I have to admit that, although I'm a fan of Shakespeare, I never really was familiar with this play. And what I really can't say is whether it's a bad adaptation, or the game is just a bad choice for film. There are a few nice things in it, but the performance is quite a lot and the plot is obvious. The theme of the drama is on the nature of the debt, using the financial idea of ​​guilt and justice as a metaphor for emotional questions. It becomes clear when the issue of the rings becomes more important than the business with Shylock, who unfortunately descends into the garden species anti-Semitism, despite Bard's best efforts to save him with some beautiful monologues. <br /> <br /> Outside Jeremy Irons worthy turn, I didn't think there was a decent performance in the crowd. Pacino's Yiddish is made up of a small safe that is added at the end of each statement, and some of the better Shylock scenes are reduced to variations on the standard "Pacino gets angry" that his fans know and love. But Lynn Collins is really embarrassing, to the point where I thought they would get her out of the picture in time. When his incognito goes as a man, it's hard not to laugh at all the things we don't have to laugh about. With Joseph Fiennes standing there to look sincere and complicated, it is difficult not to make devastating comparisons with Gwyneth Paltrow's performance in Shakespeare in Love. The big problem, however, that everything left in this movie is just a lack of emotional focus. It's really hard to see if this movie is a somewhat serious comedy or a funny silly drama. Certainly, a good summer supply performance will make the material more lax than this gloomy production. The actors seem shy to try humor, and uncertain about where to put dramatic and comical emphasis. All this is basically the fault of director Michael Radford, who thinks the material is much heavier than it seems to me.
