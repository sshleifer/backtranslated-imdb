The plot for Black Mama White Mama revolves around two female prisoners at a women's prison in the Philippines. A Black, and a White. These two women are being jailed together. Pam Grier is Lee Daniels Lee is locked up in holy women's prison, dancing as a harem girl. <br /> <br /> Lee's boyfriend owes her part of his profits, from his drug trading activities. Lee is mainly interested in the outbreak of the prison to hold her beau's drug money so that she can leave the Philippines and live a better life. Margaret Markov plays Karen Brent, a white woman with a privileged background, who is also a revolutionary. Karen joined a group of revolutionaries, determined to change the corrupt Philippine political system. She was imprisoned by the Philippine authorities, and held as a political prisoner. <br /> <br /> The story line started when Karen and Lee broke out of jail, they were together. The two of them also chained to the wrist. As they flee, they also fight with each other because they have different goals to pursue. Of course they hate each other. But they also realize that they have to set aside their differences to help each other survive while they are catching. <br /> <br /> If this movie looks very much like The Big Bird Cage, it's because much of the role in the two films is the same, as well as their location in the Philippines. Roger Corman, always had a consistent stable actor, which he used in all his 70s B-movies. Apart from Pam Grier, Sid Haig, Roberta Collins, Claudia Jennings, Betty Anne Rees and William Smith were also one of the many actors who were regularly cast into Corman's AIP films. <br /> <br /> Like The Big Bird Cage, Black Mama White Mama, relies on too much greedy to be tasty. Pam Grier carries her usual tough chick persona in this movie, and shows her ability as a female action heroine. Margaret Markov is less effective, in her portrayal of revolutionary Karen. She just seems fragile and well cut, to be a dedicated political guerrilla. Apart from Sid Haig, as the colorful Ruben, the rest of the cast is forgotten. <br /> <br /> This movie has little entertainment value unless excessive, violent acts of violence are your thing. Only the performances by Pam Grier and Sig Haig make this movie worth watching.
