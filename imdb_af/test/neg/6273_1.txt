My paraphrase above the slogan at the back of the DVD box makes it up: this movie was far more horrible than horrible. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I've ever seen, as long as I can remember. My wife accidentally rented it because it was the Tom Cruise version. The nice rough special effects on the menu we have to get rid of. The generous nudity that has taken place in the opening scene has made us more suspicious. <br /> <br /> But as the film was, we were nominated by clumsy acting - both over and under - non-continuity in directing and editing, urgent writing and rough special effects. We got up to half an hour or less; After starting it badly it might not get any better. <br /> <br /> As I despise reviews that contain a product without a specific product, there are a few examples of the movie's especially uncomfortable moments, even if it is for spoilers: <br /> <br /> - The lead says goodbye to his young old boy, as the latter is planning to drive away with his mother, the latter prickly, because it is their wedding anniversary, but the lead doesn't come together because of sudden business. The boy asked for worry, "will I ever see you again?" Perhaps it is supposed to come out as a premonition, but it comes rather than uncomfortable behavior for a child in that situation. <br /> <br /> - A large alien spacecraft crashed into the earth and sat in a huge crater. . There are a lot of people close by who are uncomfortable about it, but otherwise generally untouched. One woman finally says, "It's oriented!" <br /> <br /> - After this vessel loaded a village and its inhabitants, the head and a bystander, alone near their homes and trying to load their cars for an escape, something like that would change into a silent surprised tone: <br /> <br /> "What was that thing anyway?" "I don't know ..." <br /> <br /> - A crowd trying to evacuate a bridge is blocked by the army as part of the bridge is destroyed. When an alien ship creates an explosive in it, the crowd begins to run away, apparently just because a director has told them, and not because they are scared or in any real danger, let alone unusual circumstances. <br /> And so on ... writing about the movie falls short on the experience to really see it. But please, PLEASE, save yourself the trouble, even if your morbid curiosity is peaking! The film is so bad that it can't even be used as an unintentional humor (versus King Vidor's "Solomon & Sheeba" with Yul Brynner wearing a wig). Life is too short not to look so nonsense. There should be something more productive and enjoyable to do, such as walking the dog or cleaning a birdhouse.
