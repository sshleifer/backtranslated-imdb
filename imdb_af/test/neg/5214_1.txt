(Chances are I will spoil valuable plot points while writing it and because I can't determine and don't really care what you think is a valuable plot point, if you think about watching this movie and having a problem. learn such things, I suggest going straight to the next review.) You know, I don't care about the cult films filed under the "cult" section. And people who believe it can go there and get their job out of the "reality". I mean, is it too much to ask for the open pseudo-Christian propaganda movies to be filed with the other special feature films? <br /> <br /> I couldn't have been flabbergasted anymore if Pat Robertson made a porn movie. (or would it be "flubbergasted"?) <br /> <br /> It was bad enough that there was a very inadequate score of kicking and punching in this. It was bad enough that the same story was repeatedly done in much better ways. It was bad enough that it was not submitted under special interest, with other cultural films. It was bad enough that it somehow nodded to be realistic as if we were living in the world where villages are owned by the "debbil" and the very deep and nasty evil is NOT done by humans - usually in the NAME of religions based on the god of Abraham. It was bad enough to just keep that thing down because people were complaining so loudly that it was terrible. <br /> <br /> No, the LOT was when one of our guests got up when we just had to turn the damn thing off and declare: "I really want to see something really violent or pornographic, just about it Get out of my head, both, if you have it. " And we just met her.
