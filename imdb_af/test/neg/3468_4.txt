'Leatherheads' try so hard. Try to be light hearted. Try to be a comedy. Try to be a love affair. Let's see, it tries a 'His Girl Friday' through 'The Sting' through 'One Dozen One Night' through a dozen sports movies. Oh, it's not trying, and the movie is as damp as the last game's field. <br /> <br /> A fan of movies will see the huge battlefield in speech between the Duluth Bulldogs and some soldiers and realize that The Battles that John Ford with such a style and boredom and humor in movies like "The Quiet Man 'or' Donovan's Reef ', or' The Searchers' played might have been easy to do, but of course it's not. I'll bet George Clooney that John Ford's canalization will also be easy. How difficult it can be: masculinity runs amok, pushes, bottles broken over heads, an irrefutable piano ... just put it on the screen with a little music. Sorry. It takes a master to make fighting moves. <br /> <br /> Movies are not wanted. Humor is difficult. Romance is difficult. Slap a lost art. <br /> <br /> I once read that you never wanted to be too close to a ballet performance. Something about not making the fantastic bubble of the show by hearing the thunder of the dancers' feet or the boundaries of the elevators. This movie is so ... all the excitement and good intentions, attractive actors, nice sets, but it dips through its steps rather than galloping like the original Galloping Ghost, Red Grange, who releases the movie.
