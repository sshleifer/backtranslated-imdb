Just let me give you advice. If you watch this movie, just to see a lot of unlikely characters, slaughtered in a dozen different ways, then you will love this movie, because everyone dies a terrible death, past the gore there is not much else . <br /> <br /> Where do I start: -The characters don't appeal to the audience, because there are no stories for any of them, because I don't feel connected to any of them. they did not, and I was so sick of them that by the end of the movie I was furious with the mischievous crawl to kill them all. (which he did at the time). <br /> -bath acting; I mean I didn't get it, for example using the Asian tour guide. First, he spoke perfect English, and then their little tour boat that sank somehow got an accent from the blue, and later he usually spoke English. <br /> One of the worst endings for an abomination: (if you can name it). After nearly everybody killed the monster / human mutant thing, he was killed by the last two remaining idiots, or so they thought! The monster / human thing is finally killed when the beauty and the geek bump a pile through his heart / sew (it was hard to tell) and it probably died right in front of them (within easy reach), but later it comes back and killing them (wtf) i mean why it didn't just kill them when he was right next to them. Arghhhh! I mean it was just to slow down, it was like the author didn't know where he wanted the story. (or he was a few minutes short of 80 minutes, so he added even more delayed twists to the movie so people could get 80 minutes worth of 75min instead. <br /> <br /> What I didn't get did not, why did they not only kill the damned thing while it was unconscious, but they just walked away like fools and walked away So it can come back and kill them, the only reason I gave it a 4, was because of the gore that was actually the only thing I watched this movie, and that they were all killed, I'm serious)
