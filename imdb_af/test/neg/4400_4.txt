The Palestinian situation is fertile and still largely ground for film making. "Divine Intervention" tries hard and gives us an insightful look at the almost surreal life of those caught in trouble, but the film is little more than a handful of (really nice) visual jokes cast on celluloid, while the links between them are becoming increasingly unclear as the film progresses. A missed opportunity to say something more coherent about a very topical issue.
