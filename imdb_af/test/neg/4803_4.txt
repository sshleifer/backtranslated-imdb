While it's one of two movies on Tales of Voodoo Volume 1, there's no voodoo or anything supernatural! The box calls it "Hell Hole", but the screen title is Escape from Hell Hole. The title is confusingly similar to Hell Hole (1978) aka "Escape from Women's Hell Hole". A group of women bathing in a river and apparently the worst thing they need to worry about is a tin river, which easily overwhelms them. No nudity in this or any other scene. <br /> <br /> A woman named Cardena drives up a car and apparently is known by all the women. She invites Indri to join her and her uncle M.G. to live in the city. Once they get there, it becomes clear that M.G. wants to take Indri's virginity. M. G. runs a kind of prostitution house, and he is also in charge of a corrupt branch of the army, or a paramilitary outfit, or prefers his guards to wear uniforms in military style. <br /> <br /> The women who refuse or otherwise have problems are placed in a prison. Indri is sent there. Several unsuccessful attempts to escape or rescue are made, but inevitably fail despite the obvious benefits the women have: they are wider than the guards and relatively few of the guards have automatic weapons - most of them have semi-automatic guns or handguns. <br /> <br /> WIP genre enthusiasts may like it, and the fact that it is made in the Philippines gives it novelty, but otherwise. .
