Every year the company produces Now a few "action packed", "full of suspense" movies. This tiny little thing, called Shadowcaster III (Until I visited this site, it wasn't a whole trilogy), is a good example of the good work the company does. Frank Zagarino is as average as ever and does a good job as almost indestructible (?) Schizophrenic (?) Android. I will no longer waste words, as I do not want to reveal the terrific plot and destroy some great laughs for you. <br /> <br /> Rating 2/10 (Recall for those who are hardworking technicians. Man, To collect this kind of garbage should be nerve-racking.)
