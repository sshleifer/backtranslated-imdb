From Kreestos: <br /> <br /> The dialogue is terrible, terrible, brave. Acts poor. Many plot errors. I don't recommend it at all. <br /> <br /> From Wikipedia: <br /> <br /> Artistic Licenses The work manuscript of the score is attributed to two cops [1], both male, not female depicted in the movie. <br /> <br /> The copiers didn't add or change the score. In fact, Beethoven advised them of any deviation from the original count. <br /> <br /> The film was introduced in 1824 during the compilation of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. During the movie, Beethoven is shown to be difficult to hear, but it is good to understand people speaking out loud. In fact, Beethoven lost much of his hearing seven years earlier (1817). Beethoven never experienced permanent deafness; his condition varied between total silence and terrible tinnitus. The ninth symphony was compiled at a time when Beethoven's trial deteriorated seriously. At this stage in his life, most Beethoven talks were facilitated by the use of notebooks. However, it can be argued that he could also read people's lips, as evidenced by the fact that people face him when they talked to him. <br /> <br /> In the film, Beethoven makes an allusion to the moonlight Sonata. This is an anachronism, since the Sonata No. 14 "quasi una fantasia" not until a few years after his death called "Moonlight".
