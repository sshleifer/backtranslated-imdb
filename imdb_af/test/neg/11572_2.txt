imagination should have slipped from Jim Wynorski's mind when writing the writing to this one. I don't mind when the animal scenes are almost identical, but when the actors repeat rules of other movies, it goes a bit too far. I enjoyed seeing Jay Richardson and Glori Ann Gilbert ate. Gloria doesn't bring a movie, but her tits (my men's sentiments). Jerri Manthey must have remained surviving island. Her play is stiff, incredible and she is just an ordinary drill. love the scene where the cobra comes out of the ocean, then the man eats, for extra flavor, destroys the thing. At least we know the following plot giant snake man hits komodo before he becomes father to a nest of eggs. Jerri will be great as the mother cop. Sit back with a 6 pack or a few joints. it will relieve the pain.
