How offensive! Those who love this movie probably never opened a bible. I can suggest the NBC, "OK. Let's make a movie to satisfy the witty Christians, but they will never know the difference if we have nothing flawless or in the correct chronological order." Well, they were wrong. Anyone involved with this cruelty must find a church and repent of their involvement in this blasphemy. I just gave this movie a 1 because I couldn't give it a 0.
