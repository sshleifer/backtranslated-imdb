I have nothing against Paul Schrader. In fact, HARDCORE (1979) is one of my favorite movies. But some horror movie fans were in a premature riot when his original version of the EXORCIST prequel (DOMINIE; this one you are reading now, as it turns out) was deleted by Warners, and when Renny Harlin was replaced with stuff up and make a new version that was "more scary". In my opinion, some viewers are harmed and are automatically tackled to hate Renny Harlin's subject matter (EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING) before the first frame of film ever was decided for them to judge. And I should know; because I myself went into the theatrical movie of STARTING with stubborn arms folded and prepared for the absolute worst I had to come. Imagine if I was Harlin's BEGINNING much more serious than I could ever have understood, with a good performance of Stellan Skarsgard as a young version of Father Merrin, struggling with his faith in God. It was by no means a good movie, but it was nowhere near the garbage I had prepared myself for. We finally saw the true rubbish version. - And that's Paul Schrader's DOMINY: REPLACE TO THE CHALLENGE. It was relentlessly talky, uninteresting and unkind. Stellan Skarsgard's troubled priest was nowhere as interesting as he was to me in Harlin's movie and the actor himself was not as good in the part. For anyone who pointed out the obvious CGI effects, do you think what? They are also here in DOMINIE. Remember the foolish end in Harlin's version (what will I agree with the rest of that movie)? Well, you're going to find that this end of Schrader is not a much less crippled hell. <br /> <br /> Let me also say that I resist the nonsense offered by those who appreciate this movie. Better than Harlin's, by saying we appreciate "slow down" or "can't make subtle film". As a person despising Stephen Sommers' MTV fashioned MUMMY or '99, and being a true fan of the very suggestive and strategically old horror movies of the 30's and 40's, I can assure you that this is not the case with me . There was at least some terror and exorcism-type action in Harlin's START; This one is just a real exercise in tedium and a great challenge, even for the most certified insomnia. It will be very interesting to hear that horror fans convince themselves that DOMINY: PREQUEL TO THE EXORCIST was as good as they already thought it should be beforehand; just as they were already ready to paralyze Harlin's BEGINNING. The second thing they learned was that Paul Schrader's name woke up with the White-Out.
