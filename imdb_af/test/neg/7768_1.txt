Appalling, flat, materialistic nonsense. How women (and gay men?) Can enjoy this garbage is outside me. No self-respecting person will ever want to be with one of these neurotic golden diggers. What's more, so many reviewers say they are related to the women at the show. If this is the future of women, the Lord helps us all. To reveal your independence and respect it as men, do not spread your legs with another man every three seconds. I think it undermines women and doesn't do justice. But this review is not against women. Fans of this show say it's "hilarious" and "rivoting", but every time I watched this show, I just struggled to stay awake. In spite of the storyteller's story, there is even nothing close to something that can be regarded as a rational thought. So, it's not entertaining, and it's not informative, so why would you save it to watch? One in ten stars.
