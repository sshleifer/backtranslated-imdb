It is generally not my practice to review movies that I do not like to a large extent. Once or twice a year I set aside my rule temporarily to comment only on things I would like to give a warning. I find it nicer to comment on something I want and encourage than I shoot with bad movies. But a few "movies" are calling for the razor. <br /> <br /> Bilitis is one of them. The cinematography is not the only aspect that is vague and out of focus. An almost unspeakable plot (definitely incoherent, if even one is) bad acting, cheesy script and terrible pacing. These are his big problems. <br /> <br /> Understand, I firmly believe that not all movies are created equally and movies should be judged by their category. It's not fair to say, says Beach Blanket Bingo against Gone With the Wind. I judge Bilitis against other movies in his weight class. Rated against movies like Emmanuelle or Secrets of a Chambermaid, it is very bad. Even eye-candy should be entertaining and bilitis is definitely not.
