Nightkill stars Robert Mitchum as a world-tired private eye examines the case of a missing industrialist (Mike Connors). He is hired by Jaclyn Smith, the anxious woman of the missing man. What Jaclyn fails to inform Mitchum is that she knows her husband's whereabouts well. She was the one who helped her lover. James Franciscus has her rich husband. <br /> <br /> What more would you expect from a rotten slasher movie with Robert Mitchum? Mannix goes west, monkeys are abused, models lean against classic cars, and Smith is constantly staged by Sybil Danning until a great style wrap-up brings the whole pity to a bitter end. This is BAD theater. And this movie is sooooo poor. Halloween seems to be mixed with Trick Or Treats. Avoid it. <br /> <br /> Valued R for Graphic Violence, Nudity and Sexual Situations.
