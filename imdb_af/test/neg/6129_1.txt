O son, son. This movie is something for lovers of 'real' kineatie art. It really doesn't make sense at all. This is quite boring, especially because of the "anti-climax". All people behave more than strange and unrealistic. Sometimes it feels like it's in a theater, because in the dialogue the actors tend to meet the camera (and therefore the audience) instead of each other. As I said earlier, if you are in those more artistic movies, shown in Cannes, go for it. If you are not, fix this movie better because you will be more than disappointed, and finally know that you have wasted your time - as I did. Two inches off ...: - (((
