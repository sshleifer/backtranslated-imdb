I gave this movie to me and have to admit that I'm glad I didn't pay for it. <br /> <br /> The back of the box makes it a kind of sex triangle, with 2 women trying to trick her. But the reality in this movie is far from that. <br /> <br /> In fact, the major is the victim of an evil and sadistic rape by the other two characters. There was absolutely nothing that I found interesting. <br /> <br /> Even movies like the silence of the lambs and wild things (which the box tries to compare this movie) were sounding due to the unexpected turns and tension. <br /> <br /> But Jaded has none of this. It focuses on the rapists and the sick relationship with the boyfriend of one of them. And the release of a videotape that can prove the victim's story is true. <br /> <br /> While showing that the same sex rape is possible, it's not a movie worth watching. <br /> <br /> If possible, send this movie at all costs.
