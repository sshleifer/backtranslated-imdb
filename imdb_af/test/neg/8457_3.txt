"Terror in the Aisles" may look the best deal for horror fans, but it has very little to offer. Allowed, it offers a decent and versatile (too versatile?) Selection of horror / thriller fragments that are considered classic but ... what is the point? This documentary goal is mainly for the horror-loving audience, so we've already seen all of these tracks, haven't we? The only thing that is really commendable about this project is the editing. If you're in the screaming queen, chasing dirty murderers and those kinds of things, "Terror in the Aisles", have neat combinations of the best known rows. All these different scenes are linked by a lame wraparound story with Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen sitting in a cinema. Between two rows, the address the viewer and "explain" why we love horror so much. These speeches are, of course, soporific and rather obvious (it's in our nature to be scared ... bla bla bla) and I don't understand why many people love the concept. It's a look if you're a loyal horror fan, but it's definitely not necessary to look. On the contrary, if you have to see another classic genre title, beware that bits here do not spoil your future viewing. The main reason I didn't like it at all is because it shamelessly ignores far less well-known but fundamental (strange) titles that focus on "Halloween". This results in a cool joke, however, when Donald Pleasance shouts at his screen.
