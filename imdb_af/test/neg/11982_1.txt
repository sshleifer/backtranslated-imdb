Hardly the whole movie has gotten ... It's bad, dialogue is even worse. I felt like I was watching it, but it was the same as one of my favorite games, so I struggled. They even screwed the sound. On some parts of the movie, the background music is so loud that I had to turn off the volume. It would be great if it was a competition over who could screw more. <br /> <br /> Oh yes and PS: I don't know what this guy can "Yours" ... I think this movie is just because he is the director. I've reviewed the list of his work, and that's his first (and probably the last) creation I've seen. <br /> <br /> on and off.
