The most predictable movie I've ever seen ... extremely boring, I feel like I've seen a hundred movies with the same story. Acting is good at best, there is really no action and there is definitely no excitement. Powerful actors with terrible writing, I think it could be better written by a 10th degree. Feel like a piece to watch, because I was hoping there would be something in this movie that would separate it from all the other garbage, but it fits right into the hope. The whole movie I'm waiting for something good to happen, but it never came. I never classify movies and I never watched movies, but this movie was so bad that I had to plug in and review to try and save some poor souls from their time (and / or money) movie. I paddled it and wish I never wasted the hard drive space. If I spent $ 10 to see it in theaters, I'd kill myself.
