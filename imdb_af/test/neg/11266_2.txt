I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many movies since his boom in the 80's as a mature young actor. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD because it was cheap and partly for the internet related plot and to see how much parent C. Thomas Howell is; I don't remember him in any movies since the 1980s. <br /> <br /> In just a few words: what a huge disappointment. I give a few low budget movies a chance, but this one has started to look. Within the first 15 minutes of the movie, this elusive woman talks to an Asian guy in a classroom. They basically stimulate themselves on their own chat, and insist on meeting the participant personally. She meets him, has sex, joins him and then kills him in cold blood. The plot deteriorates further. <br /> <br /> The plot is thin and thin and the play is very tight. Don't bother with buying it, even if it's in the $ 1 DVD bin. I'm planning to take my copy of the DVD to Goodwill. I'm really surprised that any of the previous reviewers here gave this movie a bad rating.
