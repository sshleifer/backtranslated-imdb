Finally, I can connect the dots between the return of the Jedi and Phantom Menace. We see here where Lucas made contact with what made the original Star Wars movies big and started to descend into the plot, less tribulation that destroyed episodes 1-3. This movie is more like one of those cute low-budget 80's swords and wizard movies than anything worthy of being associated with the Star Wars saga. Like the Jar-Jar character, it looks like kids (and the toy market). The battle scenes are especially bad. It was depressing to see Sian Phillips' incredible talent go to such a waste, following her classic performance in I, Claudius.
