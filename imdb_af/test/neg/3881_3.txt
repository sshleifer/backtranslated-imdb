If you're a healthy person and you've seen movies before, you can't endure this idiom for more than 20 minutes. And if you stay longer, it won't be because you'll expect akshay or paresh (please don't govinda!), But because you value your money too much and you want at least a short nap on the soft seat the multiplex In exchange for the money they robbed you! It is hard to believe that the director who gave us a cult film like HeraPheri can fall to such levels. All right, he is repetitive, but now he comes out of all the third course. He expects us to laugh because he brought in Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumar. ..! No, sir, it won't work now. Especially with this stupid writing of you! Even comedy films can have meaningful scripts (Lao Raho Munnabhai anyone?). <br /> <br /> Govinda doesn't have much to do, can't comment. Ash Kumar was boring, Paresh Rawal might have cracked some of the worst joke. Lara Dutta had real space to perform in this one, but she failed failed ... the only highlight of the movie (possibly) is Tanushree's play! But she's just there for the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> I don't think this movie is worth it ... (probably not so much!). So final warning - don't see it!
