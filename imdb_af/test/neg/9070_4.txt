Attractive husband and wife writing team Robert Wagner (like Joel Gregory) and Kate Jackson (as Donna Gregory) come to the haunting home of actress "Lorna Love" (actually silent movie star Harold Lloyd's home). Mr. Wagner and me. Jackson is contracted to write the silent movie star's biography. Wagner has a personal interest in the project, as his father once was the famous star's lover. Mysterious events unfold, and Jackson must fight to save her husband from the spirit of the beautiful blonde, "perfectly preserved" in a manger on the estate; Besides, the evil woman seems to be possessing her husband and killing Jackson! <br /> <br /> It's a very "Night of Dark Shadows" variation, co-head of the real "Dark Shadows" aluminum Kate Jackson, who knows and plays her part well. Robert Wagner misses David Selby's intensity. Sylvia Sidney (like Josephs) sidesteps Grayson Hall. Marianna Hill is not a game for Lara Parker (or Diana Millay). Bill Macy (like Oscar Payne) is good at playing John Karlen's role (in a Dan Curtis production). <br /> <br /> There are smooth cameos by Joan Blondell, John Carradine and Dorothy Lamour. Me. Lamour's delivery looks like Joan Bennett, who asks the question: why didn't producer Aaron Spelling get the original "Dark Shadows" regulators? <br /> <br /> Director E. W. Swackhamer was Bridget Hanley's husband; He went with me. Blondell worked on "Here's the Brides", and with Jackson on "The Rookies". "Death at Love House" probably has a tighter story than the Night of Dark Shadows movie; it differs in the movie angle; and ending up in his "Father Eternal Fire", it looks more like the TV series "Laura the Phoenix" storyline. <br /> <br /> **** Death at Love House (9/3/76) E. W. Swackhamer ~ Robert Wagner, Kate Jackson, Sylvia Sidney
