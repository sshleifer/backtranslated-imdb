I think of myself as a bad filmmaker. I like to think that movies label most people as the worst of all times I can easily resist. <br /> <br /> But ... there are exceptions. I can only remember three movies that I had the accident to see that I repeatedly used the quick button for big bits of the story. Those movies are The Mighty Gorga, the Night of the Seagulls, and this little crap, Deep Blood. <br /> <br /> In the world of Jaws ripoffs it is falling off the scale. Deep Blood does not have the realistic storyline of the original Crocodile, or the incredible effects of The Sea Serpent, or the comments of Tintorera. No, instead, we are treated to a handful of teenagers from any randomly failed '80s public access sitom fighters and local sheriff. <br /> <br /> Shark attacks are realized by quick cuts of documentary footage with actors surrendering in the water, sometimes with a bit of what seems to be the orange-ish paint thrown into the water. There is not a minute of original shark image material in this celluloid waste. <br /> <br /> Usually, I or someone like me will read a dishonest review like this one and say "cool, I need a copy of this!" This is the same thought I had when I " read another viewer's review on this site. How wrong I was. <br /> <br /> So ... from one bad movie lover to another ... let it collect dust on the shelf ... Grab the depths or the big alligator instead of satisfying your need something lying in the water.
