You know the old saw of a train wreck? One about how you can't look away? This movie is not that good. The only reason you're still there is because you brought your kids, and you can't leave them alone in the theater. You might catch a nap. <br /> <br /> Tim Hill should never work in film again after delivering this horrible piece of junk. He manages a decent comic actor in Jason Lee and turns him into a robot, uncertain actor in this production. <br /> <br /> I didn't have much hope for this movie in the first place, I admit. If it wasn't basically the only family movie, I could take my son Christmas, and my wife and I wouldn't be away. God, I wish we could go back in time and stop ourselves. I leaned to my wife about 10 minutes to tell her what a stinker I thought it was, but she hit me at the punch. <br /> <br /> I'm not joking. It's bad. Only David Cross's wonderful-as-usual work saves this review of only 1 star. <br /> <br /> The story is cloying, insulting and stupid, as expected for a movie in this genre (although the recent "Curious George" was fortunately intelligent and enjoyable). The acting is mostly poor. The decision to "update" the Chipmunks songs for today's audience was at best inadvisable and was the worst. It doesn't work. <br /> <br /> The old chipmunks were smart, naughty and clever. These chipmunks are dumb, somewhat temperate, unpleasant and in a surprise, needy to the futility. <br /> <br /> Whether it's a glimpse, a tribute, or a completely new production, this movie completely fails. The final straw? My son couldn't wait to go. Spend your money Curious George instead.
