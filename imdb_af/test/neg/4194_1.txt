Totally agree with other reviews. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie for about 5 minutes. I looked at one review on another site and found that it wasn't even a true successor. It was after I walked slowly off the TV with remote control in hand, the jaw dropped below and below. <br /> <br /> The quality of the filming is beyond the low budget. It doesn't even look like a freaking movie. Looking at "home video" of a documentary, I would expect it. <br /> <br /> In summary: Avoid, avoid avoiding. Boooo Lion's Gate! <br /> <br /> Fully embarrassed to look at myself for 5 minutes and I hope I saved others to rent or own it.
