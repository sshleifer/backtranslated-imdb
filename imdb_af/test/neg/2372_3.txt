This is a comedy version of "Aliens on a Train". It works pretty well. I'm a loud grader, so the 3 rating mostly reflects on the characters and plot. The performances are extremely good, all of them. Of course, the two stars, DeVito and Crystal, shine most. Each artist performs well enough to play. The comedy works in a plane just short of slapstick. DeVito characters work best when disrupted. His character, portrayed as a writing pad, is likely to be more real if he is published and earns as much as most hacks. His character will have a good agent and several requests in real life. The characters are one dimensional, which is good in comedy. But the character of Crystals is not very well written. His desire to kill the "moma" suddenly does not make sense. It looks like a miserable attempt at humor. The vigorous efforts are not too frequent, and the movie is running pretty well.
