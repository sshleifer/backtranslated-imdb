"Submerged" is definitely NOT "the worst movie ever". It does have its faults, like borrowed footage, crazy script and non-special special effects (it's the worst), but it also has good points. The acting is surprisingly good, there are many familiar faces you probably know if you are a b-movie fan like me. <br /> <br /> I was delighted to see Brent Huff playing one of the heroes, mostly knowing his 80s action movies, and I have to admit that he is not a bad actor at all. Fred Williamson, Maxwell Caulfield and Tim Thomerson get limited screen time but are credible in their parts. The "eye-candies" in this Fred Olen Ray movie are Yvette Nipar and Nicole Eggert, who both look very sexy and very common. Michael Bailey Smith adds some muscles in the background as a Navy SEAL. Unfortunately, the only cast member who (in my opinion) is completely out of place, Coolio. He didn't stop at all, talking like he didn't even read the script, and a bad start at the start of the movie was shot an hour later. Not a good choice. <br /> <br /> Summarizing this movie - it's not such a bad choice for late night entertainment. If you can find out about the special effect thing (so many guns, so much fire, and not a single wound on anyone), Coolio's annoying display, and the recycled footage from Airport 77, you can't keep this no-brainer at all .
