At this moment I watch this movie on TV here in Tokyo. Beautiful scenery, beautiful sets of biblical relationships, beautiful costumes, beautiful color, beautiful Gina. Great climate scene when God destroys the Sheban idol and much more with the Millean thunderbolts at the moment when Yul and Gina are in love. Yul does a half-way job to deliver his lines, but he sounds very much like Yul, which delivers his lines as Ramses or Taras Bulba. George Sanders sounds like George Sanders playing George Sanders. Given the limited spectrum of acting, she is asked to appear in this role, but Gina does a good job, although by the time the movie ends, she is completely transformed into a bad repentant lass and looks like she might be in play a biography of Mother. Teresa. I think thunder beams will do it for you, but it's almost breathtaking how fast she pervades her own beliefs for her new religion. Supporting players are usually terrible, without credible emotion and timing. The usual big-fight scenes, which passed in 1959 for lascivious dances, and an orchestra that emits many trumpet calls, behind a big chorus, are many of the "Ah's" but not one of the best Hollywood quality no. The last sword fight between Brynner and Sanders is at the low skill level of a junior high school game. That film is a big piece of eyecup but not much more.
