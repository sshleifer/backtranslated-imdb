Greetings Everything, <br /> <br /> Isn't it amazing the power that movies have on you after the 1st viewing? <br /> <br /> I was so excited about the first viewing of this movie, I couldn't speak for Flatliners for weeks, because I was a very impressive 18-year-old and then my taste in movies become a little more conservative ever since. <br /> <br /> Then somehow I forgot this movie until I saw the DVD in my local department store and remember how good it was, I thought, "Right! I'll get you off the shelf pick when they bring out the special issue. " <br /> <br /> Last week I was delighted when my best friend invited me to watch Flatliners on DVD. It was expected that I would love this movie more on 2nd look. How wrong I was! <br /> <br /> Pronunciation: after 11 years, my view of this movie has changed from a very scary 1st-class movie to total rubbish that is rather superficial on the religious and supernatural side of things. <br /> <br /> I've never been a big fan of Julia Roberts play (except for Erin Brockeridge in which she earned her Oscar). I think the problem with this film definitely lies with the director and such a mediocre manuscript. I left this movie because it had no real substance or potential, and just a few scarey cheap tensions that were not well done. Not even James-Newtown Howard's score, which I would rather have a movie composer, can be my buzz and excitement. <br /> <br /> In 1990 I would have given this movie 9.5 / 10; but in 2001 I would be happy to give it at 2/10. <br /> <br />
