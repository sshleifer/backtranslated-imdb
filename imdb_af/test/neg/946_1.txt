Overview: Child is not accepted into any colleges. He creates a "college" where he and his friends can party by using their parents' tuition fees. <br /> <br /> Wow. An attempt at ignorance. <br /> <br /> If you believe we are all good, man, then this movie is for you. In addition, you should understand: <br /> <br /> 1. Children have everything inside them - they just have to let it out. <br /> <br /> 2. Education really suppresses the innate creativity with which everyone is born. <br /> <br /> 3. Someone else has to pay for you to follow your passion. <br /> <br /> 4. 300 teens can live in harmony as long as you remove the restrictive rules. <br /> <br /> 5. Outspoken speeches are often far more convincing than a prepared presentation. <br /> <br /> 6. If the Education Council allows you to open a "small school" with "non-traditional teaching techniques", it is because they have your best interests at heart. (Not that they're willing to let low-functioning students go to work fast fast anyway.) <br /> <br /> This movie is one in the college comedy genre, that is, Animal House. This follows the pattern reasonably now. What is new here is a complete attack on higher education, not a parody of the bad elements. It lacks the sympathetic insider, a professor who embodies the valuable part of university life. <br /> <br /> This lack of balance will punish this movie to the back rows of Blockbuster. It's so one-sided, I wondered if it was an ironic self-referencing about the whole genre - for about a minute. The film has no deep meaning, no low, no introspection. It is as if they have some children who have never gone to class to do what comes naturally. And of course, what the name of the school is: S ***. <br /> <br /> (I never thought I'd say it: Go see something with Will Farrell instead. His comedies can be surprisingly sophisticated.)
