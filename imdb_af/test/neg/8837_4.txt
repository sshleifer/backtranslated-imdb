It is a pity to say it is one of the lesser of John Wayne's series of poverty driving western for Lone Star Productions. Here he is an American Marshal on a bandit's route, and I don't know you as the shadow. <br /> <br /> No, it's not Lamont Cranston, it's a few men who give their orders through an open wall. safe so his men don't see who he is. But the voice is unmistakable, you will know within 10 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> And another reviewer here is very wrong, no squeals or groans of the audience would have happened, as Gabby Hayes still plays a variety of roles and he is shaved here. He has not yet found his niche as the sweet oldtimer sidekick of several movie-cowboy heroes like the Duke. <br /> <br /> Later he leads his men very openly into the climax so I'm not sure what the point is. from the original gimmick with the wall safe. I don't think those who wrote this one also knew. <br /> <br /> Wayne gets Yakima Canutt as an Indian sidekick here and the relationship is about the same as an unattended Lone Ranger and Tonto. <br /> <br /> It's all pretty silly if you ask me.
