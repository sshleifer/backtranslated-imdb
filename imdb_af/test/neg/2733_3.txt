Terry Cunningham introduced this Sci-Fi Network original. Everything is not good in Washington and Oregon; Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes threaten to drop most of the Pacific Rim into the ocean. To cause a global effort to destroy the environment, a squad of scientists led by dr. Jake Rollins (Luke Perry) a massive earth-borne vehicle called "The Mole" to chew the Earth's fiery core to prevent impending punishment. . Technical dialogue doesn't really help this movie. The acting is lame, but then Perry has always been laid. You can only be guilty of participation. Others in the movie: Michael Dorn, Adam Frost and Michael Teigen
