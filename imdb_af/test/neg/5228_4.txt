Based on a Stephen King novel, NEEDFUL THINGS offers the plot and sincerity to keep you in your seat. A mysterious man (Max von Sydow) comes to town and soon becomes the most spoken citizen. Could it be that the devil himself founded an ancient dealer in a small town in Maine? von Sydow is masterful and dynamic in this role that dominates the screen. Major actors are Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedelia. Harris is steady and Bedelia deserves your attention. Also in support is J.T. Walsh and Amanda Plummer. Not the best, or the worst adaptation of King's horror on the screen.
