Let me get my chest first. I hate Octopussy with an absolute passion. What is so frustrating is that it had so much potential and had a very good opening sequence. Unfortunately, the opening sequence follows it all down. First, there was absolutely no plot to start, just an excuse for Moore to tell his funny jokes. Next, there are several rows that would make a Bond fan, for example the order in which Bond appears to be distributing a bomb as a clown. The villains are pretty poor, Louis Jordon fails to make an impact as Kamal Khan and Bollywood veteran Kabir Bedi are as poor as his henchman. It's funny that when people debate what the worst Bond movie is and Octopussy is overlooked when it's easy to make money.
