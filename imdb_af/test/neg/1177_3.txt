With a catchy title like the Butcher or Plainfield, this Ed Gein variation and Kane Hodder will play. It will undoubtedly fly away from the shelves for a few weeks. Most viewers will get bored with this latest performance by Ed Gien. /> <br /> The movie focuses on Ed's rampage and gives us a few episodes in his Psycosis and lives in Plainfeild. These are the scenes that give the movie a much needed push. <br /> <br /> What ruins this is the constant focus on other characters, and focus less on Eds.Big error here. <br /> <br /> Kane Hodder is a strange choice to play Gein, but he pulls it off very well and earns more acting. credits as he currently gets.Pascilla Barnes and Micahel Barryman also point out. <br /> <br /> 3/10
