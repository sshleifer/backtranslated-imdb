I watch a TON of movies and enjoy the occasional B movie, but this movie was horrible. Apart from the "homemade" quality of the film, it was very slow and didn't make sense. I'm just commenting b / c from another comment I saw here saying it was wonderful! WOW! Maybe it's OK to look on a rainy day when nothing else is available. <br /> <br /> The characters were irreconcilable and did not fit an observable pattern of reality. The dialogue between characters was forced and sometimes very confusing. <br /> <br /> I think if you were in the whole area 51 and some of the nuances understood other commentary reference, it might be good - but for me - the average Joe - I don't get it! ?
