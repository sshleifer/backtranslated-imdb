It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is not a collection of historical accuracy, and reality is reversed. Just one example: Morgan spoke to the few ethnic Chinese that he experienced. The acting is on top, the writing is a badly written lie. I have never seen worse fake beards. <br /> <br /> Hopper arrived in Australia and reportedly made the film only if the script was completely rewritten, so he could be a hero. As the script was ten on the fly, it can explain how bad it is and how the movie is over. <br /> <br /> Any movie about Ned Kelly is much better than this movie.
