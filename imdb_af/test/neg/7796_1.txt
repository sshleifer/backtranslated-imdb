think of the most unmistakable topic you can and that's 10 times worse. A woman must complete as many crosswords as she can in a day. We don't even get the questions and think of the words on our own, we just look at her struggle. The woman seems so anxious and in a hurry to do the crosswords, but for some reason she spends the time deducting to walk around the city when she is focused at home. The acting is terrible, the actress is crying and puffing as she tries to think of the words, and we are left completely in the dark. The New York scenery is nice, but the movie does it too much and it quickly becomes fast. The film plays like a rejected NYU student movie. This movie has no detached features and I do not recommend it to anyone.
