I suspect this advice will soon be full of comment from over-emotional people who praise "Dear John" as a "pearl" and a "rollercoaster ride" and all the other turbulent words that this movie's target audience usually uses. <br /> <br /> I'm definitely not the target audience of this movie, but I don't like romantic plays as long as they are well made, so here's my goal to take the movie. <br /> <br /> It's not good. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie either. But the plot meanders, development stagnates where it had to move forward (right around the middle, to be precise) and for the end ... it almost felt like they had run out of ideas so they suddenly said, "Hey, let's just make a last scene movie fast, put a sentimental chorus over it, and make it so. " Even Amanda Seyfried's beauty can't save it. Channing Tatum also delivered a good performance, but you can do just that with a faulty writing. <br /> <br /> Talking with the music, it is unbearably predictable and kitchy. From the smoky voiced, annoying, highly sensitive female folk singer Schtick (who was certainly chosen to call on the majority of college age girls to watch this movie) to the bridging "glittering string and piano" combo it is just someone who pays more attention to the film as a whole rather than its own "feelings". The movie has a good start and the great conflict we are introducing in the second act was all promising. So was part of the second act itself, as the story unfolded. Then the movie just dropped the ball. In addition, I need to give spoilers. <br /> <br /> "Dear John" is not a bad movie, but it doesn't work either. If you want to see a real movie about extended love waiting to be reunited, check out "Notebook", which was really great.
