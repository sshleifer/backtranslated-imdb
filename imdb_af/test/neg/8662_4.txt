I began to take a critical view of this adjustment within the first few minutes, but as a dedicated Jane Austen fan I persisted to the end ... But this is not a program I recommend to anyone is unfamiliar with her work as I do not think it does justice, nor does it make entertaining television in its own right. There was something about this adaptation that didn't have credibility - lots of costumes and even the actors didn't have an authentic look and I found that the acting was sometimes bad. There is no doubt that the actors were all very nice, but it did not provide enough variety to create many diverse, memorable characters. It was too static in the same place, and miss Fanny's return home, which is one of the most interesting parts of the story. The best actor was Blake Ritson, who caught Edmund's health very well, and the Crawfords were also effectively thrown. I like Billie Piper as an actress, but this role did not suit her and was much better played in the 1999 version by Frances O'Connor. He gave a much more subtle and convincing performance overall. Jane Austen adjustments will always give a love story to make you feel good, but unfortunately this is one of the worst things I've seen.
