Highly defective but just about viewable "rejection" that rejects like a Farrelly brothers. However, the most criminal thing is decisive. I couldn't believe Jerry O Connell and Jake Busey in the role of superstuds for one minute, which any woman could pull at the drop of a hat, and I couldn't (the very beautiful) Shannon Elizabeth as a street fisherman hard cop believes. The story is predictable, but can increase several times a few times, although the "gross out of" spectacular "scenes (an amputated testicle and another set in a sperm bank) mean terrible. If this movie is on TV, it's probably worth checking out if you're very bored, but don't waste your money!
