While trying to build a large shopping mall or complex or something, a rich landowner ignores ancient indigenous American artefacts buried on the ground and unleashes the Bone Eater ... a creature that walks around and kills people in search of to his fallen friends or something. <br /> <br /> Indeed, this movie had to be an original Sci-Fi channel. If this were not the case, the director should never lead anything. The effects in the movie are at best ridiculous, and the Bone Eater monster is nothing more than a CGI animation that is later added to the frames. The actors don't even look scared when they see the thing (probably because they really don't, and it's just horrible actors). This is a great comedy, though it is supposed to be pure terror.
