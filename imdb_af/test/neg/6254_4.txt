CHEERLEADER MASSACRE (2003) <br /> <br /> mainly: Tamie Sheffield, Charity Rahmer, Erin Byron, Leonard Johnson, E. Eddie Edwards, Samantha Phillips, GiGi Erneta, April Flower, Nikki Fritz, Tylo Tyler, Brad Beck, Summer Williams, Brinke Stevens, Melissa Brasselle. <br /> <br /> Plot: A group of cheerleaders, along with their coach and three guys, are on their way to a game when they suddenly break down and hide in a nearby cabin. Soon, they drink, have sex and are cruelly murdered one by one by an invisible killer. <br /> <br /> The good: A few laughs, surprising identity of the murderer, a Brinke Stevens cameo, my favorite scene of THE SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE is used as a jump back. <br /> <br /> The bad: I was excited about this movie, I love all three Slumber Party Massacre because they were just as nice and I expected a lot of this "Slumber Party / Sorority House Massacre with Scream Tones ), but it just sucked in. They told it on the "We are a cheesy but proud" thing and basically make soft core porn but with a good what-thin-it. <br /> <br /> **
