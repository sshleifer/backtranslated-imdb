Family Guy is easily one of the worst shows I've ever forced to watch (Not at the bottom, but I've seen The Jersey Shore.) A popular hit with high school and college kids experiencing immaturity for edginess is this show is original and celebrated. <br /> <br /> Since it's a comedy show, let's look at the "humor". 1. Random flashbacks / clips to celebrities or movies or politics or anything that can be cut for a knee-jerk laugh. It got old after the 5 or so repeats per episode. Simple solution: Every time you hear, "It's worse than / like time ..." plug your ears. <br /> <br /> 2. Impatience for own pleasure. This show is notorious for the inclusion of inappropriate gags that have little to do with the overall plot. Solution: See South Park. They did it right. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that Family Guy is not worth your time, and does not hold a candle at The Simpsons.
