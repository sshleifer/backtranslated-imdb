Imagine if you have an alternative universe where someone made SEVEN. Instead of a talented roleplaying team, they cast a politically conscious environmentalist and an emerging comedian as the lead roles. If your imagination cannot stretch that far, just look at the GLIMMER MAN, as this is the next worse thing <br /> <br /> !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> Jack Cole is a police officer with a hidden past and it is very ironic that he is played by Steven Seagal, as he is also a concealer of a hidden past, but does not tell anyone because it is highly secretive. Perhaps the biggest secret is how somebody like Seagal has become a film in the first place, as THE GLIMMERMENS are in the trend of all Seagal's other movies, as it is full-fledged. Look at the way he is introduced as his partner walks into his office. "Your love beads man. In your wrong office," Steven replied with something she was sharply in, or he would have someone who could understand a bloody word He said because he was mumbling for many of the movie. In fact, the only time I could make up his dialogue was the school scene where he was on the armed man holding the class hostage, <br /> <br /> "Don't kill me" <br /> <br / > Is that what a cop would say about a suicide weapon? I just think in another movie where Steven is not the hero (ie a good movie), the police will say something in the line of "Don't kill me, I have a wife and a few kids who wait home ". So suicide-armed governor will blow his head off, but Steven saves his life by making them both through two sets of windows. It goes without saying that you shouldn't try it at home <br /> <br /> As the story goes, Steven (I gave up calling him Jack, although he wrote to the writer to give Steven a meaningful name) is becoming involved in a case a plagiarism where someone steals bits from other superior movies with serial killers. If Steven finds more victims, you can see him. "What was that movie Morgan Freeman used as a policeman?" While inspecting the bodies, the action continues to switch to the hero's household life just so we know this man's good As a family man, this man is very good as a family man so sorry he is as bad as' a movie star
