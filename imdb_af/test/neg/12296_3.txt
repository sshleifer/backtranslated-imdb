Yep. Those of my generation who had grown up to watch those old Sunbow cartoons were spoiled. The 80's Joe Tune was one of the best cartoons in the history of television. Well-written stories, well-developed characters. Admittedly, it was nothing more than a glorified toy commercial, but it certainly helped carry that toy line. Fast forward nearly twenty years later and enter Valor vs Venom. The animation was at most average. The movements of the characters seemed to be rough and puffy. The movie felt more like a small soldier successor than a special military force story. Then we have character development or lack thereof. Dust likes to be all dusty? Cut and Dice like to do things together? What? Do the authors have a writing course on how to develop characters with the Jar Jar Binks depth equivalent? As for the story. I like a little Sci-Fi. But the whole concept of making soldiers in a mutant army was killed in the Joe universe. Mega Monsters or Toxo Zombies Anyone? But I give the creators credit to try to make fans fans happy by martial arts action every 10 minutes. I'm not a big fan of SE and SS, but I liked the fighting scenes between the two. If you can appreciate VvV for what it is, you will enjoy it. I admit that I can't appreciate VvV as I belong. Once again, everything Joe gets is compared to the ways done in the 80's, and honestly nothing will ever be compared to the glory days of GI Joe. If you can appreciate VvV for what it is, you will enjoy it.
