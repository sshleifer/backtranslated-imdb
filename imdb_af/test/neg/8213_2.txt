Buyer beware. The Alpha Video release uses a print that damages description. The movie is shot in color, but you won't know it for the first 25 minutes or so. The pressure used is so blurred and rounded that it is almost sepia. After 30 minutes, some color goes back into the print, but from there the color comes and goes. Keep in mind, even at best, the color is pale and washed out. It seems as if the print of a television was not receiving the best reception. Adding to this travesty is the most pompous delivery of lines I can remember. Even the voice about narration is stupor inducing. Each line is rendered in this annoying plowing behavior. I found myself hurrying and getting the words. For this reason I couldn't wait for this movie to end. It's one of those bad-it's good movies, but I wish someone would find a half decent print.
