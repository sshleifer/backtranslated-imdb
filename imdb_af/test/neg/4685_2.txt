The word "boring" is thrown too often when it refers to exactly how bad a low-budget horror movie can be, or perhaps not. I saw a lot of B movies. Very horrible, terribly inactive B-movies. Party with a production value of several hundred dollars. Independence, co-operation, worse continuity and embarrassing budgets really make a movie inexplicable? Some will certainly be like that. Most of these are probably great supporters of The Matrix. Well, I hate big-budget movies, so I say no. Bad can sometimes be funny (Blood Freak), sometimes even thought-blowing (Troll 2), but Boring will always be inexcusable. Hey, similar to Bloodthirsty Butchers, reminding me, I'm writing a review for this pile of garbage ... Uh, yeah, anyway. This is one of late British director Andy Milligan's many alternatives to sleeping pills. This one is based on Sweeney Todd ... Great. Milligan takes a boring story and still manages it. Hey, it's pretty funny, I said ... sorry, I'm still distracted. It's not that easy. With the second thought I will make it easy. No gore, no scares, no entertainment, just unpleasant, annoying people who have incoherent conversations. these are bloodthirsty butchers. Oh, and something about a hairdresser who kills people, and something or other about meat pie. I don't know, it's not important. <br /> <br /> For something that is a bit more rewarding for Andy Milligan, there's always the only other one I've seen, The Rats Coming, The Werewolves Are Here. Yes, you heard me. But hows about us forget about this Milligan man all together, and get something sweet like Sick Girl or Teenape Goes To Camp. Whatever you decide, just know, Bloodthirsty Bugs suck, possibly even more than any other version of this already dull story. And that, B-movie fans, really say something. 10/02
