This movie had all the ingredients of a good adventure movie, but it has disqualified virtually every level. <br /> <br /> The presence of Roger Moore in the list is usually a sign that the movie is not going to be anything more than mediocre, because Moore always has main roles and cannot act. But this movie also featured Ian Holm and Lee Marvin in it, and was based on a Wilbur Smith book, so I thought I'd give it a chance if I saw the DVD in the bargain. <br /> <br /> It was a mistake. The opening scene started in the center of a coil, with sound suddenly appearing as if the first second of the soundtrack had been cut off. The scene showed a German crew at sea. This bad edit was a sign of things to come but the scene with the dreadnought was interesting enough to make me look. The special effects were good, and the crew carried the right uniforms and spoke in German, indicating that the director had at least paid attention to historical details. I was surprised. <br /> <br /> So I kept looking, and then Moore appeared and my benefits were confirmed. Bad plays, clichés, cliché cinematography and inexpensive humor ... but worst of all, there is a disastrous effort to mix the light-hearted feeling of the movie with serious drama and tragedy. It just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> The movie ends so suddenly and as bad as it started? in the middle of a coil.
