I have just applied this unofficial adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft's "The Lurking Fear" shot in Louisiana. Outside of a few changes (names, settings), it follows the short story point for the first 70 minutes, but then try to give its own "turn" end that you can see coming from a mile away. Either way, it's a much better adaptation than Full Moon's LICKING FEAR. It's a shame, it's a horrible movie. Director David McCormick shoots the thing with all the flair of an industrial brief. I swear I might have counted two camera movements. The design of the creature is cheap (we are talking shopping masks here), but shooting in a dark way (deliberately or not) where they are somewhat creepy. The impressive thing in the picture is the abandoned house, but McCormick also fails it. Lay this one under good adjustment, poor execution.
