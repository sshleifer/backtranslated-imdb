Too much stock (almost one third of this 53 minute film) slows this one down. Admittedly, the plot is that John Weston (John Wayne) is sent by Marshall George Higgins (George Hayes) to participate in a fixed rodeo (says "Ro-DAY-oh"), but character development and interaction are sacrificed. The relationship between the bad girl (usually a Latina - even in the big "Duck Soup" [1933]) and the "heroine" Polly Ann Young, a Loretta Young Look alike (hey! This is her sister!) benefited from more screen time. The happy ending is too sudden, though this time John Wayne kisses the girl. <br /> <br /> The most interesting stock material was the long rodeo parade of real Indians, squaws and papoose. But if the best part of the movie is the stunt work of the Mighty Yak, Yakima Canutt, who jumps us from one horse to another, and jumps several different races on a horse, we know we're in trouble. As noted by others, the final battle with the villain is very poor. <br /> <br /> My copy, from 'Platinum Disc Corporation', has an added, sparse, bad (pseudo-classical) stereo track that disturbs the authenticity of the original movie. (The DVD box has 'amplified sound 5.1' on it). If you modernize and color it, add a 'western' sound point with acoustic guitars, 'rock-knocking' head leg, harmonics, and an accordion. <br /> <br /> Finally, we must say this is one of the worst Lone Star efforts.
