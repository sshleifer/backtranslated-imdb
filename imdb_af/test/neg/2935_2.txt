Well, where do you describe this celluloid debacle? You already know the big fat NADA that if a plot is over, so let's point out that it's such a computer, it's offensive. Hard to believe that Frank Oz, the same man that made us upset, like Little Shop or Horrors and Bowfinger, made this trivial mess. <br /> <br /> So, this guy doesn't know he's gay until this actor points it out. Well sure. If someone ever says I'm gay, I know the truth, even if I like girls like George Luca $ of a dollar. <br /> <br /> And how to know the true nature of my sexuality? Well, if I like classic literature, dance and Barbra Streisand, I'm gay. If I dress like a blind in a rabbit (with half my shirt hanging), I'm straight. Oh, sure. <br /> <br /> And here is the great cliché of clichés: no matter how you look, there is always a very attractive Hollywood actor who will worship every little fat under your skin or a top model I will love your zero IQ, your bluntly ugly face and your pointing ears. If all the gay communal places were not enough to hurt me, it did. <br /> <br /> I see it coming: now you will say, "Relax! It's a comedy! Don't take it so seriously!" If a comedy gives something "carte blanche" to suck aloud, I think the world has a serious problem. Wouldn't it be much better to make a movie to condemn those old tiring cliches, rather than increasing them over and over again? <br /> <br /> So, one of the absolute worst movies I've ever seen. 1 out of 10. If you give this rating, it has to do with my sexual inclination, please let me know. I'm interested.
