My wife and I looked at this abortion from this beginning. I immediately hated it, but my wife tied it for a few years. For me it just got worse and worse and the characters were without a doubt sad and depressed without any redeeming qualities. My wife then got tired and we stopped looking completely. Sometimes I hit a stone or pass it through when the channel is navigating. There is always someone shouting or doing something terrible. There never seems to be any lighter moments or happiness of any kind. It was always my biggest grip when we first looked at it - no humor. The authors have no idea of ​​drama - they seem to think conflict IS drama, and of course it's just one element of it. Light and shade are much needed and actors who can bring something to it. I'm sure the Eastenders actors are competent, but they have nothing to do with it. It must be the most depressing work in showbiz. I don't understand why the British public sees and likes it. What on earth does it say about our psyche? I heard it said it was "just like real life" - nothing like my life or anyone's life I know, otherwise we would fling ourselves out of tall buildings or under public transport. The themes it addresses are far from family view but are still shown before the watershed. I like series like Breaking Bad or The Wire, but I won't expect to see them at 7:30 or 8:00 in the evening. The program is a large-scale garbage dump and must be avoided at all costs.
