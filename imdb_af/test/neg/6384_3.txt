I saw this movie and was honestly disappointed. And in my opinion, this movie has no heart. I really don't care what happens to the characters at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> There was so much there that they could have done with the movie they didn't do, because they were either set up to be unclear and to make some deep comment on life, or trying so hard that the characters and the story were completely lost. I saw another picture of this director and enjoyed it well enough. But I felt this movie of the brilliance and the heart of the other and I left to wonder what the point was, or if the point of the movie was that it had no point. Honestly, while I didn't want to tear my hair out of the movie, I regret the lost time on the sad little movie. <br /> <br /> I have no doubt that some people will love this movie, but frankly I didn't.
