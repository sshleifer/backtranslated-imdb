I'm a big MD fan. But I call it as I see it. This movie came together. The plot was ominous. Access to heads of state in this movie is easier than gaining access to the local grocery store. Come on! Tone Loc has the emotion of a wooden board. Leave it alone! The editing is messy. The actors, and I use the term loosely, sound as if they are reading their lines on valium. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been better. Dudikoff has potential, but he chooses scripts that just scream, "Stinker". <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good Dudikoff movie, I may suggest Crash Dive or Avenging Force. If you have never seen one of his films, it is not the one that represents your work. You will leave with a bad taste in your mouth and think all his projects are so bad.
