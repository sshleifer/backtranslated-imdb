While these films are plowed by the artifacts of the Amityville house, it won't be long before we go to the floorboards, but now it's a mirror that causes problems for more cardboard characters in this sixth entry in the series. A homeless man talks about it to Ross Partridge, who then has strange visions and discovers some unpleasant revelations about his past. The everyday horror runs on a dim pass and let's wait for a build-up that never comes when the various spooky actions lead to a stupid final. Shabby and lifeless, with rope-like plays and Partridge's great hair that doesn't help.
