"It's like this town has the power to suck your brain right out of your head. '-Patti <br /> <br /> Patti (Christina Ricci) is a sarcastic teenage girl, bored with her already average village. Bored of it is until a woman has been kidnapped and she finds what she believes is clues to the poor woman's whereabouts. Now, with the help of her precious cat "D.C. "and an indifferent FBI agent (Doug E. Doug) she must find her. <br /> <br /> The Darn Cat is a bad movie. It is quite foolish and it has humor that is often quite flat. However, there are a few buttons of talent in it. Doug E. Doug was good at Cool Runnings. His performance as `Senga 'was really funny. Here he was wasted as the Fumbler agent. He does have a good scene when he mimics the cat. Micheal Mckean plays Patti's father. His character must be the most sensible parent to ever live. This poor man crushed his expensive cigar, was arrested for picking up his own cat, and being married by his girlfriend and still not angry with his daughter to cause all his problems. I wish my old man was like that. The only real good performance is Christina Ricci. She entertained as the ever-irritated Patti, but occasionally very bad dialogue pulled her performance down. You can also recognize Peter Boyle (Young Frankenstein, Everybody Loves Raymond), the old woman of Wings and Cliff of Cheers, in this movie. It's a movie that all these actors will forget. Even the cat is not very good ... I really can't recommend 1997 That Darn Cat. Some young children (under 8) can enjoy it a little, but everyone should look elsewhere. If you're looking for a good Christina Ricci movie, I suggest that Addams Family Values, The Opposite of Sex or Sleepy Hollow. As a fun family movie you are looking for, try snow day before. <br /> <br />
