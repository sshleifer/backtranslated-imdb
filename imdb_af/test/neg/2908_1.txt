It's terrible. Not really, it's not one, the absolute worst ... the worst ... I'm screaming to even name it @ & $% in _movie_. This is a ninety-minute visual root canal. The plot is virtually non-existent: A Mad Scientist who looks like the foreman of 'The Cars', fertilizes a woman in his secret lab, a grass chair into which I think a garage can be, via a injection of Palmolive. Within hours of birth she is an adult monster who then goes on a rampage. It's the whole movie. The Dead Scenes: It's poorly set, take _forver_, and the acting ... how can you mess the _screaming_? The victims are standing there as the coarse, squeaky, overloaded freak progresses and they continue to shrink for about three days. The sets are cheesy, the relief for most of the movies is a single maglite (yes, a big honkin's flashlight), the sound quality is poor. There are only about 40 words of dialogue for the whole movie and the play is widely described. like wood. Footage is recovered scandalously to make out the movie. And the special effects will make any BBC slideshow shake their heads and announce, "They didn't even try." The 'monster' is a few unnamed in a $ 3 Halloween rubber mask with a few bandages that are turned on. In his encounter with the sole police officer of the movie, the police make fire-free, smokeless, invisible bullets that seem to move so slowly, the monster can obscure them five times. Don't see this movie. No really, it's not a risk. Don't see this movie. The director must be shot. The writer must be tied to a giant rock where his liver will be consumed by Ed Wood every morning. Enough rent and there can be a successor, don't let that happen!
