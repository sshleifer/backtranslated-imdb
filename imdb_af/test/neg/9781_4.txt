The Bone Snatcher is about a group of miners looking for a missing crew of miners in the Namib desert. When they find it, they are nothing more than clean stripped bones and they could not have been dead for more than six hours. The story holds your interest in what exactly caused it. The characters are good enough, and the acting is pretty good. <br /> <br /> About an hour and ten minutes when you find out what causes the legs to be stripped clean, you sigh "oh, it's really stupid." The film is ruined by poor writing and a non-exciting ending. Until then, the movie was pretty good, and it's a shame that it took such a bad turn. So I can't recommend this movie. I gave it a 4/10.
