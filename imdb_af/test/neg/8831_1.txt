I want to make it very clear that I am not religious at all. I'm an atheist, but I could see Richard Dorkins contradicting him time and again. I would also like to announce that I am not the kind of person who argues with philosophy all the time, but I feel that when we compare science and religion, we must be philosophical and willing to question the belief in mainstream science <br /> <br /> I wonder if Richard Dorkins ever spent any time thinking philosophically about faith. Anyone who thinks long and hard enough about science and religion will realize that science is indeed a religion in itself. Yes, there is a fundamental difference between the way scientific beliefs are compared to other religions, but at its roots it is belief in a particular human instinct. <br /> <br /> In this series, Richard claims that science methods are the only correct way of thinking and it makes sense to believe in something only if the evidence is strong enough. If you dig deep enough into how science functions, you will realize that it is just as irrational as religion and that it eventually comes to faith, faith in the evidence, belief in our common sense, faith in our senses, but more than anything otherwise faith in our instinct to follow patterns of repetition. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to explain, but think about how the laws of physics have been decided because it was and still is the most common pattern of repetition. of which we are aware. I think people have an instinct that makes them believe that the longer something stays in a certain state or place of existence, the more we just accept blind belief that it will be more likely. For example, we don't expect gravity to work suddenly tomorrow. By this I mean the matter away to attract it. But the only reason we don't expect this sudden change is because we knew so long that it was always so far-fetched as we know. However, this does not mean that it can do exactly the reverse tomorrow or even now. No matter how long something can stay or change in a particular condition, there is no rational reason to make assumptions about it, but we do nothing about instinct. I will ask you to consider what is a long and short time? There is no such thing, I do not know exactly how long it has been for these supposed wise men to decide that everything from matter, sound, light, etc. Must be made, but let them give what they perceive as a fringe! Let's say much longer than it really was 1200000000 years! Is it a long time? 99999999999999999 years make 12.00 billion years look like an incredibly short period. For everything we know, there can be a tremendous change in the so-called legislative laws within the next trillion years. It's all about comparison, just when we compare things, we can say "it's long" or it's short. It is the same with large and small, wide and thin, heavy and light, strong and weak and others. <br /> <br /> I doubt any scientist can tell me why they think the trust of this instinct makes sense. I certainly do not see why it should, but it does not mean that we, as humanity, need to stop using it. With this in mind, the most hypocritical remark made by Richard Dorkins, was when he said that faith was irrational, "a process of non-thinking," he said. If what we have in this instinct I have described and this instinct we all possess on one level or another is not faith, I do not know what hell is. Other times when he is hypocritical is when he talks about the religions that are the Bronze Age, "Bronze Age Myths," he says. I want to point out that, regardless of how many scientific methods have changed over the years due to experience, experimentation and evaluation, the pure rules of science are getting older and older! They can even be described as the Holy Bible of Science. He went about how he was sick of the various religions that were stubborn. "I'm right, he's wrong", but look back at how rude he was to the various interrogators, but he's just as stubborn. To be fair to him, at least he does not try to bombard religious communities. I appreciate his hatred for certain religious beliefs that raise war, but I do not respect his arrogance in his own beliefs. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, Richard has the right to believe in science if that's his way. I'm also scientifically intellectual, but I don't think he has the right to find religious leaders who have unfriendly arguments, try to force them to express themselves and describe them so foolishly. In spite of all his education, experience and discoveries, he does not seem to question wisdom properly. I read what he says in defense of this argument that open-minded atheists like myself have suggested. What he says suggests that he misses the point altogether. <br /> <br /> Finally, the title of the documentary is Root of All Evil. It states that religion is the root of all evil, it is not true. There are causes of evil that have nothing to do with religion. <br /> <br /> All the documentary series were frustrating, meticulous, hypocritical, and flat.
