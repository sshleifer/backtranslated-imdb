The series finally hits rock bottom with this bad fourth installment, which was the last one (thank God). None of the three pursuers responded to the highly entertaining original, but this particular movie is nothing but a shameful attempt to use the name of the "Magnificent Seven" and Bernstein's exciting music theme. The production values ​​resemble those of a television made for television, and the characters are forgotten and indistinguishable. In parts "II" and "III" you can't remember their names, here you can't even remember their faces. Lee Van Cleef was an inappropriate choice for the role of Chris, but no one could have replaced Yul Brynner in our minds. Don't waste your time.
