I have to start by saying I have something of a love-hate relationship with musical. Some of them are fantastic, some are straight shit. So I expected Hair to fall into one of those categories. However, it did not fall into the middle. <br /> <br /> The songs are not brilliant, although the "Sodomy" song has made me smile, and everything is quite dated. But the movie didn't pull me in like others did, like Rocky Horror. Although this is a bad example, as I hated Rocky Horror for years, I suddenly found it and loved it. Maybe Hair will be the same. Although I doubt it will get so much exposure to Rocky Horror due to the language and nudity content, so I doubt I will have the chance to grow it on me. Gettit? Hair .... growing ... o adjusting to yourself. <br /> <br /> In any case, I haven't seen the last fifteen minutes or so due to a technical fault, which was a shame because I wanted to see how it ended, especially after I read some of the reviews here. <br /> <br /> Not a movie for the casual movie maker, but definitely one for musical lovers. I really hope they won't make it again, as I think such a reproduction would end up in a shallow, pale, PC version of the original. <br /> <br /> A look for lovers of the genre.
