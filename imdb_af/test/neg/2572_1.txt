This film is without a doubt the worst action movie I've ever seen. I'm sorry, but it's just pathetic. In fact, the best part of the movie (this movie is supposed to be a serious one) is when a chicken drives over the road, on foot, about 100 miles per hour. This pathetic editing error makes the movie absolutely hilarious for about 2 seconds, then it is "stop, on the edge of your seat, if you try to find a comfortable position to sleep in, action!"
