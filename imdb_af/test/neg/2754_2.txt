Don't make a mistake, Highshot Bigshot is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Bigshot high school is about a geek that plans to get rich and get the girl. However, he is completely wrong about it and, of course, the end of the movie ends with a few other people, thankfully the girl. <br /> <br /> The morale of the story is all the women who care about wealth. Also for our men, I think, we just have to accept that we have it or it doesn't have us! <br /> <br /> I can easily see how this movie can be considered a 1, but it is above the worst movies. The acting is not terribly horrible, and production values ​​are not terribly dreadful. Over all this is a bad movie and for many reasons it is not worth seeing. Of course, if you insist on torturing yourself, look at the MST version. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (maybe a 1.5 / 10)
