The other lowest rating judges summed up this sewer so much, it seems little to add. I must emphasize that I only imposed the Cockney Filt on me during visits from my children, who insisted on watching the Sunday omnibus. My God, it is depressed! Like all soaps, it consists entirely of completely indifferent characters that are unpleasant to each other, but it is ten times as bad as the next worst. The reviewer who mocked the real-to-life bilge was mocked by his defenders. If someone lives in a social environment, they will cut their wrists in a few days. And I can assure that someone who is not familiar with the true East End is rather "ethnically enriching" than you will ever see here. Take my advice - avoid this nadir from the UK TV industry. This is evil.
