It's a fact that it is the first Saudi feature film to be shown in cinema theaters, but not in Saudi Arabia. We don't have theater theaters in our great kingdom. Not just one theater theater! The government banned the opening of theaters after Islamic extremists OR the religious police (or both) asked to close it in the late 1970s and early 1980s. They accuse the 7th art of wrong sex relationships and things like that. I see a powerful reason why we don't open theater theaters !! .. We have lots of video stores in the whole kingdom, we watch movies in the TV of some satellite channels, we can install the "Showtime" channels and in all movies it seems in many ways harmless. I know many people are talking about neighboring countries just watching a few movies. I personally went to Bahrain several times to watch movies in theaters, as it is a lot of fun, other than watching a movie house. Saudis pays the most expensive cinema ticket in the world, we travel to watch movies, while the rest of the world has cinema theaters around every town. This is one of the problems we have! <br /> <br /> The film is produced and presented by Rotana Filmed Entertainment, a major company of Saudi magnate Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal (the world's 8th richest man). <br /> <br /> The movie's title is a word literally means "how are you?" but it is also a snake that means "what is now!", sometimes used as a snake to be bad about something and sometimes used as a snake to tell someone who is polite to invent his business and not to interfere in someone else's business. Anyway, I think they meant (how are you!) And at the same time, I might be wrong. <br /> <br /> Male actors come from Saudi Arabia such as Hisham Abdulrahman, who is very well-known and has some popularity after winning the first prize in Arab realty show more like "American Idol". He works in some TV shows like the Arabic version of Cash Taxi. The other famous actor is Khaled Sami, who is funny and very good. sense of humour. Other actors such as Mishal Al-Mutairi, Turki Al-Yusuf and Ali Al Sabea are less well known and work on some TV series programs. Female actresses are non-Saudis and they have performed a very good job on the Saudi accent. Jordanian actress Mais Hamdan starring and Emeriti actress Fatima Al-Hawsani. Not that we don't have Saudi actresses, but are few and not good. <br /> <br /> A Saudi critic, Rja Al-Mutairi, who writes for the Alriyadh newspaper, wrote about it: "We can't expect much from the 1st Saudi movie. It was born in unusual circumstances, so we can't judge it according to the usual standards like any other movie, the fact that the movie hit a big financial success in its first opening days in the kingdom of Bahrain, the movie is fresh and about A Saudi family agreement (interaction) with controversial new issues in Saudi society such as: women driving cars, low-level thoughts about the arts, the guardianship of a group by a certain group and the differences between conservatives and a The ideas are good, but you feel you are lost in the middle of the movie, one of the benefits of the movie is the good music score by Rajeh Dawood, which was good, but sometimes does not match or express in the picture is not Turki Al-Yusuf has a go own work done. His performance was best with Mais Hamdan. The biggest loser is the leading actor Hisham Abdulrahman who came behind supporting actors Mishal Al-Mutairi, Ali Al Sabea and Khaled Sami. good work within the boundaries of their roles. <br /> <br /> After all, "Keif al-hal?" Even with all its drawbacks still an ok movie and it is a very good 1st step of rotana .. and the movie has become the speech of people and streets which is a golden goal of a strong debate in the Saudi make films about movies in general until they become aware of the importance of 7th art and other arts. <br /> <br /> PS: There is another Saudi movie maker "Abdullah Almohaisen" claiming to be the 1st Saudi movie titled "Shadows of Silence" br /> <br /> movie not seen. I hope I was helpful.
