It's technically a very capable movie. The camera works and direction is excellent and the acting is also good, especially the fine Daniel Auteuil acts as the Marquis. I really thought there were no problems with these aspects of the movie. Instead, I was a little annoyed by the way the Marquis is portrayed, as it doesn't seem to be honest and seems to be a very revisionist view of history. In fact, the Marquis has recently undergone some transformation into a liberal defender with great insight, and he wasn't really the fat-sado masochistic rapist. In a way, it is very reminiscent of the whitewash given in THE PEOPLE VERSUS LARRY FLINT - where these men rise to hero status. Even if you don't think the Marquis's perversions were not that bad (they included rapes and extreme violence), his depiction in this movie as a "sexual social worker" in this prison seems pretty stupid. Instead of the violent and selfish seeds, he spends a lot of time taking care of a young virgin and slowly helping her to explore her own sensuality. What a nice and friendly man. In fact, now that I think about it, I remind myself of the man Maurice Chavalier played in GIGI (but without the song) - a cute older man who loves the ladies. I strongly doubt the real Marquis de Sade would not recognize this character at all! <br /> <br /> The surprising film doesn't have much nudity, though it is very explicit. Just a maniac will show their children as this is a very mature drama. It is very well made and quite entertaining - just not so true. The director admits that the film in the interview is largely fictitious among the special features on the DVD I watched. So go ahead and look at the movie if you want it - to understand it just isn't very good in history. In the 18th century, sexual freedoms in France were properly accepted because it was fairly broad. Despite what the movie implies, it was not the SEX that was the problem, it was the violence and rape that (and still is) the problem.
