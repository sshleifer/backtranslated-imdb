It's terrible. <br /> <br /> Very brief review I know, but it's been a long time since a movie left me in such a confused state - and wondering how hell made a movie like that. <Br /> <br /> The last time this happened, turkey was "Mission to Mars" last year. <br /> <br /> Salvatore Coco is an ex-con - trying to improve itself through self-help videos, endless seminars and enhancement courses. He lives by the catches that these courses set out. <br /> <br /> He stumbles across an excited nightclub singer, played by Nikki Bennett, and has an epiphany; his new career will be that of a talent agent - with the singer as his only client. <br /> <br /> Financed by his gospel song, paraplegic girl, played by Sasha Horler - he sets up shop and tries to recharge Nikki's career, with unfortunate results. <br /> <br /> 'Walk the Talk' is why Australians are so disrespectful of Australian theater. It is poorly configured, lame and too long (111 minutes for a comedy that scarcely scraped the 80-minute point). <br /> <br /> Each scene is too long and very repetitive. The audience is not given a character to collect; an essential ingredient in a movie like this, presumably about a 'underdog' that gives it a little. <br /> <br /> The slick and honestly poor end comes at the end of 30 minutes of the most sensible dialogue and scenes you cry out for a power outage. <br /> <br /> This movie is a failure at all levels - worse for Queensland audiences by its liberal and inexorable use of various Gold Coast / Palm Beach sites; and its ridiculous use of Brisbane suburb names such as Norman Park and Caboolture.
