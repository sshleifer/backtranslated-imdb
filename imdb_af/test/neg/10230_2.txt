I loved the first movie, the second one was okay, disappointed. John Cleese was no longer jean bob as my favorite character. But the third one ... what happened to the animation? It looks like a low budget like a nice morning cartoon! except for the flashback taken from the first movie. They really had to stop at number 2, it just made the rest bad! Derek's voice changed, but it's not as recognizable as Jean Bob. Rogers also looks very strange. I also don't understand where Rothbart came from. I thought he was dead! This movie turned me off, as much as I liked the first one, I was very disappointed with this installment. They will never beat the original! :)
