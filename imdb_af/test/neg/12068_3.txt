Apparently, the author and director of this direct-to-DVD slasher movie is a fan of the 13th and other summer camp slashers. This movie has it all - a group of teenagers who want to use the weekend with fun, alcohol and sex in a deserted summer camp, called Camp Blood, the old man who warns them not to go there; and of course the crazy killer with the machete who clap the teens to the teens for no reason at all ... The whole thing could have worked if it was shot on 35mm film with acceptable special effects. But instead, the special effects were poorly done. The murderer walks around as if on a Sunday afternoon walk and the only good thing about this movie is the scene of the talented main actress and the sex scene at the beginning. Other than that - boring and forgetting. Jasper P. Morgan
