Anyone who called the steamy smelly poo piece called Congo understands my title. And I feel for you. This movie wasn't just bad. It was painful. The book was stupid, the writing was even more stupid and the role was terrible. Dylan Walsh? Rumors have it, Julia Roberts threw your ass because this movie was blowing so badly. Big Diamonds? Killer gorillas? Talk about gorillas? Hmmm. Sounds like a hit! OH! Tim Curry's accent is so bad in this movie, I prefer to be deaf! I recommend this movie to seek bulimia for a heavy meal or Kavorkian patients who just need another reason to die. If it is true to the book, I would say we can have a good old fashioned Footloose book that burns and destroys each copy. Looking back on future generations and finding this garbage, how will we explain ourselves? Listen to the others who hated this movie! Don't look at it! Run away! Don't see this movie! If you think it is full of action or tension or cool effects, YOU ARE WRONG! If you think it's blowing more cock than Nicole Ritchie, you'd be right. So if you're still looking at Crapo. I mean Congo, I say do this after just taking 50 Tylenol PM.
