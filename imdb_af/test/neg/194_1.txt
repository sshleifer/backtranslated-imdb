This film is an insult to the play on which it is based. The character of Claude was distorted unrecognizable, leaving a painful display that did not even look vague as the original plot. Shame, shame, shame. They also cut a fair number of the original count of change to the context in which the songs are sung. It twists the air of the movie and causes the viewer who is aware of how it should be to win, as the author of this screenplay gives Hud a woman, Sheila becomes a spoiled rich girl, characterizes Claude as' killing a cowboy and burger. rather by sending him to Vietnam. If one is not familiar with the original plot, I assure you, it is not a bad movie for you to see, but if you ever want to see the original or are you, like me, a hard fan from the classic play, will do best to avoid the movie altogether. One really has to stay one or the other.
