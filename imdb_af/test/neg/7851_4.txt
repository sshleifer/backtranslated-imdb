German emigree and uber-hambone actor Paul Muni, who has never seen a scene he doesn't want to chew, goes "blackface" to play a humble Mexican immigrant living, living in Los Angeles and making his way into the world to work. If this creaking vehicle reminds anyone of Al Pacino's minstrel performance as an unprecedented Cuban in the remake of SCARFACE, don't be surprised. The characters are very similar, and both are very pop-eyed when the script asks. Hispanics everywhere have to be attacked a lot by Muni's over-the-top performance, as these mad Mexican lives are condemning American dream, consequences. I think Benicio DelToro's grandfather wasn't available. A young, bleached blonde Bette Davis plays one of Muni's love interests; She eventually goes insane for the love of Mr. Meh-hee-kan Muni. Davis is an absolute reason, and this is the only reason to look at this racially attacking slap. There is an absolutely delirious near end when Muni asks the dreams of his dreams to marry him - a white gall of breeding with one of the stylized, rampant 30-accents that Hollywood so loved - and she calls him a rage and a brute, of another tribe. Muni immediately changed to Mr. Hyde and chase her to an untimely death. In the last scene, a reprimanded Muni tells his sober priest that he is returning to his own people, his own kind. End of the movie. Finis. That's all she wrote. Muni said he hired a genome-eyed Mexican as a driver to study this exotic creature's speech pattern and physical habits. Yowza!
