I look forward to seeing Bruce Willis in this, especially since I remember clipping to the original when I was young. <br /> <br /> This movie is a perfect example of how movie companies can take a very good story and mute it until it's just another formula that US law enforcement system US (the Russians ... The cold war is over, make it with the Russians.) US THE TERRORIS, similar to probably 50 other movies. <br /> <br /> It also treats its audience like a lot of idiots. Choosing a weapon is good, simply ridiculous, are we seriously expected to believe that the world's most feared and experienced hit / terrorist would prefer an assassination? <br /> <br /> The whole point of the original story was the tense dual sense between the ordinary detective who gave the responsibility and the professional, creating a ruthless but elegant plan to reach his target and then get away. None of them survived. All we have is the tired old American CIA / FBI / Army vs the evil terrorist plot. We've all seen 1000 times. <br /> <br /> But, of course, the movie company's MBAs realized that a new intellectual angle would lose their revenue from the short attention span, so the answer is ..... Bruce Willis, BIG explosions and a lame plot. They assume that the American audience is unable to threaten a foreign statesman (where is France on the map afterwards), so it's an American! <br /> <br /> Another example of a movie being polluted by the management room.
