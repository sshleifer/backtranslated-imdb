Living in Edinburgh, and a big thirst for history, I took a lot of the "libertys". Wrong dog breed for a start! Bobby's owner Old Jock was an old single man who came to Edinburgh and died a peacock in the house, not like the movie. For anyone coming to Edinburgh and hoping to see the movie, you won't find the cemetery in Princes St Gardens !! There were a few moments where a tissue would have been good. The actors were fantastic to fold out a rather thin manuscript. I don't feel the poor little Bobby actually had enough screen time, possibly due to the fact that it was lost at one point. All that said, the movie was good and any 8 year old would enjoy.
