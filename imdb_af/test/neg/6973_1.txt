Wow! What can you say about this bizarre, stupefying mock-u mentoring on Ed Wood's cross-dressing fantasies ?? Well, one word that comes to mind is incoherent! Wood uses raw sheets of harmless, accidental stock and then builds a story around them - and what a story !! Star himself like Glen, a regular Joe who just goes to sleep in his fiance's underwear and sweater in the fiancee. I think Wood wanted to be a plea for tolerance for all the Glens of this world by showing that Glen is just like us all, just in Angora. Ummm ... ok. But then we get this very bizarre montage of a little horny devil, a chick in slavery, a little rude, show people, some Moore stock footage, and finally an emaciated Bela Lugusi, who's kind of twisted, playing invalid Puppetmaster. Lugosi is a cry that radiates such a garbage as 'Beeevaaare ... the bee-green-dragon who sees your doorstep: he is lee-tee boys, puppy-eyed tails and bee-goats!' Um, ok, Bela ...: = 8 / Here is a strange, twisted type of logic. Then he reminds us that "7 out of 10 men wear hats, and 7 out of 10 men are bare". Hmmm, that stranger / cross decor / habidashery-koeispiracy-thang must be !! Glen of Glenda stars an abundance of (everything it is ...) from reputable Wood Schlock actors, including Lyle Talbot, Delores Fuller and Timothy Farrell, and Wood manages to cherish every little, amateurish, non-talent from each one . Everyone now knows Bela's sad story: by the time Hout used him for this movie, he probably got another solution and needed the moolah, but even for him that depth has not yet reached. One of the MooCow's favorite Wood Mooments comes with the stock-loading buffalo scene - it's sooo fun demented !! The MooCow says "Puuuull the orders", and gives you a copy of Glen or Glenda - you won't believe it! : ??
