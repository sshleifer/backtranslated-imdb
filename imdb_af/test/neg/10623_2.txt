When I borrowed this movie, I didn't expect high quality performance, but it was just sad. <br /> <br /> Most of the plays were so incredibly bad that you couldn't easily get into this movie if you tried. There's nothing really like seeing a child announce things like "Oh no! My dad is invisible!" or "I wonder what it does?" In the same monotonous one can announce on the radio with traffic advice. There are some good actors, but they are wasted on smaller parts. <br /> <br /> The story is decent, but it will be pretty easy to guess, as there aren't too many real plot changes. Lots of holes too. For example, the Dad is invisible, and the inventor determines what part it needs to make him visible again. So the boy goes and steals the part of an electronic store. Can't he just ask his father for the cash? <br /> <br /> It comes in the comedy category, but most of the comedy in this movie was pretty stupid, as the invisible dad withdraws his clothes while invisible and then almost naked during a meeting, or walk around with his head at all times. Funny at first, but it gets old. <br /> <br /> 2/5, because it's viewable, and that's one of those movies that is funny in their own way ... like the monotonous review of lines.
