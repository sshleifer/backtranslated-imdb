This so-called movie is terrible! The actors can't act. There is no plot. I believe they have to start over again. I hope they can fix the acting errors in this movie. I'd like to see the trailer after they shot it again. Maybe there's hope for that. I'm not hurting feelings, but I believe high school children can do a better job. The wardrobe could have been much better. Sorry, but it just didn't do me. I usually enjoy the trailers of this site, but ... this one I can't find entertaining. I hope they take criticism well because I believe they will receive much more from others regarding this movie.
