It's about jealousy, it's about racism, it's about manipulation, but the underlying message is love. Geoffrey Sax tried to draw Shakespeare's Othello by bringing it into the contemporary context. However, the actors were not convincing enough to pull it off. There were extra bodies to put everything in perspective, but John Othello, played by Eamonn Walker, responded a lot in this movie. As a result, Keeley Hawes, Dessie Brabant's downfall, eventually ended in Dessie's death. <br /> <br /> Ben Jago, played by Christopher Eccleston, was seen as the main character in the film. He did not give enough evidence to Dessie to cheat on Othello, with Michael Cass, played by Richard Coyle. Instead, he just played a friend for everyone and gave one reason why she was "cheated". In the play it made Iago much more convincing to even let Othello suspect. This change made the film more about anger for the wrong reasons than the book was based on. However, the movie had some good points. This changed the army scenes into a racist group more against blacks, where Othello is the head of the police group. These scenes are made credible by the raging crowds and burning fires. You can sense the amount of racism in the movie, more than you can in the book. This book plays the contemporary scene by understanding it much easier than the Shakespeare times in which it was written. In the play, Iago (Jago) is tortured at the end, but in the film he becomes content and gets Othello's position. He never gets what he deserves and is never caught telling the lie to Othello until it's too late. I saw it as a downfall in the movie, because I felt that the villain had given his treasure of the promotion from the lie, and in the book he found out by Rodrigo. Overall, the movie could have done a better job based on the play than it did. I feel that the director of the movie is some of the most important parts of the play that has been omitted or omitted to make the drama flow or make it more of a tragedy. I would say that you first have to read the book, to understand all the events that happened in the movie, otherwise you might get lost and confused.
