Ants are shown in cartoons for chicken legs, watermelons, people, etc. To carry. This can be an admirable feature as ants carry the film Phase IV. This is not because they want to, but because they have to. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with a narrator and states that some cosmic events have come across the earth and that a fellow scientist has worked on the effect that this disorder has on the ant population. The film is broken up into segments; The first part after the cosmic event is Phase I, and so on until the end of the movie, which is Phase IV. <br /> <br /> What is Phase IV? Who knows? We don't get that part; supposedly it has something to do with the binding of one of the scientists studying the ants and a girl living in the area. The girl who looks like a cross between Alicia Silverstone and Liv Tyler is angry with the ants for killing her horse, but except for an angry outburst, the biodome goes empty ("Clueless"). /> <br /> These ants are pretty clever; or the scientists are quite stupid. I'll give credit to the ants. Why? Anything that usually ruins my picnic, which can then build up, dry towers, and inflate trucks, and with the greatest convenience, gets my voice to be the smarter species, at least in this movie. <br /> <br /> Sterno says bluntly on this ant. <br /> <br />
