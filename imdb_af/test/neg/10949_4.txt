The concept: shows 4 families of diverse ethnicities in the Fairfax district of L.A. preparing for the family gathering at Thanksgiving. I love Soul Food and How to make an American Quilt. (I think there's a law that Alfre Woodard should be in all these movies), which in the same way presented a pastiche of family traditions, and was prepared for a surprise. Instead, I was visiting. They draw about 40+ characters, and all but two are one-note cliches with no finesse whatsoever. The authors and directors should learn about life for a few years and learn how love from different generations actually relates. Instead, you have a bunch of ** gates gathering on Turkey day to act like an extraordinary a ** gates. Now, to some extent, that's what Thanksgiving is about. But it's not wrong. And why Julianne Marguiles saves and gives her absolutely nothing to do. It was an attempt to get through, and Mercedes Ruehl is looking, but I give it a 4/10.
