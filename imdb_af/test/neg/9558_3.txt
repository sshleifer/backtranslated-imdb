My girlfriend wanted to see it (lol, that's the case a lot) ... so I rented it. Then I saw how award-winning it was nominated for 10 Oscar. GREAT! It must be good oh drama. This movie had a lot of potential ... the direction and the way everything played was very good. But as soon as the movie ended, I couldn't help but ask me if this story was really worth making a movie. Virginia Hill (Annette Bening) was extremely annoying, I couldn't tolerate her character at all. Warren Beatty was excellent in the movie scene, but again I found it hard to have sympathy for his character .... he just came down as an idiot, a hotheaded loser from a gangster. He had no place in "life" in the first place. How does he come in with like Meyer Lansky and Lucky Luciano anyway ??? This film left me with a dull but uncomfortable feeling. What was the big problem with this movie? I just didn't feel complete with Bugsy. Beatty's fianc√©, though behaving fairly well, was too random and illogical. I guess that's how Siegel really was .... but it was just too much of it. There just wasn't much of a true story here. My basic assessment of this would be <br /> <br /> "a hot-tempered, playboy, down-going gangster falls in love with a loser of a woman, come up with the idea of" Las Vegas ".... but she failed attempt at the casino he builds, along with the fact that he has no money for his mobbase's money, gets him killed. <br /> <br /> What else is there? And it was a big disappointment, there should not be many movies in 1991. How it was nominated for 10 Oscars is beyond me (although the two who won it are justifiable) 1.5 / 4 stars.
