Why, why did I ever waste my time watching this movie? It was given to me on video by a friend and I thought I'd see it, it couldn't be that bad. First, the play is just awful and we have to believe it is real? Secondly, this film blatantly tries to copy the Blair gate project (yawn) and does it very poorly. So if you want the horror of your life, I suggest a Simpson's Halloween special will be more powerful. but if you just wanted to laugh then the general crapness of this movie would suffice. but generally I would avoid this movie at all costs or drink a large amount of alcohol before I see it. the best bit? It's just about half an hour, thank you.
