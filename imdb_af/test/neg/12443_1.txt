My mom brought me this movie on a DVD. A man in a rental recommended it. But it may be the worst movie I've ever seen. You know, I didn't expect much from this movie, but it didn't have a good story, it wasn't even funny and it was pointless. I look forward to seeing Christine Lakin in this movie because I loved Step by Step. Even she was a big disappointment. The story was completely unreal. One of the party guys is dead (he wasn't dead, he woke up later), the house looks like a bomb explodes and there are 2 guys who have 3 hours to handle everything. But then there comes a homosexual, policeman ... There's a total mess to the end and the guys got tide and everything in like 15 minutes ??? Come on, at least be realistic. Money of money. Really ...
