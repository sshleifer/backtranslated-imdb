Obviously, they wanted this movie to drive the story line through the characters. But immediately the story line causes you not to keep the new main characters. The island's escape and the dinosaurs below had nothing at all and looked almost like a cartoon. The whole action entrance to the island is merely a rehash of parts of JP 1 and 2. The story line is predictable to the point of annoyance and it is totally unsatisfactory and makes me feel cheated. It gave me no option to award the movie 3/10!
