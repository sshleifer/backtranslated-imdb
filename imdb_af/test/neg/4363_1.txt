<br /> <br /> This movie sucked! The first one was better. None of the first has returned to this dumb prosecution and somehow it is a good thing because of the bad acting, but the characters in this movie are not even better. Killjoy in the woods? Come on! Give me a chance! I'm surprised Killjoy's friend, the Blair Witch didn't turn up to make a cameo. Bad acting, bad story and just making it stupid and boring. Don't waste your time!
