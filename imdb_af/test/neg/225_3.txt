After reading Fool For Love in a drama class of mine, I see how Sam Shepard's wonderful play would be translated on the screen. To my horror it was nowhere as entertaining as the play. The movie seems to be dragging, the music was inappropriate for the scene of the movie, and all the raw energy of the play apparently sucked out of this movie version. It is a pity that it comes this way, even with Shepard's involvement, which plays the role of Eddie. Do yourself a favor ... see the play the next time it's done in your area or rather read the book.
