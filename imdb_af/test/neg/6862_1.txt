I remember seeing this movie when I was about 10, one of my friends had it. By then, it was just a movie I was about 10 years old and just thought of it as another action movie. <br /> <br /> Looking back as a full movie buff, it's quite a shockingly bad movie. Who made this movie is sure I had a short Hollywood career. Although the main actor, according to IMDb, did some movies, although I didn't see anything and didn't remember him too much. <br /> <br /> Anyway, just to say that this movie is really bad, in all respects it can be. I'd love to see it again: oD
