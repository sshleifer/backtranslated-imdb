There were some decent moments in this movie, and a few times it was pretty funny. However, this did not mean that overall it was an incredibly boring movie. There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this movie, and I couldn't understand why he would even leave his wife for this chick he's supposedly knocked out. There was better chemistry between him and Liv Tyler in Armageddon. Hell, there was better chemistry between Sly and Sandra in Demolition Man. <br /> <br /> There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were unnecessarily slow moving. <br /> <br /> It was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding". Wait until it's a year and a half on video and rent it in the .49 cents bin if you have nothing to do with a rainy Sunday afternoon, and you can't think of better movies to rent.
