This movie was definitely on the boring side. The acting was decent and the movie looks pretty pretty, the soundtrack is definitely for fans of Kenny G and Michael Bolton. About the sound track I found it very ironic that a movie tells the truth and does not steal, decides to use a song in the titles that a BLATANT RIPOFF by Paul Simon's "You Can Call Me Al" was - except that they do not recognize it at all. Isn't there a little hypocritical there? The main kid's scene was where he hosted a game player, my favorite. 10 lines? Do I have to write ten lines on this movie to be included? What a ripoff, I don't think it's fair to write FORCE people more than they just wanted to get it!
