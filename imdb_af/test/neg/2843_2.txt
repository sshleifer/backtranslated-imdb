Initially, I thought this one was supposed to be a comedy / horror when I saw the body in the bath, with the woman standing there shouting over and over, but as the movie continued, has become more and more flat. The plot was silly with a man who was upset that real estate prices had risen. Now he instantly thickens to call up the radio psychiatrist and take out his anger because he has nothing better to do. Then the law becomes involved and we try desperately to feel that they really care who the caller is and go out of their way to track this man. One suspect after another is accused. This movie is terrible and the slow moving love stories of Adrian B. and her husband are boring and made me the movie quickly. Avoid it!
