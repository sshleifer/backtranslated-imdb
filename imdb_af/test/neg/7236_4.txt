This is the successor of Octopus. <br /> <br /> Pff ... OK. Lots of stock material but pretty good. I'm surprised they actually had a giant robot octopus that didn't look that bad! I was really surprised at that. <br /> <br /> The movie overall was just cute. It never explained how the octopus grew so big, and it wasn't linked to the first. But it was still fun. <br /> <br /> The end of me and my friend laughed. Actually, once the potato has been fired, the two main characters start a bomb, and five explosions, most of the stock, appear on the screen! We joked that they went to the dollar store and bought a "five missiles in one" toy! Believe me, it must be seen to believe! Overall just silly fun. Possible to give a chance, buy if it is cheap.
