OK, yes I know I'm a Philistine, and I don't know or love opera. I readily admit that I can feel different about this movie if I did. But I don't. So for those of you like me, skip this one if you don't want to look at the pretty (sometimes uncontaminated) girls. For what it's worth, I thought the first segment with Theresa Russell (which I didn't recognize) was the best of the lot.
