I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out, and it is a pity to say, and it was one of only a few movies I wanted to start early on. I didn't have a problem with the drug content and I could see how this warning story might have been. The problem was that the filmmaker, along with James Woods and Sean Young, signed two of the least beloved characters I've ever seen on film. I hated this couple and couldn't care less if they sank straight to the inevitable bottom. They were not one surprise in this movie. Every turn of events was so painfully obvious that I felt I could have written the script myself; Although I think I would have done a better job. I later heard nightmare stories about the incidents on the set between Sean Young and James Woods in the sense of some sort of stalking. It made me wonder if the terrible play came from some bad feelings and dysfunction. Anyway, I refer to The Boost as the worst movie I've ever paid money to see.
