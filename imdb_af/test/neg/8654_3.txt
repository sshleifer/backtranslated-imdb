I agree that this movie is about sex without seduction or love. In fact, it makes sex look so boring and makes me wonder why it's bothering. Actually, I don't think it remotely speaks of how Canadian Indian second generations feel about sex. Anyway, did you know that the first hotel / drunk idea was copied from a Korean movie, Yopgijogin gunyo, made in 2001 or beyond? The Korean film was actually brilliant as a comedy, but at the same time, the audience was forced to reflect on the complexity of husband and wife relationships and male-female differences in experience and thought. I mean most of the Neal N Nikki hotel / drunk segment is taken into account. Can't Bollywood filmmakers try to make originals, please? Seriously, I never enjoyed a Hindi movie that is a copycat. Those I enjoy always mean Indian feelings through Indian cultural.
