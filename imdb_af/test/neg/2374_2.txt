I always said there was nothing to beat the original form: the comics. I was proven right again. This, like all the other movies, captures the Asterix series, fails to impress. The creators of this movie do not find the other such a comic-turned-movie (x-man, superman et al.) Businesses successful that they deviate from the original comic versions and adapt it to make it more viewable. Agreed, this movie deviated, in the sense that this movie was a cross of two Asterix books, viz. Asterix and the Great Crossing & Asterix and the Normans. Also, uncharacteristic of the Asterix series (except Asterix and the secret weapon), a love interest for one of the main characters has been introduced. All these things were finally a childish story. The funny parts were very few and far between. All in all, a total waste of time and money to see it, let alone at theaters, even at home.
