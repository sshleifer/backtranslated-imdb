Overall it was a viewable movie. I didn't interrupt or stop coming back - a clear sign of a boring movie - so it passed the first test. Best of all, it came quickly into the story, no boring unnecessary storytelling for the characters. <br /> <br /> It will never be a good movie. Also not as a big B movie. I would recommend this movie to slasher / horror fans who don't really think about video releases. <br /> <br /> Unlike some movies, there is no nudity, just moderate language and rather muted gore. However, there is violence. Death was rather dry and unimaginable. The computer's special effects were actually pretty good. The way the 'creature' turned its chains into some scenes reminded me of 'Spawn' and 'Ghost Rider' comic books. <br /> <br /> A little pet ... It's in Lousinia, but no one seems to speak with any accent. I had to watch the credits to realize that it was filmed in Lousinia. <br /> <br /> Like most low-budget films, there are small pieces in the filming. Lack of time and money will be the main factors for the goofs. For example, in one scene it went mid-afternoon to beat in seconds in seconds ... during a short drive. The other case was the stunt double because the "creature" was not on the "creature" makeup when he dropped out of the trailer. He also seems to wear a shirt in the scene. <br /> <br /> In short, I didn't hate this movie, but I didn't like it either. I will never rent it again, but if a friend owns it, I can see it again in a few years.
