The Red Comedy murder in the Grayfriars abbey was far from one of the most terrible things ever done in the Scottish Independent War of Independence, and battles (and murders) in churches were not uncommon. Not much later, Robert Bruce's wife, daughter, was captured two of his sisters during a battle in a church where people were killed. And compare it to Berwick's mass murder, in which the English slaughtered at least 8,000 non-fighters (some, yes, in churches) are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It's not a well-made movie. It is a bit of an antidote to the absolute RIDICULOUS sizzling representation of Robert Bruce in Braveheart. Whatever Bruce was, it wasn't a wuss. <br /> <br /> Too bad that they didn't do a better job of this, because someone has to make a very good movie of a war so wonderful that it sounds like something someone made of A complete defeat at the Battle of Methven to a secret return to hide from a long guerrilla war after Bannockburn. However, this is not the case. Poorly made and to a large extent poorly written and performed. Sorry!
