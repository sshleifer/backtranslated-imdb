I wanted so much to like this movie. I really did. But it was a horrible disappointment. <br /> <br /> I read Jennifer Egan's novel in 1996 and was surprised by the story. In fact, it remains one of my favorite books of all time. Note, the book has much more depth than this movie, in plot and emotional resonance. It made you care about the characters. It painted a complete picture of Phoebe, as opposed to the extremely poor characterization of the young girl in the film. <br /> <br /> Although beautiful and with a few promises in her emerging career, Jordana Brewster was so flat and hollow in this show as the writing was. And Christopher Eccleston (Wolf) was just a terrible choice for Wolf's role, both physically and logistically. What an uncomfortable couple. Wolf had to be more of a dark breeding character, and more physically tempting, as he was in the book. In addition, the chemistry between the two actors was painfully forced. <br /> <br /> However, Cameron Diaz deserves the greatest praise for her performance. She took an impossible mediocre manuscript and gave her character life, a real spirit. She is just beautiful and her careful ways make her very credible as a hippie. It's too bad her talent has been devastated on this forgetful movie. <br /> <br /> In the book-to-movie category, it's a terrible translation, almost as bad as a message in a bottle with Kevin Costner. But don't start me there ... <br /> <br /> I'm not usually so hard in my criticism, but I was so disappointed here because I really care about the story and wanted to see it. right. It didn't deliver. <br /> <br />
