Irwin Allen has all his talents behind this one: he is author, producer and director of this cartoon-like "epic" about an atomic submarine and his efforts to reduce a ring of radiation surrounding the Earth. Potentially exciting story fails to take down, despite an eclectic cast. Varied players from Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine to Frankie Avalon and Barbara Eden are interesting to mix and offer a drop of color, but this fuzzy scientific fiction is rather cheesy. Good for a little stray laugh, but Allen did not feel the difference between strong, solid adventure and camouflage. Later on a popular TV series. ** of ****
