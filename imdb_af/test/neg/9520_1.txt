What a self-indulgent mess! Duncan Roy's film is apparently autobiographical, but it is impossible to find a little emotional truth in this chaotic, poorly-activated and foul-smashing fate. <br /> <br /> In a way, you need to admire a man's balls by grim determination and manage a generous benefactor to make a movie about his own rise and fall - from abused, working classmate to criminal English gentleman. However, the tone is so self-pitying or so bow that it is impossible to engage with characters or plot. The raw material is potentially good stuff, but Roy doesn't seem to be able to take the kind of story that grabs you by the throat, then moves to tears. And this is a complete riddle why it was ever made to be selected as a triptych image - presumably because a single image was too boring to watch. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to see so many other good actors - Bill Nighy, Diana Quick, Lindsay Coulson - giving career worst performances.
