I'm not sure who should be blamed for this debacle. In fact, the play is not bad and the story is not as horrible as some made for Disney movies. The story itself is shallow and undeveloped, but it's not surprising in a movie of this kind. The acting is more than a little two-dimensional, but I give the actors credit to manage to do something about the material they had to work with. <br /> <br /> However, it is inexplicable in my book to base a whole story on the theory that they have created a "perfect" pop star and then cast an actress who cannot sing to save her life . If the girl can't sing, have someone who can record the music! <br /> <br /> This actress is a DIFFERENT singer - she was so flat she usually sings in a totally different key!
