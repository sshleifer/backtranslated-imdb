The film contains a very short scene of Deneuve in a bath. She looks absolutely stunning for a 56-year-old lady, but it is the only saving grace of the movie. Otherwise, it has an unashamed, unmotivated script and the main actress has nothing of Deneuve's appeal. The director apparently watched too many Peter Greenaway films and Pola X appears as a student's imitation of the Greenaway style, without any inspiration.
