"The Foreigner" is a story of foreign plot with Seagal in the center as a deep cover that has a package that everyone wants and wants to kill to get. The movie is not inspired by less of the usual action words Seagal puts on the movie card (firefighting, hand-to-hand combat, fireworks, stunts, etc.) And more of a story that is busy, uninteresting and full of meaningless filling. What action is there, token and gratuitous while Seagal, more and more like a pork chop, seems to be depressed and bored by this unashamed look, while there is no improvement in acting abilities. Somewhere around "The Glimmer Man" or "Fire Down Below" Seagal flicks has a nose dive and "The Foreigner" is just a continuation of the trend. Nothing here is worth watching, except for the most mortal Seagal fans. (C-)
