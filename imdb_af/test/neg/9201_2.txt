I say Ben Johnson and my fellow Canadian say, "Ben Johnson?" - He was a goddamn MOVIE STAR guy, a COWBOY, and by 1976 he played scarcely by playing a sheriff who was foolish for TV disaster movies like this, which on the DEAD SWARMS OF KILLER BEES all seem thought, get to get us back then. So there are these bees, and they kill some people by flying in their mouths and going among them. Eventually, these idiots find the swarm and die and this woman is trapped in her car through the whole swarm. The police are like what we do? Uh, bees die if it's cold. So where can we make it cold? I know - the stadium in New Orleans! So they drive this car and its villain killer bees through and through the streets of New Orleans, with a bullhorn saying, "START THE STREETS OR YOU WILL VOTE FOR DEATH." And the future home of tens of thousands of flood victims with its broken toilets thus becomes the narcotic death of these particular bunchabies. I don't know what the biggest outrage on this big city is ... well I do, but this one sucks too. Most appropriately looked at an extremely blurred-to-orange 16mm print, though Betamax is a good alternative!
