I'm not inclined to ranting and my expectations were low, but what does it look like a good idea? Just because you have a camera, some big ugly friends for actors and talent replacements don't mean you have to go out and make a movie. It had to be the movie-like equivalent of the song in the shower, ie it should never have seen the light of day. Somehow, this garbage found a distributor to help it escape the boundaries of a 3 to 4 foot booth. It's going from bad to worse. Talk about a low budget, one torture scene consists of a guy throwing a cup of coffee over him while he is tied to a chair. Apparently, it is very painful because the big baby stops shouting. Maybe he ordered these days !! The acting is worse than wood (I can see a tree for 30 seconds before being completely bored. If you can see this garbage, you're a better man than me!) And the battle scenes will be at home. a toddler playground. Do not touch this movie unless you enjoy pain (in this case, try to rinse your coffee over yourself). I'd like to say it's so bad, it's good, but really it's just awful.
