You don't have to spend much time making it for television or serial shed or whatever it was meant to find out in the store. The incredibly bad musical score makes its debut from the start. Seriously, if it's not the worst theme I've ever heard, I certainly can't remember it. While the acting talent is available here, from Jeff Bridges to Carl Betz, Vera Miles, and Sal Mineo, the writing is horrible and the story is set up, filled with indifferent stereotypes, and a clear ripoff by Ken Kesey. Why should Hollywood always present stories from the sixties as if the so-called hippies were all unidimensional morons? It is too bad that such an interesting era in our exceptional conventional social experience is generally portrayed by out and out of garbage, so that the least offensive of the genre is now accepted as fairly authentic when almost none of it is close to the way things really was not. The best thing I've seen is a memo called Looking Back by a man named Becker, but who even heard it? Nobody in Hollywood, that's for sure. They are too busy pushing such a movie like a movie to bother reality.
