If there was an EPA for movie, then this movie would get their most sincere approval. If we all recovered our "things" to this degree, we would never run out of everything. <br /> <br /> Funny how I am reminded of this movie when I first saw Starwars I: The Phantom Menace. At least Lucas didn't recover his old footage. <br /> <br /> It's a dud. But it's a nice dud. Fun in spots (I like when the child said "damn rocks"). And if you like explosions (even recycled), you'll get your fill. <br /> <br /> For a natural "no budget" movie, of course, it's pretty good. It is weak, but there is a slight characterization here and there. Story is predictable, but will lead you anyway. <br /> <br /> It is an "all-chasing child" and it will most likely appeal to younger audiences. I gave this one out of 10. <br /> <br /> I dug my old VHS copy of this movie. I don't think it's on DVD.
