It's Saturday, it's raining, and I think every movie should have at least one comment ... so I just watched "The Crime Doctor's Courage" throughout. It's a murder mystery with typical characters of characters, and some of the common suspects - each with their own possible motive for the crime. The story suddenly begins and the viewer is thrown into the plot without any character development or story telling whatsoever. I don't think it's too surprising for a B-movie of this period. There are also a few moments that seem to be before World War II, but perhaps it is due to the author's background in radio programs. <br /> <br /> The "crime doctor" is the sleuth who is visiting California for some R&R of his psychiatric practice on the east coast. He hooked up with a riddle writer friend with whom it was implied, for one or more former mystery-free hijackers. The author sometimes fills the role of sidekick in our sleuth (AKA Dr. Watson), and occasionally it also highlights a bit of comic relief (kind of). There is also a somewhat simple, but not a bumbling, police chief who is sometimes aggravated by the assassination. And then there's the mysterious Braggas, a brother and sister who is dance artists at a nightclub. The dance is kind of an interpretive dance that is one of those moments that feels more like the 30's than the 40's. Although the storyline is in California, the Braggas seems to be living in a castle! <br /> <br /> There was one plot element that could keep me entertained, but I won't reveal it anymore because I always enjoy more movies when the story is discovered, rather than known in advance. (Though I can think of many, many, B-films that are higher, and it's hard to say it's one, it's been well spent). I haven't seen any other movies from the "Crime Doctor" series, so I can't make any comparisons.
