The concept is excellent. The performance is the overall quality of the ABC network. <br /> <br /> Apart from Peter Jones, the rest of the panel appears to be marketing executives. rather than real entrepreneurs. <br /> <br /> When I realized Peter Jones was with Simon Cowell, my first thoughts were to take America through the balls. But it seems that ABC has taken the concept together and destroyed it. <br /> <br /> I was an absolute addict of the Dragons Den in the UK and was interested to see Peter Jones manipulating the concept that originated in Japan and developing his own show for the statements. The result is not inspiring or informative. <br /> <br /> If you have a drama in your life, do you have a choice now? Jerry Springer or the American Inventor To sum it up: a struggling musician who sells to a media magul. <br /> <br /> Idea: Get Me! And I will produce a show that earns the title
