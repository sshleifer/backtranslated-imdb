Okay, so one night and some friends and I decided to be stoned and watch a movie. Unfortunately for us, we chose Ernest Goes to Africa. "I've never laughed so hard in my whole life. This movie is very bad. I literally put better movies than "Ernest Goes to Africa." (I poop movies) <br /> <br /> The highlight of this movie, at least for me, was the opening sequence, when Ernest made silly faces. When they showed him with a head on the size of a peanut, I lost it. Maybe I found it so funny, because at that stage I was the highest. Maybe you're right. <br /> <br /> If I had to guess what George W. Bush's favorite movie is, I would guess "Ernest Goes to Africa." "Never before have I seen a movie rely more on the stereotypes of color people in 1950. There were times when words escaped me and I just stared in awe. <br /> <br /> While watching, can't I help but is this movie for kids? Do literate adults really do that? How could there be a whole franchise of Ernest movies? Is it really my life? Is it really? <br /> <br /> I hated this movie.
