When I was young, I had to get up early on Saturday morning not to watch cartoons, but to switch on the local channel for what is called the Kung Fu Theater. It wasn't as if these films were works of art. It was not as if these films had all come from China, Japan, Korea, or any other country; if the story had to do with the fight? whether it's swordplay or fisticuffs ?? And if the fighting wasn't much of anything in any American gym class, it was good enough. It wasn't as if they were actually very good. They were just fantastic action lashes with incredible dramatic music where the hero sowed his revenge over a whole lot of liars, and then the credits would roll. <br /> <br /> "Sword in the Moon" is much like these movies from my youth, probably a bit of a thematic setback, given a welcome twist by making the characters enough to make it harder to to tell the bad guys the good. <br /> <br /> Yun (Cho Jae Hyun) is known throughout the kingdom as the human butcher. He murdered quickly and mercilessly on behalf of the Chun dynasty, the chief guardian of an emperor who saved his life and the lives of his men in exchange for his service. But an equally ruthless rebellion and his beautiful sidekick appear in the countryside and start killing imperial ministers, and Yun agrees to find and kill these rebels. His job becomes one of personal discoveries when he learns that the two rebels are Choi (a friend of his past) and his previous love, Shi Yeong. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "Sword" doesn't have much to distinguish itself from other action movies. Some beautiful cinematography is almost completely wasted on sharp editing, with portions of the movie being so detached that it's hard to believe that what was necessarily the movie was what everyone meant. While the atmosphere and story tend to be a dark mood, the tone is almost sacrificed to the never-ending parade of flashbacks as each of the main characters is given a healthy story arc. What should have been a quick and easy action movie is cut off by too much personal luggage, and the film suffers as a result. <br /> <br /> I read that this movie Korea's first true decay in the world of house-action action alongside the likes of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." Next time I strongly suggest that the producers keep a little more 'martial' and a little less 'art'. '
