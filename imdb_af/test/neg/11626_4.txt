Mickey Rourke (who once was a well-known movie star) plays Martin Fallon, an IRA terrorist who accidentally generates a school bus, full of children who are so disgusting through his actions, decides to leave the IRA and in London to the to go <br /> <br /> !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> The movie's opening is quite disturbing, as the lives of small children are ending in a fireball. Things like this occurred in the 1970s and 1980s and in the 1990s in Northern Ireland, giving a prayer for death a realistic realism. But as soon as Fallon decides he'll give violence (What? He's a terrorist and he never occurred to innocent passengers?) Realism disappears and cliches and ridiculous plot moves occur. Martin is in service of the London Underworld (don't they have their own hits?) To commit a hit while wearing an IRA uniform (never knew the provos had uniforms) at a cemetery in broad daylight IRA man uses a bomb placed under a car?) Where he is seen by a priest who recognizes him while in the SAS. Hands on who do I think lie? I'm not and we're halfway through and there are still several clichés to come. <br /> <br /> That sounds very stupid and that's what you expect from a novel by Jack Higgins? Everything is clichéd, confronted and stereotypical and the bits that are not, are not bizarre. The critics slaughtered this movie when it came out. They especially said it might have potential if the movie Bob Hoskins had played, Jack Meehan and Alan Bates played. The SAS soldier became a priest and once the critics were right. They also have to note the movie might be less bad than Fallon being played by someone who was able to do an Irish accent. Rourke may be young and macho (O has another movie with an IRA uberhunk), but accent is not his strong point, more than character work. To give you an idea of ​​how disappointingly PRAYER IS FOR THE THING, the director eventually denied what is always a bad sign. <br /> <br /> As a footnote, the original release of PRAYER FOR THE THING in Britain has been delayed for several months due to "The Enniskillen Bombardment". In November 1987, the Provisional IRA exploded a bomb in the Enniskillen center where a memorial parade is held commemorating Britain's war death. Eleven (11) people died and were injured. It was not an accident and no one left the IRA
