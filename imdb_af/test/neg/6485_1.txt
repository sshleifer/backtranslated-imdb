I bought this movie from a 3.99-bin petrol station for one reason: Billy Drago, which is one of my favorite actors. He's terrific and good, but that's where it stops. The movie itself is a dirty cheap, grim terrible attempt at a cruel western one, and does not manage a successful merger of the two genres. The play except Drago's is so bad that I want to put the bank cushions over my ears, the production values ​​are non-existent and the writing, I don't even know where to start. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs unless you are a strong Drago fan like me. <br /> <br /> Terrible, shameful, unforgivable.
