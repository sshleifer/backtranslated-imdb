The actors and actresses on this series are good, but the scripts were absolutely horrible. This family is so dysfunctional that they are not even funny. In fact, the scripts often illustrate how not to be a parent. The scripts are so bad that Homer Simpson looks like a better father than that. <br /> <br /> If you are a parent, you want to see what doesn't happen to your children, this is the perfect guide. I think the garbage that this show feeds us out of words. <br /> <br /> Michael Rapaport saw much better material in his career (including his role in HITCH). They need a strong lead and better, much better scripts than I have seen so far. <br /> <br /> If you think it's generation, my teenager even turned it off because they thought it was terrible.
