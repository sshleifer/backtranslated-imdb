Very simple, these are all syndicated episodes and NOT the original uncut / unsaved NBC episodes. It's NOT the full first season, all the eps edited at 21:00 to agree on syndication, which means jokes are cut, an extra commercial blur is included. All the Harvey Korman intros are not here ... very poorly done! Shame on a series I was waiting for .... booooooooooooooooo! If you're a real Mama fan, don't buy it and go to http://www2.warnerbros.com/web/main/help/whv/customer_service.jsp and send them comments on why we're unhappy. At this butcher works for a classic sitcom!
