How unhappy, but also fortunate, that the two films about pot-holing -The Cave and The Descent - must come at the same time. Unfortunately for the Descent, his release in the United Kingdom on July 7 coincided with the day of London's underground tube / metrorrorist atrocities that killed 60 people and injured hundreds. Not a particularly good night / weekend to watch the cinema, especially to watch a scary-as-sheesh movie about similar women trapped in a deep, dark, claustrophobic underground mirror system. The two movies have virtually the same elements - half a dozen or so characters that have been lost in a previously unexplored mirror system, with no one aware that they are trapped there. Many water, caves, danger ... then eventually some evil human or human beings are determined to prey on them. Where the two are so different is that the cave is unreal, totally amazing, more alien-esquire sci-fi fantasy adventure than horror or drama. The relatively tiny-haired British film (filmed in southern England, though in the Appalachians) is five-star troubling, a heart-beaten-up shock that turns so hard that people start to get out of action early in shock. It beats the girls in any old order - you really have no idea what to expect - certainly not her! The Descent is also naturistly illuminated and makes it increasingly scary, unlike the ridiculously lit cave that looks like a giant magical Christmas soccer club, with cathedral-sized room to room that exudes glorious blue light. who knows where, while the cavers torch solely in the artistic relief of the granite-hijacked heroes (every doll-like as any Team America / Gerry Anderson / Thunderbird creation). Fantastic costs are also borne, but despite this, the incomprehensible scene characters have clearly forgotten to catch any sense of imminent danger, drama or something worthy of a horror movie - it's rigorously rated PG. And in this case, the actors push in exactly the order everyone expects of them - I quickly wrote a list after they were introduced to each character, and only got Piper Perabo out of order. The Cave script is completely by-numbers. Unlike Shakespeare, a room full of chimpanzees will soon write it within a week. Take a typical exchange between the 'good friend' white and black clues that go; "How many times have we been in this situation?" - "too much" (answers Morris Chesnut). I swear, you can hear my suburban London audience on the obvious. The worst thing about The Cave is that there is a clear opening for the sequel - "The Cave 2: Overground" or whatever. Be scared, be very scared ... Or rather than catch the Descent and be really scared, very scared. RR
