Some ugly weirdo who had three families cheated them and they all neglected, built ugly, useless buildings that were left over, and now it is undiminished and crumbling. His bastard half-Jewish boy walks around with interviews with random Jewish senile people we care about and shows his terrible storytelling and writing skills while playing tragic piano music. It lasts for almost two boring hours and is nothing. <br /> <br /> All your level hippie people watching these silly documentaries eat salads and yogurt, thinking all this crap is so important. It's not. Save the whales. Nobody cares.
