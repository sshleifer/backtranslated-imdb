The man who is called to sue for the 1.5 hours wasted from his life I cannot disagree with. The movie started out as a sort of classroom project, and ended up in a dark room. when the girls were completely naked, there appeared lightly everywhere, I know I didn't write the script or say anything to it. But this one is like a bad remake copy of the saw with a bad end. Thinking of a man who actually wrote this story, sick. It's really a shocking movie, can't say, that's not the case. It's just the brutality and the violence that made me sick. It is really frustrating to see a movie without ending up, like a bang in your face. The movie is now done, you can go home. <br /> <br /> After I thought it was supposed to) review <br /> <br /> Conservingly in your face work was good in my opinion - it sucks you in <br /> < Overall The movie is NOT my taste of film. The whiter wanted us to know that these things are happening, and the man wrote his own little fantasy. If you've ever seen the movies? they all had a moment of comfort in holding it. This one? do not. Maybe it's just me, it's too soft, but this movie made me shake, and the story is really short, the sick man is killing girls slowly. But the actors sucked you into this movie every blow every scream you could almost feel. <br /> <br /> And to be honest, I was quick to judge this one, is it a terrible movie? No it's not. this is an exaggerated example of reality, it is a real thing it could get. But do not look at this movie if you expect a great riddle or a real plot, or even a kind of story. The man gets girls in a dark room and dies one by one, that's really it.
