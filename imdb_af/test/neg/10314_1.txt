The DVD edition of this movie is hoping you will buy this movie on Sandra Bullock's name and face. Her photo (years after this movie) is basically the cover art ... and the backside art ... and the inside of the cover art ... the same picture. Her name is prominently displayed on the front page, all 4 sides and the disc itself. She is the first name in the list of stars. Her biography is printed in this case. This movie has to turn around her character, right? WRONG! It's her first movie and she plays a small role. After watching the movie, each role looks like a small role. The character dog actually shows some personality. Less than an hour after watching it, I don't even remember the names of many characters. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if I've looked at it a few times, I could actually figure out the plot, but I don't think it'll be worth it. <br /> <br /> Wait, I just remember a funny bit! Shoot-up video fans will get a kick from the Doom cam. Looks like a first person shooter game. Hands and gun pointing out the camera. <br /> <br /> I'm generally not a film critic, but it can be the worst movie I've ever seen. I expected some silhouettes to run over the screen, sit down and start making it. <br /> <br /> I'm just glad that the money we spent on it went to charity.
