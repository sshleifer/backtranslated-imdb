Supreme Sanction is a film about a female killer working for the US government. She must kill a famous TV reporter, but save his life if she sees that he has a girl. Because she did not kill him, she became the next target of her employers. <br /> <br /> The writing isn't good, although I've seen worse B movies. A hit with remorse, the government killed innocent people in the name of terrorism ... What's next? Aliens who save the victim? No, Supreme Sanction will never win any award because of the writing. And the acting is no better, I'm scared. Some better-known actors (Michael Madsen and Kristy Swanson), who clearly had many bills to pay and therefore accepted to play in this movie, along with other actors who may not even know what a camera really looks like Don't do the movie either. <br /> <br /> So why should you watch this movie? Well, if you have nothing better to do, but to watch an action movie and you are tired of the 10,531th repeat of Mc Gyver or the A team, then it may be the movie you want to see. Otherwise, you can solve it better. I give it a 3/10.
