Eugene O'Neill is argued by some as America's leading playwright, but for things like The Iceman Cometh, The Long Day's Journey Into Night, The Emperor Jones. Strange Interlude was a piece of experiments in which he faced the characters on stage watching the audience and saying what they really thought and then talking to. It was a nine hour production with a dinner on Broadway, so you can safely assume that a lot has been sacrificed here. <br /> <br /> For the screen, the voice over thoughts is used for all characters. This is probably a technique that is better suited to the screen. Mr Laurence Olivier did very well in his version of Hamlet. But Bill Shakespeare gave Olivier a much better story than O'Neill gave his players in this case. <br /> <br /> Players like Clark Gable, Norma Shearer, Ralph Morgan, May Robson, etc. Is much more animated in most of their movies than in Strange Interlude. The story takes place over a period of 20 years. Norma Shearer is a young woman whose intention in World War I was murdered. She starts playing a bit, though the part is not shown in this version. She announced the knowledge of Alexander Kirkland and his friend, Clark Gable. She also has a perennial robber, Ralph Morgan, a friend of her father's Henry B. Walthall. <br /> <br /> She married Kirkland, but then became his mother, Ms. Robson, warned and showed that madness gallops in that family to quote another literary work. Since Kirkland wants children and Shearer and Robson to think that Kirkland's train will slip the track if it doesn't get one, Gable is being recruited for breeding purposes. Of course you can see all the complications it can cause and O'Neill explores them all. <br /> <br /> Gable is so horribly disappointed in O'Neill production, but he was an emerging player at MGM and did what they told him. Shearer does what she can to lift a very dry story, but his body initially defeats. The best thing about the movie is perhaps Robson who bit a bit in her dialogue. <br /> <br /> In 1928-1929, Strange Interlude played for 426 performances on Broadway and Glenn Anders and Lynn Fontanne died in the Gable and Shearer parts. Perhaps no one really could have saved the movie, because Groucho Marx had put their folders in Animal Crackers two years earlier. After I saw what he did, I didn't think the movie was going to take it too seriously. <br /> <br /> And since O'Neill's not the best, I couldn't.
