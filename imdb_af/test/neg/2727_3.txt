These are times like this that I really wish I was a more avid reader of Clive Barker's literary repertoire, as very few things feel worse than not fully understanding a movie of this amazing "visual" caliber. Based on the novel "Cabal", the story of "Nightbreed" involves a behemotic amount of lazy and bizarre creatures and institutions in an underground society of demonic ghouls. An ordinary man is linked to the strange world, called Midian, by his dreams and his psychiatrist forces him to believe he is responsible for a series of gruesome murders on families in recent months .... To be this truth, he returns to Midian - under a rural cemetery - where he is reluctantly accepted. However, the shrink is right on Homeboy's cure with a deadly scheme to let the Nightbreeds community out ... <br /> <br /> To love so much of this movie, I was very much in the long run. Unfortunately, I didn't read the story so much, and Barker's fantasy world and its purpose and all these monsters were terribly confusing and the point of departure was painfully uneven. I understand how the final cut was cut in hell and even the Barker show's moderate aversion to the overall product, but I just didn't get it. Even if it's important to read the story, I feel that it should at least be translated on film so it's still understandable to those who don't know the literature. If "Cabal" is as complicated as this movie, if Barker really has a dead concept. I can't help but feel bored after a while, especially if things start to get ridiculous (somewhere around the prison I realized how bored I was) - like a police department that fears fearlessly against the Midian war as it happens every week. ! No one seems to think the idea of ​​immortal monsters is a bit ... strange. I like the visual effects and all the crazy things that happened in Midian, especially that hake lady and that big head of SOB ... Definitely an epic movie when considering the massive amount of effects and convincingly morbid décor. David Cronenberg fills his position well if the loony shrinks with his cool zippered potato bag mask, but we all want him to do the camera afterwards to save this hope ... <br /> <br /> So, if you have Clive Barker material and fully understand exactly what Midian is, why do they show creatures during the opening title series (horrible idea!), and why are these creatures there and how is a punk child a telekinetic link? to do, you should choose "Night Break". I'll be looking for one of those days for "Cabal" and hopefully get perspective. Or maybe I'll just forget about this travesty ... Until then, it's a poorly constructed and pretty boring movie trick. Instead of "Hellraiser".
