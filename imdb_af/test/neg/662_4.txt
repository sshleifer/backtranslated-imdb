I had no idea this movie was produced by "WWE". Wrestling is lame enough. Why did they have to further ground their name by making a movie as it was? I found it a complete disappointment. If I was aware, this movie was as stupid as it was, if I stayed at home and did something more entertaining. Certainly, I give them the credit of the cool effects; but the killer did not look as frightening as he could have been. He lacked a number of things. But I'll let you show it to yourself. The plot was a good idea, but could be done in a much better way. Perhaps WWE will remain at its moronic wrestling in the future and stay out of the film industry.
