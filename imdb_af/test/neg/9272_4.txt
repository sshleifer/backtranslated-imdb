Story of an ex-Navy Seal now a martial medical officer assigned to a state-owned Russian sub with a nurse. It is a call to answer help that is completed by a dying member of the original crew. The sub is dominated by terrorists who are bent on destruction. So we see the duo trying to get control back. And it happens with the fear that the US naval forces should release everything about the terrorist sub to prevent it from starting its arsenal. Be wary of the early explicit sexual scene in the first quarter of the movie. A few inexplicable scenes to the end. See it when you have the time. Nothing to miss, even if you run the show while you go, get yourself a cup of coffee: move slowly.
