Now, here's the thing. For this movie to work, you must accept the following: A murdered woman is alive again at the end of the movie, a detective stops asking the dead woman's fianc√© because a newspaper reporter has asked him Nie, and the same reporter, beaten by a shiny blonde taken up in the nightmare for suspicious behavior, blow to marry her in exchange for the judge who let go of the hook. Do you follow me on this? I can't tell you how many times I've stopped the picture and repeat recycled screens that just didn't make sense. Eventually, the blonde (Claudia Dell) and the reporter (Richard Hemingway) married, but I have no idea how they came to that decision. In fact, I can't figure out how the filmmaker decided to make this movie. Oh, I think there is some entertainment here for just the sheer nonsense of everything, but it would be nice if even some of the pieces fit. Still, I'm not ready to add this one to my top ten worst list. I think that nightclub scene with the feathered ladies might have saved it. But why was it in the movie? I just don't know.
