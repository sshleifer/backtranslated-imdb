OK, I'll give it a 1, but I'm going to give it a two because I laughed while watching this movie ... First, I can make a much better movie than this one ... in a week ... The special effects made this movie look like a joke. One shouldn't make such movies with terrible special effects, because then people won't take it seriously. The acting and direction was also terrible. The script had lots of plot holes and the whole movie was not credible at all. It must be the worst Indian movie ever. The songs were also bad. The acting was bad and artificial. Must I say more. Don't see this movie unless you're curious to see how bad it is. That's why I watched it. I'm going to the movie and I wanted to see how bad a bad movie can get. Trust me, I watched one of the worst movies in history, if not the worst movie.
