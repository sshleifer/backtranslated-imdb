This movie was so bad, I don't know where to start, apparently not the filmmakers either. It starts with a guy in the mid-thirties to late forty watching television. The news tells of a corn maze that is open for Halloween. He has a "vision" of God knowing and rinsing his children walking in a cornfield maze and somehow linked to this "vision" How do you ask? I do not know, and as I have said, the filmmakers do not. They are simply visions of people's feet. How did he get these "visions"? It's never been explained, we just have to go with it. He goes into the maze to find his two daughters inside, and twice the girls he is looking for, run right next to him, once they jump into him. What does he do? Is he pursuing them? No. He stood there like an idiot calling for them when they were just passing by. Stop the girls? No. They walked off and asked: Was it Dad? Then someone who is dressed as a devil is slapped on the "star" (the daddy character), but he just strikes him in a pathetic battle to find out he is a worker at the haunted house. The police are called and after finding the "star" (which is a very bad term to use) they handcuffed him. They put his hands in front of him, so he can get something to choose the lock, what he does. First, anyone ever arrested knows policemen are putting your hands behind your back and secondly, what does this "average man" look like to pick the lock on handcuffs? Well, he eventually gets away from the police who give up and leave after a 'star' woman diverts the siren into the police car. By the way, it's now night time and all the workers who run the maze looked like the sun had left. Leave a man who attacked one of their workers and two missing children in the maze. Considering it was a slow night that it was their only client, why not. In addition to the police, there are also better things to do. By the way, the "star" by the name of "Walker" we find out of his name, a name in which his wife even calls him. Somehow he knows there's something buried in the middle of the grain field and starts digging. I say "somehow" because I couldn't figure out why he started digging in the first place. He gets a locket, what does that mean? Nothing for anyone who sees it, but for him it is a kind of clue to crime. Someone killed their children in his "vision" and I think that's what he's doing, real detective work. And now he knows there's a killer loose in the corn maze, one he somehow knew was there from the beginning of the movie. That's why he is looking for his girls. Every time we see the killer, or rather the killer's feet, we hear a strange robot sound, like a sci-fi reject toy that changes one's voice to sound mechanically. Why do we hear this sound? Is it anyway related to ... anything? Again, who knows this? Certainly not the filmmakers. The highlight of all the bad acting and bad dialogue was when "Walker" shouted "Hey you, Mr Bad Man ... I'm going to get you." Once again, his wife is attacked by the "Bad Man" at the entrance to the corn maze, which, as I mentioned before, is strange, is empty of any employees or policemen. The "Bad Man" calls "Walker" on his cellphone to tell him he is planning to kill his wife and children as well as him. "Walker" can only answer with "Hey. HEY!" before he dropped his phone and ran away. With no one on the other hand talking, the killer also drops his cellphone, pulls the woman a few feet and leaves her alone for the rest of the movie, and loses the first opportunity to hold on to his treatments. If this script is not written by a child, I will be surprised. It wasn't. It is written, directed and produced by the same man. And not only that, he also did so much of the crappy camera work, where we run random shots of feet through the muddy maze and meaningless shots of the wheat field, wasting 90% of the movie time. In the end, "Walker" uses the cuffs to cuff the "Bad Man", which also seems to know how to choose locks with the same metal object "Walker" chose. Apparently, there are many small metal objects that are just around this lawn. But after the killer insists, he will still kill the children. "Walker" kills the "Bad Man" and everything is right with the world. In fact, it makes "Walker" a killer, killing a man who "suspected" killed his own daughters and trying to kill his death. He knows this, not because of evidence, but because of his visions. He never found a body, no one else knows this man was even in the maze. And the lock? He gives it back to the ghost of the two dead girls. No proof. So he kills a man without tangible reason. I can't imagine what the filmmakers think of this one. It had to be a way to cover a misappropriation of funds for the production company. I'd rather see the Blair Witch Project five times than see this movie again. The actors must be ashamed. The director / producer / writer / cameraman must also be ashamed. In fact, the entire production company must be ashamed. If there is someone related to this movie, please reply. What did you think?
