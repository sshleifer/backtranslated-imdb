In the early 1990s, "Step-by-Step" came as a boring combination of the ultra-cheesy "Full House" and the long-lost loopy classic hit "The Brady Bunch". The differences between "Step-by-Step" and the two aforementioned performances were, of course, better written, excellent comic timing in almost all actors, and much more difficult situations that were not so sugar-coated, as they are very popular. predecessors. Admittedly, even with the great enhancements in the show's basic dynamics and even though it wasn't really spectacular, it wasn't really as memorable in the long line of stingy family programming! It was just a much better time amplifier, which you can say, compared to the sex-like migraine-invading Full House, which happened to run neck-and-neck with "Step-by-Step" overall popularity. . The show, which, of course, is syndicated, is definitely suitable for family fees, but be sure not to expect much when you see it.
