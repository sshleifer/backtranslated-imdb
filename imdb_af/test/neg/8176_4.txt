It may not be the worst movie ever to win the best picture, but it is up there. Well, with the second thought, it's probably the worst movie ever to win the best picture. Yet you will expect it to be worth while while filming. This is actually, but also doubtful. The film contains almost no depth and is just "fun" for "fun" if you want to call it. Initially it is very interesting, but everything seems to be exaggerating at so many levels. <br /> <br /> The acting wasn't spectacular to watch, but Charlton Heston was interesting to see in his first lead. I found many of the characters as the scene of the movie annoying after a while. Who I did a lot was James Stewart as the philosophical clown. He saved me the movie because he gave it a much needed extra layer. Unfortunately, there was not much left to Stewart. <br /> <br /> Directing the highly respected Cecil DeMille was not for me. I sometimes got the movie and his use of Betty Hutton was a mistake. The appearance of the movie was very good at times, but it did not generate that magical feeling that classic should have. The writing was actually pretty good considering the level of the movie. <br /> <br /> Of these movies, the term "Hollywood Trash" came. There is no depth, no valid attempt to draw emotions from the audience and just no artistic value for the film. Then of course the many holes in the plot throughout. This movie was consistently annoying and frustrating. I even felt through this movie that much of what I watched was not just inaccurate depiction of the circus life, but rather the opposite of what it really is. Why this best picture is beyond me, but it's not like the first or last time the Oscars made a mistake.
