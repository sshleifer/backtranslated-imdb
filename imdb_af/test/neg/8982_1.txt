This movie was nothing like the book. <br /> <br /> Everything is mixed or changed. Most of the movie was not even in the book. <br /> <br /> This movie should never have been seen. It was a big disappointment to me when I enjoyed the book so much and watched this movie spoil the whole thing. <br /> <br /> I would never recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Nora Roberts or JD Robb. <br /> <br /> Honestly this movie is not worth checking out how the book really is.
