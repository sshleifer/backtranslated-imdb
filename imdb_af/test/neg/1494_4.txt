An annoying group of ex-students from the Monte Alto International High School decide to spend an evening in the now desolate institution where a mystery killer is called the watchman by horror legend Paul Naschy, who killed them one by one. "School killer" contains some references to such teenage classroom crimes such as "Scream" or "Friday the 13th". The climate change ends up looking like a so-called "The Sixth Sense". The uncertainty about whether the murderous person is alive or dead gives a little light interest, but the characters are one-dimensional and the endless screens of the dark school corridors have really come to my mind. The presence of charismatic Paul Naschy almost hits this clich√© leaf. There are also some decent gores on the screen, including a wonderful bloody abstinence. It is nice to see Manuela Velasco of "Rec" fame in a small role.4 out of 10.
