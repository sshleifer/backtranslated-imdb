I will admit that when I started watching this movie, it held me that forced me to conclude it. Quite possibly it was a latent voyeuristic tendency in me that wanted to see our hero get it with his victim, or perhaps fascination that they had received funding to distribute, distribute and show this movie that was looking for merit or perhaps some bizarre wish-fulfillment fantasy that there may be a point at the end of all the pain. But not so lucky. <br /> <br /> So you are warned not even to look at it first, so the same doesn't happen to you. There is nothing worth wasting your hour and a half here. <br /> <br /> The first person's writer and schtick on Fabian's "quest" to fertilize Falkland women is even more than a sophomoric (maybe Freshman - Freshman High School, that is) film student project than you might think. The effect ends with cutting off both locals (which, apart from the two professionals, are actually real people), as well as engaging in a rather disgusting sexual politics (whether it is literal or symbolic) not, it is useless and sexist). <br /> <br /> The reason I finally watched it all is the same reason that one starts picking with a scab, there is an irresistible fascination to do so until it's completely down, even when you know it is bad for you. You just want to see what happens. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's quite dishonest filming, because it seems to have no moral center, no explanation of the local political situation or anywhere in the type. of political-sexual-personal film universe a la Goddard. In short, it has nothing to say and spend as long as it does. Smug will be the one-word tagline. <br /> <br /> I suggest that the filmmakers rent a few times, a Watch for Guffman, even "Blair Witch Project" if they want to follow the sktick with a little more style and a little more true emotion. Or at least entertainment value.
