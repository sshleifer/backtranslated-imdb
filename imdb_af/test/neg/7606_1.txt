I made the mistake of watching the "Dark Star" (1974) late one night many years ago. It was one of the stupidest movies I ever watched: <br /> <br /> 1. Bad acting. <br /> <br /> 2. Bad writing. <br /> <br /> 3. Scientifically stupid plan. (Destroying an entire planet because its orbit is unstable or just making things worse: instead of having one large, easily avoidable object, you have thousands of smaller but equally deadly and harder objects to find.) <br /> <br /> 4. Totally unrealistic characters. A painted beach ball as a space stranger? The authors should have done too much drug. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, the majority of actors in Dark Star never did anything else. Of those who did something else, the majority never returned to Dark Star. Therefore, with Dark Star on the play of the play, a star star was your scene!
