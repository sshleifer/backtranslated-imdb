I am from Australia and have respectfully watched the extraordinary culture of rugby union in New Zealand. I can fully appreciate the comments of Kiwis on this movie. It was a total insult to a race of people and their beloved sport. <br /> <br /> Whoever was involved in making this horrific movie should be made to apologize formally to anyone who had the accident to view it. Note: people do not kneel and cry while slowly reciting the Hakka. What a pitiful scene it was. <br /> <br /> Are we supposed to feel a kind of sympathy for this idiot that his girlfriend nearly killed, refusing to listen to any advice from anyone with half a brain, then apparently the light? What a very unsuitable character (with the visits to children's hospitals doing nothing to leave his despicable personality). <br /> <br /> And why do people even make a movie about Americans playing rugby? They hardly even play in the sport on the world stage, not so much as even trying to make a movie about it (yes, rugby is a 'world sport', other than gridiron and baseball)?
