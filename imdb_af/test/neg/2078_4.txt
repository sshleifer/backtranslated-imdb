Before you start to see if this movie is worth your time or not, I have to tell you that I've never seen another adaptation of Carmen. So if you are looking for an overview of how it falls, it can't be used much. for you. <br /> <br /> The only time I got Carmen was on the car stereo while I was on a family holiday through Spain when I was a teenager. I didn't pay much attention to it because I didn't have opera at the time and I didn't know better. The story has been around for 150 years or so. I feel I have missed out on seeing this movie? Yes, mainly because of the plot, but also because all the actresses played by Carmen, like Paz Vega, I would love to have all the adjustments in my DVD collection. <br /> <br /> Directed by Vicente Aranda (who also reformed the story with Joaquim Jordà), the story is told by the original author Prosper Mériée, a French writer who made his way through the 19th century from Spain. He comes across José (Leonardo Sbaraglia), a criminal soldier and one of many men who fall in love with Carmen (Paz Vega), a sultry, sexy, bedazzling gypsy woman who has the devil's mouth, toro 'and recklessly. people lead to their punishment. The moment she met José, she was attracted to his perpetual behavior. But she chops him, rolls it in and lets him go, many times. Up until one day, José is looking for murder. Carmen persuades him to join her band of gypsies. They seem to settle down, she fell in love with him, but she meets the beautiful Escamillo, the warrior. Can José keep an eye on his jealousy or destroy him? <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful, seductive story, something that looks, almost a Shakespearian or Ovid plot, with the depictions of tremendous passion and emotion that we can make or break and transform into characters to do. . It's poetic, fiery, and above all, endty. I stopped hanging out, I didn't know how it was going to turn. I always hoped that José Carmen's dirty little ways could change. I will not tell you whether he succeeds or not. <br /> <br /> The above summary is what I took away from the movie, but I wasn't impressed by the movie itself. Only after I looked at it did I dig a little deeper into the story and I realized how much of a missed opportunity Aranda made to tell Mérimée's classic. It was a shallow, finite period drama blunder, which saw that Paz Vega spent much of the time partially or completely naked (not that I am particularly complaining about this!). <br /> <br /> First of all, the acting was poor. I was not impressed by Sbaraglia as José. I'm not sure if he was a bad actor, or José was a bad character, I didn't read the book. He is supposed to be a man who goes to Carmen with a burning desire, but he spends a lot of time confused, jealous and a little dull. Paz Vega was slightly better than Carmen. I was convinced of her hardened, evil character, although I saw more convincing performances in her role in other films, such as Zapping and Lucia and El Sexo. She looked too good to play a gypsy woman (not that I got many Andalusian gypsy women), so somehow the role didn't really suit her. The other actors in the film were also not nice. They wanted to do everything half-heartedly. The story is passionate, emotional ?? they looked half-arsed, as if they couldn't wait to put on the tight 19th-century costumes they wore. <br /> <br /> However, the costumes were impressed by - one of the film's release factors. I like the Spanish culture, I like the soldiers' uniforms, the top hats and the women's Flamenco dresses. They have the time well equipped. I can really say that. Sorry, back to the criticism. <br /> <br /> The writing, as mentioned above, was reconstituted together by Vicente Aranda and Joaquim Jordà, and done so badly that it turned Mériée into his grave. It was boring. It didn't take advantage of José's intense passion for Carmen (or maybe it was just the play). There were cute lines on something, Satan and devil conotations all over the millions of swear words. I know the Spanish is partly for the strange swear word, but the film was in a literal line with the pit, "whore." Perhaps it was realistic in the poverty-stricken Seville in the 19th century, but the story itself didn't need it. <br /> <br /> The editing and camera work was boring and ordinary. There was only one bit I actually liked, and that was when the camera followed a fly-close in the middle of the sky, which fell on Carmen's face. It was good. But the rest? Boring. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is sad to see such a great story spilling with unconvincing acting and directing. If you are a literary teacher, let your class anyway look at this adjustment to get an idea of ​​the story. But only the male half of the class will pay any interest in the movie, thanks to Paz Vega. Otherwise, stick to the opera version (although I hate musical). I give this movie 4, just because I love the storyline! And Paz Vega!
