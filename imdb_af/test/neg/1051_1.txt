I had a kick from Reynolds who said to his lawyer, "Look, I've done a lot of things in my life, but I never killed anyone." Of course, he forgot about his career shifting hill after starting silly movies like "Cannonball Run". Physical Evidence was originally supposed to be a sequel to 'The Jagged Edge' that Glen Close rejected. The verdict is in, avoid physical evidence.
