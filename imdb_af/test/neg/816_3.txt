I'm a Boorman fan, but it's probably his least successful movie. Comedy has never been his strong suit, and here are his attempts to make a screw ball. Yet it is Boorman's eye for talent to see: this is one of Uma Thurman's first lead roles, and as always, she is wonderful to watch. (On a sad note, Boorman wrote the script with his daughter, Telsche, who died a few years ago.)
