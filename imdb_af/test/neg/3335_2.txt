First, I don't see how the movie is on a "best" list or how it won awards. Compared to La Pianiste, which is also on a "best" list, La Pianiste is gold. This movie lacks so many things on so many different levels, but I can't quite explain why I liked it so much. The main actor was annoying, I felt like I never knew what was going on, and I was BORN !! Although it was supposed to be a life change that Pierre started, I wanted to end it as soon as possible. Why should it be his sister and cousin? Ugh. And why did Thibault have meaning? He just became bipolar, mean. And also, was it me or did I miss the whole purpose of what that guy was in black? Who were all the people playing music in the big cellar of the big warehouse? Why do they have all those strange equipment and guns and all the extra rooms for people to live in? I mean in earnest, but is there a lot of incest in French culture? European culture? I learned 5 years of culture and I didn't hear anything about it!
