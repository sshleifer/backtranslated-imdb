Okay, I can almost put any movie, and I tend to get a real kick from Sci Fi Originals, but there was a big mistake in this movie that caused me to turn it off for half an hour. <Br /> <br /> After serving in the US Army, there are some expectations in a movie that includes the army. At least some attention to proper military rank, uniform and terminology is needed if you expect a viewer to enjoy the experience. "Bats: Human Harvest" carried characters rank that got the wrong direction on the shot, and later in the movie the time was listed as 11:00, but it was full of dark outside. Even if the writing is done perfectly, and the dialogue is spectacular and the acting Oscar-worthy, if the people who make the movie do not care enough for the movie to even show the right way of military times, why anyone should bother trying to see it?
