I first announced a poster that placed this film on a street in Helsinki, Finland, in June 2000 from a street. What prompted me was that all readers advise the movie, although French, "Banned in France". When I returned to New York, I discovered that one of the movie theaters in the City was the movie, and so (with my Finnish fiancee) decided to see what all the fuss came from. Son, we ever did. <br /> <br /> Read the comments here, and the reviews I knew were violent and sexually explicit. Not necessarily offended by either of these conditions, I went with an open mind to see what disturbed the sensitivity of our Gallic cousins. Presumably, like someone reading it, the story will be taken up by two women who start a crime and murder in France (the movie has English subtitles). The deal with Thelma and Louise, however, ends with that; the sex is unusually graphical (and in abundant supply) as well as the violence (very blunt to death, and lots of blood and other organic matter splashes on dot impact). <br /> <br /> At the intellectual level, one can make the film's essence the relationship between sex and violence (as is the only sex these women know is: one is a small one prostitute, and others have earned money by periodically importing pornographic films, and when they prevail over their sexual situations during crime and murder, they respond only to the same violence and cruelty they know and understand themselves However, it is important to note that the victims of their rampage are not just creepy people who are interested in creepy sex (of which there are several), but innocent passers-by, for example, a woman at an ATM. <br /> I don't really understand why the repeated "porn movie" shots have everything needed (except to portray physical contact as cruel, unhindered and uncovered) and the relentless gore after the first couple violent spasms become quite boring. <br /> <br /> It is a rough and rough film, but in fairness it is about dealing with coarse and coarse people and unpleasant conditions. From a point of view, the lives of the French underclass are explored, and this is pretty grim; a travel report for France, it is certainly not - maybe that's why the French banned it. <br /> <br />
