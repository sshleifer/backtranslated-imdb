Perhaps this movie is actually meant to be satire like 'airplane', but it failed so much as it failed to be a thriller. I don't understand why they couldn't pay a real pilot a few hundred dollars for some technical advice. Hell, I would've done it for free! This magical airplane dropped from a 757 to 767 to 747 in an hour, and the power trees worked backwards. And the dialogue sounds as if it came from the back of a child's 'phone' game, where everyone spoke different languages. I actually returned the TIVO and looked a second time to see if it really was as bad as I thought. It was.
