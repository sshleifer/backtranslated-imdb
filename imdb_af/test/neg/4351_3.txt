An unfortunate inferior precursor of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf", this movie pulls on and off, occasionally revives your interest just to put you through more self-indulgent mapping and obvious but overly plotting points. <br /> <br /> It may list like 111 minutes, but feel like three hours of painfully wasted time.
