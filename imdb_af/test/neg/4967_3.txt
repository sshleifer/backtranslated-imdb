All the boys apparently sexually raised by Mandy Lane. All the girls are jealous of Mandy Lane. But nothing seems to get out of it, and this viewer wonders why? Mandy is beautiful and a magnet for every boy she meets, but we never know Mandy or any of the characters in the movie. Mandy accepts an invitation from her student partners to go to a secluded farm. Three boys and three girls drink and drugs. In the film, the teenagers drink like water and drink drugs to experience a psychedelic journey. And there is absolutely no sex. Meanwhile, the teens disappear one by one. But the others are all drunk and tall. No one, including those watching the movie, cares or is not involved at all. No one, including the audience, seems to be giving a damn. Emmet, a fellow student, is the fan of the whole event. There is a security guard, Garth (dashingly and handsome played by Anson Mount), who protects and protects the farm. Halfway through the film, the killer is revealed, the tension suddenly being released as the air exits from a balloon. The events are completely predictable, and the movie just goes completely apart. Mandy meets her game, but we never know why - and at the end of the movie there is no sex yet. Mandy hypnotize the boys, or does she just carry all the boys and girls to their deaths? This absolutely confused viewer can only conclude that Mandy wants to get rid of the female and male competition - by killing the manipulative girls and the nasty boys. Is Mandy Worth It? The director (Jonathan Levine) seems to think so, but not this viewer. The skilled cinematographer (Darren Genet) offers some beautiful images, but in reality she looks focused on Garth, which is quite the stud. Not all boys love Mandy or do they? If you're bored enough to find out how this movie excels, my advice is to sleep halfway through the movie until you see the bulging cross of Mandy and Garth. But don't wait for anything to happen. Yes, you guessed it. Mandy remains a virgin, and there is still no sex. I rank this movie a 3 out of 10, but not because of Mandy. Why? Because all of Garth's girls love, and all voyeuristic eyes look like Garth in a compromise position. But unfortunately, girls and boys, this movie never looks like a disappointing and incomplete sexual fantasy. Mandy goes to a secluded farm, and nothing sexual ever happens. The audience is led to horror on a farm - and can't help but wonder why?
