It's a sneak peek. I'm shocked to see it even in the IMDb library. And, Bill, Julia, and all the other "professional" actors involved must be ashamed to be part of this sick movie. I thought I would see a somewhat classic horror movie with a creative ending that authors find out ... which usually doesn't make sense when writing a horror movie, but as a viewer we try to rationalize and understand . This end was not creative. It was sick and has all the remarks of a sniff. I am shocked that it has been edited to this end and more shocked that it will be distributed by the end of June 2009. It should not be displayed in a theater. It's harmful to innocent thoughts on many levels .... look at the movie, the end, and you'll understand this statement. Plus, included in the plot is a lovely little girl "not yet 9", says her character. She is not in the snuff, but she is an integral part of the movie. Why do directors feel that they have to shock with a sick movie to get recognition? The director is in the wrong line of work if she thinks it's an art movie.
