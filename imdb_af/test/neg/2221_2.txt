Mild entertaining and self-conscious cheesy - but what can this be? Cushing in one of his poorest roles, and he often sounds called. McClure is just too Cheezy to be believed, but who can blame him in the wilderness of this movie, whose plot of ancient dinosaur birds ruling people has 19th-century setback "period charm" but not enough and unfortunately the writing wears racist connotations of the literary genre in films. Nice effort by the actors, but a poor pregnant production.
