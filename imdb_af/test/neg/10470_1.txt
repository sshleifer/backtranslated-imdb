Bone Eater is in a small desert town in Alabama, where property developer Dick Krantz (Jim Storm) is building a large resort. Late one night, three of his workers, Riley (Timothy Starks), Hansen (Adrian Alvarado) and Miller (Paul Rae) are digging foundations in the desert when they don't see what looks like a tomahawk bull. Unfortunately, they have an ancient Native American demon called the bone ether coming together and killing them. Local Sheriff Steve Evans (Bruce Boxleitner) soon breathed Krantz's neck, as the construction of his resort stopped. Sheriff Evans also has to deal with the lower demon, as it kills someone who is overwhelmed ... <br /> <br /> You know I consider myself a pretty big fan of the horror and sci-fi genre. I definitely don't think my opinion is worth more than anyone else (unlike many on the IMDb ...), but please believe me when I say that Bone Eater is the worst Sci-Fi Channel 'Creature Feature' I ever seen and it's against some damn strong competition. As a horror and sci-fi fan, there are two names that are sent in the role of a movie, awaiting how bad it will be. The names are Jesus. I have no talent. Franco who has nothing to do with Bone Eater & Jim Wynorski regulating the absolute disaster that Bone Eater is. In fact, Bone Eater is so bad, Wynorski hid under the pseudonym Bob Robertson. When a director hides as badly as Wynorski under a pseudonym, you know the movie should be bad. Where do I even start? Bone Eater is simply the worst movie I've seen this year. It's bad, the story is terrible. The script is sloppy. (At one point, Sheriff Evans says Kia meets him at the hospital, but when they met there later, he surprised and said, "What are you doing here?" At one point, the sheriff Evans says triumphantly that we are in the twentieth century and that old native american demons are nonsense, although we are actually in the twenty-first century, there is a role when a woman tells in flashback the story where three men wake up and make the bones eater they died, but since it killed all three of them, how did anyone else know that it should be passed in the legend?) and sometimes it becomes more than a little embarrassing. The character is terrible clich√©s, the small town of Sheriff who saves the day, engaging his daughter who gives some personal motivation. As for the Native Americans, there is an old wise man, a young, warm head who hates 'white man' and a young woman who is the voice of reason between the two who have names like Stormwolk and Black Hawk. The movie is so boring as hell, nothing happens, the story is terrible, it's full of plot holes and decay in any kind of logic, the set pieces are terrible, there is no horror or gore or tension or mystery. Bone Eater is just the kind of movie that will make you lose the will. <br /> <br /> Bone Eater has some of the worst CGI computer effects I've seen for quite a while, from the stiff, stiff moving leg-etherics itself that is just a selection of bones that Magies are held together for a motorcycle that jumps into a huge gap to a horrible CGI truck crashing over the edge of a cliff into a van which is thrown on one side by the bone ether. When the bone ether needs some speed, it causes a large horse to form sand and dust and rides! In principle, it's actually quite a neat idea, but it looks terrible and the screens even have a cheesy cowboy music on the soundtrack! There is an endless scene at the end when Sheriff Evans cuts his own arm (why?) And it bleeds, but apart from that there is not a single drop of blood in the thing, when the boneeter kills someone who usually just disappears. in a cloud of dust, boring. The hilarious climatic appearance between Sheriff Evans and the bone ether must be seen to be believed. Sheriff Evans will soon face the tribal paint on his face, while the leg getter drives his dust horse and they have a kind of jousting game that is just bad to describe properly. <br /> <br /> With a so-called budget of about $ 700,000 Bone Eater is filmed in a very easy, forgetful and flat way. There is no sense of style at all. The majority of the movie takes place in bright sunlight and if you watch it on a decent telly, the desert cleaning is almost delicious. There are several veteran-known actors who really keep it busy. Boxleitner plays exactly the same role as in the similar theme, but much better 'Creature Feature' Snakehead Terror (2004), William Katt obviously puts his name on any crap as long as he is paid while the asterisk-man Walter Koenig really desperately should be to appear in this. <br /> <br /> Bone Eater is a really horrible 'Creature Feature', there really isn't much more to say about it. other than managing it well. The worst movie ever to appear on the Sci-Fi channel and what it says is not it?
