The movie is okay. That means I don't regret it! I found the play pure and most of the dialogue was stupid ("oh no, it was my grandmother's bible!"). It's kind of a bad remake of U-turn. A man does not come to a desert city anywhere, meet the wrong people and fall in love with the wrong woman. And because he was involved in something, he thought he could leave him behind. The movie is pretty predictable and there is really nothing new about it. When it's done, you don't really care. Most characters are stereotypes, especially Brian Austin Green !! All in all, just another movie of the states, but enjoyable on Wednesday night. IMDb voice: 4/10
