This is a documentary about homeless women. It was interesting in that it focused on women who are socially involved - with work and lasting friendships - but in situations where they cannot afford housing. <br /> <br /> I found some of the women covered to be interesting, but there was little focus or progress in the story. The direction and editing didn't keep my attention. There were, of course, differences in the stories of these women, but the message was essentially the same and could be said by focusing on some or other of them. <br /> <br /> I made it to the end of the movie, but it was a pretty boring journey.
