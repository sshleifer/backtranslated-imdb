Bloody Birthday is a completely fluttering film from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> I found the play pretty good in the light of the movie's genre and its obvious low budget. I don't know what was going on with cinematography, but it looked horrible. Get over-saturated. Maybe it's a bad transfer to DVD or maybe it always looks like I don't know. <br /> <br /> There is really no reasoning to talk about. There are a few deaths, but no regrets. I won't bother if I am you. The best thing about the DVD was the 15 minute interview with producer Max Rosenberg, who was very amusing and honest. He has nothing to say about director Ed Hunt and admits the movie was a failure, but he wants to make it again because he believes it has a decent plot. However, he died in 2004, so I think it would be someone else to tackle that challenge. With the way things have gone the past few years, it won't surprise me. There is at the cinema at least once a week. It can't be worse than the original one I suppose, but I couldn't care less if it was made again or not.
