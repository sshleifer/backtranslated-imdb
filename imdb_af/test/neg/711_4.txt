OK, it's not nice either, but just because Laurel and Hardy were very good in the past. If this movie has received a total overhaul, with improved picture quality, add new dubbing to the badly-tuned voices and add a nice unobtrusive background music, then this movie will really get its shape. As it is, it does have problems. People don't do it at all for how old the boys look. Quel surprise! They were in their 60's and led a 'life'. But for me they still had a bit of spoilage, and while not even getting near the chicks of their classic feet (I gave it 4), it's worth a watch, simply because it's them. To think differently would be unfair!
