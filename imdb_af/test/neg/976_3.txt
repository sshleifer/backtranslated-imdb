Watch Watchtime I got the impression that the producers had the idea of ​​just sitting Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy for the fact that they had a movie. Other than that, I can't think of a reason to justify the movie's existence. Not that it is not amusing, it certainly is, but the concept is so ridiculous that the laugh is slightly muted. <br /> <br /> The thing that really got me was Eddie Murphy's character. I can't surround my mind with the notion that someone is a police officer as a daily work. When I was working at the New York State Crime Victims Board, I had to deal with all sorts of policemen. They ran between the really dedicated and some real snails, but I can't think of anyone who thought it was just something. I do until I find my career in an area far away. I mean, can you really see Eddie Murphy whether someone else is going through the rigors of the right Police Academy, not the screen version, to just get a day's work? <br /> <br /> Anyway, DeNiro is your basic hard work detective who is on the trail of a big gun dealer. He is sheltered and Murphy is part of his backup. So, what does the showboating Murphy do, he calls a reality-based TV series like COPS to film the action. <br /> <br /> So, DeNiro's bust is blown high into the air, but the display manufacturer gets good footage from Murphy and DeNiro and decides on a new reality-based television series. So these reluctant partners come along and try to work with DeNiro's case with all the TV cameras. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy is a funny man, I loved him in Beverly Hills Cop and in Doctor Doolittle movies, but he's done better than Showtime and Robert DeNiro definitely. <br /> <br /> I think Murphy wanted a chance to work with DeNiro, and DeNiro had to receive a heavy salary to do this movie.
