This is very much due to the CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS plot. Although very large, it is partly the story of a rich boy being sent as a crew member on board a cargo ship and a man in the process. Moran of the title is a young young woman who is also owned by a father of her father. When the cargo burns, she and crew are evacuated to our son's ship. However, the captain smuggled and his intentions are not honorable where Moran is concerned. The inevitable consequence - our son falls to the male Moran and she to him. Eventually, the evil is muted and the loved ones unite. Some interesting dialogue points out that Moran does not belong to anyone - "and no woman." (A cut to Sappho here). Dorothy Dalton is appropriately sexless as Moran and not too attractive. Valentino does well in a romantic, action role. His sexy body and body are beneficial and the role is quite masculine. He is very attractive. It's not a good movie, but it passes the time. What it really shows is Valentino's beauty and sexuality.
