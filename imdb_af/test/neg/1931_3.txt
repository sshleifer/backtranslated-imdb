The story is derived from "King Lear"; The area is a farm in Iowa. Here's a test for this kind of thing: if you ask yourself, "Why did it do that?" And the answer is, "because that's what happened in King Lear," you know the movie failed. Well, that's what happens here. The father figure in this story does not live his own life, he mimics a fictional one. But there is more wrong with the movie than this. <br /> <br /> Jocelyn Moorhouse is ambitious - much more ambitious than I think she realizes. She tries to take the King Lear story and completely change the environment. This is a task in itself. The likely consequence is that the transplanted story will die, and no one can really figure out why (although there are enough successful transplants, such as "West Side Story", to make it worth it). But she is also trying a revisionist resignation. In the version of King Lear she wants to create, Reagan and Goneril give our compassion and Cordelia is a villain. It is also a task in itself. <br /> <br /> Success at any task is difficult; It is impossible to pass both immediately. In fact, to succeed as soon as possible is impossible. If we have to look at the same events from a different moral perspective, the events must be the same events - meaning that the institution cannot be tampered with. If the story has to be transplanted, alive, in another environment, its moral heart must be defeated all the time - meaning that it cannot be tampered with ethically. Moorhouse was bound to fail in not only one, but in both her efforts. And so she did. ... Of course, it is possible to try both tasks, not to succeed in both tasks, but by being hit a bit, it becomes an artwork that is good for independent reasons. I call it because I haven't read Jane Smiley's novel, which is good for independent reasons for everything I know. But the movie is not. If nothing else was wrong, it would still not be reversed, it was just as thorough, indifferent DULL. The many wheat fields are even more boring than they would be in real life. It doesn't have to be the case, as I can think of the top of my head on four films ("The Wizard of Oz", "North by Northwest", "The Straight Story", "Kikujiro") in which the grain fields are smooth not boring.
