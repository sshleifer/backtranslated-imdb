I've never had an interest in cannibal movies a few months ago. I avoided this genre of movie. <br /> <br /> I recently had to undergo knee surgery and found that I had a lot of time my hands as I couldn't work, so I decided to see almost every horror movie our local video store had to offer . I would have given it a chance. <br /> <br /> Christ was a mistake! I have never seen a movie that is bad in all my years to be a movie addict. It's just a stack that is pasted onto a DVD disc and sold as a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of respect for other horror fans who can turn off their brains long enough to enjoy This crap, They're more brain-dead than I will ever be and it's a bit of a feat! 0/10 and that's nice.
