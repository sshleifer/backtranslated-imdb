This movie was just two nights on ITV1. Dear o dear. Someone actually bought it according to Robert Carlylse. OK, I missed the start. But what I saw was so bad, I thought, no ... I looked embarrassed at the stars in it. Nothing was based on reality, I doubt whether things are progressing as they did in this movie. Everything was poor about this movie. OK, cgi .. but no reality. The entry gave the impression of a stone hanger end. Care, I wasn't impressed. Yes, formulate. Couldn't guess the end. From what I saw, the army had the upper hand, people who did the heroic things were given the time to do their thing, but it wouldn't have been so? It was worse than leaving your brain at the door. It was irritating. As someone else said .. yes, right .. of course, that would have happened ... not !! The credits called Quebec and Canada .. so it was a co-production, missed the relevant third party. I'll have to look back at this site. I'm usually not critical, but it irritated me.
