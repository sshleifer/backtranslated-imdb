This fake documentary is wrong at many points, it is bad, has uninteresting characters, but the biggest problem I have with it is the basic premise. <br /> <br /> This film uses the idea that H.P. Lovecraft traveled to Italy and some of his work is based on true supernatural events he saw. I am willing to go along with the idea that he has traveled to Italy (just for the suspension of unbelievers), but that some of his work is based on reality and that Insmouth exists is total nonsense. <br /> <br /> First of all Lovecraft did not believe in the supernatural faith. In his letters he clearly states that he regarded himself as a mechanical materialist, his samples showing that people were not so special. Another myth used in this movie is that Lovecraft was an occult expert, not all of his subject matter came from the most basic sources. <br /> <br /> So we end up with a movie about people jelling a lot and when we finally see the monster, it's so bad you can't even laugh at it, you just feel pain in your love for horror. <br /> <br /> After saying the movie Frankenstein Lovecraft that he was sorry for Mary Shelley because he felt her work was slaughtered. I feel sorry for Lovecraft.
