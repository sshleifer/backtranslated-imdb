There is no reason to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Why? Many reasons. First, the acting is terrible. There is hardly a line that is not read incorrectly - but it is hardly surprising given the banality, stupidity and repetition of the dialogue that the actors are asked. It was terribly written. One of the most annoying things about the script is that the authors only know one way to make their characters speak to a certain point, and that is to repeat them the main words of the previous character's line. <br /> <br /> "Repeat?" <br /> <br /> "Yes, they repeat it. For the whole movie." <br /> <br /> "The whole movie?" <br /> <br /> "Yes, the whole movie." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In such movies you usually know who the bad guys are and what they follow. (All the good guys who usually have to do is stop the bad guys. Setting up a good "Mwahahaha! With X in my grip I will rule the Universe!" Villain is the first stop in any cheap SF plot ), but in this turkey? - You tell me. <br /> <br /> As I understand, we are "heros" a lot of mass murderers who have been sent on a Dirty Dozen type mission in the past. They are sent by a fascist totalitarian state to prevent some other mass murderers from changing history. The new history does not include the rise of totalitarianism, and a war that kills 30 billion people and leaves Earth a dead planet (we know all this because this movie has one of those handy long-screen scenes just before the action start telling you who is who and what is what this is an indication of who the producers think their target audience will be, it is told as well as appears on the screen - just to save the audience from the tax of their brain. much by reading a lot.) So, who should we root here? I think we are asked to believe that our hero undertakes a kind of journey from totalitarianism to love, peace and understanding to shoot many people. But it does not work as a bow, as we are shown he is a decent man It is right at the start when he tries to save all the civilians on board the rebel station. <br /> <br /> I think the creators were somehow deeper than normal complexity in this movie, but they just ended with an unholy mess with more plot holes and logical inconsistencies than a dozen or so of your average SF movie. <br /> <br /> The opening credits were nice.
