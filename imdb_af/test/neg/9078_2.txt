The males who do men (1984) were one of the few non-gun movies Charlie Bronson made in the 80's. Unlike most of the Cannon films Charlie dies in, this one was not fun or entertaining. Charlie basically tortures and brutalizes people for over an hour and a half. If you thought he was Mr. Emotion before, wait until you see it! <br /> <br /> In this one, Charlie goes to an unnamed Central American country and shows the population that anyone who has messed with Chuck or his people must pay the pipe. This one is not fun. It's not cheesy or camping, just brutal, sadistic and not in a good way. <br /> <br /> I didn't like this one. I have no love for this movie. No recommendations because it is not worth looking at. Maybe if they didn't cut the hell out of it. Look with caution. <br /> <br /> Don't worry.
