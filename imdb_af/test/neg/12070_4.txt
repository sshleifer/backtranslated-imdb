Again, Woody Allen looks completely without any inspiration other than regaining himself. Here we have a cartoon (like Zelig), the structure of the film is a series of anecdotes (Radio Days, Broadway Danny Rose) in the 30s (Zelig, Purple Rose, Bullets on Broadway) about a low life (Deconstructing Harry) who believes he is a genius, relieves him of being a yoke. Given this film and Deconstructing Harry, one wonders whether this is Allen's justification for his own conduct with Mia Farrow's adopted daughter; Yes, I was a while, but I'm a genius, so you must love me. <br /> <br /> Over the past ten years, all produced just two good movies. the fine but overloaded Bullets on Broadway, and the excellent but largely ignored Manhattan Murder Mystery. His other efforts range from small pieces (New York Stories, Mighty Aphrodite) to edgy but experimental (Men and Women), to sheer mischief (Alice, Scenes from a Mall, Shadows and Fog, Celebrity, Deconstructing Harry). His films no longer try to have a narrative bow, and his humor seems to be terribly amusing, not funny. After the deconstruction of Harry I stopped watching his movies in theaters; After Sweet and Lowdown I can't rent anymore.
