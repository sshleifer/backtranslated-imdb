I saw Winnie's Heffalump a few days ago. A fun story based on well-known characters created by A.A.Milne. Although Winnie, Piglet, Tigger and Rabbit are all present in this animated feature, the main character is Roo this time. He is friends with scary Heffalump who is not scary at all and shows everyone that friendship has no boundaries and everyone wants and deserves to be happy. I love this movie and I will love it even more, I was 10 or 15 years younger. Unfortunately, I would like to become a child again to enjoy this Heffalump story much more, but all I have left is a feeling of sadness at the loss of some kind of childhood and innocence that this movie is full of? I was happy to hear Carly Simon sing, Joel McNeely scored well.
