This movie is so stupid that I want $ 2.99 to pay me back! First, this movie starts with a bunch of wood-actor geeks with talent as they are picked up from the street because the "real" actors did not show up because of the laughable writing or they just couldn't get anyone desperate enough. to do this movie! The music in this movie is enough to make you sleep, flute music made for faerie's dance in the desert won't even be good enough for this movie! And the man dressed like Satan looks like he's all dressed in a K-Mart Halloween special costume! There are no dead scenes except some lame scenes. When I saw the terrible killers in those bathrobes with Nosferatu faces, I just laughed! The whole town is supposed to run away once a year! This movie is one of the worst demonic movies I've ever seen. Avoid this one!
