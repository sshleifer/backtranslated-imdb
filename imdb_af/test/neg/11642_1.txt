If you are bad movies for entertaining bad movies, bad acting, bad production, etc. Make Mystery Science Theater 3000 quality .... you'll love Pacific Inferno. Jim Brown will always be remembered as one of the greatest soccer players ever to play the game ... as an actor he will forever be remembered as one of the greatest footballers ever to play the game ... I'm not sure who Rolf Bayer was ... but I hope he was 15 or 16 when he directed it, maybe he was the next Spielberg in the making ... because if he was a grown man regulating it ... " A 15 or 16 year old could have done better .... The base or plot for the movie probably has historical merit and perhaps even truth accurately ... but the real movie can be one of the worst movies made in American movie history is. Waiting for Lee Marvin, William Holden or Charles Bronson to somehow save, except what "face" of this movie is left over. I would have loved the red carpet, black dasgala for the Hollywood opening when this movie was previewing ... if this movie had to watch many viewers and shrink under their breath ... it's on the dime DVD shelves now ... Look for it for entertainment value ... this movie is so bad, it's too good to succeed ...
