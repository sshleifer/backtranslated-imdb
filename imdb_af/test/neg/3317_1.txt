Don't get me wrong, I like to wrap up half-naked chicks. It is part of the pleasure of a Moroccan restaurant, which abandons the belly dancers. But it doesn't make much of a plot. <br /> <br /> My first big problem is the music. I felt that when Ann Rice wrote "The Vampire Lestat", the Cure was more the style of music he would have wanted (though I could be wrong). I know with regard to the current "goth" music might have been a good idea, but they did a horrible job. Lestat was an actor with a pretty good voice. That they chose Jonathan Davis to be his stage voice is heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Second, and someone else said, mixing two very complicated books into one crappy movie is a bad idea. "Lestat" could be a movie in its own right, and a damn good one if it's done right. I don't think honestly, "Queen of the Damned" lends itself well to a movie. Although I would like to see a movie containing a creation story, there is too much, how to say, "unwillingness" in the book, because it is a very interesting movie. And the resale they did was badly smothered. Note, it's been a long time since I read it, I always thought "Lestat", "Tale of the Body Thief" and "Memnoch the Devil" were much more action packed and would have made better movies. /> <br /> I know many people (hey, myself included) who love many candles vampire crap who think it was absolutely the worst of the genre to be a big movie. I tend to agree with that. Aaliyah did have a nice body.
