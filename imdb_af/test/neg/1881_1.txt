What really surprised me about this movie was that it was so false. First, who in the late 80's (when the movie takes place) lived like this family? A college professor wouldn't make enough money to support the lifestyle I saw on the movie. Therefore, he and his home wife will be bothered by financial misery, especially when she gets cancer. Secondly, Streep is my age, and most women, especially in her class (educated, white, well off), experienced the feminist movement. Yet this woman seems unaware of her anachronistic behavior. I actually felt that she was a very controlling woman who kept her husband an emotional child taking care of all his needs. <br /> <br /> The fact that so many people have moved through the movie is wonderful. I have admired Carl Franklin's films in the past, and I really like Meryl Streep, but gad, what a manipulative and lying movie it is.
