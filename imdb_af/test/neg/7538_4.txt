Having seen PURELY BELTER, I came to this site to review it, but not just to review the scriptwriter / director Mark Herman's resume. Once his name appeared on the opening credits, I knew I saw his name somewhere and after I found out, he wrote and directed the movie version of LITTLE VOICE one of the most underrated British British films of the 1990s. <Br /> <br /> PURELY BELTER is a completely different kettle fish. This is a grim stereotypical view of Geordie's life and a very unknown one. Everybody is either a female clerk, a single mother, a shop runner, a drunk or a junkie. As many scenes are placed in a school, the PE teacher is a sadistic bully and it is the closest thing the movie ever comes to reality. Oh, and everyone is very dirty mouth that adds to the indifferent atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I didn't like PURELY BELTER much while I watched and now that I know who Mark Herman is, I even like it less. With LITTLE VOICE Herman proved that you can make an amusing exciting comedy with northern souls, but I had to ask where his undoubted talent went into this movie?
