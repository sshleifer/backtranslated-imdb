The only time I look through IMDb comments is when I saw a duff movie. I think I'm looking for reassurance that it's not just me. For me, Lonesome Jim was a duff movie full of incredible characters in incredible situations that came in a nasty and annoying way to a knock-out conclusion. So I look what other people have to say and feel like alienating Jim on a limb, since pages to page of various star ratings and plaudits doubt my critical faculties. But maybe I should review the comment submission institutions as it dies after a while and I am relieved to see values ​​reflecting my own. I feel justified. It is a garbage film, it doesn't coincide and it forms a wasted evening to put it through. Prize to join spirits.
