I always loved bad creations, rhetorical criticism and my film professor confirmed it to me in college. It's not as bad as The Star Wars Holiday Special, there's nothing at the bottom of the lunch box than that mistake. This Fantastic Four movie, complete with I-have-no-idea why-hes-over-tweaking-his-fingers Doctor Doom, is high on the list of colossal mistakes. Doom's dialogue "Kill him! ... let him go!" is classic as it is staggering in his hilarity. The editing is good, and the director of photography is not half-bad ... it's the top. But I can't see all my friends watching at all, but if I get the chance, I show them "Jonny and Sue can come to outer space with us!" scene I do. I also include the final scene, where Redd Richards in his FF outfit enters the limo for some reason, next to his bride Sue in her wedding dress. The payout is the extra road in farewell when they drive away. Most people are in total disbelief that there exists such a thing.
