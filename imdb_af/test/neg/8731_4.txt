I'm supposed to take something with a salt grain. These lab movies (and yes, they spend a lot of time in the lab) always fail in one dimension: there is an understanding that single people wandering around have uncovered secrets beyond the understanding of one to this time. Of course they pay a price because their experimentation has the same shortcomings as Dr. Frankenstein did. There is always something they didn't expect. There are so many things from pure science to fashion for young ladies to scandalous cover that doesn't work here. The young woman is picking up and the doctor can't help himself, but he could be a bit discreet or even attempted to hide what he did. Things go wrong and because of this intellect gets its tremendous power, including an understanding of how it came. Rock Hudson looks pretty fit here. However, he never really makes it into this role. It runs through with lots of clich√©s and silliness that reduces the basic problem. Once she has her revenge, a more appropriate thing for her to go astray and allow him to seek her out and destroy her in some way.
