Normally I wouldn't even go to bed like that, but since role-playing is a sweet hobby for me, so was the subject of the movie I did. It was rubbish in so many ways that I didn't know where to start. I'd rather sit by the "Plan 9 from Outer Space" marathon than watch another minute of this vomit. At least Plan 9 didn't have an agenda. How the media could capitulate and irresponsibly represent extremist agenda as fact is beyond me. This is a daunting time when a whole group of people can be carelessly married without defense and no real facts. I know this comment has become more social, but it couldn't be helped, as this movie pleaded it. Imagine a pro-Nazi movie being reviewed strictly on film earnings. Will not happen. As it is, the people who made this film are confronted with themselves, and may have to move into a communist enclave where propaganda is accepted.
