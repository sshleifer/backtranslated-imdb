Of course, you can put a model airplane on a black background and call it sci-fi, and that's enough to interest me. If you are, Black Horizon will at least be interested before you see it. The best part of the movie is when they introduce the real footage of a shuttle service. <br /> <br /> The movie plays like the Naked Gun series, rousing cop plays with bad clicks and bad acting. Unfortunately, I don't think they're meant to be funny, the actors are really made of cardboard, the dialogue really sucks, so they just have to laugh, and not with them. <br /> <br /> On a side note, it is rare to see a half-outer movie halfway on earth and not interfere with the expected alien and supernatural events. I really pain for more realistic drama based on our space efforts.
