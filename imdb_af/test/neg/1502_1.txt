NOW! I hated Ouma. First, she is too long, of course she is Tom, who is brother, who plays her - and I hate the thing she does when she brushes her fake silver hair back, but: there are funny parts in this movie. For example, the fact that every single actor V.G. (many German), and also that they think that even when left alone, they have to pretend that that guy (Tom) is their real "grandmother" or something. I kept special - not that moment when Charlotte left and started walking to the nearest gas station to ask for help. She suddenly finds herself in the middle of a few bushes (where was it before? No one dares explain) and turns, turns, turns like a ballerina, looks at the stars ... and ... ignores the fact that GRANNY IS IN HER, READY TO PUNCH !!! But anyway, the music wasn't that bad, the hairstyles were okay and the end was terribly challenging ... Mmmmm ... wish I had the German version.
