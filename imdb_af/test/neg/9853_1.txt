Now we have been chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda. It's no wonder that most American viewers admire and are hated by Europeans. This show is made for Americans - it's too stupid and full of hate and clich√©s to be allowed elsewhere. Almost everyone involved has to return to school, acting completely predictable and bad, the writing is lots of waste. operator work is ground zero, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> You're warned. It did not even entertain a guilty pleasure for those who were burned with the brain. I wish I could enter negative values, administrators? Anyone?
