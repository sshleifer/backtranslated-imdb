Since I bought the DVD, I watched as much as I did for my wallet. <br /> <br /> The plot fell in love with her, Kirk Douglas, as a successful first novelist hired by Laraine Dag as a secretary. Complications occur. <br /> <br /> Douglas is usually thought of as an intense actor, given to heavy dramatic roles, sometimes heroic, sometimes rotten. He is not bad in this thorough comic part. The problem is that the part is not particularly comical and nothing else. <br /> <br /> The plot is falling. A dozen "peculiar" characters come and go - the most prominent Keenan Wynn as Douglas's friend, who does nothing, but makes furious comments. Thelma Ritter was better at this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Well, if the plot is weak, it could still be saved in the dialogue, but there is no one to talk about. Some gags are stupid. Others do not clean the beam. Here's what I thought was an amusing line. Douglas just hired a day and wanted to take her to the beach house and seduce her. Day is disturbed and claims she never heard of a writer working in a beach house. Wynn asks if she's from Douglas' previous book, "Last Year's Love." Hold. Yes, of course she did. "Well, most of last year's love was done in the beach house." Ha ha. <br /> <br /> Nice cast, including support, but a failed comedy. There were better sitcoms on television.
