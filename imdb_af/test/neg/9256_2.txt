From all the movies I could choose, it had to be so. When I was last in New York, I went to a Times Square store and out of the hundreds of DVDs they chose Joel M. Reeds Bloodsucking Freaks (1976) and on a dual DVD that also includes Seeds of Sin (1968 ) included. ), do I regret it? Read on to find out. The film is made on an island (near Milligan's Staten Island house), where two lovers walk along with a massive parasol, apparently made of paper, at one point giving it the top of a weed as a gift. Besides Colin (Hal Borske) a delayed hunchback appears and kills both of them for no reason. After the opening credits made by some of the worst headache-inducing music I've ever heard, I got it started at least as it is always used by the movie, we are introduced to three couples. The women are all sisters, Vicky (Ann Linden) and Ricard (Fib LaBlaque), Veronica (Eileen Hayes) and Bill (Don Williams) plus Elizabeth (Carol Vogel) and Donald (Richard Ramos). They each received a letter from a lawyer, H. Dobbs (Neil Flanagan) requesting a meeting so that he could read their father's father. Dobbs informs them that they should spend three days in their children's home "Crenshaw House" with "sexual harmony and marriage love" they never knew because of the tense relationship between their father and mother. He informs the couples that the will is highly irregular, but legal. After three days the inheritance is settled. The couples are also told by the servants, Martha (Veronica Radburn), Hattie (Maggie Rodgers) and the delayed Colin, who welcome the couples by biting and biting bits from a rabbit. Later that night, remaining from the dead rabbit, found in one of the couples beds with a note saying, "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit." It starts with a series of events that end in horrific murder and reveal dark family secrets. <br /> <br /> Written, photographed and directed by the talented Andy Milligan. It's an absolutely horrible movie in every way. Let's just go through some of the mistakes. The music, it's terrible and causes headaches. Sound, you can hardly hear what characters say and some scenes have no sound effects and at certain points you can send Milligan calls to his actors. Oh, and there is also a lift on the sound track. The acting, probably among the worst I've ever seen. The very un-special effects, Colin pokes someone's eye in the opening order, it's the size of a tennis ball, the part where someone is tied up and his stomach opened with a saw looks very terrible like the different hands and legs that cut down. Photography, Milligan has absolutely no idea how to film or film a scene. He regularly cuts off the top, bottom or sides of people's heads and faces from the screen and shakes and shakes his camera as it is being driven by someone who is constantly overwhelmed. There was also at least one scene so badly thought and filmed that a crew member was seen. The movie is often so dark, you can't see what happens. Editing, again of the worst I've ever put. He seems to cut screens before they are finished, while characters are in the middle of a sentence. The script, if any, credited to both Milligan and Hal Sherwood (it took two people to write it!?) Is everywhere and is incredibly stupid. There is an incredibly bad order where the killer follows a victim in the basement, the killer runs right behind him, at one point the potential victim turns around. What does the killer do to prevent them being traced? They fall from him, the killers are close enough to give the man oral sex, but he doesn't see it right in front of him. You have to see this row to believe it, I still can't believe what I saw. Bizarre sub-sections just happen and disappear completely. Check out the scene when Richard has to borrow money from his brother Walter (producer and fellow writer Hal Sherwood), who seems to be a gay priest who has a bloody relationship with his brother before he was married! A strange scene that's not there at all. Martha's housekeepers' response to the first murder, she is more bothered by the fact that it threw her dinner schedule! There is also a bit of fierce dialogue, Patty and Martha discussing Colin, Patty says, "If I didn't hit him so hard," Martha says sympathetically. "You must be Patty, you must!", Completely straightforward. And don't start me how ugly the wallpaper looks through the house! The only good thing I can think of is that the costumes look reasonable, for the period in which they are meant. I can probably talk about how amateurish it is all day, but I think you get the idea. One to avoid unless you're a serious masochis! I didn't regret buying or watching it for a second!
