This movie started well enough, and it was pretty good at the mood of the book, even if the play wasn't on top. The soundtrack was painfully bad. Saxophone and electric guitars? It was noisy uncomfortable. The female singer was positively horrible! In the second half of the film, the story takes a particularly dark turn. Too dark for Austen. Northanger Abbey is a dark and scary place, while in the book it is disappointingly moderated and modernized for Catherine's eyes. <br /> <br /> Who's in the heel this Marioness with the horrible makeup and wig? A totally strange and unnecessary character. <br /> <br /> One of the key elements of the book is the general is not a Gothic monster like the characters in Catherine's books. His monstrosity is much more complicated in his suppression of his children's spirits and his treatment of Catherine on the basis of money concerns alone. He did not join his wife or murder her, but he sent Mrs. Morland on a 70 mile journey alone in a rental car, with not enough money to pay her way home. Just her friend, me. Tilney's mind to spend her money on the way out saves her getting stranded. This whole point is seriously disrupted in the film. They make the general too dark from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Peter Firth didn't have to sing! This part was painful to watch. His portrayal of Tilney was not bad, but it was a shadow in the dark. Henry Tilney of that book is sport of me. Morland's imagination traveled to Northanger, but he was never dark. Firth would have benefited from better direction. The young lady who played Isabella needed a better acting coach. John Thorpe was angry. The striped waistcoat and chains he wore were vague! It certainly fits his character. <br /> <br /> I think the movie would have fared better with a completely different soundtrack. It throws a repressive pole over the whole movie. When I watch it again, it will be with AF and subtitles. Maybe I'll give the movie a 4. <br /> <br /> The sound quality of the DVD was pretty poor. The picture quality was not much better. It is striking on a digital television. <br /> <br /> If I think of what this movie might have been, I am thinking of persuasion with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds.
