It's a strange, strange movie and doesn't earn a better point than David Lynch's! The special effects are badly made, the actors are mostly bad actors and in this movie it's not about a race that is the minority of a planet and is trying to fight the dominators, but it seems like it's a crazy film is paying tribute to sect type organizations. It is certainly not the will of Frank Herbert, the author of the six-part epic! Check out David Lynch's one, this is the perfect tribute to the novels!
