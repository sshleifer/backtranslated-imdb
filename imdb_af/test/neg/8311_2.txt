Just as bad as this movie is, I really like it. The poor acting, dialogue and action made it so funny. I loved John Travis of Omega Cop and went out all night to find out how the Death Machines got in at the airport if they couldn't speak, probably shaking / nodding the security questions. Actually why can't they talk! It fails to meet any kind of movie convention that makes it very interesting to watch - just a lot of people are killed to get a very loose plot around hired killers - no "machines" as such and that strange face / mountain front. cover and the trailer does not appear! I love the fact that there is no good man in this movie until about halfway and I love the many useless scenes of the landing plane. Many people are killed who have nothing to do with the plot and no explanation is given. about anything - DO NOT expect to understand this movie. Instead, admire how the chief good guy can't even handle an eternal old man in the bar - who is portrayed as the bad man, nevertheless opposes the barman's decision to hire a thinly-dressed woman dance in the corner for 'entertainment' - All the good guys seem to enjoy it! Why did your old guy get our hero - and why did the random block decide to help old guy in the fight? Why did the hero fall under one of the old guys in the bar where a stream of water was radiating in the background so it looked like it was coming out of his mouth? Definitely Top 20 B-Movie, should look for part 2.
