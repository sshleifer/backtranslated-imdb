"Cover Girl" is a dark brown World War II musical with absolutely nothing unforgettable about it, except for the signature song, "Long Ago and Far Away." This movie came out before Gene Kelly really hit his artistic struggle, and while there is evidence of his budding talent here, he mostly plays a sidekick for Rita Hayworth. And there is the problem. Rita Hayworth is beautiful, no doubt about it. But she is simply not a compelling screen presence. I've found myself wanting to keep her more than I actually do, and this movie is no exception. She is simply not a very good actress, and she is not even a very good dancer. Looks good as she is, there is something foolish about her, and this movie suffers. <br /> <br /> Degree: C-
