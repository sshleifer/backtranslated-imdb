John Wayne is without doubt one of the most popular and beloved actors of all time. His career stretches over forty years, and within that time, in films such as "Angel and the Badman", "The Green Berets", "Sands of Iwo Jima", "Rio Bravo", "North Alaska" and "The Unfortunate ". <br /> <br /> The film mentioned above is considered to be some of its best, as opposed to this 1934 effort, "Randy Rides Alone", which is almost forgotten about the time being, which is indifferent, for it is nothing memorable apart from its short time of just 53 minutes. <br /> <br /> A young John Wayne plays Randy Bowers, who for reasons never really explained, comes to a salon in the middle of nowhere and finds that everyone inside is murdered. As they look around, there come a post and find Randy there and they arrest him, accusing him of being a gangster and asking to know where the rest of his gang is. He was sentenced to prison, accused of murder. Sally Rogers, whose uncle owned and murdered the salon, came to prison to see Randy explaining that he was one of the gang members. She was hidden in a secret room when the shooting took place. Sally doesn't believe Randy is a murderer and doesn't recognize him, so while the sheriff is out, she hits the keys and Randy escapes. As he ran away from the sheriff and his post, Randy conveniently stumbled into the gang's hideout in a cave responsible for the murders. Randy sat out to clear his name, and to bring the gang to justice. <br /> <br /> "Randy Rides Alone" can be a fun movie to watch, especially if you're a John Wayne fan. But at the same time, it has too many mistakes that are impossible to ignore. The movie is also extremely dated, as you would expect; We have the horrible camera shooting that makes everyone look like they are moving in super-fast motion, and the dialogue is terrible. The play is also not good, and Wayne's character is very timber and he looks with other role-players like someone's puppets (in this case director Harry Fraser). Harry Fraser is driving, and doing a good job, but the story is paper thin. One can't help but feel about 10 minutes from the start missing out on the movie, as Randy just arrives from the neighborhood at the salon and someone is looking for someone. An explanation of why Randy was there later, which appears to be a P.I sent to investigate claims someone is trying to take over the town. To be honest, I didn't succeed, most of the time I hoped the movie would end. <br /> <br /> But that said, I didn't find this movie very terrible. I enjoyed it a bit and found it to be nice. But it's really not a good movie, and it's not really worth watching or tracking. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Randy Rides Alone" is incredibly dated and is a tired Western with very few redeeming features. Can be fun, but overall it's not a good movie and definitely one of Wayne's poorer outings.
