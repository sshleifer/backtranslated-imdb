I've always been a fan of Bottom, grabbing as many videos as I could find in the series here in the states. The chemistry between Rik and Ade is always genius, and the combination of clever writing and completely silly humor seems to work without delay. So I sat down to watch this movie with great eagerness ... and was completely disappointed with the end. <br /> <br /> The first 3/4 of the movie can best be described as uninspired and poorly directed (sorry, Ade!), but with some brilliant moments. Unfortunately, these exhilarating moments make you realize the less brilliant the rest of the movie is. The slapstick starts out funny but eventually gets a little boring, with just the twisted sex jokes to keep things humorous. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie (the 'green' scenes, for those who have seen you) was ... perhaps the worst end I've seen in the past decade. Honest. It was a joke repeated thirty times, followed by a sudden end that didn't make sense (which didn't bother me) and wasn't funny (what did). <br /> <br /> In short, I was very disappointed by this movie. I will stick to the few brilliant moments in it, to retain the most beautiful memories I can ... but I have to warn you if you don't pay over for your NTSC local importer conversion cable. There are much better things to spend your money on.
