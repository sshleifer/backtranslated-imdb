I have to agree with the previous reviewer. Although Kristin Erikson had a good job of playing the injured girl, I don't seriously think that Isabelle, the character she played, was owned. I saw people having psychotic breakdowns due to sexual abuse, and they never made it clear whether the father had actually abused her or not. I also had to see a few more parts to make clear about what the letter said, what the characters' names were, and I am not yet clear about a few things that have happened, whether they really were or not. . I try to find the "original" story on which it was based, to compare facts, but I can't find anything online about it. <br /> <br /> It wasn't a bad movie, but some of the dialogue was incredibly cheesy. Special effects show, the movie wasn't bad for a Grade B, and the titles made it all worthwhile. That is, if you have nothing better to do. lol
