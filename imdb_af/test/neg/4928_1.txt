Just watched this movie at the Fantasy Filmfest BERLIN. I'm not impressed. <br /> <br /> As far as the story goes. Friends come back from their holiday in Mexico. While waiting for their luggage, they get to know a few boys, who then take the last and obviously wrong bus to the city. On board is also another older man, so strangely portrayed that you immediately guess that he is one of the bad guys. The other one is the driver. <br /> <br /> The shuttle brings them into industrial desert and then one after another, a little blood, a bit of the limbs, some violence, mostly with the fear of the Girls In the end, after a few ups and downs, heres and there are a few not too recent moments, everyone is dead, but the driver and the girls. the girls end up in a garage where one of them is killed after confessing she slept with the other girlfriend's boyfriend. The other girl, who concludes, is sold by the remaining kidnapper (indeed killed) in a cargo box to Asia (a cargo port is the final photo.) First. Story. Numerous gaps, questions you ask yourself, loose points, and a conclusion that is not a good revelation, but a total disappointment. I can't see how such an unprofessional runner is supposed to kidnap dozens of women (as indicated by a driver's full license ... aha) Second. Acting. Moderate at best. <br /> <br /> Third. Scare Factor. OK. but I am robbed of torture as a means for nothing but self. Trading with people can be a good reason for a horrorflick, but it's not used as one, just as a background. <br /> <br /> Fourth, Music and Sound. A few nice tries, but the sound capabilities of the industrial landscape, warehouse garage and truck sounds were not really explored. Music? Would have been worse without it, but apart from that. Some pseudo-moving syntax theme for emotionality when the girls reach their final destination. OK, I think. <br /> <br /> Pronunciation: Avoid it!
