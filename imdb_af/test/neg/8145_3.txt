Two years later the last "Our Gang" was shortened. After you have seen it, you wonder how it lasted much longer. The quality of "Our Gang" soon after Hal Roach passed to MGM, and this short is a perfect example. The gags are all very unsuitable and Froggy's last line of this is the happiest day of his life, making the rest of the time a bad picture in your mind. A very poor example of film making.
