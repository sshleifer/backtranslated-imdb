I have to say, I'm a big fan of these 'Last House to the Left' rip-offs, even those that most people seem to hate are often held in high esteem by me. but one of those movies I didn't like much was Aldo Lado's Night Train Murders, and unfortunately it looks like trains and The Last House on the left don't interfere, as Terror Express is still a rogue off. Something that this kind of movie really needs is a resoundingly nasty main character; While Terror Express offers three potential candidates, none of them is acted upon and becomes this villain, leaving the lack of the main area. It is actually starting well when three young men start on a passenger train to annoy the guests on board. This leads the audience to believe there is more in the store, but unfortunately it never really gets as the scene is fixed. From there, the trio makes a train and uses their new power to terrorize the guests and rape the women. <br /> <br /> It should be said that there is a good number of sleaze in this movie, which will be pleasing to many viewers; but there is scarce blood. Director Ferdinando Baldi thought he could get away with replacing the blood with sex scenes, and he could also have got away with it; if he can film a brutal sex scene. The idea that these men have taken the train by force goes out of the window when it comes to gender, as the people you would expect to be powerful and compelling, find everyone too eager to give their women a good time , and in spite of a very easy 'sandwich' order, none of the sex is particularly interesting. Since much of the movie is recorded by these sex scenes, it becomes a big problem. Movies like this are often lacking in style, tension and credibility; But you know you look bad when it's boring. As you would expect, nothing from the play to anything; and especially the central three stand out for garbage. The direction is lacking in style, and there is very little voltage or voltage; makes it difficult to care what is going to happen. Overall, this is a nice crappy example of an exploitation movie, and I can't recommend it.
