I was excited about the fresh (pun intended) summary of this movie and looking forward to seeing it. The first few shots include some of the characters as well as the main place where the stories take place; the horticultural awards. The movie looks fantastic. Colorful but simple. Magical but genuine. Unfortunately, it only takes a few minutes to find out where the movie is going. We will soon find out that it will be a manipulative, juicy story that will put a lot of loaded people in the way of being confronted with a "good victim" refugee and that it will be a happy ending to the dressed people. Realizing error of their ways and accepting people. <br /> <br /> The characters, especially the prejudices, are very comic-booky in nature. The story focuses mainly on two refugee families. One of them is led by a single mother who played Diveen Henry horribly. I am sad to say that any emotion that could be felt after her was disrupted by what unforgettable act. <br /> <br /> The other story is much more interesting and focuses on a father and his two children. Everyone was hit by containers, where the woman and mother died, by traveling to this country, but this is the man who suffers the most. Benedict Wong gives a sensible show here. Initially, his emotions are very muted, but when the story develops, he makes us subtly aware of the inner struggle of his character. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is just extremely boring. There were so many possibilities with this movie. There are several characters to keep up with, many of which have potential, but none of them are realized. Even worse, despite the fact that this movie is not very Hollywood, some of the main plot threads are solved cheaply in a Hollywood b-grade solution. Example: <br /> <br /> Character A likes character B Character B rejects his advances No problem! Let's have character C declare her love for character A so we can all have a happy ending. To yawn. <br /> <br /> I loved the plot of the Asian family. It was well done. Unfortunately, the entire allocation business, its common aspect, is the dynamic with which a large roll of cast is involved, all under exploitation. <br /> <br /> What you're left with is a little worth movie.
