Yesterday was one of those days we decided to go to the movies. We accidentally chose "Ik ook van Jou", but we wanted to see the current Dutch movies. <br /> <br /> The movie is based on a book by Ronald Giphart, and I must confess immediately that he is not exactly one of my favorites. The film features actors who are best known in the Netherlands for their appearance in soaps and / or afternoon shows. At least one of them (Kamerling) did pretty decent things after they left the sea world. So we decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. <br /> <br /> And what a mistake it was. This movie fails on all fronts. Bad acting (the best thing is actually by a trial king, who very convincingly claims to be dead). Flat, uninteresting story with inexplicable and uninteresting margins (Why France? Why tell the story to a girl from Uganda?) Errors (black people don't use sunscreen, as far as I know, and heating systems in the Netherlands don't make clouds of steam like in New York, even if it looks nice on film, people don't wear T-shirts outside on New Year's Eve in Northern Europe.) There is one funny moment involving two little dogs, and that's it. <br /> <br /> So that's what I think, but more importantly, it seems that none of the people who left the movie enjoyed it afterwards. I heard one of them say he was very disappointed because he liked the book so much. I didn't read the book, but my advice should be: read the book, don't see the movie.
