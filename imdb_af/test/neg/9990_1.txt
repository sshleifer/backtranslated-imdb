I saw this movie with a group of friends at the age of 18. His reputation preceded it, and although all my friends were also of legal age, I only had the courage to enter the video store and actually rent it. We met at a house where the parents left the weekend. Although we were in close proximity to each other, we did not speak or acknowledge each other's presence. As it turned out, the film both earned and we didn't have the expectation of shame we felt. It's not disappointing about pure free content, but it's disappointed in every other way. <br /> <br /> Caligula tries to transcend genres by combining a historic epic combination with a brazen porn flick. It fails in its ambition and submits to the worst of both worlds. The movie's obvious point of sale is its pornographic aspect, and it offers far more than its share of true, graphic sex. But to establish this generation in the context of Caligula's depraved government, it appreciates the deed even less than the average adult movie. Sex without context can at least be physically pleasing to the adults involved, but pleasure and perhaps even permission is largely absent from the world of Caligula. In it, sex acts at its best as an idle pastime and, in the worst case, as an instrument of sadistic domination. In the present day, it is somewhat common to use words such as "sin" and "depravity" that are appropriately used to describe acts that are pleasant, but still taboo according to certain moral or religious perspectives. Caligula takes the viewer out of fascination by portraying true depravity and demonstrating that no joy or pleasure comes from it. <br /> <br /> The historical parts fail to meaningfully contextualise the family, they fail to entertain, relieve, intrigue, or interest the viewer in any way. They only offer long pieces of unceasing tedium. Rarely did a movie become so boring. The generation, after the initial shock and amazement fades, only adds to the overall monotony of the picture. <br /> <br /> Rare discussions of this film involve his violence. While many films are made more violent than Caligula, little can compete in terms of the shock value of his violence. Apparenly, inexorable barbarity as well as hyper-depraved sexuality characterized Caligula's emperor. The violence is even less for the dull of the heart than the generation. <br /> <br /> An overview like this will probably generate as much curiosity as it falls apart. I understand why someone wants to see this movie; After all, I myself gave in to the same curiosity. I just hope my review will give the potential viewers the knowledge to make an informed decision on how to see it or not. My high school criminal justice teacher described police work as "hours of boredom structured by moments of sheer terror." This statement perfectly describes Caligula. You're warned.
