This movie was so bad it was funny! For a while I thought I was actually watching a bad movie (a low for your consideration). The "cliffhanger" scene at the end hurt my laughter until inside me. The script was frightening, along with Sean Young's horrible play - especially while explaining the whole story in detail (complete with flash pages) while deviating from a cliff. This makes it a truly classic bad movie worth watching! In fact, the fakey shots in this scene reminded me of an Ed Wood movie. I still can't believe how this thing made. First of all, how did such a bad writing get the green light? How did star actors attach? Were they on low points in their careers? Questions, questions.
