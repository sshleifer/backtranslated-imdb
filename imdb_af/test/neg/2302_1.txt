So I hired this movie and hope to learn about the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the start of its independence from the Belgian government. I was excited to become acquainted with the figures involved in history, mainly Lumumba and Mobutu. I wanted to see how the new Congolese government is trying to unite the various groups against colonial rule, the political motives behind each, the reasons for the decision of Belgium to give the DRC independence, and also how the United States and the former USSR was involved. Unfortunately, all my questions have become largely unanswered. My belief is that this film was made by people who, through passing fame with the DRC's struggle for freedom, have a story full of drama and emotion, and decide to exploit it. They then tried to make all the dramatic points in a storyline, briefly filled with dialogue, set off and shot it. I can be wrong, but if so, it's sad, because then the makers have to be too bound to get everything in, and eventually they have thrown all the details in an effort to create a comprehensive history. Whatever the reason, the fact is that the movie can be a timeline of sentencing statements and facts on the screen. The film goes through every major appearance and tells the viewer the main idea of ​​what is going on, totally over the real details in favor of coming over the big things. For example, there is the scene when Lumumba is captured by the increasingly rebellious army controlled by Mobutu. In the situation, the soldiers have three possible points of view: one that sympathizes with Lumumba, one that indignant Lumumba, and one standing in the middle, sympathetic and yet obedient to commands. As a result, there are three soldiers talking in the scene, with lines untouched by their views. To prevent the actual tension that these opposing viewpoints deal with, the scriptwriters simply inserted a random blast, more army men appeared, and eventually they all ended up. This is the magnitude of the reflectivity of the movie. Most of the time, each character simply sets their basic motives, the other characters react with theirs, and that's it. There is little told by actions; Even the things they say are the point of pain. It is hard to believe that the people who are represented actually acted. Also in the trend of this directness, things like political tensions between factions are reduced to a simple recognition of the fact: we never learn what these factions are, what they fight for, their power, basically anything except their existence. The characters are also one-dimensional and flat; Unfortunately, I don't know if Lumumba was actually a freedom fighter who was passionately dedicated to ideals of Congolese unity, but after an hour or so I certainly didn't trust it to tell it. The Dutch Reformed Church, like many developing countries, has a complicated and important history, especially in the period leading up to independence. But telling these histories will not be useful unless there is recognition for the complexity of the situations. Lumumba fails to pay close attention to these details, and ends up telling the viewer, small except the most common of outlines.
