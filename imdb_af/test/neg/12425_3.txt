A few companions and I have the strange hobby to really look horrible and completely obscure (for good reason) horror flicks and then look at it under the influence of broad consumer goods such as alcohol and / or soft drugs. Often, many people do it, but they watch movies like the "Godzilla" remake, while we wade our eyes and brain with things like "The Loch Ness Horror". And, eureka, it's a prototypical bad movie! We open traditionally, with bagpipes music during the opening credits. It is natural to emphasize that dumb viewers were supposed to place the story in Scottish Highlands and not in the director of Larry Buchanan, Texas's birthplace. For the same reason, the role players are also instructed to persuade and speak spoken talk. The US marine biologist prof. George Sanderson arrives in Loch Ness with a brand new and highly sophisticated sonar equipment to track the whereabouts of the legendary monster in the lake. Meanwhile, there are many other parties hanging around the lake, such as a group of kids on a science camp (which is a boring way to spend your holiday), retired army generals looking for a Luftwaffe aircraft during World War II. the more fallen and a bunch of thieves and failed scientists stealing the monster's egg. You would think that these many sub-graves bring some plot and excitement to the plot, but unfortunately this is not the case. "Loch Ness Horror" is a totally boring movie with only a few notable elements. The monster itself, for example, is a beautiful cheese-like creation with cute eyes and a smoky breath. His teeth also glow in the dark, which is quite useful if you are dumb enough to go on a cruise in the middle of the night. By the end of the film, the remaining role-players were more interested in the lost Luftwaffe airplane than in the monster, so it was time to wind it up. "Loch Ness Horror" is highly recommended if you are a fan of bad B-movies from the 80's, but is advised to contain overload of senseless dialogues and a bitterly-run ending that makes the movie suddenly run out has. outside budget.
