I hate and despise this film and the filmmakers behind. <br /> <br /> Certainly, I'm all doing a hard and honest movie about youth and youth culture. 1987's "River's Edge" is an excellent example. of a well-made teenage drama. But what I am exceptional about is the infantile, dirty and sensational approach taken by the makers of "2:37". <br /> <br /> An excellent example is how it comes up with so many issues and yet in any meaningful flaw failure to comment or make a decision on even one of them. <br /> <br /> My other big problem with this movie, apart from its full plagiarism of Gus Van Sant's "Elephant" (surprised by Sant's not sued) is his "bullshit in a china store's attitude" versus fairly delicate issues such as incest and especially suicide. <br /> <br /> In short, avoid this movie like the plague and anything this movie maker ever involved. I heard that his motivation for making "2:37" may or may not be based on lies. If I saw the substandard result, it didn't surprise me at all. It is a glorified student movie exercise that has no place whatsoever in a theater or on DVD. Pure and simple.
