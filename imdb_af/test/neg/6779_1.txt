The problem with this - and with all Vietnam war films - is that they are too biased. Anti-war films overlook the fact that the vast majority of American soldiers were heroes, while prowar films about the fact that many of the soldiers have indeed committed atrocities like the one in this movie. This movie sucks. It is time for a movie that is not prover or antiwar, or liberal or conservative, but totally unmanned.
