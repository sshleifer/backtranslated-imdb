Matt Cvetic is a loyal communist in a steel factory in Pittsburgh who recruits workers in the party, although it isolates him from his son, family and neighbors. What makes it even harder is that Cvetic is actually an FBI agent who must be a Communist post to get information about party activities. The party is trying to strike a strike at the mill, causing the pro-strike movement to lead workers into a golf propaganda. Cvetic is also dealing with beautiful Eve Merrick, a party member and teacher at his boy school who finds that Cvetic is a double agent. When Eva learns the ugly truth about the parties' true motives, the red decides that she needs to be liquidated and Cvetic must help her without endangering herself. The movie should have enough tension and double crossing, but there is very little in this movie, but (according to today's standards) is very cheese-like propaganda and little action or excitement. Lovejoy is very good in the lead, but even he and the rest of the role-play seem lethargic. Few surprises here and how did this film receive an Oscar for the best documentary? Rating, 4.
