I think I'd rather have clipped my piles with a few rusty clippings than carrying another 5 minutes of this movie. In fact, I can't even be bothered to go into detail! Not sure how they managed to get the needles in the woodworkers to heal them! Better for all concerned if they just snapped the island after watching the virus, so it would have been as long as the commercial break, and we could continue with our lives. One more thing was this rubbish that was commanded by the channel of God. Like everything they looked like, the bleeding gentleman was most of the time. Avoid like the plague! In fact, I would prefer it!
