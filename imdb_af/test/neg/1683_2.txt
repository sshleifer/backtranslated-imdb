I jumped to learn to finish this show. The show's characters were extremely annoying. None of them had one of the singers. Damon Wayans is probably the most suitable one. Kisha Campbell is ... Kisha Campbell. She is just as annoying as she is in Martin. <br /> <br /> The kids are also very annoying. The oldest is an idiot, the oldest girl is a brat, and the youngest is frustrating to listen to. <br /> <br /> I think I looked like the intelligent boy. But it's about it. <br /> <br /> It made the world a favor by ending. <br /> <br /> Let's pray that a Wayan never dies in another show ... EVER.
