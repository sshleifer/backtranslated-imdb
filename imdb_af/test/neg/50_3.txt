My parents rented a lot of horror movies when I was a child. We liked to watch them, even when they were bad, they made some fun. It was such a movie that is hard to review because I saw it once as a child, but it's not something I want to find again, so I can do a more in-depth review. The story has died some old terrorist actor legend. He seems to have remembered that he did a bit like a top Vincent Price, without being nice and nice. He commits murders and dies, but what is it? Is the movie over? No, as some children, for some reason, choke the body and are prepared for a fun evening to kill the ham from outside the grave. I remember the murders were nothing special after the first couple and I remember this movie was quite disappointing. Seems to have a good point of departure, but it just didn't deliver the goods, because more cool death was needed and that super-terrorist had to add a little to his repertoire.
