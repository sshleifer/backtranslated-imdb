"Tales from the Crapper" is gory, disgusting, tasteless, offensive, lowbrow and scatological. But that's right, I was ready for everything from my previous Troma experiences. What I have NOT prepared is that it is also relentless, unfriendly and boring. Very little of the true anarchic spirit of movies like the "Class of Nuke'em High" remained intact; In its place we get FINAL SCOPE jokes (to the point where you start to wonder if Lloyd Kaufman is going to senile, think that adults are running, so shocking!) And a cynical, shameless exploitation of the viewer, who is essentially investing time and money to see a "movie" that even Kaufman looks like, should never be released in the first place. Oh yes, there is a lot of female nudity on the screen, but let's see it: the average porn movie probably offers a better storyline, higher production values, funny humor, and above all more RESPECT for the intended viewer than this horror. <br /> <br /> PS: Kelly Powers AKA Suzi Lorraine (the blonde lesbian student in the segment "How to make your own movie") is one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen.
