Geoffrey Wright, director of "Romper Stomper", transplanted Shakespeare's Macbeth into the contemporary, criminal underworld of Melbourne, Australia. The result is a semi-horrible piece of cinema. Sam Worthington is Macbeth, and walks around looking very self-conscious and bored. Victoria Hill, who wrote the writing with Wright, is Lady Macbeth, and she is neither terrible nor good. Lachy Hulme, who plays McDuff, is the only actor in the role of any kind of authority. The rest, including Gary Sweet, was wasted and sent wrong. Shot on HD by late Will Gibson, the film's visual texts lack character. Everything is too clean and deliberately relieved. Wright's direction is utterly uninspired and the action ranges are confusing and inactive. Illegally marketed as "the most violent Australian movie ever", the film is sometimes violent and fairly bloody, but it fails to deliver a single impactful moment. Slowly moving and terribly pretentious, this umpteenth silver screen version of the classic play is the embodiment of the wrong head.
