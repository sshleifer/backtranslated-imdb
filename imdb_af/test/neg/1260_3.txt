It was more of a love story than one about an angel coming to earth, although both corners of the story are a good part of the movie. <br /> <br /> If I took this movie to heart, As someone who knows and believes in the Bible, I would have potted it a little bit quickly, but I don't think the general atmosphere was communities or blasphemy. It was just ridiculous or just stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean, John Travolta as a dirty angel? Smoking? Scratching his groin? The quote of the Beatles? A "warring angel" who knows nothing of heaven? An angel flirting with all the women? Yes, it is all absurd and definitely Biblically wrong. <br /> <br /> I can tolerate it all, but I don't know how many people, whatever beliefs they have, which can be a boring movie that seems to be in the second half. It begins to drag when the romance between William Hurt and Andie MacDowell begins. Some of the dialogue during the romance is so stupid, it is offensive to any discriminating viewer. <br /> <br /> This is another Nora Ephron directed movie. Man, I can't believe how many incredible silly movies this woman wrote or directed. She is at least consistent.
