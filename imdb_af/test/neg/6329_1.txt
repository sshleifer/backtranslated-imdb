It's not a new movie. This is a review of 1994's Emmanuelle, Queen of the Galaxy, and it's been cut off considerably. Warning: Many characters appear in the credits cut out of the movie! <br /> <br /> If you want to see this one in its original form, quit "Queen" - avoid this one at all costs, as The cuts make it even smarter than it was originally.
