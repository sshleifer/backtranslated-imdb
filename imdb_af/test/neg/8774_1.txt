I waited quite a while until I could watch this Lone Ranger movie. I finally saw it today on the Lone Star Channel and was very disappointed in the whole movie. Clayton Moore and John Hart performed better than Lone Rangers and Jay Silverheels as Tonto, as the two stars in this movie. Very bad acting was done by everyone in this movie. Even the plot was bad and far-fetched. I believe the horse, depicting Silver, was the best actor throughout this movie. I'm glad I didn't go out and bought a copy of this movie when it first came out because I feel it's a waste of good money. I'm really sorry the characters that Clayton Moore, John Hart and Jay Silverheels played, and created on the silver screen, have been killed so badly. Unless in the future, they find actors worthy to portray the characters in the same way Clayton, John and Jay have done so well in the past. I won't spend the money buying the movie. I won't see this movie again. <br /> <br /> Wayne Davies
