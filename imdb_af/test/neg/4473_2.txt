Hollywood won't stop making money on a movie, even if they have to drag stereotypes and put them in the most impossible and stupid situations. This attempt is a clear example of this and I really believe in my heart that a movie like these races is irresponsible. Story is about a divorced attorney named Peter Sanderson (Steve Martin) who spoke to a woman on his computer, and when he finally met her, it turned out to be the opposite of what he expected. Charlene Morton (Queen Latifah) is a greasy black woman who is not planning to meet Peter, but rather wants to look at her case where she was found guilty of robbery. He wants her to leave well, but at times she keeps on and to save his work, he agrees with reluctance to look at the facts of her case. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT *** ** <br /> <br /> Peter kept his children with him and Charlene seems to help raise them, but suddenly a news bulletin is announced that an escaped culprit, named Charlene Morton, has broken out of jail. Peter tells her to go away when the FBI goes around, but he finds out she is innocent when her old boyfriend pops up and threatens him. <br /> <br /> This movie is directed by Adam Shankman who is moving things at a good pace and is technically sound film, but the writing is just as unlikely and every character is a stereotype to the point that a 1970's movie "The Landlord" is clearly more in line with race relations than this mess. I have always been a big fan of Martin and I think he is one of the most talented people in the area, but he likes to work constantly and sometimes he seems to be giving him some writing. On the other hand, I always had a problem with Latifah and the way she played Martin's life is so overwhelmed that she is immediately surprising. The basic premise that Hollywood loves to use is the hip black person who is unceasingly white to loosen and then gives a street logic that will help them with their lives. It's basically what the story is here, but of course they have to make Martin look black and convince like a delayed Eminem, because Hollywood knows it's what viewers want. Well, I was pretty much offended by everything in this movie and that's not because I don't have a sense of humor, but unfortunately (For Hollywood, anyway) I use logic and common sense when watching a movie . Yes, I enjoyed Eugene Levy's talk, but do we really believe he will be lured to Latifah immediately? I suspect things have happened and how many times is a chief actor shot just to be saved by something in their pocket? Wouldn't a cell phone break if it was hit by a bullet? Even if you were the strongest Martin and Latifah fan, I wouldn't recommend it. I know I said it before, but it's not an attempt to make a good movie, it's an excuse to try to make money!
