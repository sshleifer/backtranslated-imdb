I've been a fierce Star Trek fan since 1966. Still. One thing I learned from Star Trek is that the special effects are secondary to the characters. Encounter At Farpoint failed in his mission. <br /> <br /> Excellently produced. <br /> <br /> FAITH directed, written, performed. D.C. Fontana really blew this one. This episode is so embarrassing that the master band should be burned. <br /> <br /> The first half of the first season didn't fare much better.
