What else can I add? This is without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Terrible acting, a brave script, boring slow tempo - even visible microphones hanging from the top of the screen. I can go on, but I really can't be bothered. I watched it for 90 minutes before the feeling of losing the will became too great for me. <br /> <br /> I can only assume the first set of comments and voices of people related to promoting this insult to British film production. <br /> <br /> And worst of all, I had to buy the Mail on Sunday to get it :-) The only reason why the DVD is not redistributed as a coaster is that it is now proud place in my top 10 worst movies ever collected. <br /> <br /> Definitely one that should be avoided.
