So it is supposed to find it funny that this woman travels all the way to the jungle - after the war zone - just to find out why her fianc√© hasn't traveled to Switzerland? Or should we take it seriously? It's not even funny, smart or entertaining at all - it's stupid - and so is the movie. The main actress is one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen in a movie - even worse than Jar Jar Binks. Dialogue is trying very hard to be funny (almost all the time), but it is never. The number of funny jokes is somewhere between zero and nothing. And as for the plot, did they even bother to explain to us what the rebels are fighting (except anti-government)? I don't think it mattered to anyone - not to the rebels or to the characters who just flew blindly to the battlefield. Don't waste your time. "Coronado" is not funny or entertaining.
