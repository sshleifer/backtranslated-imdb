That's what happens when a franchise becomes lazy, and no one can think of a new twist. Remember what happened to the "Childs Play" series? The first three were played as horror movies, with real scares (though predictable) that were true to the theme of the movie. Then they run out of people for the doll to steal, and decide to laugh, with the following two black comedies ..... <br /> <br /> Well that's what happens here, but I think so was not meant to be so. Similar to saying, "I wanted to make pancakes for dessert! I did it deliberately!" when your couch accidentally falls flat. But the milk was messed up, and it had some value in the theaters. <br /> <br /> When the floor ripped off the passenger seats, I expected the passengers to stick their legs through the hole, starting Flintstones-Style, to land the plane safely in the Alps. I have. It would fit into the stupid camping theme of the rest of the show. <br /> <br /> Instead of showing the obvious physical impossibilities of the movie, how about social incompetence? So as to calm down George Kennedy's character to the news that his date was a whore? Even in 1979, a man would not easily accept the idea that he had just poured out his heart on a paid companion. He presumably felt that he had a relationship with a related spirit, which later became a mercenary sex worker with a come-to-line. Who will NOT be seduced by the experience? And yet he giggled and folded his arms around his mate's waist as they cheerfully walked away. What a cheap wrap-up of a messy scene. Ouch. <br /> <br /> I had an appetite for souffl√©, and served spicy spicy spicy pancakes. And no, you didn't deliberately do it!
