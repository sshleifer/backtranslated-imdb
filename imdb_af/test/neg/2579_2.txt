Steven Seagal's intention is to be praised, and his action in this film is similar to that of many of his others if you ignore the fact that he is allegedly portraying a brilliant scientist. The problem I had was with two items of the plot, which extended my suspension of unbelief outside the breakpoint. <br /> <br /> First, how is it that careful design variation on a nasty germ, which the antidote should be Just as carefully researched and invaded by a large laboratory, is cured by tea from a flower growing high in the mountains, drinking? and that grandfather's family seems to be the only people who know something about this? <br /> <br /> Secondly, and this one really takes the cake: Getting enough of the cure to repair a whole town, Did you expect the army to land the helicopter and all the houses in this small town with all the houses must start? No, they decide to sprinkle the flowers around the city and force the sick to go out and collect them again. Just foolish, unless the power in the drug somehow depends on the fact that someone went out and collected the flowers themselves. <br /> <br /> Add in the cardboard nature of the villains and the inappropriate title, and you can think my voice on this movie is really high.
