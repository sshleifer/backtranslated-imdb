I stayed in the East End of London for three months in the last half of 1987, when the show was up for almost two years. It was considered a running joke there. <br /> <br /> Why? Because it had an all-white casting. Each company and extra in the first few years was white. <br /> <br /> The street where I lived was a long one with over 800 homes and to my knowledge I was one of only three or four white faces living on that street. We were at the corner of the Indian and Turkish "quarters", and even if you excluded these two races, the Asians and Afro-Caribbean exceeded the white people twenty-one. And of course, of the very few people who * lived in the area, * were the most shots like me. A cockney accent has never been heard. <br /> <br /> It wasn't a racist rant, just a simple factual statement. The BBC also couldn't be bothered to cross London to do their research before they wrote this soap, otherwise they only available white actors and decided to bluff it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, as I say, in the east end of the time, we considered it a comedy program. :-)
