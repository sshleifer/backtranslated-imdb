What does West think about making this dribble? It doesn't look good with any of his other work, but he fell into a slight downturn after making an A Nightmare On Elm Street. It can be seen by its follow ups 1. Invatation to Hell 2.Chiller 3.Hills has eyes II 4.Deadly Friend 5.Serpant and the Rainbow 6.Shocker all these movies were either mediocre our crap it was until people under the stairs that he regained his momentum and started kicking again. Chiller it himself does not have one of Craven's regular and no tensions. The only good scene when the old man had a heart attack on the stairs after he had stabbed his work.
