This movie is about people living at a trailer. Later in the movie it becomes clear that those people come outside workers, mainly old men. Well, they sit around the whole movie and talk about f *** ing. but there is never any action, only those people talk. In the beginning I thought it was some cool twisted redneck stuff, but after a while it became boring. I mean, how many versions can you think to say f *** ing, d ** k & c ** t? For sure, it can be funny - maybe for half an hour, not 80 minutes. but it was funny to watch those people try to act. I'm pretty sure they regularly read their text on a skin when they play. but it doesn't disturb the movie, it's so cool. because those individuals look so poor, f *** ed-up, crestfallen a *** oles that suits the style completely. their wood, helpless reading of the texts makes a very good atmosphere, I fell in love with the characters a bit. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER AHEAD *** Later in the movie the f *** ers do some comedy shows (rhymes about f *** ing) with only themselves as audience and imagined applause. Then one gets an eviction advice and decides to defend the trailer and enter their roofs - armed with a few weapons. then they shoot. fin. sounds like action, but it is not. just take a little housewife. *** SPOILER END *** <br /> <br /> but the movie was completely followed in its style and I'm pretty sure it's just what the movie maker wanted. This is the portrait of the f ** k-ups in a coarse home camera style with characters that cannot perform, but looks interesting personalities so they are great to watch. But the texts are over - you know what - all the time being boring after a while. <br /> <br /> beautiful young director who also looks like an interesting person, as he has played some teenage stuff in popular movies / TV series but now has more horror movies, which is more his cup of tea I. And it will now be distributing its first direction effort through the troma. know nothing about a release, I have this one as a "trainer" of this year cannes who says "just for start-up purposes".
