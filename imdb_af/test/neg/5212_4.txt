I recently saw it at the 2007 Palm Springs International Film Festival and I can't believe it's Sweden's official submission to the 79th Academy Awards to be considered for the best foreign film. Producer Anna Anthony also presented Sweden's official presentation for best foreign film with Zozo last year. I wasn't personally a fan of Zozo, but at least had some production value for it. It can be shot as a high school film project. As a short movie it can work, but as a movie it is as lost as it is characters. It is a story of twenty-five people living in a small Swedish town, with no goals or hopes or aspirations for the future and who have lived in the past for their long-standing childhood. In fact, Falkenberg is not like a remote northern Swedish town. It is a popular summer resort with a population of town and townships of nearly 40,000 and is located between two major southern coastal Swedish cities of GÃ¶tborg and Malmo. The characters are nice enough guys, but if they were high school boys with a dark or confused attitude about what they were going to do with their lives, I would definitely not care about them anymore. However, they are long past the point where they have to make plans to handle maturity. If they want to stay forever in Falkenberg, surely have to work in the tourist or fishing industry, instead of just drinking, drinking, smoking and sometimes painting a house. Maybe if they hang out with a girl or two in their circle of friends, the girls are completely absent who don't make sense. Jesper Ganslandt makes his legal message and co-wrote the film with the kinographer, of which I use the term loosely, Fredrik Wenzel. the acting is not bad. I'll give it a 4.5 out of 10, but despite the submission for consideration for the Academy Awards, I wouldn't recommend it.
