Most American remake of European films is pretty poor, but it's in its own league. In fact, it can even be the worst (Sandra Bullock) movie ever made. I thought I could have passed it, because just another innocent bad Hollywood thriller did not see the Dutch original, SPORLLOOS. The altered end here is stupid enough (and performed with particular inefficiency), but a much worse crime than it is removing all the intelligence and depth of character that marked the original as a classic. The real horror found here is in the fact that the same man who runs RAILWAY is responsible for this atrocity. Will the real George Sluizer please rise?
