I knew well when I rented this DVD, that it could well be one of the worst movies I saw in my life. But to say it was one of the worst movies I ever watched, it will lighten up. I wonder if there are no legal steps that can be taken against the individuals who allowed this movie. I mean, the finance had to come from somewhere, someone had to make money to make it! ?? <br /> <br /> I would identify several production values ​​that led to the failure of this movie, but this movie has defeated every production standard in the universe. I couldn't make it through the whole movie, as I began to obscure the horrible filming techniques. Neither can I tell you how many scenes I just zoned because of the inexplicable terrible dialogue. <br /> <br /> I feel like I've been permanently alive. If you watched this movie before getting this warning, think about starting a support group with me for the poor people who saw this monstrosity.
