I have never seen a more unrealistic movie if this dirty piece is missing. The acting was over. The direction was tough and amateurish. The writing was just a joke. The story was watched by a person who has never been to a high school soccer match, much less a professional game. And why did Oliver Stone feel the need to place himself in this movie as an actor? He was terrible and ever played the most unrealistic announcer. He couldn't even be hired to do professional wrestling. Then you have Jamie Foxx, who throws like a girl. But he is a bit more athletic than the old Dennis Quaid. Stone seriously wanted to send this movie to 16-year-old men with ADD. That's why we hear the loud music, the quick cuts and many changes. It just became a bad MTV video. Shame on Al Pacino to do this crap. Cameron Diaz? Heck, that no talent plays a role that comes in the pike. When Lawrence Taylor is the best "actor" you do, well, your movie sucks! And this one does.
