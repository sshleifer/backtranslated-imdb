I was advised to recommend this movie by one of my filming friends and therefore expected something good. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in the first half - ah, a movie about a wimp that takes revenge on their ** hole boss, however original - and looks at the second half at a fast pace and hopes to find something that justifies the 45 -The minutes I've messed up already. But all I get is the "shock" that ends ... <br /> <br /> The basic problem is that it's a movie that can't decide what it means, and say whatever it says (hard to tell what it is) bad. Great plays don't save a bad writing full of characters I can't care about. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if I didn't have moonlight in the movie industry, I'd be shocked to discover the stupid politics and exploitation going on behind the screen, but as it is, my feelings are as summarized above. : 'Ho Hum'. <br /> <br /> 2/10 ... would have been 1/10 if not for acting and paper cutting scene.
