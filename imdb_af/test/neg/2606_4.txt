When Family Guy was first placed, I was not in a discriminating mood. With the 1990s with a wealth of smart, surrealistic cartoons, why should I be? Nickelodeon produced Doug; Ren and Stimpy and Rockos Modern Life among other fine cartoons (Yes, it includes Spongebob). Everyone had impressive, dreamy animation and surprisingly sophisticated stories and dialogue. The Simpsons has become a direct phenomenon, perhaps not as brilliant as its biggest defenders claim it, but a very good investment of your time and certainly rejects the fake axioms that all TVs have wasted. South Park started out as a rough but hilarious attack on everything with unique and intelligent satire underneath. It has evolved to become a Monty Python-esquire show with outrageous concepts and brutally fast and sharp social criticism (such as their defense of the noble underpants) and eventually settled to be completely self-referring and "meta" like the Simpsons , and unfortunately jumped the shark. Family Guy is superficial like The Simpsons and South Park. It pushes buttons and is a favorite among college students and bestiality enthusiasts. But what it has in loquacity doesn't have it in true white. <br /> <br /> The show is known for using gimmicks, especially for flashbacks. Many are references to bad TV sitcoms or advertisements. Some are funny (especially from the first two seasons), most are not. Are references inherently funny? I'm not sure, but they are mostly what the show is because their characters are painfully uninteresting. Where Homer and Bart have charm, and Cartman has an artillery of self-awareness and pure shame to support his terrible behavior, Peter Griffin has no excuse. He's just a hard, unpleasant pig. Anything funny coming from his character is just because the writers forget how to be unfunny that day. Lois is also very shallow and boring; Meg is a prop, just to be abused; Chris is borderline and sometimes just funny, and the two main stars of the show (Stewie and Brian) are so contradictory in their characterization that it is all really useless. <br /> <br /> I can't stand other mopeds when a character indicates something clear and hangs for an awkward long time. This happens very recently, and I can't carry it anymore. Not only the often called chicken that Peter wants to defeat, I speak of the painful moments when they talk about pop culture and produce it as if they were strangers. It's not white or even ironic humor, it's completely boring and lifeless. <br /> <br /> Not that the show can't be funny, in fact, some of the previous episodes ran me. Highlights include the pilot section, where Peter becomes reality after losing his precious television; when Peter's religious zeal appears and causes destruction; When Peter becomes a clown at Megs school, and the "pancake" section. I suspect these are the episodes that inadvertently included real human traits in his characters, or just times the writers were real comic inspiration. <br /> <br /> One last thing, the show isn't offensive. It's just offensive to those who won't watch the show in the first place, so it's almost like a circle screen on the hipster choir.
