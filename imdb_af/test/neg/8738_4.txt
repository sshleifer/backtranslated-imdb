MASTER PLAN: has the winning team in a deadly tournament. One of several artistic action photos that attempted to capture the taste of the famous 'Enter the Dragon' of '73, this is an attempt by South Africa. The villain's fortress is a little different, appearing from a distance as a white castle-like fortress in the middle of the desert. The villain himself, a Baron or General, is a slightly more perverse version of the "Dr. No" or Han-form of master villain, with strange flashbacks to the glory days of Nazi Germany. He wears the full regalia Nazi uniform at certain points. His main ambition in life is to hold an illegal martial arts competition / tournament against his Japanese rival, an extension of their complicity in World War II (my army is better than your army). It sounds stupid and that is, although the suggestion of madness and mad machismo almost works. The central hero, Steve Chase (Ryan), looks like a white Bruce Lee character, with a similar, light, light body, but of course not at the same level of martial arts expertise. I thought he would be a secret government agent here, but apparently not. He and his girlfriend joined the Baron team's fighters, but decided to stop (what did they think they were in?). Of course, it's not that easy. There is a strange sequence of those escaping through the desert, with a destroyed car with a targeted sail. The desert winds can do wonders for traveling. The plot seems to be kissing in the 2nd half as the hero joins the rogue's rival team and the girl is held hostage by the villain in a cell, under threat of rape by the hero's rival. The most interesting character seems to be Chico, a dwarf who is the villain; He is faithful to the Baron, but sympathetic to the fate of the hero. Many of the battles use the ballet-like abilities of the hero, with lots of jumps and slow motion. The sound FX is also amplified and exaggerated in an effort to add more impact to the bladder. There are some good battles during the tournament towards the climax, but no one really stands out. If one had to choose, I think the best involves the brutal man of the baron of the Baron, who is introduced late in the story (he lifts the back of a car at one point). You wonder how the hero will eventually take him out, as the brute shuts off most of the bumps. The play is very mediocre, descending into the camp to the girl, who tends to laugh for no reason, as if she is tall on grass, though she is very cute. Some of the practice scenes are also champions, especially all the guys who walk or roll over the desert. And with such a title, there are surprisingly few real murders. Ryan, as Steve Chase, returned as a traditional agent in the following "Kill and Kill Again."
