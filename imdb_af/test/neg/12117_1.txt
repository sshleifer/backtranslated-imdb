Evening with Jonathan Ross now means to me his white in the first hassling and confusion with carefully chosen words a 78-year-old man by phone and then he and Russell Brand have to break him and masturbate as he sleeps as a way to Too bad for making obscene calls to him. Kinky! And illegal. For a very big laugh, maybe next time he should try to know someone he knows well, like his boss? Or a follower of Abu Hamza? Would he be amused if someone did it to one of his daughters? <br /> <br /> Over the years I've seen less than 30 minutes of BBC Star Man Ross's talk show, because I find him so horrible, some of the guests I've seen were OK - probably, most of those who ever appeared were OK for everything I know. As a talk show, it looks rather poor, though? What's so crazy about asking Tory leader David Cameron on this TV show if he ever masturbated photos of Margaret Thatcher? He talked to Gwyneth Paltrow by just asking her if she wanted him. But Ross's mentality is ultimately completely exposed to the above revelations and I thought I would take the opportunity to warn the few decent people around the world who may not just know how dirty this man is and about him and her - unless you think all the comedy should be "edgy", ie obscene / empty. We are not the same here, although BBC and Channel 4 are all changing standards. <br /> <br /> In October 2008, Ross joined fellow singer Russell Brand to a series of up-front sexual obsessions calls to Andrew Sachs' answer phone (Manuel of Fawlty Towers), broadcast it as intended on BBC national Radio against Sachs' request and then tried to get Sachs granddaughter to burn the evidence if they were prosecuted. A significant number of people here (probably most of their non-license fee payers in the BBC) found it screaming and / or the national scandal was blown away, but many people still apparently knew rightly wrong and 42,851 eventually complained to the BBC about the incident. Many unfair media fools and others have clipped over this 42,851 who have never heard the radio program (and never want it). With their arguments, they presumably also suspect an event such as the Holocaust justified because at that time there were relatively few people complaining to the media and none of us here should be terrified because we were not there. The 2 BBC producers who were initially involved in broadcasting broadcast thought it was "very funny and brilliant" comedy and only 2 people complained about Brand's radio program at the time - what I fear is just the moral level indicated what its 400,000 weekly listeners sank. getting with the help of BBC expertise. Many moral BBC tried to use it in mitigation in the later OFCOM investigation. Role over Aristotle, Lord Reith tells the news! Sachs agent complained to the BBC but was ignored by them until a national newspaper Tory got the story. The punishment for any ordinary pervert it does will usually be dismissal and prosecution, perhaps even the prison, but while Brand and BBC Radio 2's chief were finally ordered to resign the multi-millionaire, Ross had a 12- given weekends by the BBC's boss. I suppose he first asked Ross's consent, although he could pay Ross's £ 1,500,000 payment, to prevent him from returning to the program in 2009 before ending his contract. All the time to think of more smudge and / or more insulting whiteness for his 4 000 000 viewers to admire - but at least he can still breathe his way to the bank, to stop his spirits. Some people think his position will be untenable and he will not be able to continue. I think his skin is so thick because the input is so high that it is returned and refurbished with a refurbished vitriol. (Update 23.01.09: I only watched the first 5 minutes of his new series - the "biggest cock-up" - to use his reference phrases - continues to allow this sniper-illegal law-breaker to get the public's money take it like this.) But who knows: maybe in the future, after the clever British film and TV industry comforted him for the moral attitude the 42,851 had given him with awards, he would become a gentleman for his services to Perversion by the perverts in government. At least, I hope these few edgy deviants continue to live and stay with other distorted commercial TV and radio stations, so I won't pay for them to disregard the law and spit out illegal ambiguities in the future. In 2009, OFCOM fined the British TV license fee payers £ 150,000 for this "sorry" case. Thanks Ross for offering to pay! Not. <br /> <br /> To the apologists: Get a life / sense of humor / sense of relationship! It's not the end of the world that has a few talented perverts as your heroes and there are much more important things to worry about in this world, like the price of real cheese! Summary of the family man Dross: A comedy genius to seemingly receive millions of people (especially himself), just a nasty obscene caller who obtains an obscene wage package from an obscure multimedia company to others. So much for our society of Political Correctness and Respect! As you would guess, it does not apply to the rich and famous and will never, but only to the poor. Summary BBC: Blindly stumble upon Huttongate, Campbellgate, Dykegate, Springergate, Crowngate, Phonegate now Rossgate I hope his next crisis will be Abolitiongate. I also hope that anyone who thinks comedy should always be challenging and push back borders, ie offensive, is not challenged or offended by my opinion of this particular law enforcement, its distorted programs and its current distorted employers.
