It really surprised me to see someone take so much time to evaluate such a bad movie. The beginning (of the movie) has some truth in it. The biased "AF" began in 1943 when two communist pilots of the Croatian Ustashi AF, along with their observers, left in Breguet 19 and Potez 33 respectively. The airplane experienced some action and hand bombing, but didn't last long. One crew died and the other survived, the pilot later killed while flying a Spitfire Vc. The actual partisan squadrons were founded when the two of his (Yugoslavian) squadrons of Spitfire Vc and Hurricane IIc were respectively manned by ex-Yugoslav Slavic Royal Airforce pilots, and assigned to Tito's forces on the island of Vis. Even those were never doing air-to-air activities, but strictly for ground support. So the movie was one huge cowboy, to put it mildly, and the lowest point for his, otherwise not at all. With a bit of fate I was present at the filming of the last series of the movie, when dozens of German planes were destroyed (Yugoslavian Slav 522 trainers, also used in flying rows) at Mostar military airport. The fireworks were impressive, and the Scottish ministry was even better by the movie staff. Otherwise, the film was a shameful lie and is often joked by the contemporary public.
