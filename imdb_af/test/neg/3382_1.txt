Okay, so when a friend told me that he had to send MM2 and MM3, I thought I had to see Monster Man and see how it was, maybe I could take part in it, but when I arrived in my DVD player and trying to hide from the first 45 minutes, but bad, bad, I mean terribly annoying bad comedy of that fat ass, he thinks is funny, not to mention how well the director spent on the inexorable desert road trip not, I came to the conclusion that these guys didn't have an idea of ​​what they did and missed the boat with a long shot. The story has the potential to be somewhat different from the ordinary BS you see on the Blockbuster / Hollywood Video shelf that was eliminated by the Lions gate today, but they surely messed it up. Why put so much time and effort into shooting annoyingly bad plays and bad jokes, why shorten the road trip and put more of the plot into the movie. Myabe's writing was so bad that they had to cut out a lot of the movie or maybe the director didn't shoot enough of the horror and gore, that they had to get filler to make the usual 84 minutes ???? All in all, and I'm easy here, maybe because a friend of mine is the naked redhead in the bar scene that gets his skull bruised when the three are pursued. I'll try it for at least 1 star, and the gore / kill scenes weren't that bad, again they tried. Badly, Lions Gate could have created a cool franchise for this idea, but failed. I do not recommend renting it, maybe you can find a cut-off version where the hitch hiker movie starts. CRAP!
