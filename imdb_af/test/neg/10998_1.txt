If you like really shocking movies, it's for you. The acting is the worst I have ever seen and the story line is not true. If you come to this movie in your video store, don't even consider borrowing it. The chick on the front is not even the one in the movie. I gave this movie only 1/10 because I couldn't vote. Avoid it at all costs.
