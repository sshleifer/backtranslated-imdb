As other reviewers have noted, this movie is a cross between (stolen from) stories we've seen before. Specifically, it looks like Clint Eastwood inserted into High Plains Drifter in Mad Max. Remove Clint's cigar and replace with a cigarette; remove his horse and give him a high-tech motorcycle, and voila, an updated driver. In this movie, the "hero" is even more blatantly a "Savior" than High Plains Drifter. Now our hero has a long brown hair, a wound on his left, and his access to the town is preceded by a plea for "rescue" by the surviving townspeople - a pretty transparent reference to a "return". I watched the movie on a hot, humid morning. Sleep was impossible and at 4:30 there was nothing else on TV. The film therefore served its purpose. While the original, with characters that are almost comic caricatures, the movie is rather entertaining ... at least at 4:30 in the morning.
