I realize why people hate this movie. And I hate Blair Witch Project, so go figure? It's about as advanced as it gets and yes, they insult your intelligence by trying to make it look real. I really liked the Madame Lalaurie story, but it's probably made better. But the main reason I like this movie is fake or not when the ghosts start attacking and kidnapping, I get chill bumps every time and have to look after me because it feels like I'm with me. I know it's my imagination. but hey, more than half of the bravery in today's theaters and DVDs, doesn't give me goosebumps. This makes it a terrible joy. Not for everyone, because skeptics will hate it and not for gorehounds like a PG-13 rating there are no gore. And the females are very irritating! You would wish the ghosts would take them down and experiment on them before all this was said and done. ** from *****.
