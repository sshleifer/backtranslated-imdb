I never read the book. Now I don't really want it. I had no idea what this movie was about when I walked into the theater. I still don't really know what it's supposed to be about, but I know a good two hours of my life is wasted. Two precious hours I can never come back to. <br /> <br /> The storyline was so predictable, it's laughing. Werewolves ... or something ... a lot of Romeo and Juliet type plot. I predicted the end within five minutes in the movie. And I was correct. <br /> <br /> The acting is not terrible. The only two cool characters in the movie were the British cousin and the Rambo graphic novel. The other characters are also ... the dialogue is very fleshy and predictable. <br /> <br /> The absolute WORST part of the movie is the transformations between the "people" and the "wolves". If you want something like Van Helsings, you're really upset. Imagine Ballerinas, a bright light, then a wolf. Yep ... it's about it. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Period. Especially when you read the book, because you just want to hit babies.
