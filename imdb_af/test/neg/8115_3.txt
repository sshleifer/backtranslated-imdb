While it is extremely dated, I have to insist on it. PLEASE, NO REPAIR! Frankly, it just won't help as there is nothing that can be added or changed to make it cinematic better. <br /> <br /> The novel on which it is based was atmospheric, well-written, truly spooky work, but on film, it just doesn't translate. Most of King's written masterpieces fail to translate to film. I'm not sure why it is, but if you look at this work, you'll probably just see what I mean when you see it. <br /> <br /> The book? It's wonderful. It's not a masterpiece, but it's more than just entertaining. <br /> <br /> The movie? Do something else. You can thank me later. <br /> <br /> It amounts to a 3.1 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy :.
