This is one of the films that killed the "spaghetti" western. It doesn't just lose something in the translation, it's also a total chaotic mess of editing. Or pieces of it were published and edited for an English version. Anyway, it makes little or no sense, period. It makes the "Trinity" and the Eastwood "Man With No Name" movies look like John Ford / John Wayne in comparison. Nothing in this movie is original. Somewhere there is a beginning, a middle, and an end. Except for the end, everything is not exactly in that order. Robert Wood seems appropriate. The rest of the cast, especially the women, had to make better career choices.
