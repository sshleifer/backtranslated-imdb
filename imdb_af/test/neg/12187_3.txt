After all the hype I heard from the Jane Austin novel and various movie versions of the book, I was very disappointed with the movie. I expected a classic drama, but that was not the case. First of all, I leave my review with the fact that I like old movies, especially riddles and dramas, but not female-oriented films. It certainly makes a big difference, so take my review with a big salt grain. I thought the acting was a bit at the top, but it is very common in films of this era. June Allyson was good as Jo, but I found every sister to be stereotypical and form-driven. There were no surprises or too dramatic moments. I hate writing negative reviews, but the movie left me very cold. It has always been my intention to read the book, but then it seems unlikely. The only heating storyline was between the old men and the youngest sister. It was a very welcome bright spot in an otherwise disappointing viewing experience. Again there are others who like this movie, I'm just not one of them.
