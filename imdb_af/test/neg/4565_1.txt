I thought I could only get a few laughs from this long stretched movie, but was sadly disappointed. This movie is about losers who spend most of their time trying to get a pass rate, even trying to open a book or to do something. The film also portrayed teachers and principal, Mary Tyler Moore (Mrs. Stark), "Labor Pains", 2000 as complete idiots. I know it was supposed to be a comedy, but it never made me laugh and I thought the whole movie was a COMPLETE WASTE! However, all the actors have performed excellently and have the difficult task of making this movie a pleasant and entertaining movie! Usually studying and getting good grades for college is the only way to go!
