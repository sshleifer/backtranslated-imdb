The movie started very well. So far Isabelle's exorcism can be believed .... but later, gosh !!! I didn't know if it was a horror movie, a drama or a Do Not! The injured creatures who attacked the sheriff had nothing to do with the movie .... the make-up !! Well, it really looks right at the beginning, but in the end the last part of the film, the make-up (especially teeth and eyes) was very exaggerated. If you want a good "Exorcism" movie look, "The Exorcism of Emily Rose". <br /> <br /> Along with "Hard Candy" (Totally boring, pathetic plot and end), these two movies are the worst. I saw Lionsgate !! But, the movie company has given horror movie fans great movies, but with this one you'll want to never rent! Exorcism movie fans just stay with two "The Exorcist" and "Emily Rose's Exorcism"
