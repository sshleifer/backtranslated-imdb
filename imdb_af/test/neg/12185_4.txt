It was next to Jill Ireland's last movie appearance, which died after four decades as a well-known actress and producer in 1990. Ireland made a number of waves in the press when she abandoned her former husband, David McCallum, in 1967, with her long relationship with Charles Bronson. It is a great irony that Bronson, probably the everyday leader in the on-screen deaths, had one of the most enduring marriages in film history. <br /> <br /> 'Murder' seems to be a movie. It was stopped in Cannon's production schedule for Bronson and Ireland. Ireland suffered from cancer-related illnesses already in 1987, and you can almost imagine the two actors who "just want one more, for the old", almost. "Murder" is indifferent as a whole, showing the lack of polish and thirsty funds that Cannon could dilute by 1990. But there's a kind of nostalgic value to see the couple once together and the movie makes you wonder what exactly a relationship to survive in the chaos that is Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Bronson plays Jay Killian, a coveted secret service agent dedicated to protecting First Lady, Lara Craig (Ireland). The president's wife has a reputation of being difficult to operate, service providers and wanting to do things in her own way. All this, however, changes when efforts are made on her life and she must travel with Killian by car, train, motorcycle and believe it or not, dune motorcycle to escape would be murderers. There is little surprise here, as Killian believes the killers are part of a court, perhaps arranged by the President himself. By the way, Killian a mrs. Craig develops an unspoken love for each other in scenes between Bronson and Ireland which is actually very funny. <br /> <br /> What I really get is how this movie was promoted during its release and how it's still made to look like a DVD. The original trailer gives you the feeling that 'Murder' is another cold-hearted Bronson shoot-up. But much of this movie, which was PG-13 at hand, is in a comical year, placing it in the sense of a romantic thriller like Bronson and Ireland's western 'From Noon Till Three'. Even the DVD case shows Bronson with a rocket driver ready to blow it up. What he does, but to a lesser extent than his other 80's potboilers. <br /> <br /> Generally, "Murder" causes Cannon to work scrap and doesn't really know what kind of movie it wants to be. Except for the drift of action to a romantic thriller and again, there are serious errors in continuity, property values ​​are cheap, and the effects are terrible; Many of the explosions look like carpet rather than being done in place. Robert Ragland, who has shown good skills in earlier films, worked with Valentine McCallum on a score that is mostly synthesized and better suited to television. <br /> <br /> Richard Sale's script has real lulus of dialogue, with the talks between Bronson and Ireland being the only brightest place. There is no explanation why the First Lady is suddenly called "One Momma" and also why Ireland is left with her British accent if the character is a Wyoming resident. Jan Gan Boyd, who plays Killian's chief assistant, has a kitten-like personality and is poorly mistaken as a federal agent. Stephen Elliott (a former Tony Award nominee who died in May 2005), Randy Brooks, Erik Stern (as assassin Bracken) and Michael Ansara (Senator Bunsen) are acceptable in their supporting roles. <br /> <br /> By the way, This was the last movie director for Peter Hunt, who broke up on the scene in 1969 with 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' and with Bronson and Lee Marvin on 'Death Hunt' in 1981. 'Murder' is available on DVD by MGM Home Entertainment; It is presented in dual widescreen and standard format with three-language subtitles and scenes. <br /> <br /> ** from 4
