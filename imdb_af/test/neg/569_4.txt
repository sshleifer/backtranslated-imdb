I like most of the dialogue, I like the cast, I thought it was well done. I especially enjoyed Ellen DeGeneres' perfect death team performance. <br /> <br /> What didn't work for me was: (1) the prolonged relationship with the younger man (too long, apparently out of character for Helen), (2) the seemingly endless movie clich√©s, mostly visually but including unlimited statements about readings of the love letter itself (its content should have a mystery); (3) a young woman feminist scholar and ironically a fireworks scene (no wonder I remembered how to make an American Quilt movie); (4) the bumbling "gotcha" cop who "smells" everywhere (also no cliche there!); and (5) a fascinating romantic village. <br /> <br /> I would have preferred the movie to investigate the source of (or even glorified) Helen's bitterness more wisely, to include more of DeGeneres' character, to eliminate or interrupt the various intergenerational artworks. reduced, and a little less critical about the small town. <br /> <br /> Once it has been developed as a play, criticism can be addressed before the material is used for This film, which is unfortunately definitely mediocre.
