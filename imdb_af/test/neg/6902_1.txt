I can't get any value loss for this movie. It seems to be loosely based on the Lion King mindset. Father is killed, son cannot fill his shoes and try to run away, etc. Etc. Etc. The only difference (except being in a barn instead of a jungle) is that Barnyard is trying to make things with club-type music. They go all over the top to try to be cool. The problem is that it's not really cool. It's like "that man". Everybody knows at least one of the "guys" who are older and still cohesive with the younger crowd in a useless attempt to cling to their youth. They're trying to be cool to fit in, but it's really not. It's this movie. <br /> <br /> But if you have money to burn, and you feel like paying someone to suck away 90 minutes of life, don't let me stop.
