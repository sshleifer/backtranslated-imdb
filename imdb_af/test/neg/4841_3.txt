It is said to be the first Polish western and written and directed by Piotr Uklanski. This film is known in the US as DEATH MAN'S BOUNTY. It uses some strange visual art to tell a story that is short on dialogue. Val Kilmer plays a corpse and some scenes are through his dead eyes. Some awkward visual situations are actually comical in a sick way. My favorite is a young man who builds a bunch of one's own fingers and actually fixes himself to test the power of the rope. A cowboy known only as "the stranger" (Charles Roden), finds a dead man (Kilmer) who, according to him, is a popular man. He took him to the nearest town to gather the abundance. He ends the corpse and loses the potential bounty in a gambling match with the town's drunken sheriff (Boguslaw Linda) and has turned the few village groups against him if he has a bravery with the barmaid (Katarzyna Figura). He manages to escape death and lead the little ones to a dangerous 'wild goose' hunt. One scene has the stranger who is prone to a scalp wound through crawling powder and a match. It looks like rocks chained to a hitching post when the sheriff finds out that there has been no bounty. This movie, also known as SOMER LOVE, sang a ghostly theme song by John Davidson. Yet these western ones are like a train wreck. There's just something that tells you not to look ... but you do.
