** Spoiler * It gives the very irrelevant end ** <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this movie there was a brief intro for the world of gore by the master of gore films, H.G. Lewis. He talked about how this film was lost, and then found years after the director's death. He also talked about how gore films are measured by the amount of stage blood used in it. Bloodfees was a 2 liter, 10,000 Maniacs was a 5 gallon. But then he goes and claims that dr. Gore was a 15 liter. I want to know where half of the 15 liters went. When I watched the movie, I saw very little nearly 15 liters. Agreed, there was a fairly large amount of blood, but not nearly 15 liters. Some of the showtimes were definitely beautiful and realistic, meat cuts and all but I wouldn't say 15 liters. <br /> <br /> "END !!! ENNNNNNNNNDDDDDD !!!" Does this sound familiar? This is what you should have said near the last half of this movie. After the Igor character was thrown into the acid bath, the film slowed down to a painful creep. There was no coherent end as it did not provide the 90 minutes before it. She was in a bus ride with a total stranger, BIG DEAL! This is what happens if you keep an individual (I will not tell anyone, because she does not qualify as a person) very innocent of the world around her. The doctor teaches the girl that a man should be loved so that everyone who meets her loves her. <br /> <br /> Although HG Lewis told us at the beginning of the movie that we may not like the play, directing, or even the gore ... I go with choices A and B. SAVING !! It was enough to give my bad dreams of slimming and people with bright eyes while talking to one person. But I made it through the movie and came out stronger. Bad I couldn't say the same after I completed ROBO C.H.I.C. <br /> <br /> It was a BAD movie. I can usually take my doses of vinegar in good speed, but every time you get a movie that bites. I think this movie has taken an arm or a leg (haha ... * sigh *) Admittedly, I enjoyed the stare off screens, where the good doctor stared at his future victims and really opened his eyes wide and not staring. It was very similar to Fuad Ramseys in Blood Feast when he stared at that lady in his catering shop and didn't use his power afterwards. I think this movie picks up where Fuad's forces stopped. <br /> <br /> * Final Judgment * The movie had to be lost. Good day <br /> <br /> -Scott
