Good effort to tackle the unconventional topic of May-December romance. However, the treatment is completely unrealistic. Sure, sixty-six-year-old men can and fall for younger women, but they are usually mature women with whom they share common interests and values ​​and views ... not neurotic, immature, underage girls. Of course there are exceptions, and they are called close to pedophiles! Sorry RGV, but it is not credible that a healthy and completed sex genius will throw a comfortable family life and become a joke to his friends ... for an 18-year-old who does not have a practical thought not and that acts like an unstable escape from a spiritual institution. You don't need to have a PhD in Psychology to see that Amitabh's character is being seduced by sex and that the young woman has unresolved abandonment and daddy issues. <br /> <br /> As for the repetitive scene of Vijay, the edge of a wreath, contemplating suicide, is about as close to everything that comes with Jiah, acting like a bang teenager. <br /> <br /> On a positive note, the actors did a good job work and cinematography well.
