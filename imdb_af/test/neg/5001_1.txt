I'm not sure what the appeal of this movie is, but I couldn't find it. It's a very long, hardly credible, scarce lucid conversation between three guys on one set. <br /> <br /> It doesn't move anywhere, the characters are just totally bizarre, the underlying chart is the same. It's lost on me, definitely an outing movie. <br /> <br /> The one thing that runs you to walk is the ever-unrealized possibility that it may have a kind of point or meaningful climax, and the fact that, All annoyance aside from the banal personalities, they has acted reasonably well. But you need to strengthen yourself for an endless dialogue, which many times wish Teach would close the% * & * for a moment.
