"The Cellar" is an unbearably dull and excessively child-friendly 80's cheese parade, led by Kevin Tenney (creator of the much better movies "Witchboard" and "Night of the Demons") and the incredibly undisputed Patrick Kilpatrick, who allegedly man with feelings. The pacing is very slow, the plot feels too familiar, the sample effects are all but fossilized and the film opens and ends with boring narrative channel that somehow does not relate to the real subject of the movie. The voice-over keeps on the wind and creatures driving on the wind, but what is the wind in the plot? Like so many 80's horror movies, "The Cellar" deals with cursed Indian landscapes and all too real mythical monsters hidden in cellars and chicks. Mance Cashen and his family moved into a home that was built on what was formerly home to Native Americans, but then white people came and changed the country to oil fields. Half of the writing is wasted to explain the origin of the sample, but I can easily sum it up: an old Indian gatekeeper called the creature (which looks like an excessive paper mâché gear) around the white people overwhelmed over his country, but he buried it again because, and I quote, the SOB also kills Indians. Mance's extremely annoying son accidentally awakens the animal and cannot, of course, convince his parents of the big hungry mess in the basement. The alleged emotional family situation (Daddy wants his son to love him continually) is very pathetic and redundant and the film needs even more bloodshed. children's film or not. The youthful hero (Chris Miller) is rather annoying, but we definitely saw worse kids in the 80's. "The Cellar" is highly recommended unless of course you are a fan of cheese and typically 80's sample designs. The big dodgy gear thing is a real hoot to see.
