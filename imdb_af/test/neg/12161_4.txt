I went to see this movie because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to go. <br /> <br /> We both tried to watch our watches well before the movie ended, to see how much we had to endure. Two hours and six minutes, that is. It is about equally divided between battle scenes (about a dozen of them, more or less interchangeable) and plot development. <br /> <br /> One would have thought that the subject is the son of a minor chief who overcomes half the world, plot would have been relatively easy. There is a fair amount of raw material that can be a good story. But the authors flew it completely. We don't get any real history. Rather, we get a Hollywood version of history. <br /> <br /> What does young Temudjin retain by its long - almost endless, actually, or so - looks to the viewer - tribulations? Why, the love of a good woman, of course. <br /> <br /> How's he going out of jail? Well, an old monk who recognizes his innate goodness and greatness stretches across the continent to take this good woman a talisman who symbolizes Temudjin's love for her, dead dead, just near enough to find her as he is there. lies. , talisman in his hand. And of course she goes and becomes (inexplicably) rich and powerful, saves him. <br /> <br /> How does he escape from the handcuffs? Well, he goes down to the shrine of the great wolf god Tengri (or such a name) and Tengri sets him free by magic. Yes, right. <br /> <br /> Why does he want to become the ruler of the Mongols? The wolf god again, apparently. Go on Temudjin to ask for guidance, and - surprise! surprise! He gets it. "Laws," he says to himself. "What the Mongols need is laws. Good, simple." Golly, it was impressive. <br /> <br /> And finally, how does he win the decisive battle against his rival's stronger powers? Better tactics, surely, but also using the good old wolf god who sends a storm to the height of the battle. All the troops giggle like the thunder rolls and the lightning flashes (Mongols are afraid of thunder, you see) - but not our Temudin. The troops, dedicated entirely by his bravery, honor him king! <br /> <br /> I don't know what causes people to produce this type of garbage. The funny thing is that it is washed up with all kinds of eager realism: lots of sneaking of milk, dirt and violence. It's as if the producers of this movie wanted to get the trivial stuff right, so the viewers wouldn't see how childless some of the big things are. <br /> <br /> There is plenty of violence in graphic proximity: slashing impulses, blood jets, bloodshots, clouds of blood - actually the blood guys had a good time. Despite realism, it is impossible to take seriously. <br /> <br /> I have to call the ridiculous CGI final battle scene. How someone can think these things look realistic is beyond me. They don't. Oh, and it's all shot in the standard Hollywood style - breathtaking panoramas for the spectacular scenery, and the super-close Stedicam stuff for the combat tones. And the standard Dolby super-sound effects of wrinkles and bumps and the constant low frequency hum to maintain tension. <br /> <br /> Tired. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
