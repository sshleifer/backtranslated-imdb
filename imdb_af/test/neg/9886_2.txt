The movie blood and chocolate is nothing like the book. The plot changed completely and the one who chose the cast had to read the book. First, the girl is not an introvert. Vivian was the one who drove Aden. Her mother had to survive and be one to Gabriel. Astrid was the one who did all the murders with Ralf, an ex of Vivian's. Gabriel is not old. He is old. And Aden didn't finally get Vivian, and Gabriel did it. The title comes from Vivian who compares kisses from Aden (sweet like chocolate) and Gabriel (nice like blood). She chose blood because it promised more and he understood her more. It reminds me, Gabriel is not against people like in the movie. He only avoided intimacy with them because they injured him in the past. Actually, the book is so much better than the movie. But if you want you to run, a dating montage, and lots of jumps. Then it's the movie to watch.
