"Undercurrent" has a leading role-players of wonderful actors who might be compiled for the perfect venue comedy. Oh, they are almost wasted on a 'woman's eye' pot boiler - and a paper thin one on it. Katharine Hepburn is indeed radiant like a tomboy / old girl who eventually marries, but her husband is deeply disturbed and has dark family secrets. Director Vincente Minnelli has absolutely no idea how to save this foreign plot, which is confronted by Edward Chodorov from a story by Thelma Strabel. The friendly, leading movie (Robert Taylor, Robert Mitchum and Edmund Gwenn). ** of ****
