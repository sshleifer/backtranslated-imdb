What's the point? Wasn't it done before, better? And again? Why does Werner Herzog waste his good talents and time with such a mess? Shouldn't he shoot a movie somewhere - I mean a real movie? <br /> <br /> It all felt from the beginning. Werner Herzog would never have sought to make a film about the Loch Ness myth - at least not on such a small scale surrounded by losers - so the plot was not credible from the beginning. The actors who are supposed to act as if they were not acting were of course acting. The story was not interesting, the "everyday people" needed in every spectacle were invisible, the personalities were outdated, the jokes were not funny, the consequences were inconclusive and the end was nowhere to be seen. <br /> <br /> I just don't see the point. It's a fake movie about a fake movie. Hah, hah. Perhaps if those who thought of such a movie were trying to make someone mocking people who were really a real Nessie, it might have been. But Herzog was not a believer and never claimed. A mockumentary about the cryptozoological crowd would have had so much more fuel. <br /> <br /> It was a mistake.
