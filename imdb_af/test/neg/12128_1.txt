Maybe I was young when I saw it. Maybe I didn't grow up with Grease and Elvis movies. <br /> <br /> I didn't get it. I get "black" comedy (Black Adder etc.). I get irony and spoofs. But I don't get it. <br /> <br /> I made it an attempt to discover the name of this movie (the help of people on usenet and the most excellent IMDb Message Boards) my first 1-pointer. Awful!
