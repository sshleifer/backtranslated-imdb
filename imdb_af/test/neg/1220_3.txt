The jaw is the trashiest of all Italian genres, and director Joe D'Amato is second only to the big Jess Franco in the prime film production. Put the two together and what do you get? A big piece of waste, of course. Unfortunately, it is not in the good sense of the word, since Deep Blood is more boring than it is in hilarity. For the film's credit it actually tries something that borders on a plot; but to take credit from the movie - the plot is rubbish. It has something to do with a group of friends who take an oath (friendship) and then an Indian curse that manifests itself in a shark. Or at least I think that's what's going on. Anyway, most of the movie is poured out with dull dialogue and 'drama', and the shark itself - which we can't forget - is the only thing we really want to see - just find it in a cameo role . Or even most of the sharks are actually stock images! Despite a trash genre, there is actually a lot of fun jaws rip-offs; But with this one, Joe D'Amato makes it clear that he has not bothered to even try, and the result is what must be the worst Italian shark movie of all time. Avoid this foam.
