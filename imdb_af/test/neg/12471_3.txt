"Tart" is a good illustration of the guy, Yogi Berra, who said, "If you don't know where you're going, you'll probably be different." Author / Director Christina Waye (in her first feature) has managed to make a $ 3 million film that eventually ends in a different place. "Tart" is either a lifetime story without characters that a rational person can connect to, a black comedy without any humor or a sex-fluttering movie without something particularly sexy. <br /> <br /> Unlike the standard Swain film, "Tart" actually employs a skilled and experienced production designer. Good enough to offer two very nice shots: the scene of Swain and Barton with a whirlpool and the scene of Swain in the park - with a nice montage of the Alice in Wonderland sculpture. The symbolism incorporated in these elements supports the possibility that Waye (despite the absence of a linear logic or unity of tone) actually has visionary talent and aspirations to make a quality film. <br /> <br /> It is even possible that Waye tried to make a merger of the somewhat expressionist "Metropolitan" and the classic "Cruel Intentions" camp with the Manhattan High School. There are many camera shots that are framed by windows and doors, yet there are sharp shots of faces and eyes. The former technique that symbolizes the latter and the latter on the deliberate distance of the characters and their motivation. "Tart" was at least twice on the edge of the camp area and would have become accustomed to staying in that direction. First there was the scene where they were trying to throw the apparently dead Swain into the rubbish bin. Then there is little that her father is Jewish (played at the same extreme as Joel Gray who is dancing with the Jewish guerrilla in "Cabaret"). <br /> <br /> In her other films, Swain's acting technique is overwhelming every scene she sees. (In the "Tart" screen she actually has an ability to limit herself. This is the best performance of her career. It also gives some clues about her physical decline of willowy super cute in "Girl" to bang. in "Pumpkin." This transformation was about half finished by the time she made "Tart", so the destruction of time goes. <br /> <br /> Mischa Barton ("Sixth Sense's" I feel better girl) and Lacey Chabet is excellent in supporting roles, the rest of the cast is simply awful, though some of the blame must go to Waye's writing and direction.
