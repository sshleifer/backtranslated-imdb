Oh, how terrible is this movie! I don't know if it's a horror movie or drama, because the story and the two genres aren't very well established! The story does not move, it is slow, boring and sleepy from the beginning to the end. This movie really lends me! But I think a lot about the camera work, it's authentic, fresh and bright, the play is also wonderful, the little boy was the big artist in this movie, but it didn't make me jump from my chair. But this movie makes me grab a pillow, lie on the bed and sleep until the credits roll ... <br /> <br /> Drilling! Not worth looking at! I tell you, this movie sucks! <br /> <br /> 1/10
