It's terrible, you just can't believe it. The score is annoying, the filming is bad, for example, sometimes you see the shadow of the cameraman appearing on some players' faces. The quality of the movie is ultra bad, looks like it was made in the 20s. It's terrible. There is a little blood in the beginning and through the film, but always filmed too dark. No gore effects. The director made a better one like Blood Rites. But there is another man, because searching for this cheap movie is not that difficult, but you have to pay hard-earned cash for it. Certainly, it will ever be in my top ten worst horror worms, I don't know if I call it horror. There is too much talk, you will get bloodthirsty after watching it
