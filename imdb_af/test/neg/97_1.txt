Lowe returns to the nest, another failed relationship, to find that he has been assigned to the jury duty. It is in the plans to get out of it somehow, when he realizes that the defendant is the girl, he has been seriously congratulated since the first degree. <br /> <br /> Living in the past by telling people about his feelings about this girl (played by the camp), Lowe remembers those feelings and does everything in his power to solve the attempted murder while at the same time keeping away the right bad guys and succeeding in a successful movie at the same time. <br /> <br /> I heard that St Augustine is the oldest city in the US, and I also know it has links with Ponce de Leon, so the wallpaper is a good place to start. Unfortunately, this is the only good thing about this movie. The local police are improper, the judge is an idiot, and the defense counsel does everything in its power to make herself look like Joanie Cunningham! I don't know if the director should blame for bad direction, or just to make the roll in such an unfortunate effort. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie was so boring, I couldn't even sleep! 1 out of 10 stars!
