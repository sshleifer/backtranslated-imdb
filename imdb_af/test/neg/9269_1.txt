It's hard to decide where to start. I bought it for a few times and this is the worst pair I've ever wasted. The back of the DVD has no photos and some lines plot summary, it had to warn me, but I usually like bad movies for a laugh, so decide to let it go. The movie consists of three short stories, each one caring for someone who was on a particular bus at one point. (It's never made clear what the meaning of the bus is, or which city it is set up). <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE SPOILERS (as if something is going to be spoiled). The first story is about a man convinced by a car, against his wife's wishes. The car is like a demonic Brum and takes over his life. <br /> <br /> The second is about a man's slum that never cleans his fridge and grows a monster bacterium. <br /> <br /> The third of a woman going to a dating agency just to discover her date is not that normal. <br /> <br /> In between, we are treated at shots of the bus (or a bus anyway) while a narrator at a rubbish bin on relationships (really, it's like he's on commission to get relationships) say) <br /> <br /> The movie actually has no redeeming features at all. The acting, the costumes and the little Spfx are all disgus things. There are even attractive female cast members to admire. Put simply, this movie is a debacle.
