I like Christophe Lambert as an actor. He played in several good movies (Highlander, Subway, Greystoke, ...). But I can't even think he played in that movie. The story is almost nothing, the special effects are very bad and the actors too. To resume the movie, I have only one thing to say: this is the first time I watch a movie and want to leave after 10 minutes.
