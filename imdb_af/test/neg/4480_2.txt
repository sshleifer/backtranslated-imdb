OK, it's awake when you're sick in bed or nothing else needs to do. However, the suspension of unbelief needed to come through this movie is significant. First, in today's modern society, do you believe that college cows that link it to someone in such a short time, even if you are a "virtuous" Habitat volunteer who loves autistic children? And the 2 week romance blossoms in a letter exchange that leads to John's "conflict" of registering after 9/11/01 ... LOTS? He asks her what to do? Every man we know is not going to sit down after the towers come down (my husband was one of them and I love him and is proud of him). John's character is so flat. He is almost without a film the whole movie. He looks good, but not Spec Ops. He doesn't seem to be self-confident, quiet instead of a hell-raiser, no tattoos, gets a "fight" with the preppy boys who are nothing more than a staggering game ... around without a lid on his head, almost the whole movie ... and there are military technical flaws everywhere (epaulette upside down?). The war styles are stupid ... John and another old step down on their own ... huh ?, then another guy is shot and John drags him 10 feet and starts giving girlfriend before he returns the area or back arrive or even with their back against the lid ... this is a shooting fight for God's affairs, you don't stop fighting until it's over. Very, I wanted to shoot John in the back. Back home, when the truth is revealed and she wastes the wine ... we hated her to remove her shirt in his presence. WTH? break his heart and then provoke him to adultery? She is a lead letter. The best part of the movie is when he drives away from her ... at least he had self-respect and honor. Overall incredible story and we usually don't care about these characters or their love. Gloomy!
