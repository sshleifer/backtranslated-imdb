Don't get me wrong. I have a considerable soft spot for Charles Band's works, as well as producer and director. But you have to raise an eyebrow when the man willing to give his name to Dollman Vs The Demonic Toys holds a pseudonym for anything. As a bit of bad-movie fun, "Head of the Family" is quite lacking, although it performed better than you would expect. Jacqueline Lovell is a solid talent who deserves better than those movies. JW Perra is also quite funny than the titular monster, but for such a super-intelligent creature it makes it easy. Yes, I'm nitpicking because the rest of the movie is so sharp and spiritual ... <br /> <br /> And with a main character called Lance Bogan? Nice guys. We didn't know you Americans knew that snake!
