Seriously, if you want to see a clich√© horror movie, you should see this one. It contains all the "scary parts where nothing happens", "the nerd-type that is not actually killed", "boy and girl who come together and survive", "with an old child fear" etc. . I wanted to see this movie because I learned the mix of a video game and worked out a movie. Guess I was wrong. What makes the movie more bearable? It's only 1 hour 17min, so if you're bored, it might be a good idea, though I'd rather get bored. Why doesn't it look at all? Frankie Munitz aka Malcolm is just annoying as the nerd type. I can hit the man and it is so sad that he was not dead earlier and eventually he even comes back. See something else!
