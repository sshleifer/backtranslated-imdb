The screenwriters for this mini-series had themselves been condemned to the guillotine. They slaughtered a very fun story and wasted Richard E. Grant's talents. The only thing the writers kept from the original books was the name. All the characters were totally changed and the story was not the same. I strongly suggest watching another version of the Scarlet Pimpernel. Any other version is better than this one.
