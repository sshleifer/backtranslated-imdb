This boy of a successor son was terrible to say the least. You'd think the production would be better 10 years after the original was released, but Retro Puppet Master was not ranked by the original writers and had a bad story, lacking any eternal connection with any characters and slowly pulled out. scene. No buildup of a strong plot, very poor climax, you will slowly get yourself through the whole movie, if you can sit through the entire reel. I never could understand why a horror movie continues to make persecutors the release of their "last chapter." I hardly suggest watching this movie, but if you have to, I won't recommend putting someone else through.
