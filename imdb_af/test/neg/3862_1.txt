Imagine Diane van Cheers, the self-centered intellectual character, now thinks she's been trying to make a movie moire movie. That will be it. If you just watched some of the shots without any sound, you'd think Hmmm. It could be a good movie. <br /> <br /> Now when you turn on the sound and listen forever, you quickly realize that the person who made the movie knows nothing about movies or what they read in a book. I always thought, this thing is a strange movie. It was so bad. If you don't remember Cheers, think of Mr. Beans Holiday ... remember the DeFoe character who made the terrible. movie ... imagine that horrible movie without Mr. Bean saving it. This is what this movie is. I say nothing about what the movie is like but it's an attempt to make a dark, moody movie about a hit that goes home .... at least it's about everything I could get from it.
