The Vindicator begins with the unforgettable scene of a monkey in a cage that separates a small toy robot as part of a scientific experiment. This random violence has sold it to me and I'm happy to say that the rest of Vindicator has offered a real cheese festival. <br /> <br /> The Vindicator is about a scientist (David McIlwraith) who has almost killed an explosion In his laboratory, the baked remnants are placed in an experimental body suit / armor. For an incomprehensible reason, he is equipped with a Rage Response Activator, a device attached to his brain, which will make him homy if he gets physical contact with any other person. They give some clear explanation on how it is an essential defensive mechanism, but I can't see the logic in installing such a device unless you wanted an exciting Cyborg killing machine. This is especially ridiculous when it is indicated that the suit Carl carries is actually an experimental space suit. What possible need for an astronaut to change during a mission in the amazing Hulk? He breaks predictably from the lab and continues to play the dodgy scientists in the pack with Pam Grier's ninja sniper assassin. No, really. The Vindicator itself looks beautiful. damn goofy. It's basically a man in a colored golden foil suit. He also has a constantly confused look in his eyes, which does not inspire fear or even compassion. I don't think you can blame him for that. Most people watching the movie will have the same look on their faces. <br /> <br /> The acting is of the very bad, stilted, "I'm not sure what character's emotions or thoughts are that this point so I'll take a point and send out my dialogue in a random tone while trying not to watch the camera's school of acting. The actor playing the funky black scientist struggles even with this last part. <br /> <br /> It is after this initial accident that the Vindicator goes to the scientists. Oddly enough, the whole Rage Response Activator touches me and I will play your kill 'thing as big a role as you can expect with Carl in a fairly detached way to his former colleges. There was one scene where he was quite brutally killing a street joke surrounding him. I know it is the rigorous for street gangs to attack the main characters in the eighties, but surely one of them must have realized that it might be a bad idea to attack the cyborg man, even though he looks like C3PO's delayed cousin. As it is, it does not seem as if it is surprising that a blocked golden cyborg is walking along the street as if it were a daily appearance to them. The only other time this rage reaction activator pops up in the movie is when old Carl can't hug his wife. When Hunter tries to turn it against him by throwing her into him, he will be forced to kill her. He made incidental remarks that he reprogrammed himself. It doesn't happen. They could have left the whole Rage Response Activator thing out and only went with a straight revenge story and it wouldn't make a big difference in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is an amusing sequence in the sewers as Grier and her cronies trace the Vindicator. Because of its armored hiding place, they are all armed with weapons that "sour acid". For a bizarre reason, when this weapon fires, it is displayed on the screen by cartoon red lines that go to their targets, Ghostbusters. The Vindicator fights back by ripping a gas pipe out of the wall and all Grier's goons burn in a big flame that comes out. The resulting fireball is so large and powerful that it comes from the sewer from a manhole and inflates some of the scientists. Strangely enough, Grier escapes by throwing herself deep into the thumb, despite being closest to the Vindicator. It's one of several fake fiery explosions throughout the movie, including the death of a funky black scientist when the vindicator sends his load off a cliff. (This is after they caught The Vindicator by severely capturing him in a huge bunch of clowns). <br /> <br /> There is also a disturbing and long and sequential sequence in which Carl's treacherous overweight friend, who looks like a poor man's Ned Beatty, reveals his imagination with Carl's wife and tries to rape her. It lasts about 5-10 minutes and is full of disturbing shots of the guy who's banging over the woman's face, staring over her face and trying to dress her. It's really the least to say and really looks like most of the rest of the movie that is kind of cartoon and bigger than life in its violence. <br /> <br /> The movie final involves the Vindicator packing a whole host of other dudes. For whatever reason, all these other dudes are less kicking than Carl, some of them are sent by the woman by simply having a protruding tube in their side. Fortunately for Carl the suit he wears, this major design flaw is missing. The only memorable part to the end is Grier's death. To do something that I have never seen in the movie, in a movie before the middle of her confrontation with the Vindicator, she decides she really does not stand a chance against him and in a rather virtually blowing her own brain With his gun.
