Well, I have to admit that this movie sometimes occasionally laughs at my face. OK, but it doesn't make a good movie. Most characters are horrible stereotypes and truly unconvincing. Not everyone gives up big appearances, but some really try, but fail because their characters are poorly written. The perfect example is Julia Koschitz. She changes her eating habits from one conversation to another. At one talk she does not speak alcohol on the next, she is allergic to champagne. She feels too good for most people (actually she is) but still ends with the "perfect" fitness about the look, and refuses to give a few more "realistic" guys a chance, and so on ... The ending is very cheesy, although I like one of the final scenes, when everyone finally stops talking and the director gives us the chance to catch our breath again. Shopping is basically a movie that offers a few cheap basics (mostly because it's about sex and relationships, I assume) and maybe short entertainment. Yet the whole picture is one great stereotype and nothing is really special about it.
