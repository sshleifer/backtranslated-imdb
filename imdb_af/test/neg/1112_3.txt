Wicked Little Things has an excellent synopsis: empty house next to the deserted mine in the forest with a tragic past; family moves home and strange things start to happen; small, creepy children are starting to appear here and creepy-little-children do. But that's where smartness and potential fun ends. This group of children was sealed in the mine many decades earlier and now looks like the poor make-up looks for weapons that eat meat to eat. Oh, I get it, it's a ghost-zombie movie. Hmmm .... while I can appreciate someone trying something new with this genre, it just didn't work. What was the children's motivation to devour flesh? Why do they need weapons? Did anyone else think that the filmmakers are giggling around the daily footage because they felt it would be a cool / scary movie? I noticed that after thirty minutes I felt the well-known resignation that I just wasted my time on another modern crap festival. While the play was good and the quality / cinema environment good, the script itself suffered from a lack of knowledge about the supernatural horror genre. A lot of kids running into the mall are scarcer than this pack of badly disguised rodents. <br /> <br /> This movie is not terrifying, and while I appreciate the story, I even enjoyed reading it. Instead of seeing it, I still have to say that Wicked Little Things is more accurately called Wicked Little Turd.
