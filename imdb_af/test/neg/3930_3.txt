A cheap and fearless hoarse movie with poor characterization, very subtle style stoic emotions (think Chow Yun Fat in a better tomorrow) and a few cheesy clicks thrown into a deserted factory ready for some poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo. Even the squibs look terrible. At no stage in the proceedings does it look remote like America. Three wobbly old cars don't make a landmark. The Mustang even has a wobbly front wheel. The plot, as it is, is so distracted and predictable that the end is like an euthanasia. It can't be fast enough. Even the jewelery of the robbery looks like the cheapest jewelry available. The terrible dialogue and hopeless overwork by all who are shot is a real waste of space and time. Worth watching if you want to know how not to make a clich√© series of low budget movies.
