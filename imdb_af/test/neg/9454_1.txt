How poor is this movie? Well, I got it less than two months ago and can almost remember what it's all about ... <br /> <br /> I also paid Â£ 1 for DVD, the old story of 'put-a- new-cover-on-the-box-and-silly-will-buy-it-syndrome. All I really remember is that the roll storm has been running around, the use of cars had to be over budget and a vampire was involved. Then again, think you know about the movie's title. <br /> <br /> Straight to video rubbish or straight to cheap jack DVD as it is now. These things will be until the death of the sun in the bargain shops at rental shops, supermarkets and charities. Only cockroaches will rule the earth, but this garbage will still be round. God bless the dawn of the DVD age.
