I recently caught this movie on TCM and can understand why George Murphy went into politics if it was the best MGM that could serve him. It is so slow that the attempt to make it a real film noir effort does not come down. It contains two of my favorite players in Eve Arden (totally wasted) and Dean Stockwell (the best actor in the film), but what really struck me was that the leading lady, Frances Gifford, was about 90 minutes (it was longer !) without changing the expression on her face - her faint scene was comical. John Hodiak played his part, but the script, and the rest of the role-player, dropped very badly. I gave it 4 stars mainly because of the photography. It would have been on the first half of the program when dual features were on the way.
