I had to go without seeing the movie after I read the review here. I saw the whole movie by sending quickly and ending in 25 minutes. Although it's a low budget movie, it can be made better. <br /> <br /> The movie starts out more like a thriller and in a few minutes tells you to turn off immediately. And why was the movie called "crash landing" when it landed so well in such a bad climate. <br /> <br /> Without any acting, all the characters where just like kids move or do. <br /> <br /> Don't forget to comment on the joker - the main creator that would be more suitable if this movie was a full-time comedy.
