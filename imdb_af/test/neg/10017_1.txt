New York family are the last in their area to get a television set, which nearly ruined David Niven's marriage to Mitzi Gaynor. Bedroom comedy that rarely invades the bedroom (and nothing happens anyway). Gaynor as an actress has about as much scope as an oven - she turns, she turns off. Film's only remuneration is a supportive performance by perky Patty Duke, pre- "Miracle Worker", as Niven's daughter. She is pretty; "Happy Anniversary" is not. * of ****
