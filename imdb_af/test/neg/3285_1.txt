It's easily the worst, most offensive piece of crap on TV. I would like to ignore it altogether, but Fox held it in their Sunday series and forced me to see something else between American Dad and Family Guy. The think-head male star man is just about the least developed, pathetic excuse for a person I've ever seen on TV. Nothing on the show is funny at all, and almost everything else is done better by other programs. <br /> <br /> Obviously, their strategy is to ram it deep and hard into the Sunday schedule and hope someone likes it, but I have to break it for you, Fox, that's the wrong hole. The scam didn't work on me - I just look elsewhere - but come on, your freaking boneheads, this spectacular SUCKS, and it sucks even worse when compared to the rest of the Fox Sunday lineup. <br /> <br /> THEY CANCELED DEALED DEVELOPMENT FOR THIS STAMP?
