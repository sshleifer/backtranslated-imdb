A strange, deliberately skewed biopsy of Dyan Thomas in which we hear little more than a dozen lines of his poetry. Instead, we should see a raw character, seen through the prism of his proto-bigame relationship with wife (Sienna Miller) and childhood love (Keira Knightley). Matthew Rhys plays Thomas with enough charm to play against his otherwise declining self-interest and Cillian Murphy makes the sustained tense life. <br /> <br /> The movie never looks where it's going. There is no bow as much as a viaduct from one side of the war to another. Maybury looks much more interested in his two female leads (who wouldn't!) Than in the man they brought and then split. Miller is the choice of the two (I have qualified Knightley at best, but I never found her sympathetic), but they both offer very contradictory Welsh accent. Other funny decisions include too much for the inconspicuous character of William (Murphy), art production (eg, dual crossroads) that are not impressionistic or symbolic, and the old chestnut play of period that does not mix. 10/04
