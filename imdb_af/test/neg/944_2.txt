Seriously, I don't understand how Justin Long is becoming more and more popular. He also has the best agent in Hollywood, or recently sold his soul to Satan. He is almost unbearable to watch on the screen, he has little to no charism and terrible comic timing. The only movie he tried to anchor that I enjoyed remotely was Waiting ... and that's just because I worked in a restaurant. But I deviated. Apart from the terrible lead, this movie has many other debits. I understand it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean it has completely offended our intelligence and shocked it so much that it's offensive. Lewis Black's considerable talent is also wasted here, as he is at his most surfers when he is uneasy, which will definitely not allow the PG-13 score. The movie's only light spot was Jonah Hill (which would seem almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he had lost in the meantime). His one linen was funny at the moment, but was definitely not enough to tolerate it anywhere. If you just want to turn off your brain (or better still, you shouldn't have one), then you might enjoy it, but I can't recommend it at all.
