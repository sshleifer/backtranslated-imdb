Most of you out there didn't really like it ... you were right. A small minority of you really loved the movie ... can't say you're wrong. To me this movie was stupid. I have seen many stupid, foolish comedies, but this one surpasses each one of them. While I was watching, I couldn't stop rubbing my eyes, not believing what I was seeing and trying to decide whether to laugh or cry because * things were happening on the screen and people left the theater. <br /> <br /> According to leading characters, time series are reached, just enter a museum and you will actually travel to the past. Plus, if you're looking for the death experience, just go to the nearest planetarium. There you will meet God. Sorry, Loydd and are given important commands. All that is above does not make it right? Well, go ahead, look at the movie (I never estimate the movies I see), you probably won't like it, but you will be intrigued by the author's ability to make the final STUPID script. <br /> <br /> I give it a 3 out of 10, not good, far from the worst ...
