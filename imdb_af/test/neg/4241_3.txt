The female hot numbers on this show are breathtaking. They can also speak as there is no tomorrow. Otherwise, this display would quickly go into the toilet. How much money they make on all the people entering, hoping to win back to win, $ 100.oo, or whatever. Boy, now it's a scam !!! Can I buy shares in this money maker? Let's see it, with the technology of now, can call thousands of people every minute. And with tens of thousands of channels and nothing worth a shit, thousands of people see this show. "Oh, I know this answer!", Is probably a super general line among the listeners. With these super hotties constantly saying the 'lounge' should call, I think it's a bunch of B.S. Often, someone who does not come through is surprised that they are actually talking to the host. Many of them sound depressed and exhausted by probably waiting so long and trying so many times to go up and make some pocket changes. Wow, the producers just have to enter it. No wonder there are so few ads. Advertisements are just about to give time for more (mainly losers) to text in and wait, and hope, and dream, and fantasize about --- what? --- win enough money for a gas tank and a meal at Mc.something? I only watch it occasionally on my brothers TV, because he likes to watch it when he's on the computer. I will sit there for 15 to 20 minutes and watch Mel (one of the best women on TV) and laugh at the scam that stands before me. Then I must leave; even if I do not! People who have an active life can only take this show in extreme moderation. Mel, get yourself in the movies, or TV sitcoms, or something. Many of us are busy with you! Even with the super cu tires, I'm surprised this show is up!
