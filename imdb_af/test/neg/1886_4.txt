Okay - the title "House of Frankenstein" was a reference to a line from the original Frankenstein movie. When they follow it up with a movie titled "House of Dracula", which makes no sense, you know it's just starting to make a franchise. <br /> <br /> Without explanation Dracula is back and he's called him Baron Latos. He infiltrates the home of a doctor Edelmann, claiming he is seeking a cure for his vampirism. Edelmann has a sniff nurse who helps him (what is it with hockey assistants in these movies?), But what Dracula is really interested in is his other, more beautiful assistant. At this stage, Larry "Wolf Man" Talbot returns (again, no explanation given) and just happens to look for the same doctor for a cure for his lycanthropy. And then he just happens in a cave where plants can be grown to help him, which also contains only the Frankenstein monster. Dear God, when will it end ... sure, the other Universal monster persecutors were stupid, but that's just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> First, the good stuff. There are some great settings, and the vampire bat effects are slightly better than usual. Other effects are also neatly neat. John Carradine is not as bad as Dracula if you get used to it, but still nothing as brilliant as Lugosi. In my opinion, Onslow Stevens plays a much better vampire in this movie, although he has the exact opposite problem with Carradine - all the creepiness and not the class. None of the performances is so good, but it is more because of the horrible writing than anything else - the female parts are extremely poorly written. But stupid as it is, it remains quite entertaining for the most part. The best thing about it is the short length. <br /> <br /> Now the bad things ... it's not creepy, it's badly written and it doesn't work. I was hoping that the three monsters would start a kind of supernatural battle for power, but that doesn't happen. The focus is almost entirely on Dracula, which is not very well portrayed. On the other hand, it is the only film in which Dracula infects another man, but it is done by a blood transfusion rather than a bite, as Universal was always uncomfortable with the possible homosexual subtext. Larry Talbot is decent as always the Wolf Man, but he plays a relatively small part. Again, the part of Frankenstein's sample is reduced to anti-climatic moments. For the sake of God, Glenn Strange was fantastic than the creature! Why not give him more screen time? It is a pity that the series had to end on this note (not the classic comedy "Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"). In the end, it only faded and died in sunlight, like Dracula himself.
