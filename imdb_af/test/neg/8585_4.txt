Stone tried another kind of movie. Any Given Sunday falls short on an above average The Last Boy Scout and the below average at all odds. Steen can be fantastic, see The Doors, Natural Born Killers or Platoon, but he can also repeat him, see Nixon or Born on July 4th. His true brilliance is realized in Michael Caine's perfection, The Hand.
