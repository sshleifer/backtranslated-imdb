1989 was a year in which Eddie Murphy was not so hot and started making movies that would soon be forgotten. Enoughly enough, it was also the year in which Murphy directed his first film, but it would also be the first and last experiment. "Harlem nights" were not exactly what you could call a success, even though it was wonderful to see the two best black comedians together, Murphy and Richard Pryor. Don't blame it on the actors, as they all played their roles as you expected, even if you have to face the typical Murphy laugh again. The worst thing about "Harlem nights" is both the scenario and its horrible scenery. Everything is in the roaring twenties and everyone benefits from the forbidden clubs. Sugar Ray (Pryor) and his adopted son, Quickie (Murphy), easily gather $ 10,000 a day, but of course, the gang and the corrupt police come around to claim their share of the cookie. Sugar and Quickie are not guys who give their money for free and have their own plans. You can watch 'Harlem Nights', that's for sure, but if you avoid the moment you hear the name Murphy, avoid getting better, because after this movie nothing but a lame excuse to see good jokes .
