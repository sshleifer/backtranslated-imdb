A man, with the unlikely name of Shy Walker, is looking for his two daughters for an hour and a half in a wheat field. It's the whole plot ... of course with bad acting. Walker wanders around a corn maze (maize? I get it! HAHAHA ... not funny) and shouts "Girls? Where are you?!?" about 1000 times. For some reason, when running with a pumpkin, a stone-minting voice laughs (as if the pumpkin was laughing at him, yes, okay ...). His daughters scream for most of the movie ... even when there's no reason to shout (maybe because they're still stuck in this horrible movie?). Twin girls straight out of 'The Shining' show every now and then. Most of the corn maze looks the same, so Walker's search is getting very early. The filmmakers realize that there is nothing for this movie (even the music is repetitive), so they try to make things interesting by really pinning the camera, filming it upside down, placing smaller pictures of the same shot at different angles, with red lights To give out the corn, and to turn the camera 360 degrees (I accept it at least intentionally, but it's probably just examples of unauthorized filmmaking). More often than not, when Walker wanders through the maze, you can't see his face. I think the child holding the camera can't shoot that high. This movie gives you a new appreciation for the original 'Dark Harvest' (which has nothing to do with this movie except because it also features features a wheat field). Don't be fooled by the R rating. Walker says the F word three times and now we have a "R-rated horror movie", ugh. The scarecrow on the front does not even appear in this movie ... and if you want those fleshy scarecrows to come back from the first movie, you know things are bad! Instead, we get a man in yellow boots that chased our hero around (unfortunately he is similar to Walker, so I didn't even notice that he was being followed for a while). I figured out the man's identity in the yellow boots long before Walker did it. (The movie is almost over by the time he puts 2 and 2 together. The end of the movie goes on and off ... and if it's not slow enough, there's a little slow motion! The last sound what you hear (other than your own laugh) is very poor sound dubbing.If you can't say, it's the worst movie I've ever seen, at least they didn't end up with the promise of another successor !
