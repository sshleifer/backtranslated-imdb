The nicest parts of this movie were the clips of the original movie. The acting was poor and the assumption of sexual scorecards was offensive. The effects were at best marginal. There were no shows at stake, Amy Irving was featured in this movie to get a part of the Halloween H20 audience. The original was much more enjoyable and pleasing. I'm sorry to say that it won't be the best of the 10 years ... so far it's at the bottom of my list. Don't bother with this one !!
