This is by far the worst Hemingway adaptation ever. Rock Hudson was badly mistaken and totally unbelievable as a hard-hired soldier / adventurer who went to war. Jennifer Jones was too old for her and Vittorio de Sica seemed to be in some movie. They tried to make a large-scale epic from a low-key romantic novel and the result is terrible. As if that wasn't enough, the whole thing is so slow, surviving and dated that it's virtually incompatible. Rock must have kicked himself off to "Sayonara" and "Ben Hur" to make this horrific shit. <br /> <br /> 0/10. To avoid.
