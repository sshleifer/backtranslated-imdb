Harlan Banks is thief at the top of his game, but after a successful career he decided to sit down with his wife and retire. However, he decides to take one last routine job in Las Vegas. All he has to do is drive the car and it looks simple. Unfortunately, someone is going to the police and after a hurry, he just blows in the barn to escape and take revenge on those who betrayed him and get him in the first place. A typical action festival occurs. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal plays himself (surprise!) with a trench and carries his beloved Colt 1911 with his usual groundbreaking aikido. The Colt and Aikido have always been with him, but the first thing I remember him with the trench coat is in "The Foreigner." It's not particularly impressive, but it does add a bit to Seagal's deadly arsenal of weakness. Or it covers the extra pounds he packs. Just see how you choose. His main character in the film is played by Treach (another new thing, a rapper in action movie) and they both exposed a little conspiracy of bad guys on both sides of the law and blamed every culprit. <br /> <br /> The main problem with the movie is that it is painful and I mean painful, inexplicable. Seagal just follows a clockwork plot throughout the movie and even manages to become more and more boring as the film progresses. Then it comes from dull to completely ridiculous in the final scene, as people who seem to be dead suddenly murder each other, start talking. Groan induces in every sense of the word. The only real positive thing here is the decent opening - a car ride in Las Vegas, complete with police vehicles and generally entertaining chaos, but after that brief highlight you've seen it before. 3/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R: constant violence and curse
