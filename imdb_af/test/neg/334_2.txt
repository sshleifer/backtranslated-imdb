I really didn't want to write a hard review of this movie because I really appreciate how hard it is to make any kind of movie on an incredibly low budget, let alone something as ambitious as a sci-fi. <br /> <br /> However, this movie is really awful. The acting is one of the worst things I have ever had to endure and as a fan of low budget films which is a reasonably serious accusation. There are many aspiring actors out there who will work on a deferred payment scheme if they believe in the movie and what the director is trying to achieve. I'm sure the actors did their best, like everyone involved in this production, but it was simply not good enough to subtract anything from this size. <br /> <br /> Then there's the dialogue. Very poor indeed. There is no excuse for it. I had the impression that the writing was suddenly written on the back of a beer mat after an epic fascinating session. I hesitate to use the word 'laudable', but that's exactly what the script is. I had no empathy with any of the characters. Indeed, they raged on me, with the result that I wanted to bump some of them over one occasion. Mr. Stirton persuaded himself by tackling too many roles. Clint Eastwood he's not. Again, there are talented people out there willing to work on deferment if they believe in the project. <br /> <br /> Many of the special effects in this movie are made. For the money, they are exceptional, if used slightly. It's like someone said, "I have descendants and son I'll use it." Whoever did the CG work was one of the most talented of this crew. <br /> <br /> The money was simply not available to make a movie as ambitious as it was trying to be. Kudos to try it, but unfortunately it fails to reach its fierce goals in too many ways. <br /> <br /> I salute everyone involved in the production, but I really do, but they also need to get their next try. a better producer or lower their attractions to something more manageable. <br /> <br /> Finally, I cannot recommend this effort to anyone other than the most enthusiastic of film students or ordinary insomnia. If you want to see a true masterpiece of low-budget sci-fi movies, the student is trying a "Dark Star" by a certain Mr. John Carpenter.
