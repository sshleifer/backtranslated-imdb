I liked the characters, but our lead was too strong for a beautiful smile. I didn't care about two whites about him. He makes bad choices and I really don't care, because he didn't look right either. He was rather relentless. There were a few moments that gave rise to some human insight (the scene with the whale was interesting), but it is lost in the general malaise of the film. The love interest was acceptable and the other characters were lightly interesting, but the plot turned too much and left me in many points in the film. In the end I wondered why I stayed so long. <br /> <br /> There are some humorous moments, but eventually I don't care. I can't judge the movie higher. - 3 out of 10
