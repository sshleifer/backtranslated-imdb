The recent documentary "The Adventures of Errol Flynn" is a profound look at the Ultimate Hollywood Hero. Bogart, Cagney, Wayne and the like were basically blue collar types in their screen images, but Flynn was an aristocrat in his style and manner, the younger boy worked out his own fiction for a sword, thunder and romance analogy that ironically found himself trapped. If he wasn't contracted to Warner Bros, he would have been perfect in the Cary Grant role in Suspicion: the handsome lighter whose 1000-watt smile blinded the blind to being a predator. And he can play with his best-rated ladies sister Joan Fontaine. It was Flynn's trouble that he was caught the Ultimate Screen Hero to his own habits and bad timing with him. Grant and Flynn in a way are similar, but Flynn was the more macho of the two; It is possible to see Grant as Captain Blood, but Flynn in the Philadelphia story. Mr. Blanding builds his dream home or Monkey Business or Operation Petticoat "You turned those roles on their collective ears because he was on foot on his feet and the sexual tension he would have brought naturally would have made the story lines shaky. But this wobble biography is just a plasticized view of Flynn and his era. There are times when I expected half a laugh or an audience to go "Ahhh" at some time. It's not deep in Flynn's life, just the screen magazine view. It also does not plunge into its struggle to regard more than an emerging offender. As the cleaned biographies of Lon Chaney (the father, not the Wolfman, or Lenny "Of Mice and Men" and Buster Keaton done in the '50s), it's just a time to kill a piece of fluff.
