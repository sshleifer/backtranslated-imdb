It must be the worst movie I've seen this year. And I look a lot at the cable. The plot is just ridiculous, the scenes are just thrown at you without any action, no start or end of any scene. It's just random idiots with make-up shouting in some airplane. The "special effects" (Spielberg will laugh his ass off) are terrible, the yellow eye contact lenses are cute. I need to see the admin I can't carry to the end. The scene where the great scientist Bennett kept the engine light for the good life was too much for me. I'm sorry for my bad English. I'm from Romania (and this is my first post). I just had to sign up to make a comment on this movie, because I can't believe it's a movie released in 2007.
