If it were possible to give negative stars, I would be for this stink burger. <br /> <br /> Don't misunderstand me LOOOOOOVVVEEEE a good crappy movie. I'm a huge fan of movies like Octoman, Wizard Of Mars, Queen King and others. Real classics from B-Cinema. <br /> <br /> But this movie actually makes Jack Nicolson and Boris Karloff in The Terror look like an academic award winner !! The Dialouge is so unnecessarily long-lasting and mostly inappropriate. (ie. "I will now condense (yes, condensing !!) to your wishes. The acting might have been much better if they had even more logical lines. <br /> <br /> The story? What story, A count is banned because his wife had leprosy, I'm not sure about that score, a (Rich?) flew one and the Captian of one of his ships falling on the island? People acting unnaturally? of camp in b-movies a lot, there is a lot of charm, but it was just stupid. Clean stupid a Salt Sea Captian, who sounds like a college professor? come (I felt this man had no idea how to play it, one scene he is Spanish, the next English / European)? The score, who does not know if he is a reincarnation, or really DeSade? Don't ask me how DeSade figures in here, after 4 beers my wife, friend and I still couldn't figure it out. <br /> <br /> The frightening factor? characters show and only worry about those who sleep through it. From the early 60's horror movies, some still have good shocks, but this thing ... never had a shock or even a hint of fright. . <br /> <br /> The information at the back says, "This movie contains scenes that are so lively and humiliating that they will surpass your worst nightmare." The only decline is to see this movie. It's 90 minutes. (The case says it's 74 minutes.) You're not coming back from your life. <br /> <br /> I just paid a goat, yes one goat, for this and another movie. I still feel like I'm guilty .50 cents to even put on it. <br /> <br /> To summarize Dungeon or Harrow, NO one called Harrow in it, but it had a beautiful cardboard dungeon.
