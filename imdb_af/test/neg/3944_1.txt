I can say it will be a bad one from the trailer, but the lure of the DVD box has hired me anyway. Boy I was right. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the DVD version at times (in terms of video quality) is VERY vague and unclear. They seem to have shot the whole movie with a 20-year-old video camera, it looks so bad. I really didn't have the plot, and after watching the movie, I was very late. I will NOT tell a spoil, but let it be said that the end was so bad that I laughed. This has been done so many times before. <br /> <br /> The whole story looks like something from a middle school English paper. If I had to join one movie as the worst horror movie I've ever seen, it might just be. I can't believe they really released this movie. It's really not worth the rent, or a penny of someone's money, unless you want a good laugh at the movie's cost.
