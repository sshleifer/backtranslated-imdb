I ignore Rocky 3, it's easily Hulk Hogan's best movie, and it's still one of the worst movies ever. Hulk Hogan mainly plays Hulk Hogan and introduces his struggling friends to a movie, with all the cliches to go with - the slick promoter, the unstoppable monster, the injured child, the sexy woman and ... "Dookie".
