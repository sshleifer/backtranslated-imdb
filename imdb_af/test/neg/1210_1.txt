As a retired USAF MSG (airplane chapter spec), it has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The fact that a teenager can ever get on the flyline is less ridiculous. the army spends millions on each pilot to make them the best in the world and this movie makes the air force and all its members look at its best. Yes, I know it's just a movie, but it gives the younger people a message that we are all idiots and believe me, we are not. The logistics involved in setting up any kind of mission is very much involved. Even in the eighties, military computers were too safe to hack any teenager, and the other flaws in this movie made Peter Pan more credible. Pity, for me, this movie didn't entertain at all.
