I just bought this DVD because it was dirty cheap and it was interesting in its own special way ("special" means "delayed"). The movie seems to be uninteresting - boring camera work, nothing really drives the story, and of course the play is terrible. It wasn't even "bad" in a camping way - it was just bad. There is actually a handful of great lines of dialogue, but for the most part it is uncomfortable and weak. All I could think of was that it would actually be a good movie if the writing was a great renovation (if it was written by someone who actually understood drug culture) and cast as some decent actors . I would not recommend "Weekend With the Babysitter" unless you are planning a movie career and want to learn what should not be in a movie.
