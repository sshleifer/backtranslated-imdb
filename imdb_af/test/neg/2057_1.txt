This movie is probably one of the 3 worst movies made in history. I rented it by chance, without reading reviews, and wow, I'm sorry. Actually, no plot doesn't actually follow the vampire genre. Just plain god horrible. Watching this movie will expel your enthusiasm for vampire movies. I felt the writer / director / producer went on these drugs and had hallucinations and tried to recreate them on film. All the time I wanted to end the movie. But the end was even more crazy. <br /> <br /> If this review can only save one person to see this shit, I spent my time registering and it was worth writing this review.
