Brainy, cross-dressing boy, finds success on the Spelling Bee circuit despite an unconventional and dysfunctional education. Shirley MacLaine directs and dies as the child's grandmother and it is always fascinating to see long-time actors get their chance to direct a movie, the material they are drawn to and the actors they choose to work with . Here is the only person well-thrown into "Bruno" MacLaine. The child actors seem to have been chosen for their twinkle and gift, and MacLaine has their close-ups for turbulent long periods. nothing about these cherubs does not seem to be, not the lines that fall unconsciously out of their mouths or the interaction they have with adults or even each other. As the boy's disgruntled father, poor Gary Sinise around the sides, in shame, always with a painful appearance on his face. By the end of the movie, MacLaine turns the whole thing into a thrill of hugging scenes, and even ends with the child hugging the pope in Rome! Another ungodly treat of a talented actress-twisted director, who, like Sally Field and her movie, "Beautiful", seems to stop looking. Shirley uses ethnicity for shtick and childless innocence as a punchline. The children in this role roll their eyes, crack wisely with adult remarks, use big words - but if one leper boy calls us gay-hero, MacLaine's grandmother calls him to go over and push the child out for the media!) . How is it for progression? * of ****
