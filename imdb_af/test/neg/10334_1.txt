But definitely a serious contender for one of the worst 10 of all time. <br /> <br /> I got this DVD cheap, with Sandra Bullock as the front runner. These are false ads. She is almost 10 minutes from the movie on the screen. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there was no other point of sale for this movie - the dialogue was terrible, the editing was obviously done by someone who was out on Quaaludes, was the director ... let's just say that my 14-year-old daughter can do better, but I hope she never sees such a dull praise from me. It is possible that the family cat could do better. <br /> <br /> Sandra earns a first-class work for a first movie, in the short time she's on the screen - and that's the only redeeming quality of this movie. Stupid story, poorly written, and transferred to movie, as only a 7th-class Media class should be able to do. <br /> <br /> In short, it's craving.
