I carefully checked if there was another movie called this one, and there was not! But I really don't think everyone saw the same movie! There is no way! How can you vote more than "1" for this movie ?! The idea of ​​this movie let's say it's acceptable. Oh, and the acting of Dan Gordon (Chris) is pretty good. But these are the only two things that are acceptable in this project. The other is ... terrible? It's a very delicate word to describe the acting of the other actors, directing, the (so-called) "special" effects, even the way the crew filmed! I don't even like the way the camera operators move to record the scenes! It could be the most miserable movie I've ever seen. I really don't remember a movie lower than this one. Maybe there is, I don't think so. Ehh, what's done, it's done ... It's the movie and there's too late for anyone to change anything I've voted "1" but my realistic voice starts with a "-" (minus) before ... .
