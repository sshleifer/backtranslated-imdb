I never walked out of this movie before this one. I have entertained the idea a few times, but this time I did it, snuck in to see the end of another movie, but had to come back and see the end of the Rage while waiting for my friends. They told me I didn't miss much when I was away. I was generally insulted by the whole movie, in such a great way that I couldn't even describe it. My bowel instinct told me to get myself out of the theater. It was a visceral reaction to a terrible movie. The plot is centered around the cruel acts of some reprehensible teenagers against vulnerable and restless others. There was no ray of light, no wise or similar person to contrast. I found that even the "good guys" of the movie did nothing to me, was stupid, stupid, whiney, or just ineffective. <br /> <br /> The repetitive, graphic suicide images were much exaggerated, unnecessary and disgusting. (Not in an "I'm easy to come out" way, but more in portraying disobedience to the human way). And besides the repetition of that scene, in slow motion, from so many angles, the other visual aspects (interesting camera work, etc.) had potential, but sometimes it just became annoying. I am a person who likes movies and tries to find good things about them. Usually I can find some good things to reflect on the non-stuff of any movie. I'm not saying this movie had nothing good, but I say that, whatever it was, I can't remember it with all the other crap that made me angry. I'm also sorry about that. Perhaps the best parts are the clips of the classic original.
