I work my way through the Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and the MAD SAMPLE is one of those movies in the set. <br /> <br /> I'm sure George Zucco was a good actor; but it was only the second movie I saw him, the first being DEAD MEN WALK, in which he played two parts. But even good acting can't save the MAD MONSTER. <br /> <br /> Zucco plays a crazy scientist, dr. Cameron (banned from academia for his unethical and inhumane experiments). He believes he can control evolution by bringing the characteristics of one animal to another. <br /> <br /> In this case, like many others of his ilk, it is a transfusion of wolf's blood in humans. His aim is to create an invincible army that he can control through the antidote. The subject of his experiments is his hired hand, a delayed gardener, whose dialogue lowers these sizzling classics to almost fullness. <br /> <br /> Besides his experiments, Cameron also draws revenge on those who have discredited him, using his transformed gardener. However, he loses control over his subject, which begins to transform without the transfusion - yikes! <br /> <br /> The werewolf transformations are classic Hollywood stop action / makeup effects. It was undoubtedly the groundbreaking technique of the time; But in today's digital age it is difficult to imagine audiences being scared by it.
