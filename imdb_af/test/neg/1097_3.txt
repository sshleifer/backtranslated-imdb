Director J.S. Cardone offers something a little scary and a bit creepy, but nothing more. A Wife Mother Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring) inherits a house in the Pennsylvania Mountains; so she takes her two daughters and moves into the vast estate that looks like no where. But it is somewhere, somewhere ninety or one years ago, a tragic mine accident claimed the lives of many children who were forced to work and thank in the dark. The area and especially the Tunny estate seem to be haunted by the spirits of the little evil souls. The legend is that the screaming children come out in the moonlight to seek their revenge; and you believe it better. Also in the movie: Ben Cross, Scout Taylor-Compton, Chloe Moretz, Julie Rogers and Geoffrey Lewis.
