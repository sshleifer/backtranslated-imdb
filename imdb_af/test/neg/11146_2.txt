this movie sucks a big one. so many holes in the plot. If the devil is invincible, why does he need the protection of arnian bodyguards? I couldn't understand why Arnie didn't turn up for work for a few days and then suddenly appeared, they took all the weapons and disappeared again !! Nice work if you can get it. It is sad that the last 1/2 hour in the standard must not lead uzi 9mm final. Arnie's interpretation of a depressing cop is to bend and sniff his head. I thought he had a bad cold for most of the movie. Wrongly written, Arnie becomes 95% of the film called 'buddy', 'man' etc. And then we hear him suddenly by his real name of Jericho Cane (where do they get the names of?). The end is two, you'd better get it done. Disgrace that Gladiator ended up pulling off with 100% more class. <br /> <br />
