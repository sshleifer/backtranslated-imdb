It must be one of the worst movies I ever had to see the accident. The general idea of ​​a coronal mass ejection that hits the planet earth with EM disruption is fair enough, but where did they get the idea that humans could survive a 155ºF? The acting was so terrible, I felt that the decisive agents simply grabbed a handful of people from Santa Monica Boulevard and threw them in front of the camera. I honestly saw less woodwork from my ironing board. Sorry, but this film was poor, poor and poor.
