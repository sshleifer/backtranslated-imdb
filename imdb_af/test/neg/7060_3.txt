I like many Myrna Loy movies. This film was produced before her character actor's personality was developed. It will be an old short film, but looks forever in full shape. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy seems to be told what to do with her acting and doing the job. It's about everything you can say about her. <br /> <br /> Her gypsy character is slim and the movie has many flaws, like the jewelry store. <br /> <br /> This movie will probably be interesting for Myrna Loy fans, but even so, it's a disappointment.
