I remember this for the first time in the 80's as a teenager. Man, I've read the reviews on this trash and I'm amazed at the mood. This movie does not deserve four stars !!! This movie is NOT better than Topgun. Topgun has its own problems; Don't get me wrong. This movie should be banned only for its own stupidity. So many stereotypes, so many loopholes, so much poor dialogue. I can't think of one detached quality of this vomit. It's not action / adventure. It's a bad joke on film. Plan to watch Plan 9 with stock F-16 material. This movie not only makes logic and common sense within the context of a military institution, it sends a disturbing message. The army is not going to save your father from the threatening evil of the Middle East. So go out there and cut a multi-million dollar weapon and blow him out of the sinister heads of the backward, anti-American Arabs. Cuz you can't argue with those animals. It's a Bruckheimer movie without a budget. Bare direction, poor acting, lame music, idiotic plot, like ... Iron Eagle.
