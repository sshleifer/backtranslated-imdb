It is a pity that a movie with such good filmmaking as this one did not have a plot to be supported by the work of Sarah Cawley (filmmaking) and Adam Lichtenstein (Film editorial), and above all no sense of what Mexico does not happen. City. The film is trying to be a very realistic portrayal of life in the city, but it can't. It's a shame, a lot of film is wasted. An American woman is trying to find her abducted brother. The first version of the story is powerful and interesting, very realistic, but there seems to be no effort to get a better story from the ordeal, especially when it comes to the attitude of US Embassy staff in Mexico City when this is dealt with with such an issue. For example, compare with Frantic (1988), which deals with a similar issue. Something similar can be said of the role of local authorities. Compare, for example, with Todo el Poder (1999). The movie is worth checking out if you want a feel of the city, little or no attention to the rather poor "plot" and the many twists that require a fairly extensive suspension of unbelief. Who is going to believe that a Mexican patrol from Mexico City is going to catch the main characters across the Mexico-US border? And that this policeman can use his radio from the border to Mexico City! Just the producers of this movie. It is worth mentioning that, unlike Frida and other movies about Mexico, at least in this one Mexicans, Spanish speaks.
