A boring mixture of puerile attempts at humor with romantic relationship melodrama fails to provide this poorly made film with any taste of reality. Reno (AJ Buckley) acts as his friend in Flagrant Delicto with his roommate, who tells Reno (AJ Buckley). He tells Reno: "Well, at least it is with someone you know", which means that Reno never has another roommate, this decision said to the viewers through a quick exit vote. The storyline lasts ten months, where we find that Reno is indeed true to his word about avoiding roommates, although apparently due to his decoration of a living-in-lover, Holly (Holly Fields), with whom he generated marriage plans. The plot briefly moves to an insane Hollywood comic strip club, in which Reno's uncle Charley, of a "dancer" he actually desires, covers a fever over the club bar after seeing the untouched charm of the object. his feelings are displayed. It seems that Charley was aware of the poor condition of his heart, as he created a videotape during which his commentary bequeathed his large (and heavily) stay in Hollywood to Reno and we see the last decision, unlike his vow. , maintenance applicants for two roommates as tenants, with him and Holly sharing the selection process in an organized manner. To a bizarre sequence of bizarre tenant candidates, all of whom Reno and Holly find inappropriately inappropriate to live with them in their home, know each other, unknown to each other, a tenant of the opposite sex, with the lovers clearly following the choice of their partner. The newcomers (Chad and Nicole) do not seem to distinguish much more from their existence except for highly obedient fornication with a wide variety of partners. It is not long before jealousy Mars the harmonic relationship of Reno and Holly. Reno is bent on patenting and buying a kind of sports bag and, given Holly's engagement ring, the potential success of this entrepreneurial adventure is of great financial importance if he intends to promote his marriage plan. Unfortunately, the rapacious team of Chad and Nicole, whose actions are apparently aroused by lust, may possibly disrupt Reno's future marriages. The direction is limp, clearly far from the basic needs of the players, but a frightening script offers scarce material that allows actors to work and ad libbing falls flatly. As a result, the performances are immaculate, not supported by mock editing, while the manner of camera work changes so suddenly and often as a firefly's tail light. Shaped with a low budget and on-site, only a skill level is needed for the design processes, but a greater degree of value can be placed on the tasteless D.J. background soundtrack, generally blaring and almost always intrusive. A large part of the discussion was stimulated by the film's final sequel allegedly not expected by a viewer, based on what had previously come, but in reality it probably involves the only considerate parts of a poorly-chatting script , and justifiably offers the work almost visible, despite the detached quality of the production as a whole.
