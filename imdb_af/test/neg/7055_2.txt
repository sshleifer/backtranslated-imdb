The title of the movie is like a porn, but it's not even a sex comedy. Instead, the hot summer is in barefoot region over an official sent from a southern state to a small town to find and arrest moonlight. However, the moonshine comes from the farm of an old woman with three beautiful daughters. Almost everyone can guess what happens, but strangely, the movie is very soft. It does not qualify for a PG rating. In addition, the low budget is obviously almost every shot and the acting is soooo amateur. This movie was probably meant for the entry festival, but it is unlikely to satisfy them even in 1974.
