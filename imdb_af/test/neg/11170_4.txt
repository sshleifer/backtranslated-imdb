Robert Aldrich's brutal, quasi-black comedy "The Grissom Gang", a rework of the 1948 British film "No Orchids For Miss Blandish", kidnapped 1920 heir Kim Darby by a bunch of awkward thieves; Soon the gang is sent and poor Kim is then transferred into the heads of another bend - third-class gangster brothers with sweat, pure faces and a mother like Buddy Ebsen in tow. Initially, Darby (not very brave, not very clever) tries to escape this dropbread, but they are on her. Eventually she just gave up trying, and in it lay the problem with the story. Are we supposed to sympathize with her in the audience? Is her growing concern that the family's half-white is supposed to be heart-warming? These are disgusting, clumsy characters, and I wanted to see as few of them as possible. But since the side stories (the progress of the policemen on the case and the other with floozy singer Connie Stevens) have been, the director is no longer a choice but to keep the sweaty faces on us. Pretty soon, nervous Darby also begins to sweat, although her hayloft scene is being sensitively performed and Aldrich's climactic moments are tempting as well as disorganized. ** of ****
