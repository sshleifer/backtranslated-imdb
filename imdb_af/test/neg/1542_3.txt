There is something frustrating about watching a movie like 'Murder By Numbers', because somewhere in the Hollywood formula is a good movie trying to get out. But by the time the credits roll, there is no savings. The whole thing is almost blown by the "cop side" of the story, where Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin's killer detective characters are astounded by an awkward sexual relationship that is increasingly trivialized the longer the movie goes on. Although Bullock is strongly in her role, it is not enough to save the clumsy writing and lazy pacing. Ben Chaplin's talents are wasted in an unforgettable role (he got much better earlier this year in the underestimated 'Birthday Girl') as well as Chris Penn, who has a role so incredibly small, feel sorry for a talent like him . Anyway, the plot is not even a factor in this movie. The two teen killers played by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie. Their talent and chemistry work pretty well and they play well apart. It's too bad they weren't in a much better all-around movie. Barbet Schroeder is here for safe ground for such a seasoned movie maker. Bottom Line: It is worth renting if you're a genre fan, but everyone will experience a fulfilled life without ever seeing it, except perhaps on network TV with easy commercial break.
