Do you ever want to see how low a movie can sink? Well, look no further! This movie has it all! <br /> <br /> Racism jokes, disabled jokes, overweight jokes, suicide jokes, murder jokes, drug jokes, animal abuse jokes, eating dirty jokes, old man joking jokes, joking jokes, gay jokes, crap jokes, jokes flat on the face of your face over and over jokes, over-exploitation of jokes, rape jokes, joke jokes, alcohol abuse jokes, anal rash jokes, a lot of people joking their coffee back jokes, nudity jokes, seeing who curses the most words can say In one scene joke, lesbian jokes, girl abuse jokes, and the list goes on and on people! <br /> <br /> The worst part is: nothing is funny! (Not that anyone would find most of that funny.) It seems that when it doesn't get the worst, it pushes your expectations to a whole new ground, as there always seems to be someone else who feels the viewer. worse. There was one scene that almost excited me and almost completely depressed at the same time. I don't think I should point out which one, but then I'm sure there are other scenes that will give people the same feeling. <br /> <br /> There was one moment at the end of the movie that was actually meaningful and somewhat realistic, when suddenly one of the characters in the scene was piled up with the most beautiful remnants of a trash and just a threw a few feet on the ground to just hit a bunch of beer bottles in his head. All this probably where he deserved the least. All the thoughts of a 1 point salvation are quickly considered. It is indeed a terrible movie. It is one that needs to be studied and cut into small parts at a film school to teach students what not to do.
