Young writers, young author, young cast, busless producers, who can go wrong? Everything. Even lamb is too good a description, suggesting that three out of four bones function, then actually none of them were. Hardly enough recycled plot line for a 48 and a half minute television hour, gracefully stretched to ninety minutes. The audience was back on the screen, so bad was the story. Dirty police steal drugs from the witness accuser. How many thousands of times has it been done on television? Bad police frame good policemen. Again, how many times? There was no original piece in this whole concept. Giovanni Ribisi made a brave effort to tackle the lack of script and just draw the whole movie. And the idea of ​​him and Claire Danes works from a real screenplay with an adult director and photographed by a real movie maker. Note to scriptwriters: Buy one of those story generators. It may not be as bad as tearing off bad television. Note to author: There are shots available to you other than closeups. Even the beautiful and interesting face of Claire Danes eventually becomes tiring in the close-up. Note to filmographer: Pupil himself for a few years to a professional - you have a lot to learn. Note to use color switch at the laboratory: At least try to persuade the author and the filmmaker that they do not know what they are talking about. Note to Claire: I hope it pays for your new condo. It's time to get professional management and start reading the scripts before signing up.
