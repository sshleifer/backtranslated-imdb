This movie was extremely boring. I just laughed a few times. I decided to rent it when I noticed William Shatner's name on the cover. It's all about this little kid who's been picked up by his classmates. When he wanders the streets and looks for old ladies to help, he meets a prostitute. She took him to a club called the Playground, where he befriended several pimps. When Mayor Tony Gold (Shatner) decides to take over the pimp business, Lil 'Pimp must lay down for his homies. <br /> <br /> The animation isn't very good here. It looks like it was made with Macromedia, which I'm sure it was. It doesn't suck, it's just the kind of sounding animation that people have become accustomed to in recent years. The humor in this is not very good, I didn't think it was funny.
