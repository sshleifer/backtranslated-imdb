For years, I hesitated to watch this movie. Now I know why. It was even worse than I expected. Ashton Kutcher made the worst movie mistake of his career, since 'Dude, Where's my car?' Tara Reid co-star as Ashton's girlfriend, asking him to babysit her father (and his boss) pet for the weekend. The rules: 1. No shoes in the house. 2. No people in the house. 3. The boss's son stays out of the house. 4. Do not touch the furniture. <br /> <br /> Well, you can definitely guess at the end of the first twenty minutes how the rest of the movie will go. <br /> <There are movies like "Meet the Parents", where bad things happen to someone, but it is entertaining to watch, and it is delivered somehow so you can't wait to see what happens next no. It's not one of those movies. You know from the beginning that bad things are going to happen, and they are mostly stupid things that will never actually happen. It's a very frustrating movie to watch, and there were about three times when I almost turned it off because it was so bad. But I paid the rent and thought I should see it now. <br /> <br /> Tara Reid was good, and I'd like to see her in more movies. Although I'm not surprised if it has a hand in her career. <br /> <br /> The end result is a happy ending ... but of course with the kind of movie it is, you won't expect anything. short of it. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it. You will really regret it!
