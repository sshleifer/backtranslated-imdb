This DVD is missing its calling as a Heineken coaster .... This is a good example of why no one would ever see a sequel to another director / writer as the original. Two hours from this turkey asked me to beg Exorcist 2 reruns. <br /> <br /> NO LEGAL LAUGH. NOT ONE decent fright. The script was just a mess, and I felt bad for the actors who had to perform it (they had to have diseases at home, or a sample of cook habits or something). <br /> <br /> The original was a make-up landmark. So, of course, the successors of the successor thought it would be a good idea to delete Make-up FX and rather use CG werewolves. This CG waswolder laughed me much harder than any of the "comedies". It was just a total mistake. If you want an evening's entertainment, go back to the original. Or take a movie class and make your own horror movie. You must do better than these fools did.
