I understand the drawing and call on such a different kind of movie and I'm a big fan of movies with a small dialogue, but it's really terrible. I was in the Scottish Highlands and found the lack of Scottish accent in the characters disappointing. This plot was theoretically strong enough, but the cheap sets and the lack of a single realistic character dropped this movie off the ground. I feel the use of silence to create atmosphere only works when you have actors who can provoke a kind of presence without talking and these actors can definitely not. If you want a quiet movie trying to try (Le Dernier Combat) try. There were very few movies I couldn't even finish and that was one of them. Absolute dribble!
