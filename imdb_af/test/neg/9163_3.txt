When I finally died to see this movie recently, it was exactly what it seemed to me at first glance ... another Hollywood CG / live action rehash from an established cartoon franchise. Nothing special or memorable whatsoever. Design in all sorts of ways to appeal to many young children and immature adults, and use heavy use of comic devices such as fit, poo and the size of Theodore's buttocks. <br /> <br /> This movie will bother me much less if it wasn't such a clear step for the Chipmunks. Even their characters I've found have changed for the worse for the movie. While in the past, they each had a very clear personality, they all behaved like immature, fortunate children with ADD. They constantly reflected off the walls. It especially concerned me to see Simon so portrayed. He's supposed to be the smart, serious nerd acting as the "straight man" for Alvin's crazy antiques. But here he is almost a carbon copy of Alvin. One joke in the movie even implies that Simon just * thinks * he is smart, but really ... and honestly, if I have never heard of the chipmunks before I saw this movie, I'd have agreed. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie is just another obvious cash grab and I'm more than a little sorry it was even made. The fact that it is a "child" movie does not excuse his mistakes. Being a stupid movie that breaks down a classic franchise, because it is for children, insults children, and any child will earn something more intelligently than this movie.
