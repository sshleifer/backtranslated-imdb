To be a Steve Martin fan hurt to see him in a movie with such a cut. The scriptwriter had just hired a few videos and took a piece here - it is definitely the least imaginative movie I've seen in the past. I knew exactly what was going to happen in each scene as soon as it started. The African American stereotypes and slave references are also very offensive. But the thing that was the worst for me was seeing Martin in a movie without a white track. He is probably one of the most intelligent actors and has sold out to a totally dumbed script. He must be in his interview to try to be in such a lame.
