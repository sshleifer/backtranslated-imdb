oh dear god, I suffered to see this movie FOUR times in my sister's house and was it a terribly story of sex and guns and very cheap inexplicable play, unless you are at the rifle to prevent it . Yes Rule just proved he couldn't act Ving Rhames also gave the most terrifying play in any of his films. There wasn't one part of this movie, I laughed or made me feel like I was feeling emotion. I would be surprised that people really enjoyed it. I found some horrible movies in my life. but it would be in my five worst movies. The music in it was not good and the story I think was made by some guys who ordered a pizza and just sat down writing ten bullets and then making it into a movie. absolutely terrible
