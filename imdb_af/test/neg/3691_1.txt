After watching this movie, I decided it was so terrible that I had to join IMDb and write a review to warn other people from the pit to rent / buy this movie. To be honest with the movie there is only one good section for this movie and this is the final credit because you know this crap is good and really over. I watched it to the end in the hope that I could get some fun out of the movie. Just tunnels more tunnels and an old man talking to himself (If you see this movie too much time, you will too). As far as Val is concerned, if he chooses such films, he can kiss his scene so well. There is no reason to even write about what is in the movie, as it has already been done. Keep your money and common sense and keep it clear.
