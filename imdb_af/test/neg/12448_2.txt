It was pretty bad - from bad acting, bad technical details, bad camera shots and bad sound (although I watched a DVD, sometimes I couldn't hear what they were saying, sometimes my speakers blew, even within the same conversation ). The plot was predictable, and the characters consisted of mostly incredible neurotics, bipolar and caricature. Character development was terrible ... the little little sister (why was she even written in the script?), The stomach mama (again - for what purpose?) The shining girl (why didn't he dump her long ago?), The one dark robe's gang (how originally I can't think of a better name than I think), the drug dealer's hot friend (must have a hot Latina if you're going to do LA gangs, I think, but really ...) etc. etc. Can't believe I've looked at the whole thing.
