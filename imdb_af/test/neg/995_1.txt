I think Downey might have been inspired by the French new wave. <br /> <br /> Who wasn't it? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, what he ultimately created here came from crackhead news. <br /> <br /> Of course, a synapse is a terrible thing to lose and Downey has lost enough. <br /> <br /> Don't say no, indeed. In more ways than one. Including watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I couldn't bear it for a while and started it fast. It would have been better to skip it completely.
