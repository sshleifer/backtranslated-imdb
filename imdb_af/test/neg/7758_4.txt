1960's children's show with ex-vaudevillians plays handy men to rent. As you can expect, they are a disaster in everything they do. In the course of the 11 minute episodes (leaving 4 minutes for ads in the 15 minute time slot), they do things like setting up a fence between fighting neighbors, helping a wizard on stage and a found body and purse. /> <br /> Growing up I have never run over this show (apparently shot in New York). I thought I had heard about the period or seen how much of the children's performances were or looked at them as a child or looked at nostalgic conventions. Until Alpha Video released it on DVD. I was totally unaware of his existence. <br /> <br /> The show plays like the Three Stooges mixed with Abbott and Costello as people do. (Indeed, one of the two claims to have created the legendary "Slowly I turned ..." routine that made Abbott and Costello perfect). It's not bad, but it's really not good either, because everything looks wet. The timing is often down (although it may be due to bad directions) and the jokes have been recycled for years before the show first ran. Odds, you've seen it before. On the positive side, this is the kind of thing that will be perfect for offering young children the magic of the vaudeville style comedy, but it will be for parents to even go through the short episodes. <br /> <br /> Only for nostalgia junkies. Everyone else should look at an original Abbott and Costello or Three Stooges.
