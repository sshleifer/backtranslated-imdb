Bad movie! Bad! Stand in a boot. Root Tops should really stick to low-light comedy clubs. These are movies like what makes old Jerry Lewis movies like Shakespeare and John Agar like John Barrymore. Coutney Thorne-Smith (a good talent) is absolutely wasted. Her goal seems to look pretty and unconscious. <br /> <br /> The only pleasing aspect of the movie is that Raquel Welch owns an Alexis Carrington-type role, and Estelle Harris as a landlady witch. The only way I can think that someone would think it would be a good idea to make this (except sophomoric) movie, if the producers' fourth grade child is allowed to choose the script. Well, maybe its third. What this film really needs is to be smeared in the noses of its creators.
