Young spinster, who is not associated with her own age with women, and selected by a retired couple on a rainy day, invites a glowing young man to her apartment. Nervous and too polite to hide her own sexual insecurities, she is very happy when the boy makes him home in her guest house ... But not so happy if he starts sneaking into the window at night. Sandy Dennis is not an intrepid actress, but why she was attracted to these sad roles. I think we will never know. Based on a book by Richard Miles, and as far from a commercial drama as one could get, this stuffy material not only drew Dennis but also director Robert Altman (whose work is static). The story looks almost a sex reversal of "The Collector", a brand that sold movie rights, but is not a good idea to be a good idea. Even the movie's best order (Dennis who buys a prostitute to satisfy her prisoner) doesn't come off completely, with Sandy being indignant (whose idea was this plan?). Michael Burns is pretty good as the kid who uses this frumpy, pasty-sick woman just digs for her comfortable, but he is overly discouraged by Altman. With lots of strategic towels and flesh-colored parts (Altman clearly wasn't right for an adult picture with adult themes at this point). Sandy Dennis has a handful of very good scenes; She did not speak in this, she thought before she spoke and she was carefully careful in her actions. Unfortunately, the role itself is a bummer, with an apparent sliding in the mental degradation that appears on the screen. As such, the sudden final evil, and overall results are lukewarm. * 1/2 of ****
