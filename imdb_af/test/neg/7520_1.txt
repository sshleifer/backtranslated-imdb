This movie sucked. It was predictable from beginning to end. There was no chemistry between Pearce and the Mumba chick. The plot went nowhere and flew into oblivion. All this led to the film being very hilarious in its stupidity. And I wanted to strangle Orlando Jones, the man just had to break away.
