Looking at the ratings, you will assume it's a classic, but again it's just another example of poor independent filmmakers interested in their movie. They are not even smart about it 10/10 in the vote? I think to buck the curve and to compensate all the 1/10's will get it. Is it better than any decent zombie movie? No. <br /> <br /> Consequently, cheap and nasty. If it wasn't where the actors looked, you wouldn't know where it was coming. of. <br /> <br /> Cinematography. These people act as they borrowed their father's camera just after they looked at the matrix. Less is more, but more of this team is absolutely fat. <br /> <br /> Zombies are also garbage. I don't doubt most of these people will never be heard again and it will be for good reason. I hope zombies eat their eyes because it was 90 minutes of porridge that I would not get. <br /> <br /> And counterfeit ratings only make it a million times worse. <br /> <br /> One reviewer said this was one of the best horror movies he'd seen in the past 30 years? I can only assume that his recent corneal transplant was a success. <br /> <br /> Watch the trailer as it's a warning about how bad this movie is.
