This movie is on my list of the worst movies ever made. The story is disconnected and it's hard to understand what's going on or the reason for the characters' actions. All movies must have an inner logic, and this movie just doesn't have it - the story doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> Seeing Faye Dunaway, Christopher Plummer and Diana. Quickly wasting their talents in this movie is a crime. Faye Dunaway is the lucky one because she plays the victim and is killed early in the film. On the other hand, Donald Sutherland has to be a wonderful actor because he looks good despite bad direct and bad writing; His performance is credible and he manages to stay in character despite everything. <br /> <br /> If Dame Agatha Christie was alive, she would die! The movie is so bad!
