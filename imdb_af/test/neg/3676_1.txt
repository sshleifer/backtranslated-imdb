This movie is total drink. I love Val Kilmer and was surprised by "Felon" (a good movie!) Earlier this year. The entire DVD box is misleading. Val Kilmer, while being accused of being one of the main people in this movie, is about 2 minutes in the movie. Even the summary on the back of the DVD is not quite true. It could have been a good movie, but the direction was terrible and the plot was as thin as a sheet of paper. Usually when a movie is horrible, you can sit back and laugh. However, this movie is so bad and boring, I actually fell asleep (which I never do during a movie). Avoid at all costs!
