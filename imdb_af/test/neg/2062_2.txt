I bought this DVD as part of a set of 50 "historic classical artists." It's hardly a classic, and if the plot is updated to the time of its release, it's not historic either. The actual title on the DVD is "Immature" and also subtitled "The Private Life of Becky Sharp." Myrna Loy is not very convincing, but in her defense she is sowed with a terrible screenplay and tough dialogue. As with many early talks, and especially those made by smaller studios, there is little skill shown by the cast and crew. Loy wears a few gowns that are very attractive, but her costumes and make-up in the later scenes are exaggerated. The one saving grace is a tolerant performance by Billy Bevan, who plays one of her many suitors
