Good idea .... shy about the real movie. Would it be a little more frightening and explain more about the characters and who exactly was the evil woman? If she tortures those children, why do they help her kill and don't help others kill her? It's a bit of a bowl down from Malcolm in the middle! <br /> <br /> I think it would be beneficial to be a little longer and enter into more detail with the characters, but after about an hour I wondered when it would end! <br /> <br /> It would also have been better if the actual characters they killed were not actually computerized, they looked at them. And what happened to the Frankie Munitz character? He fell into a bed of wild roses, so it had to be safe, but the computer game showed him as a game, ie dead. The next thing he appeared with that annoying blonde lass to save the man who was afraid of fire, what I noticed, had no disadvantages turning the lighter when the demon woman was to him! <br /> <br /> Too much contradiction in this movie To really enjoy it, you might be thinking twice about playing the new computer game !!
