Ugh. Unfortunately, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. None of the characters is entertaining, which makes this movie difficult to watch. They are all miserable thirty-year-olds who do not accept their responsibility for their good life. I could only make it half an hour from the movie, so there is a chance that things will improve later, but I doubt it. I cannot imagine that five people themselves will be absorbed because they will stay with each other for ten years. <br /> <br /> Three sex scenes in the first half hour were also disappointing, as they have no relevance to the plot, and were clearly a free (failed) attempt to bring some life to this other dull movie . <br /> <br /> Save your time and money and skip this movie.
