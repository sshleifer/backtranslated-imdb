As a children's movie, it is wonderful. It just sucks for the family. I really hoped for something like the Goonies, which is a good movie for all ages. This movie was just too much for the kids with the stupid writing and characters calling each other smaller names like booger. ??? Alan Cummings, however, was a delight. And why do people compare Willy Wonka with this movie ... just because there is a theme song that looks much like the Willy Wonka song, this movie doesn't make anything like Willy Wonka.
