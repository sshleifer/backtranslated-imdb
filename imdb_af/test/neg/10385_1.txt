As the metaphorical flies fled, this dumb aqueous chair of a movie asked me to join them. <br /> <br /> You will soon find some of the opening sentences that the actors are talented. The writing editor was probably dead and the director should be. To be honest, I couldn't finish this movie because about twenty dull minutes in the eyes of the main actress moving across the floor, such as a Shetland pony shot in the ass, is too much for me to too stomach. <Br /> <br /> I've never, and I never mean, seen a movie as sweaty as this one and I see tons of crap movies. <br /> <br /> Turd.
