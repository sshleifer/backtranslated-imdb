Bad Writing? Cheque. Awful effects? Cheque. Horrible actors? Cheque. Lame direction? Check. <br /> <br /> After watching the DVD box at blockbuster video and being a fan of the horror genre, I posted $ 4.28 and rented this "movie". My girlfriend was out of town and I was bored so I decided on a late Tuesday night that it would be a perfect time for me to look at boxing art, a horror movie. What I received earlier was the worst movie ever made. Until then, I've always declared the "Slumber Party Massacre 3", the worst movie ever made. <br /> <br /> If you are the type who wants to see a movie, because you've heard how bad it is, it's for you. If you do not want to lose $ 4.00 and 80 irreplaceable minutes of your life, remove this garbage. <br /> <br /> An additional comment: I noticed some of the "actors" coming here commenting on the board. How can you boast about being in this movie? You were all terrible. I mean really bad. If there was an American Idol for actors, you would all be laughed at in the first few episodes. <br /> <br /> Peace. <br /> <br /> Sutter Cain
