This movie wasn't that bad, because the story went on, but the camera work is making it difficult to watch. I don't just love the so-called "realistic" camera work currently being done; you know the type of jump from the middle, surround, etc. What particularly irritated me about this movie, however, was the new thing they threw into the mix by shooting a few black and white frames in each scene. I believe the movie would have been much better if the camera was shot in the much more conventional way, because I couldn't concentrate it and analyzed the camera work earlier. Perhaps if more people feel dissatisfied with camera work like this, the filmmakers will eventually get the hint.
