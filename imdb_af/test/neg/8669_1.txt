Why did they have to make such a terrible adjustment? The whole "Complete Jane Austin" series as part of Masterpiece Classic looks like a big disappointment. Characters are completely ignored and there is no chemistry on the screen. The whole thing feels rather rushed. The 1999 movie report based on the same novel looks like a masterpiece in comparison. I really want to forget it. I'm really happy though, "Pride and Prejudice" will not be made again as part of this project and we will see the iconic and beautiful Colin Firth and Jennifer Elle as lead actors. If you skipped this "Mansfield Park", production sees yourself happy!
