This film coincides with Mike Allred's comic book mini-series, "Red Rocket Seven", and tells the story of a stranger who has escaped to the Earth to wait for Astroesque to join the book of Revelation and the apocalypse. It's only part of a bigger story (if the movie confuses you, read also "RR7"). You can easily tell that Allred is used to tell stories with pictures. The direction is very good and the bonds aren't bad for a $ 500 budget. Unfortunately, Mike used many friends to play the roles and probably didn't have the heart to say they couldn't act. Mike also doesn't show his writing skills in this movie. His dialouge gives you the plot and doesn't let you enjoy the characters. It was actually disappointing seeing its immense writing abilities shown in its comic books. 4 out of 10.
