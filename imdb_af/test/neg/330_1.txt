Man, these movies sucked. It seemed as if seven were running at the same time and they all made little or no sense. The special effects, costumes and all those things were over. The acting was particularly bad. Everything was so forced, especially the lines of the woman with the big eyes and the little child (his "Noooooo" as he is buried is so unimaginative, it's laughing). A good part of this movie is pretty funny anyway. The one woman's death where she throws a knife in a toaster is electrolyzed, and becomes magical in the crapiest skeletal dummy in the world. Have my friends and I laugh for a good ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Looking at really horrible movies, find this one out. If not, run for your life.
