<br /> <br /> Spoilers <br /> <br /> I'll be as friendly as I can about this movie (some people, including directors! ... <br /> <br /> There is a nice car accident and the opening credits look good and ... that's it, everything else bites the big one. All the acting is scary, the writing is embarrassing, the special effects look like they were done by schoolchildren on cheap computers. serious boules shoes. <br /> <br /> As a horror movie it is not very scary and if it is a "think man's" horror movie, it has succeeded at one level or another, I thought that the end of this movie is very far away, it can actually be an ironic look at bad horror movies and i miss the point but i somehow doubt it. <br /> <br /> This is " a full movie movie store and I couldn't recommend it to anyone, and it hurts me to say this while eagerly awaiting the resurrection of the British horror. <br /> <br /> If you disagree with this review, it's okay, it's just my own opinion and I'm sure someone out there will love it (for example, the director's mother).
