First of all, let me just say ... Ghost Story .... hello!?! If any of the other people who ruined this movie from start to finish, they realized their reviews. would have been very different. The fact that characters keep disappearing when the protagonist turns back to look, should have been given away a dead one. This movie is not a ghost story when you rented it in the video store, not even a hint, and this is the BIGGEST mistake made by the studio that marketed it. It was deliberate on their part not to market it as a ghost story to confuse you as the main character is confused if you make sense. The problem in this is that they have lost too many viewers; The ghosts appear "too human and real" without any of the usual signs, images or special effects that Hollywood usually uses to let you know that you're seeing a ghost now ... and that's what they're trying to do. The main character doesn't know she doesn't see ghosts or the viewer. Now you get it? As long as you understand that the main character is seeing, you will understand the movie and not be as annoyed as viewed as a main view of continuity or plot errors. <br /> <br /> I admit it To say, it was not yet a good movie, just not that bad, and just like everyone else made it. Just understand, if you intend to watch this movie, all you see is "not always" what you think it is. 4 out of 10 for acting, 3 for originality, 5 for plot and 5 for fear factor, although there were some spooky and haunting moments. Still not a good movie, just misunderstood way.
