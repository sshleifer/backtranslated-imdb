Why, oh why, is this trash regarded as a classic? I saw higher body figures on episodes of The Simpsons. Almost nothing happens in this movie and much of the running time is filled with almost unbearable melodrama straight out of a low rental apes. <br /> <br /> The Trenton family is going through tough times and when daddy's away mom And little boy is going to fix the car. But when they arrive at the farm, they discover that the watchdog has become angry. The rest of the movie just sits in the car, while the slab of St. Bernard surrounds them over and over. <br /> <br /> As far as the child is concerned, I have never seen a more annoying child in a movie. my life. And of course he is totally Aryan, as blond-haired and blue-eyed children, like the one prominent on parcels of children's chocolate, seem to be more sympathetic to people with brown eyes and dark hair, like me. All he does is cry and cry. The same goes for Mommy. She got the car out, she got in the car, she got the car out, she got in the car. <br /> <br /> I know it was made in 1983 but I'm just sick of killing horror movies where the characters make stupid, illogical decisions. If Mom didn't use common sense, she could get away from the icky dog. <br /> <br /> It is very poorly written and there is zero voltage. If you want to see a good "bad dog" movie, watch John Lafia's Man's best friend. It's funny, resourceful, has a better dog, a higher body number and a more relevant story. Let this garbage be.
