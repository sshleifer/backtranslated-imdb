DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE! <br /> <br /> I had to see why all the critics touched on this movie. I saw it and didn't get it yet. The plot is thin, very thin. After the movie was over, I didn't know the name of the female main characters yet and one of the two male characters didn't even have a name in the credits, he was credited as the farmer. I didn't care about the characters, so I didn't care about the movie. <br /> <br /> The landscape and cinematography were brilliant, but so are the things on the National Geographic or The Discovery Channel. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie to anyone.
