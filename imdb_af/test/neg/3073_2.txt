Some movies are so bad they look for the cringe factor. Disciples made me so bad that it was uncomfortable. I watched as it was all unbelievable that I saw, was nobody aware of how bad it was while filming? Mix the most hammered performances of most wood actors, an abysmal script, every comment from all the 'actors' sounded like it came from the same character and the most hasty editing attempted (and failed bigtime) around the film' a forced pace. All of this is combined into a movie that robs you of a few hours of your life and gives nothing in return. Avoid at all costs.
