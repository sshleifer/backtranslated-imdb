This litter has so much resemblance to the novel as a cucumber slice to a cucumber. The filmmakers took the Alamo section out of the book, made it into a movie and said it was based on the book. Hah! Wonder what they did to Mr. Michener suppress to endorse this piece of fluff? It was just another Davy Crockett, flintlock gun, Santa Ana, 13 days of glory-collecting poppycock. I almost started to root for the mexicans, just to end the damn thing. And what was that scene where Stacey Keach tried to get James Bowie to look at him? The sexual innuendos he used was youthful and unnecessary. They could use the movie they wasted on that folly to place a true dialogue. This show was an embarrassment to Hollywood. Or can those clowns be ashamed?
