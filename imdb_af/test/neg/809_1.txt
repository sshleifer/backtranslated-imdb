Don't see this movie! It's ... repulsive! The start is indeed very good, but in the middle everything falls and I really regret spending 80 crowns on the ticket! Peter Dalle should consider it his last chance to get people's interest. AWFUL photo! The only bright point is the beautiful work of Robert Gustavsson, Lena Nyman and GÃ¶sta Ekman. <br /> <br /> Hope you accept my advice ... The photo is junk.
