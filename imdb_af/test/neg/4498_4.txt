It should be remembered that the Gammera movies, like many of the first series of Gozilla movies, were actually aimed at children. Little Kenny and his cohorts live out of the daydreaming of the children in the audience: they are wandering around playing with top secret things while the adults are standing by; they get cavort with monsters, and even when the bad guys enter, they are never in any danger. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the first Gammera movie is an aberration because the child is being punished and endangered, but the rest of the series is pure wish satisfaction. <br /> <br /> As one critic said, it is not adult movies, but successful children's films.
