Back in 1993, Sega released a dull, slender video game from one of the greatest movies of all time. To realize their mistake quickly, they took out another version of the game and claimed it would be bigger, harder and better. <br /> <br /> Neither. Both were slow, boring games. <br /> <br /> You can choose to be Dr Alan Grant or ... a Raptor. Both have their problems. Why would dr. Grant is going to kill all those army boys (just what do they do in the game)? And why does a raptor kill other raptors? Weird. <br /> <br /> Obviously they didn't learn from their first mistake. Sega really dropped the ball on the original release and the so-called Rampage Edition. One of the slowest, slowest and dull platforms I've ever played.
