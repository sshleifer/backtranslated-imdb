A quick, funny, come-of-age matinee skirt calling on the one-day indulgence in all of us. It actually works as a vehicle for Justin Long who broke out on our screens in the fourth Die Hard via PC vs Mac ads, Dodgeball and The Break Up. He is funny, serious and young - a great career ahead. <br /> <br /> A city's worth of college wannabes find a fake website. Bartelby (Lang) tried to deceive his condemning parents and descended on the "college". It was a short notice Facebook party. Lewis Black summarizes the anarchic philosophy as a state department. Along with criminal friends, support for the subterfuge and consequent appeal to greater traditions of education and friendship. (Adam Herschman deserves special mention for his significant slapstick contribution). Well executed, felt and immediately forgotten. 10/04
