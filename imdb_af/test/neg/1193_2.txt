I'm a massive fan of the LoG. I thought the first two series had the best comedy this country has ever seen, and the third series, though different, was wonderfully dark and imaginative. The idea of ​​seeing Tubbs, Edward and Briss on the big screen did July 3 to wait. Yet, somewhere it all went terribly wrong. The authors had no story and no real ideas. The part in old England showed the glitters of genius we know the league is capable of, but these scenes didn't fit well with the movie. Geoff had the best of too few, mostly poor jokes and Lipp and Briss's performances were much lower. If you like the league, save yourself time and money and look at the episodes of the TV series again. And again. A massive disappointment.
