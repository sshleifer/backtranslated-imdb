This film was full. Maybe it's actually a pollution. The subtle, tense atmosphere of the original remake is not true. Sarah Michelle Gellar is not given anything to do, even in her death order, but she is still the best performance in this movie, and her death is the best thing about it, even though she deserves a better death. This is the sign of very bad writing and directing. I suspect she did this movie to stop her connection with it when she rubbish. <br /> <br /> Not scary. Not tense. Not funny. Don't make sense. And, as mentioned above, Sarah Michelle Gellar gives the only reasonable performance from the whole role.
