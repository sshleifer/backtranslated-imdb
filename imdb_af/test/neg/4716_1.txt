I swear I never saw such a bad movie as Half Caste. Not just because it just makes sense, is a huge piece of self-righteousness and self-confidence that has dropped me. <br /> <br /> Sebastian Apocada (in Spanish Apokada has a similar verdict for "apocado" which means "out of life and happiness") makes a one-man army movie here, he thinks is Sam Raimi or the boys who managed the Blair Witch project. This is the Blair Kittie project, with an expensive low budget. <br /> <br /> The story, a few American filmmakers going to Africa to make a Half-Cabinet documentary, is just no point. The way of filming, with high-speed photos with slow motion shots, reveals your stomach more than the stupid rules (what is the dialogue about Bestiality?) Or the lame representations. By the way, I don't believe this cast (or caste?) Is American, they all look European to me. <br /> <br /> To complete this, just say the filmmakers made an intelligent move about selling the movie. They have a fake award performance (like most original movie) and a nice cover (in Spain the lid had a negative half-throw image), so I feel unhappy now that I can't claim my 14 euros back.
