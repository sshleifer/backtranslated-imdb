Wow. They told me it was bad, but I had no idea. <br /> <br /> We started a tradition. We got one copy of this movie, and we just pass it from person to person. Whoever sees the movie looks at someone else and sees it as worthy to see this unique, creative, horrible movie. Hopefully it will travel around the world a few times. <br /> <br /> It's painful. Really painful. It's even gone so bad it is funny. Well, okay, sometimes it's so bad, it's funny. But most of the time it just gives you the feeling that something is sucking on your brain. <br /> <br /> Wow. Look at it and then succeed.
