No Holds Barred is a movie that should never be taken seriously. It sucks hardcore as a serious movie. Look more at how you plan Plan 9 from outer space. They are one in the same because they are both so bad they are funny. The funny moments in No Holds Barred are usually those not supposed to be. When Rip (played by Hulk Hogan just as he can play it), the limo driver grabs from the front after his first encounter with Brell (Kurt Fuller) hilarity, and that is one part of the movie every person should see . It might be the funniest scene ever, I swear. <br /> <br /> Anyway, how someone thought this movie would make money, I would never know and that person should probably be beaten. I hope they are at least fired. This movie earns 1 out of 5 on my scale and that one is just for the unintentional funny parts.
