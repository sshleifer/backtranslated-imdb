The original "Attack on Precinct 13" is eager, witty, and - perhaps the most important - short. These remakes are ruthlessly stuffed and talky. Worse still, the African American hero of the first movie is being replaced by the handsome white boy Ethan Hawke, who makes this "assault" less progressive than the 1970s. God, how do I miss John Carpenter and his unlikely plot line and his strange sense of humor. I even miss his B-list actors, who are leagues better than Hawke and the company. <br /> <br /> I can't say I care about the new villains in this version - they stretch what little credibility the story ever had to the limit. The female characters are useless, the criminals are all generic hoods, and Gabriel Byrne gives one of his bored performances. The music is all wrong too - it's blatant action things that actually detract from the tension. Simply awful.
