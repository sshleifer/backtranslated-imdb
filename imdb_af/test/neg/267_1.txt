What can I say about Ocean's Twelve? Who thought it would ever come? A big debris that loses itself halfway and can't get back. I was amazed at how bad it really was. Really! I have never seen the end properly, because this film is just impenetrable. I'm a big fan of the first, but it's a lame excuse for a successor. <br /> <br /> What was the point of the lift if they were to return the money? The movie is just boring and so dragging along that I can never sit through it. It's really bad. Stay that far, repeat as far as possible from this movie. This is worthless.
