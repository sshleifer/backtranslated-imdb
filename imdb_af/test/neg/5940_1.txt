The film shows relationships of the dying mother, and the boy, who is very attached to her, and definitely loves her. What does it show? It shows their lives in very poor conditions. It shows how softly they "walk" (really he brings her). But what do we see further? After their promenade he walked alone in the same places where they walked together. This is not possible. A person who loves and cares for another dying person will do everything to make this one's life better. He won't have a free minute to think, to be alone, and if he gets a few minutes out of it, he'll run away from where he usually should be. Another thing. The author dedicated this film to Andrey Tarkovsky. We see he has learned a lot of Tarkovsky's visual effects. But in Sokurov's movie they are just effects, they don't support senses or mood. Someone compared this movie to "Mirror" ("Zerkalo"). There is nothing in common except these visual effects. "Mirror" is a good movie and this one is just poor imitation.
