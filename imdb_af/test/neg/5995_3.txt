It had to be risky. VH1 turned away from the traditional divas (Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, etc.) that made the 2003 show so old. Unfortunately, the move returned. The show had no MC to keep the show together. Queen Latifah performed a fantastic performance on the 2003 Divas. The show kicked with a horrible version of Lady Marmalade with Patti Labelle, Cyndi Lauper and Jessica Simpson. Well in the studio with some control they can all sound good. <br /> <br /> But when they compete (why?), it just sounds painful! Jessica Simpson has the most bizarre facial expressions when she sings what I've ever seen! Cyndi Lauper also performed Girl, just want to have fun. It wasn't that bad, but it was almost impressive. The worst was yet to come! Cyndi and Patti Labelle worked together to perform Cyndi's hit 'Time After Time'. It was acoustic, and didn't fit into the rest of the show. Yet it would have been good if they both did not insist on crying like mowed animals. It was just dire. <br /> <br /> Debbie Harry (from Blondie) is always cool. She has her own style and although she may not be able to vote with much of the divas, although she can sing very well. Debbie came out and performed Blondie's # 1 hit 'Rapture'. With some beautiful choir. She hit the notes perfectly. She looks stunning. Rapper Eva gave a new but unfortunately inferior rap. It was good. Debbie's next show was a team with the newcomer Joss Stone. They performed the Blondie hit 'One Way Or Another'. I think Joss misunderstood the style of the song and just shouted about Debbie. A little sad thing was when Debbie tried and failed to meet her scandal that spoiled it. She just had to let Joss continue with her totally inappropriate warballing. The whole of Blondie performed this track. Debbie's last track performed was Blondie's massive hit 'Call Me'. It was pretty poor. Not Debbie's fault, because you just couldn't hear her. The sound was horrible all the way through the show. <br /> <br /> Joss Stone also performed some songs on her own. They were pretty well done. Ashanti also turned up to do two inexplicable cover versions. First, she has Diana Ross' 'I'm coming out', and then Chaka Khan's' Is not Nobody '. She's not a diva! She can sing to some extent, but she has no presence whatsoever. Why not just get the right singers. Chaka was even on show. <br /> <br /> Gladys Knight turned up and did a medley. It was very good. She was probably the best part of the show. I don't know much about her because she is a seasoned artist in Las Vegas and her experience and class really shone. In another show, Patti Labelle hit her 80's New Attitude this time. It was the final and it was good, but it was too late to late. This was a big dud. Good luck next time VH1. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was a heavily edited 55min version shown on VH1 in the UK. If it were the best bits .....
