Italian rounding off Mandingo and The Drum is a poorly baptized Italian life on the plantation yarn. Many people who do not look like they belong in the US south wear bad costumes and wander around places that don't look like the American south. The plot has something about the romance between a rich man and a certain young woman, the jealousy that follows and the tragedy that follows. The movie promises hot steaming sex and lots of twisted violence, but nothing really comes from it, it's all plague. It's probably racially sensitive, I couldn't tell because it was artistic bankrupt. The final turn is at its best. A big turkey.
