It's a very boring and uninteresting action movie, and without Chuck Norris it would have been unbearable! Plus the low budget shows great time! Some of the battles were good, but the story was laughing, and there were no threatening villains. The dialogue was laughing. I had problems completing this movie, but Chuck Norris made it slightly portable. I really have nothing more to say, as I only paid half the attention because it was so incredibly boring but it eventually picked up a little. The direction is terrible. Don Hulette, do a horrible job here, with bad photography, a terrible fit, and generally the movie looks dull! There are no gores. The Acting was terrible. Chuck Norris is very good here, he kicks the hole and he makes the movie almost portable (Chuck rules!). George Murdock is horrible as the chief villain, and very unconvincing. Terry O'Connor is decent here and has good chemistry with Chuck. Michael Augenstein, is decent as Chuck's brother. Overall It is pretty easy to avoid! * Out of 5 (Chuck saves it from the BOMB rating).
