Why do C Thomas Howell do these movies? Cruise (Howell's one-off co-star) follows a big block of WOTW and Howell with this lame effort. <br /> <br /> Where do I start here? Production values ​​- I start with the good things. The appearance of some of the scenes in this movie is not bad to be honest. The setup is good in patches and the direction is not too bad. <br /> <br /> Script - Terrible. A series of some scenes that can be placed in any order that permeates you throughout the film. The number of times the scene faded to black and repeated a second later in the same room was countless. Very bad storyline (but so was the Cruise WOTW) takes a little blame, but a deadly screenplay kills it. <br /> <br /> Special FX - Well, I don't want to be too hard here if I propose the budget was smaller than Cruise's lunch bill - but in the overall context of the movie the consequences were bad. Some shots are pretty impressive - especially far from bridges, Washington, liner. But in the main, the "alien" machines and tentacles themselves are scary. Also the camera quality is fuzzy on some shots and cut away completely on others. <br /> <br /> Acting - I'm a fan of Howell, but as he reduced himself to play in this low-budget movie, he donated the "overworking" bug long ago. Watch his performance in The Hitcher and compare it to this movie. There is no comparison. He exaggerated his facial expressions, his flailing arms and legs (where did he get that style of running?) And for a final coup look at the scene where he lost his family's photo. Hysterical. But after all this, he's still the best actor here. Busey is embarrassed to look at and Peter Green (Zed is really dead, now baby) mumbles incoherently through his one and only scene. I honestly couldn't understand one word he said. I even went so far to activate the captions on that scene - but the DVD didn't have captions. It also seems to be a real interview, as Howell's son, the director's wife and the line producer make it all in the movie. None of them are good. <br /> <br /> Direction - not bad, but not good either. <br /> <br /> Score - Dismal. <br /> <br /> Overall, a lame duck effort that won't do anything to Howell in trying to return it to big time. He has to look at Rourke and try to figure out how he has returned to the A list, but if he does, he won't be running fast enough. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
