As a resident of China I cannot accept this kind of idea that some people should die for a 'better world'. I said "better world" because it is a lie that Chinese people have been encrypted for a thousand years! <br /> <br /> I think most Western audiences can't know Qin Shihuang (meaning first emperor). The king in this movie is the most notorious tyrant in ancient China. The Tianxia (Chinese word spoken by the king, means "the country and the people") spoken out of his mouth is utterly false. From then on, one after another spoke the king in ancient China the same thing, but very few did as they said. <br /> <br /> Another fact is that Qin Shihuang's empire lasted only about twenty years ago. <br /> <br /> Well, I like the beautiful scenes of this movie, but it can't allow me to accept the idea that people should die for a tyrant.
