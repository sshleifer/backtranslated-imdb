French Cinema sucks! With all these psychiatric visions with their my-God-I-cultivated, different attitudes! Pestilence to conceited symbolic film language and impenetrable chiffres! I will no longer think about it! Leos Carax, have you ever thought that a dialogue in a movie can be natural and lively ??? Maybe I'm too general to understand you? Or was it your job to confirm all the clichés of a Frenchman who could have the world? Guillaume the to-be guilliotined comes to his home palace, Mme. Deneuve, not in the picture, plays the flute: "Here I am, darling!" At this moment I knew she was in the bath, and we'll be lying inside her soon. Don't get me wrong, I'm not careful, and the turbulent sex scene was the climax of the movie. But it is in Berlin, we say "etepetete", which means something like "être-peut-être", a snobbish, self-satisfied and the worst I have often seen in French movies! Another example: She is beautiful and willing, looks at herself in a mirror, her hair combs, and her wild-ghosted, dirty young guru rushes into the room, shouting breathlessly: "There is no escape, there is no escape!" Forty years after existentialist Sartres and consorts - what's new, what's exciting about? My God, there is that woman and she loves you and admires you, what would be more natural to be happy with your life? And if you're not, please explain much better why !! Born French means living a life in excess, no escape, is that the point?
