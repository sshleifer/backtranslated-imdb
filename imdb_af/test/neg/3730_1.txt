For a lifetime to watch and enjoy thousands of movies, Feeling Minnesota is absolutely the worst (** big movie with A-list stars) I've ever seen. Bar none. This movie fails completely on every level. It was poorly photographed and edited. There is an uninspiring play, the kind where the actors get bored. Usually pick up payrolls? And worst of all, it seems that the messy writing was written under the influence of an unpleasant substance found only in sewers. I can't even understand how the author / director could ever find someone to fund this project, let alone any of the stars he did. I really wish I could get the time I wasted to watch this piece of garbage. If possible I would have given this film a degree of zero. Even better, a negative number.
