A group of people are deep in the jungle for various reasons, and eventually find a lost city (where King Solomon's Diamonds apparently is) and a supergorillas race. Now you know you're in trouble when you pay off actors like Linney and Curry in one movie that stars ... a talk gorilla, and that's just the beginning. Okay, what else ...? <br /> <br /> For an action / adventure movie, the movie is ... well, just like that. The first hour (!) Of the movie, they are not even in the jungle, just try there, with subplot to subplot (something about a local military regime, whatever) and when they finally do ... it's just no more fun. <br /> <br /> The effects of the movie are just so-and-so (and really bad compared to the previous Jurassic Park movie). <br /> <br /> Now, the end. The father does not care for the death of his son, but is only interested in the diamonds? Uh-huh ... just in the movies, just in the movies. <br /> <br /> A full waste of talent, this Chricton (Jurassic Park, Twister, ER) adaptation. 10/02.
