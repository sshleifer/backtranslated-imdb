It was undoubtedly the WORST movie I have ever seen, but when I first started, it was just like the very bad car wreck on the side of the road. You can't help yourself, just watch. My eyes !!! The acting was terrible, the production was terrible, the filming was terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible. I was glad the priest was cut, would have liked to do it himself because of his poor conduct. I mean suckling that acts on the tenth power. I would have encouraged if Chris had just the fate of them before turning to himself. And what was that freaking wig of hell on his head? I sincerely hope that no one has been paid, I mean to be paid, should be considered here. They have to be paid never to try another film project, everyone involved, never again. It was just a big piece of garbage I was ashamed to say that I just had to keep going to the end. Don't watch it, it's about half an hour of your life, you'll never come back, and then you should spend time on this site so you can write a comment like I'm doing now, which you should do as a catharsis to survive the aftershocks to see this movie (and I use the term "movie" here).
