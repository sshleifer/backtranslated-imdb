Peter Hunt started out as a very talented film editor and made his first appearance when he made the James Bond movie "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" clear (considered by many Bond fans to be the best of the series). Other titles in his filmography include epic-scale adventure films such as "Gold" and "Shout At The Devil", both adapted from Wilbur Smith novels. "Gulliver's Travels" is a strange one on his list of films; It seems strange that a director of Hunt's style and expertise will choose to direct a film of this kind. A half-live action / half-animation of Jonathan Swift's classic satire, the movie has been chosen for twenty years, even when it's made. It simply doesn't work. And there's not a damn thing that Hunt (with his regular eye for quick action) or star Richard Harris (who can usually enrich the most selected roles) can do to save this one. <br /> <br /> Lemuel Gulliver (Richard Harris) is a brilliant medical student living in the 17th century Bristol. His father (Norman Shelley) wants him to go to London to make his fortune; but Gulliver prefers the idea of ​​receiving less wages, but a lot more adventure than a ship's surgeon aboard a ship called the 'Antelope'. During a trip, the Antelope is, of course, blown during a storm and hit a reef. The ship sinks and everyone is lost, apart from Gulliver ??. who finds himself washing in the kingdom of Lilliput ashore. When he arrives, Gulliver finds that the strange land where he has landed ashore is populated by incredibly small people, no longer than her. For them, he looks like a giant. They convince Gulliver to help them in a war against another race of small people living on an adjacent island. But Gulliver does not like to be manipulated for the purposes of war and destruction, so he plans to escape. Harris is about to wear the whole movie here. His first scenes involve other actors, but as soon as he is destroyed in Lilliput, he spends the rest of the film spreading over the knee height sets and acting alongside his animated counterparts. The idea of ​​mixing live action and animation was not new at the moment, but it was certainly not much done. A couple of Disney movies such as Song Of The South, so fond of my heart and Pete's Dragon have tampered with the idea, but it was quite in its infancy. "Gulliver's Travels" is not a very well-animated movie, but the scenes that interact between Harris and his cartoon stars are at least done well. Sometimes the film tries to be faithful to its satirical origin (there is one scene where we learn that Lilliput has attacked his neighbor because of eggs!) And the point is that wars can start over the most ridiculous things). But in his heart, it is very much a children's movie and the satirical overtones are barely inhabited. Everyone involved did better things during their career? "Gulliver's Travels" might fill another empty afternoon, but it's also an unforgettable and experiential experience.
