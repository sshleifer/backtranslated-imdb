Oh me. Start with such a great potential - a lot of cute girls running almost naked look. Then to a bar where the 80's cheese comes up, look. Go the next morning to a Woodsy State Park, look. A lot of girls and their professor, evil bikers, a general merchant and the death of They live like the local drunk. It makes a nice body number, watch (and talk about body numbers, note the strong similarity to the DVD covered by the foreign horror flick - Body Count! Aka Camping del Terrore). A whacky Indian in the forest doing some kind of ritual, hmmm, OK, I'll let it slip, look. And then, oh brother, all the descent from there. Awful. However, the Lochness sample head in the dam scratched me.
