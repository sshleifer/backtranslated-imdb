Retro puppet master began in 1944 where Capt lives after dead objects back in 1902 in Paris when his younger self (Greg Sestero) ran the Theate Magique. He describes the fateful night when he met a 3000-year-old Egyptian wizard named Afzel (Jack Donner) and the ultimate love for life, the young and beautiful Ilsa (Brigitta Dau). He tells the story of how Afzel passed the gift of life for himself and gave life to his own puppets that were part of the Theater Magique show. But the gift of life was also a curse like the old God Sutek, who was stolen the secret of the first place, by Afzel, wants it back and everyone who taught it dead. <br /> <br /> Too late I was on a bit of a Puppet Master bender as a big fan of the first three. I decided to look at the rest of the franchise. As such, I saw Puppet Master 4 (1993), Poppespier 5: The Final Chapter (1994), the Curse of the Puppet Master (1998) and now Retro Puppet Master in the space of a few weeks and boy was it difficult to by getting them all, especially this one, because it is the worst of the series so far. Retro Puppet Master feels like a cross between Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge (1991) with the period in which Puppet Master 4 & Puppet Master 5: The final chapter with Sutek tries to kill everyone related to his stolen life secret. There is not much continuity, and again there is none of the green serum in the previous films, and despite Andre Toulon in 1939 at the beginning of the original Puppetmaster (1989) suicide he committed in 1944 alive and well . The majority of the story is told as a jump and rather concentrates on Andre Toulon himself as the puppet. The film focuses on its relationship with Ilsa and it teaches the secret of life. It's all dull and boring things to be honest. Even at just 80 odd minutes, Retro Puppet Master feels long and filled with no real fit and the no central concept as the plot never really falls off. Then, of course, there is the amazing decision to completely redesign the puppets I have redesigned incredibly. I mean why would the makers have the one basic thing that made the Poppy Study movies so memorable and completely gone away? The dolls are seen briefly at the beginning and end, but otherwise we get this jerky wood caricature that is no cooler than their modern repairs. It was never even explained why these dolls were used rather than those who got all the Pope study fans, although one suspects that Full Moon hopes to make another successor who dealt with that question. <br /> <br /> As a bad story and a complete lack of our favorite dolls wasn't bad enough. Full Moon has decided to go with a PG-13 score as it makes Retro Puppet Master the only Puppet Master movie not classified in the US. have their own movie rating systems) and therefore there is not a single drop of blood in the whole film, the dolls do not kill anyone, there is also no curse and no nakedness. It's tamer than tame kids all the way. Apart from the fact that the dolls themselves are garbage, the special effect is also the west of the series. There is no stop-motive animation in this one, no CGI computer effects (certainly in 1999 CGI was cheap enough?) And all the effects are of the stiff bar-pop type effects. I mean when you see a doll walking, the camera is always placed above the guard so the legs don't have to be shown and there is, of course, a production assistant who just pushes the thing. It's as complicated and technical as the special effects. <br /> <br /> The one positive thing about Retro Puppet Master is that it looks nice, the time of production design, costumes and props is quite impressive, and it's a pretty attractive film. to watch at times. Apparently filmed in Bucharest in Romania, which has doubled very well for the turn of last century Paris. The acting here is terrible and perhaps the worst of the series. <br /> <br /> Retro Puppet Master is more or less the final Puppet Master movie than the next one. Puppet Master: The Legacy (2004) basically shows the footage of the previous seven films and it's a great way to round off the series that started out so well with three excellent and distinctive little killer puppies. Don't worry about this, just look at one of the first three and just remember the good times ... The killer puppies will return in the terrible spin-off flick Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys (2004).
