In the XXII century, an architect by the name of the dealer (Bruce Ramsay) recommended a space station he personally designed. As can be predicted, a special force is sent to repeat the expensive station and arrest the Merchant. Upon arrival, they find him in a strange ritual using a mysterious cubic. During interrogation he revealed that they had to finish him, what he had started or the hell he had released would bathe in blood. Convincing the officers holding him in exile, he remembers his legacy, the toymaker who built the building. boxing and the reasons why he is here in space ... <br /> <br /> The movie that is actually the same as Hellraiser, that The Quickening was Highlander. Something to be ignored and forgotten, so it won't affect much more on Hellraiser's lore. By far the most trashy of the franchise with a much lower grade feel than what its predecessors have (these are B and C class films). <br /> <br /> Sometimes it seems to be influenced by a mid-sized porn movie with incredible wood performances, what do you actually think: So when will they get out and start with the community? Surprisingly not much sex in the film, although the launch of the seducing demon Angelique (a completely redundant character who unnecessarily spoils what we know of the world of Hellraiser) offers great opportunities for love. <br /> <br /> Basically, the movie consists of three different short stories (one in the future, one in the present and one in the past) that lacks focus and is amateurly rushed. The end result is extremely poor, basically underlined by the fact that you have no interest in what happens to any of the characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> Some decent gores in the movie, but apart from that is a total failure.
