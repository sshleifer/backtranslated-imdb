I can imagine why he wants to die, starring in this garbage. The man is unbelievable, but even Sidney Poitier couldn't save this tiring racism morality team in the old West. He and Joanna Going are both fantastic in this movie: too bad the screenplay, co-stars, directing and score couldn't match those two.
