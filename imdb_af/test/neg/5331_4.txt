It's one of those movies I see every time it's not going, but because it's so bad I can't lose sight of my eyes (like "Battlefield Earth" or "3000 Miles to Graceland" ). The first time I watched, I kept waiting and waiting and waiting to laugh and didn't get my chance to get about 3/4 of the way through the movie when they handled the ominous police to their underwear and handcuffed them in the park in an unflattering position. In addition, the jokes are not funny, the characters are not funny, their accidents and missteps are not funny ... add them, it's not a very funny movie! Not even at a slapstick level! And what is the reggae soundtrack? This is a movie about two white garbagem and the music is reggae. Seems out of place, right? If you want a good train track, it's for you. If you want a good comedy, look elsewhere.
