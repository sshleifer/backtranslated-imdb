If I think of a movie of the 1970s, that's not what I think. I don't want a monotonous, one-song Robin Trower soundtrack; I want a soundtrack with the top 40 bubbly songs of the day depicting the 70's. The generic karaoke style disco music during the prom scene was particularly annoying. The acting (if you can call it) was very wood, and just read the text in monotone. The film quality and camera work was terrible; The dialogue was dark, the writing thrown without much thought and the plot was thin if it didn't exist. I can't believe people give it the high ratings I've read here. Actually a forgetful, poor attempt to recreate a beloved era of the past. Two stars are all I can do. Sorry, guys.
