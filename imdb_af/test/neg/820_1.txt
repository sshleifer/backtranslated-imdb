I love Ali G's show, I believe the man has comical instinct, but hasn't yet developed it into a talent. <br /> <br /> The movie is a bit worse than I expected. I don't find Ali-G offensive, just stupid. Jokes for 5-year-olds, some good, some terrible. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie that looks "offensive" but it's actually funny, see Tom Green's "Freddy Got Fingered." /> <br /> 2/10
