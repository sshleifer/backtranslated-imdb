This movie was a failure as a comedy and a movie in general. It was a very slow-paced movie that apparently tried to convey a message, but the message was a clich√©, hopeless mess to start. This movie falls at a shameful environmental point, even a self-righteous point to destroy an SUV and promote Animal Planet. <br /> <br /> By doing this, I couldn't help but Steve Carell has no more than a really funny line. The only thing that can hypothetically mark it as a comedy is the intense effort to give cartoon lighting to Wanda Sykes. Her character gets regular, unambiguous lines where they absolutely don't fit. <br /> <br /> Far from the brilliance of Bruce Almighty, Evan Almighty blows his entire record breaking budget on special effect plotting devices that come to the fore hardly the plot. The film spends the first half of the construction of Evan's ark, but in the end we learn that the ark was completely meaningless, and the whole plot was just a vessel for the dumb gags and even stupider messages. The movie ends when we learn that the whole ark, flood and animal gathering is just a poor political statement by no one but God. Yes, God tried to influence politics.
