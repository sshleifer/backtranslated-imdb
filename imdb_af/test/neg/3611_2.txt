George Sluizer of THE VANISHING celebrity (He has both the haunting European original and the Hollywood remake) director CRIMETIME. He should not really be blamed for this confused, poor movie, because all the problems lie in Brendan Somers writing. It is sickly focused and lazy. For example, the killer hangs around a nightclub and waits to pick up a victim, any victim, and talk to a teenage girl. Cut to the next scene where she tells the villain: "I told you all about myself, tell me about your life?" Unfortunately, the girl tells the life story of the bath outside the screen and is a terrible example of the screenplay writer who is unable to bring a character to life through dialogue. I know for a fact how bloody it is difficult, but for a script produced, the writer needs to try harder. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to explain the message of the movie. On some points it feels like it's a British NATURAL BIRTHDAY that condemns the media's voyeurism with crime (perhaps it even influenced the notorious video game MANHUNT), but the writing isn't greasy enough to carry it. When you have a sex scene that does not progress the plot or characters or hint of subtext, you know you have a poorly written script and CRIMETIME is a badly written script
