If you are a fan of the original series, DO NOT see this movie. <br /> <br /> I had to be skeptical of the previews when Aeon expresses her murder motives. In the series, Aeon had no family and no motive for her adventures to save selfish interests. Obviously, the chimpanzee writer in control has the film needed to meet the bad grrl demographic by killing the character, but has a good reason to kill people. <br /> <br /> You wouldn't have thought that. possible, but the movie is more two-dimensional than the cartoon. The characters are all portrayed as inherently well with a conflict of interest that is ultimately resolved. All dogs go to heaven and the same for every character dying in this movie. <br /> <br /> The selfish, twisted, twisted, dominant people of Aeon and Trevor are nowhere to be seen. In the end, they are literally being developed into a cute couple, ala Annie Hall. The only character that remained faithful was the Relicle, the floating machine in the air. I think if you've ever thought, "I like Aeon Flux, but I wish it was more like every other faceless good-v-scientific Hollywood slap out there" then you're getting a surprise. <br /> <br /> They didn't even get the look. I think a black metal bikini was too much to ask, but the whole environment was wrong. 400 years in the future looks like 30 years in the past. Instead of a clear urban post-apocalyptic world, the viewer's eyes are insulted by a 70-year-old frutopia of ovoid furniture, wood panel walls, globes and many plants. Bregna was a dystopia, not a utopia. <br /> <br /> Talking of Bregna, it's the only city on earth according to the movie. The show is clear that there were two cities, Bregna and Monica, which was one. In the movie, "Monicans" is just Hollywood storybook freedom fighters. They also have as much technology as the Bregnans, which is not the case. <br /> <br /> The only possible conclusion is that the real author for this movie was a high school child and that he wrote it The day before it was due to the studio executives, and he has never had a seen all of Aeon Flux. The overwhelming amount of inconsistency with the cartoon is staggering. Apart from using some names like Aeon Flux, Trevor Goodchild and Bregna, the movie is nothing like the show. <br /> <br /> The real bulk of the movie seems to be trying to mix the colorful plots of soybean green, blade runner, Logan's run, and the grave raider, which came out a dull brown mess.
