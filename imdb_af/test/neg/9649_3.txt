First of all, let me say I'm not someone who normally insists on having to think while watching movies. For example, I love Tarkowsky movies. Berghman is also a favorite ..... but this? The positive points can easily be summed up: photography is wonderful, and the music is perfect .... does it make a good movie? I thought so, but this one is a perfect example of one that doesn't make me. Maybe it's because I'm too stupid? possibly, but I don't think so. For example, Tarkwosky also used very long shots, but what he never did was to film 5 minutes of exactly the same image of two people (and I just mean their heads, because in this movie is a lot of those shots, but sometimes it is effective), the general result is simply boring, even with the intelligent undertones (which are done in a way that is intelligent, but especially pedanties). <br /> <br /> You also always feel that the director does not make some of the long shots for the aesthetic or symbolic effect, but only to save on the budget .... <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed in this movie because I really had the first 30 minutes, but it just went on and off without keeping the same level as in the first scenes. <br /> <br /> While reading the Very Credible comments on this page, I also get the feeling that some people are just trying to see more in the movie than there is ... when a movie slows down and arty, it doesn't have to mean it is very deep .... yes it is an allegory about musical theory placed in the context of a small town, which is interesting to him, but it does NOT make a big movie no. except for people who want to make a kind of intellectual masturbation out of it, but then it's not what you find in the movie, but what you find in yourself .... an exercise that in my opinion can be much more effective while you see "Stalker" or "Solyaris" as Werckmeister Harmonies, who owe much to Tarkowsky, but never taxi to level.
