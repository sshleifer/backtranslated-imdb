This movie was very disappointing because several parts of the book were wrongly done. The main story is the same, but there are several errors that hurt the movie. <br /> <br /> 1) Boobie Miles is injured at the start of the story in a Texas Tech pre-season game. That means he won't do anything in the season and Chris Comer gets on the team sooner. <br /> <br /> 2) The game against Marshall was lost at Marshall. The team that was portrayed as Marshall was actually Midland High, one of Perm's main opponents and here's the proof. Marshall High is the Mavericks-colored Scarlet and Silver, Midland High is the Bulldogs-colored Purple and Gold. Look at the jerseys and you'll see who it is. Also the true Marshall High's soccer grid is overwhelmingly Swart, the team shown, is racially mixed like Midland High. <br /> <br /> 3) Perm only loses to Midland Lee through one point in district play. Midland Lee lost to Midland High and Midland High lost to Perm. These are the teams that set up the coins as such. <br /> <br /> 4) Boobie comes back on the team as a reserve for Chris Comer and after having had no playing time in the Midland Lee game, he stopped The team was halfway and standing never be on the sidelines or go back to any games. <br /> <br /> 5) Brian Chavez was a stiff end and defensive end that carries # 85 a solid end and strong safety. In addition, Boobie # 35 and Ivory Christian wore # 62. <br /> <br /> 6) The coaches like Chris Comer as a player more than Boobie because he has a better ethical uplift and runs more upright, playing as the staff also prefers, that's why Boobie stops the team. <br /> <br /> 7) Dallas Carter is played in Austin at Darrell K. Royal Memorial Stadium where UT does not play the finals in the semi-finals of the state. Carter wins the state title but is forced to forfeit due to an unauthorized player. <br /> <br /> The play is done pretty well, but if you read the book, you will see these errors are quite true. I'm also tired of hearing all the PC hypocrites out there complaining about the depiction of Dallas Carter's soccer team. The team according to the book is as big, monstrous, talented and black as the movie shows. People say it is a racist representation, but to read the book, you see a real portrayal of the team. The story has changed a lot and gives this movie a score of 3.5 / 10.
