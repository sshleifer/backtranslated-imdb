It was a movie that was doomed out of its concept. The idea was lame - taking a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 movie, making a complete non-sequel while changing his tone to a PG-rated family movie. I was not the least interested. Then came the trailer. Not only did it just confirm that the film would be unfit and generic, but also managed to give the whole movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer. It's like a 3-minute Cliff's Notes version of the flick. So of course I didn't pay to see it, but once it hit DVD, I probably thought I'd see it for free. Maybe Steve Carell can save it. <br /> <br /> No. <br /> <br /> I'm still surprised why he signed up for it. He had to owe someone a favor. The jokes were so flat and obvious, and the director of course asked him to go for a very broad comedy style like the original Bruce Almighty's Jim Carrey. But that's just funny. The studio obviously tried to complete the success of the 40-year-old Virgin, with several Carell's former co-stars, a reference to the cinema market movie and another musical closing series. But even the talented Carrell can't save it. His fellow stars aren't much better off, just wasting people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill and Ed Helms. Wanda Sykes is not wasted, she is just a waste of anything she does, and her terrible one-liners and reactions just keep people from giving up her job. <br /> <br /> The story itself is just predictable and lazy. It pounds you over the head with obvious shadow, like Evan's negligence on the environment (drives a ghastly Humvee, prefers to use wood from endangered trees for his home, hate animals ...) and at the end It's just past the best sermon on both faith and the environment. <br /> <br /> Why the movie is made is mysterious enough, but I really don't understand how it's reportedly the most expensive comedy ever. The only real job is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those on the screen is the worst and most obvious blue / green screen I've ever seen. Perhaps the renting of living animals cost a fortune. Who knows. But whatever it costs, it has not translated into quality, for sure. But hey, it wasn't the worst movie of the year. There are still much worse duds like Norbit and Death Proof.
