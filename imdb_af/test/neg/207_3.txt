The sounds in the movie were so ordinary and ridiculous, hitting the 30-minute serious hinge, pushing your teeth really and hurting your head. <br /> <br /> I like bad words more than the next guy, but come on, "no blood on our hands" is said about a million times by Matt Dillon's character, and when Matt Dillon's character the bum shoots the main character I can't remember his name because I don't really think anyone cares about getting blood on his hands literally. <br /> <br /> The background music with the heavy metal guitar that calls an A-cord for about 5 minutes is not my idea of ​​music. Come on, I have the worst headache at the end of this garbage.
