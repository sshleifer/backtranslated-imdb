The first time I watched this movie, I was ten years old. I thought it was bad and at that age I had no taste at all. I watched this movie about Cinemax about 3 days ago and was reminded why I hated the movie in the first place. Madonna's character, Nikki, is annoying and unpleasant. There is no way the main character ever falls in love with her. The jokes were curly and the dialogue was worse than a joke. soap !! I'm glad I didn't see this movie at the theater or rent it. I feel bad for my parents who had to endure watching it with me! Madonna is not necessarily a bad actress, but in this role she is portrayed as a complete idiot.
