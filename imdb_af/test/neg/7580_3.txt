I decided to watch this movie because it was considered the "scariest movie ever", so that's what I expected. Unfortunately, what I found out is that the movie didn't have a scary moment in it (and I'm the kind of person who jumps very easily). The movie was nothing but terrible clich√©s and every time there was a jump moment. It was incredibly obvious. The benefits of this movie are the music and the strange scene that actually shot well (like the very last scene when she opens the door and you see Tun in the reflection and when it swings back to him, you see the ghost on his shoulders ). Overall, this movie really didn't add anything new to the J-Horror genre and the whole world didn't have creativity and fear.
