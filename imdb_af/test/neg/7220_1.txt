This television program is an idiotic waste of time if you want to learn <br /> <br /> about animal watching the discovery channel. If you want to look at <br /> nincompos, just watch MTV. MTV stands for music television <br /> <br /> Don't need D-list pre-distorted sketch or bratty kids cry <br /> <br /> their hearts not to get a BMW for the 16th birthday no. I bet <br /> <br /> that if you like this show, I bet you love Viva la Bam, and Jackass Huh? I think my IQ has dropped ten points to watch this show. <br /> <br /> It's a combination of two jackass shows and the zoo <br /> <br /> Some people think it's a good combination. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I think it's retardant. <br /> <br /> And if you see it very much like jackass <br /> and / or viva la Bam <br /> <br /> just a note, this show is terrible
