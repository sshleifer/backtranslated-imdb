I find myself getting less and less excited about Disney's prosecutions on movies. Yes, I understand that the budget for live video movies is not the same, but these movies don't even try. Some examples are Hunchback II and Tarzan and Jane. If anyone saw the stitches for Stitch-The Movie, you'll see my point. But I leave, this movie confirms my point. The animation is sloppy, the story lines look like Saturday morning cartoons, and not all of the original voices are there. I was very disappointed not to hear Michael J. Fox's voice. It was so clear that the person who did Milo's voice tried to sound like Fox, but didn't get close. <br /> <br /> If it says anything, my kids between the ages of 10 and 6 didn't even sit all over the movie.
