I bought the video for Â£ 13 at HMV (we pay more in Britain), as a friend told me it was highly rated and the reviews on this site were generally impressive. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the opening credits were a download ... the dance / music wasn't very powerful. <br /> <br /> The car ride and the unexpected accident just as the lady passenger would be injured was a good touch, something unexpected. ... although she was driving away from the car with her hair perfectly cared for and still carrying a handbag, most director looked at Corny. But Lynch was something else. <br /> <br /> Her dazed walk to such a shock is enhanced by a regular low noise similar to fingers scratching next to a blackboard; I thought another Lynch master might portray the demons shocked and traumatized in her. After a while this noise became a bit annoying and on further investigation I discovered the new video cassettes. <br /> <br /> I don't know if this squeak has taken away much of my enjoyment, but this movie has become a waste of time. (and money) <br /> <br /> The two female characters were present and the lesbian scene was fair enough, though predictable. There were no male characters of any merit and apart from some vague good scenes (the hoover switch) there were too many terrible scenes that were simply weak and ridiculous. E.g. The coffee is spit in the napkin through the impending wage and the crazy monster face at the back of the evening. Oh, and what about the paint in the female jewelry. Drill and hub. <br /> <br /> This whole movie gives you the feeling of the failed genius. You know when you ever listen to the worst Dylan track and think my God was embarrassing .... was it really Bob? <br /> <br /> The whole feeling is that of a failed TV movie, bad with a few (not many) extra bits around it a 15 <br /> <br /> I got it during whisper the last 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> I give it another chance and look again. If I want to be amazed and work hard to understand a movie, I will look at Frank Woods' Consolidated Accounting Guide. <br /> <br /> Lynch had a classic .. Blue Velvet and Straight Story. <br /> It was, like Wild at Heart, a deviation; his stranger is now predictable and birthday. Anyone want to buy a 2nd hand video? <br /> <br /> Make room for some younger, original talent, David. <br /> <br /> Four out of ten (and no longer). Sorry.
