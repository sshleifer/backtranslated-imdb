The Second Wife is about the story of a mysterious man who has lost his wife in an accident and now believes that someone wants to make him angry. A girl who likes him wants to help him, but she is led to believe that his fears are caused by a mental illness. <br /> <br /> Interesting plot, very good acting, but the result as a whole is poor. in many ways. The story is too simplistic, or rather, presented in a simplistic way (though there are some interesting plot moves). For example, people say they love each other after just two meetings. I don't want to make anything else known, but you'll see what I mean when you watch the movie. "Come on, it was the fifties!" May you think. Still, I saw quite a few movies of that era and I know some do not look so dated today. Something that disturbed me was that some scenes were shaded dark and made it almost impossible to see what was going on. Ok, this is a movie noir, but this one is on some points too noir ...: o) <br /> Overall, the Second Woman is not a masterpiece of that era, but also no dirt. See it if you have nothing else to do.
