I'm the kind of guy who listens from the new Jack City to Baby Boy to Killa season from the b-grade to Hollywood. but this movie was something else. I'm not a hater and this movie was so nice. but some bits were just strange. Well, the acting wasn't too good, compared to Silkk The Shockers' performance in Hot Boyz (pretty good) and Ice-T in the new Jack and SVU (great). the scene where Corrupt (Ice-T) kills the Jamaican dude, he says something and lights himself up, killing both the Ice-T and the other man. It kills Jamaica, but Ice-T is unscathed, much like Ice's other movie Urban Menace (which stars both actors) was Snoops character is supernatural, but then nothing suggested that Corrupt is like a devil. Once MJ (Silkk) is stabbed, he struggles but afterwards he is usually fought and stabbed in the thigh. And when MJ admitted to killing a policeman, the policeman struck his friend. Benny was strange, Benny was not introduced to this movie and the scene was not in the movie. However, it sticks to the fact that Corrupt wants to kill MJ, but still scratches your head. wins Jody writes a letter to me. Jones character explaining what happened to them after the weekend does not mention what 2 other main characters MJ and Lisa are doing. The film showed the ghetto's abomination and poverty - which bothered the lives of the Latin and Black words - was a good part of the movie, although the clip was reusing thousands of projects. and the scene where Miles kills the Latino brother by dropping his bike at full speed (without wearing a helmet) and running in my Latino brother's car will kill him. The film was similar to the movie Urban Menace and half of the actors were in both these movies as well as the production team. this was OK tho. but i'm from poverty, i love hood movies, but if you don't love like me, DO NOT. The only thing that keeps me from running out has reminded me of the first movie I made that was made with $ 100, and my love for the genre. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel Purez
