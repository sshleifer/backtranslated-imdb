I am an atheist with little love for certain aspects of Christian fundamentalism. <br /> <br /> It is said, this movie is reprehensible, dirty and transparent. It only works at the level of contemporary fashion (and tired) hate motif of white American Christian fundamentalism. If this movie was about a fundamentalist Jewish or Muslim family, or even a black Christian family, the indignation would be visible, and the movie would be wrapped up in ALL circles. However, as it stands, it is "OK" and "artificial" because white Christian fundamentalists remain one of the last "acceptable" targets for garbage like this. <br /> <br /> Trash is really it. If you want to see a quality movie of a similar bent, find and watch "Badlands." Nothing good has been done in "The King" which has not been done better in the masterful film these days. <br /> <br /> Like other reviewers, the characters are almost completely undeveloped in "The King," the lines are a snooze, cinematography is slim. We've seen the sociopath's story better 100 times. This movie does not cut it for thoughtful viewers.
