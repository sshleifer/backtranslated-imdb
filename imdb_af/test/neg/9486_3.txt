This movie was right. Mary-Kate and Ashley play twin sisters (sorry for the obvious) who are sent to Paris for their will to spend the week with their rich uncle or something. <br /> <br /> Immediately two French boys who looked a little in, started talking to them and taking interest. Blah blah blah. It's an Olsen twin movie - we already know what will happen between them. Anyway, the twins meet a FABULOUS French model because they are in Paris, the fashion capital of the world. They make bffs with the model and spend a fun fitting of shopping in the city of lights. Yep. <br /> <br /> Plotwise, I honestly can't remember what happened. I think it can say something, but hey, it's an Olsen movie. "Olsen movie" seems to be synonymous with "light entertainment". <br /> Overall, this movie was annoying. I mean, can I really identify with two girls being devastated by hearing they are going to Paris? Really? The jokes were really not that funny either. However, I watched the whole movie. So it had to be somewhat entertaining. The fact that it was set up in Paris probably made me look.
