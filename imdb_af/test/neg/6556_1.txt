Especially if you like lovely movies. When I first looked at it, I could just say, "I hope there is a dance series in it." Imagine my joy when not only the two main characters dance, but the main ghost also started dancing. And, moreover, Sherman Hemsley sings the break dance dance song (not to mention the theme song). It made me a little sad that he had broken because of this movie, but I never liked him as an actor and he really had to know better. Not even the director will pay this movie (and you need some of the other movies he has directed!). <br /> <br /> A note of warning, however, the author looked like jokes about the, um, male lower regions. For example, one of the characters discovered a book called "Groins of the Darker Species." I'm not joking. And this is the most disturbing part of the movie for me. Other than that, find the most obscure video rental store in your town, get the movie, invite all your friends over and laugh until you cry with Ghost Fever.
