Among the many awards here for this production, there was one individual whose remarks asked if he was the only one (not so surprised) - it gave 3 stars. However, the comments continued to indicate an overall appearance of the story and other production of the same. Well, this person is not the only one who did not keep this production (join me!) But I even share with him / her. If you put a gun on my head and have asked me to make a choice between your shooting or looking again, I will definitely look at it - but I will probably think about 10 seconds. I would prefer to be locked, or to look dry on a wall. Furthermore, I don't want to see this story again, anytime, anywhere, or in any alternative presentation. Sometimes you feel like comedian George Gobel's "few brown shoes when the rest of the world is a smuggle," and that's one of those for me. I like Angela Lansbury in a favorite movie of me, "Long Hot Summer," and while not a big fan of the show, enjoy "Murder, She Wrote." But HERE - I not only care about the story or other aspects, but I have Angela's rogue, squawking, singing and everything else about her performance, perhaps the MOST ANNOYING presence in any movie (or presentation in any other media) I've ever experienced. It was like an everlasting continuation of Audrey Hepburn's "over-the-top" Cockney chortling at Rex Harrison - in the early parts of My Fair Lady. But it was an incident for the plot, presented for light, comic effect, and (gracious) brief. Indifferent, it was nothing short of short, and to me it looked like it took about 10 hours (Einstein's layman's statement of "relativity" at work.) If I was not with friends, with the necessity to stay, MY display would have been short. However, I laughed at the episode "Seinfeld" where Elaine made everyone angry because she told them how much she didn't like the English patient. My friends also saw me in the same way if I interrupted their weeks ecstasy about this movie. Give me some fingernails over any time in a chalkboard.
