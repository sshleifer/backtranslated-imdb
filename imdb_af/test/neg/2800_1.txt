Few videos in recent history have been produced so amateurly - at least no one released by such a well-known distributor. Every framework of this film is a plagiarism of better films of the past. The word 'cliche' is given new meaning by a talented writer / director who must retain his imagination for less masturbatory efforts that do not sacrifice movie viewers. Assisting in the amateur night horror effort is a number of less-than-skilled technicians who carry poor cinematography and ridiculous makeup and special effects. Unfortunately, one or two of the amateur actors in the film are a hint of talent that will go unnoticed due to the reputation this horror will produce.
