New York lawyer plans to get rid of his senile mother after meeting an attractive, available woman. Author Robert Klane, who adapted his own novel (the kind of paperback kids would buy for the dirt), doesn't seem to have mental illness. For him it is just an excuse for fun comedy and skatological jokes. George Segal - who was mostly in war and spy pictures in the 1960s - has so far become one of America's biggest sad business animals; his courageous reactions and bitter reactions just mean his mother's indescribability. Segal is good with Trish Van Devere, and their moments of engagement (although played for the laugh) is actually the only series you can suffer. Ruth Gordon, as she is, is simply too much - and more of her run less. This is one of the worst directed and edited movies I've ever seen from so-called professionals. Promising plays that do not end up playing the full effect are constantly ceased from other moments that fly around endlessly, making the crass, funny movie to self-destruction, long before it is over. * 1/2 of ****
