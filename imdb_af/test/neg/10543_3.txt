I enjoyed the first "Toxic Avenger", but the successor just didn't work. There are some funny gags in the opening, which are members of the house for the blind, but just beyond that point I just got bored. The successor is also filled with very peculiar, low-broken humor. Just this time it's not funny! Many of the gags revolve around crisp Japanese stereotypes. Almost every Japanese character seems to be fish. Does anyone catch fish in Japan? The Troma films are known to be more than a little irreverent, but if you use humor with racist stereotypes, make it funny at least. I can't laugh when I hand over the same crap I've seen a million times before! One thing I need to give credit for is the free nudity. There is even more free nudity than in the first. But I was completely disappointed, and the movie ends with a boring pursuit scene that has my huffing and puffing to die for the movie to fade black. There is at least a hilarious line out of the movie that blew me with laughter. After the villain says a line from Shakespeare to one of the locals, the citizen (an elderly woman) responds by saying: "F ** k you - this is from David Mamet." <br /> <br /> My Score: 3 (out of 10)
