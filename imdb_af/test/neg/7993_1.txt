I stumbled across the television late at night. My brother and I couldn't stop laughing at how God was terribly this movie. The crappy sound effects when White Ninja or Black Ninja punch, kick, or use a weapon are hilarious. This movie is almost on the same level as the Evil Dead series, but you can only see this movie once because of obscurity. I'm not sure if the director meant that he was so purposeful because he knew idiots like me would buy it.
