Did you find the title funny? Oh, you didn't do it? Well, that's because you're up to date. Learn to laugh, because if you don't laugh, you don't live. So, please lower your standards of what you believe is funny than a mere baby. Do you find it funny now? Still no ?! OK, it's because you're full of yourself and are too easily offended. If you don't laugh, you don't live. And if you don't like me, send me hate mail so I can write another review and say how much hate I get and try to turn it around to make it look like I'm a bad ass. Have you been to my hilarious title? Anyway?!?! OK this is it! You are a racist! You have to laugh or you're a racist. Why else would you not laugh? Oh, it's not funny! No, it can't be why. I want it to be funny, that's why it is !! Make it a pity !! Please !!! Deedeedee !! Durdurdur !! Let !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OK this is it. Where is my notebook and pen? And where are my Richard Pryor DVDs? I have to write jokes for my show. <br /> <br /> A ...... scene. Thank you, thank you. <br /> <br /> It's basically what you'll get about 23 minutes from Mencia. Please do yourself a favor and change the channel when this bum show comes on. Even basic cable channels have things 100x better than that. I don't even say this because I hate him. I'm really. This show is like seeing grass. Not sure, though grass doesn't joke. I honestly try to save your time. I even tried to watch his performance. I told myself, maybe he's not that bad. But no, he is. When I watched his performance I completely exhibited. I tried to collect myself during the commercial break and focused on the show, but I couldn't. I zoned again, I think I thought of something more interesting like covering my bed, vacuuming or folding my socks. Before I knew it, the show was over. Yes, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> Here's my last thought. There are so many things you can do with 30 minutes, except look, this man screams nothing for half an hour. Don't see a show trying to chase in vain racism in your face. I can support shows that try to relieve the tension of the race wars, but this man just offers more racism rather than stopping it.
