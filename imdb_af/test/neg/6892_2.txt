I have to admit that it has to be one of the worst of many player movies I've seen. I was shocked to discover that this piece of work has a 1.5 million budget. When it started, I thought the opening sequence was pretty good, fairly standard for this kind of movie, but anyway pretty good. But as the film progressed, I began to feel uncomfortable with the lack of pace I saw, and every row seemed to take hours. The reason could have been that the movie was already boring me to tear. There was nothing but endless accusations associated with confusing flashbacks and the occasional fitness of bad temper. Well, after we waited, we finally reached the big final ... a whole song, all dancing demonstration of how a lack of imagination could completely ruin what could be a good movie. <Br /> <br /> Overall, I found this movie predictable and boring and I would not recommend this movie to anyone other than the people I personally dislike, but if you have a few hours to waste and you Want to see a thrill that is not even remotely imagery, this is the movie for you.
