I assume the rave reviews were on this page from people who have never read the book. Unfortunately, those who love the text surprised Hollywood to destroy this one. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure where on earth the woman came to love, except that she replaced the cat and also why our Rogue Man had a proper family back in Blighty. In fact, the vast majority of the book is cut out and replaced with your standard cruddy love story. The ambiguity about which world leader was in his attractions was completely removed and our Rogue was named. Not one of them appeared in the second book. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 2 rather than a 1 because of the wonderful bad cock accents. Joan Bennett leaves Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins for miles and it's a small way to save it. Exactly, Brits should probably avoid it. Trust me :)
