This movie is total dumbness incarnate. Yet, I have seen this movie a few times and plan to look a few more times, because it is very entertaining, despite its mere folly. And it has one of my favorite hokey movie actors, Casper van Dien, who is here in his full hokey movie glory. Here is Casper van Dien completely Casper van Dien, and you must love him for it. If he wasn't in this movie, it would be completely unstoppable, or at least much nicer than it already was. <br /> <br /> The (hoesief) "science" used here makes absolutely no sense at all. No one else in the world noticed that the big asteroid near the small group is approaching Earth? Not even with thousands and thousands and thousands of professional and amateur astronomers constantly looking for something like that? A great asteroid would make itself quite obvious to anyone who has a few eyes, even vaguely able to see. And a piece of the asteroid kicked off the atmosphere and no one even noticed it? A rock that largely hit the atmosphere would cause huge shock waves. This caused an enormous amount of damage to the planet's surface. Certainly, someone would have noticed such a thing. Bwahahaha! The "science" used in this movie is so completely ridiculous that it somehow works to make this movie so entertaining. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed is that, despite the uber heat, all the characters were not dripping with sweat and their clothes were completely soaked. At most, the characters looked as if they were lightly spritzed by someone outside the camera with a water bottle to give a "sweat". Actuality was not a goal that this film continually and striving for. What in a strange and hilarious way gives this movie its amusement. <br /> <br /> Is this movie really worth watching? Definitely! Suppose, of course, you have absolutely no * expectations of anything that even distances reality. And it is your desire to reconcile and lazy at the moment.
