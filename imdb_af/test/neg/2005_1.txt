It was by far the worst movie I've ever seen! My husband and I have over 600 DVDs, most of which are Sci-Fi and Horror B movies that are not top quality but still entertaining. Dracula 300 has absolutely no detached features! The writing was terrible, and the acting was even worse. It took us 3 tries to get through the whole movie, because we could only endure it in 30 minutes. We probably thought it should get better ... we were wrong. I'd rather look at a body that is embalmed than to put it through again !!! When it ended me, my husband just looked at each other like "Uh, is it so?" The end seemed to be more, but they ran over their apparent $ 500.00 budget and were like "Oh, crap ... we were broken. And now ... fast.
