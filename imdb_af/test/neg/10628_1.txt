There are plenty of comments about the movie itself. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to say something about the German version, which I recently watched on TV. It was severely cut. From 103 to 76 minutes! It is normal that the most bloody scenes for German TV are cut. I understand the reasons for this, but this movie was something else. Not only did they cut "gore shots" - they cut overall rows, and only spared mocks. Like, "We must attack them" - one 5 second of explosions in the camp - starring away. <br /> <br /> When the assault starts on the island, it is not even possible to follow the following. storyline. All the cuts create something that comes to a string of erratic, disconnected scenes that no longer makes sense. <br /> <br /> I couldn't stand the end after 60 minutes of this nonsense. /> <br /> I think I would have given the original 7/10. The German version is worth only 1/10 <br /> <br /> Get it on DVD (and first look at the runtime) or forget about it.
