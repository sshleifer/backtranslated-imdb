I didn't even watch this whole movie. Now, I like 50's sci-fi movies even when they're wildly inaccurate, but this one just irritated me. For one thing, one member of the crew speaks on the spaceship and acts as if he had made it in the tenth grade. He sounds like he should be on a bow tie, not a spaceship. From the spacecraft's window, the crew was amazed at the earth and this boob says "Can you see Brooklyn?" and another man says 'sure'. And the boob says, "Go, I'm wondering who's storing?" Forgive me for a moment, I think my sides are dividing. <br /> <br /> Once they get into the lane, the boob says "The moon is just watching!" Take me back! "It is not one of the better moments of the film to shout the crew that stretched their mouths and shout the G forces of acceleration during the push-up. (Perhaps the best moment of the movie can be identified by a big "THE END" on the screen.) <br /> <br /> We also find that they can't open the hatch because "the boob" has they smeared before they pulled off. Certainly, a spacecraft is forged by a crew member, who later learned, never had a space suit yet and knows nothing of zero gravity. Like Baby Huey, the overgrown thick cartoon duck once said, "That sounds logical!" The gravity-in-space effects are so severe, it is painful to watch. (Everyone knows, in the absence of gravity, everything is likely to go.) <br /> <br /> How this movie gets 6.3 stars out of 10, if other much better movies aren't higher, it's " a mystery to me. I do really like old sci-fi movies, but this one is not realistic, and the lame efforts to throw character humor through that boob of a petrol station in a petrol station do not work at all - it ruins the movie. I think in retrospect it is not the whole movie that I hate so much as the fact that "the boob" is so clear, someone who would be on a spaceship - not even the hatch should fade. 'OMG. I wonder if he also checked the fan tires. Perhaps if they were "boob" away from the journey, it might not have been so heavy. Yet it is just average. I don't know what everyone else is raving about. <br /> <br /> Want to watch a neat 1950s movie? 'Rocketship X-M' knocks everything to visit. Maybe not so much 'realism', but a more serious story and less goofy characters.
