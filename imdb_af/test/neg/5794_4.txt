Even Disney is guilty of the cash cow disease. After the roaring success of The Love Bug in 1968, the house of the mouse in Herbie Rides Again, Herbie Goes To Monte Carlo and Herbie Goes Bananas invaded. No one pursues the charm and inadvertent appeal of The Love Bug back in 68, in this one we find driver Jim Douglas and his sidekick Wheely Applegate, who enter Herbie in the Monte Carlo rally. Of course, things outside the race start to take over priorities, they are blended into a diamond robbery and Herbie falls in love with another car! The car stunts are, of course, pleasant and easy on the eye, and it would be uncomfortable for me to go poison on such a friendly piece. It's just that the movie doesn't go anywhere fast, and now I can now see it for the coin motivated piece of work it is. Still you see Herbie taking a bath, watching the bad watching and of course dancing for the lady in his life, something for everyone I think .................. 0.4 / 10.
