This season didn't have a real scam, but with regard to setting stories to get us back in the mood, season 6 is without highlights and spontaneity. <br /> <br /> This season did not have its usual Sopranos style, and if you cut out all the rubbish filled in this episode every season, you would probably have had six episodes of real stories. <br /> <br /> Side stories like Pauly's mother, is she or is she? was boring and had no purpose other than exploring his character. I'd like to see Bobby express his anger more in Pauly in that carnival episode, but to no avail. <br /> <br /> That's just it! These side stories had no real purpose, and lack of finishing. If they are going to complete these stories in the next 6 episodes, I'd rather not see them, because it's not really worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Disappointing is to say a word about this season and its final.
