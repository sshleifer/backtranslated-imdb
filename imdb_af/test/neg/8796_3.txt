A single mother, her son and daughter and their hippie-chick friend camp in the woods. " A muscular, machete-wielding maniac appears in a yellow ski mask. He began to terrorize and sexually violate the family before killing them with a mug. "Wet Wilderness" is loaded with ugly hardcore sex, forced incest and blatant racism. It's as politically wrong as XXX gets rough. The score is stolen from the original Hitchcock's horror classic "Psycho" and also "Jaws". The acting is hilariously awful, the editing is bad and there are some big declines in the logic. The repetitive nature of the sex scene grinds the movie, while the short time is a blessing. The scenes of violence are rather nasty, for example, the hippie girl is stabbed with the knife. her groin and one can see blood on her cross. 3 out of 10 and it's generous.
