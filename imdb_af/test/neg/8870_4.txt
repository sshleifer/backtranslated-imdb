Police officer Michael (Tomas Arana, "The Church") filled his hands as he investigated a serial killer who left parts of the people's bodies murdered at a recent widow's home, Tracy (Joanna Pacula) . Mike needs to find a way to stop the bodies from stepping up, while finding love in the process. <br /> <br /> A feeling of yore 'giallo' films lapses this film, even though we know who the killer is of the visit and the film contains some good pieces (a scene later in the movie kept in a blind school, especially memorable), but it doesn't make much sense if it's all. also said and done. Almost not as good as Bava's earlier "Macabre" or his first two "Demons" movies, but pleasing enough if you can forgive the outrageous plots to the end of the movie. Sorry, the Image Entertainment DVD had no extras of any kind, because I would be interested in some. <br /> <br /> My Degree: C-
