End Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen. Wireline, winding disk loaded with lame dialogues and gaping plot holes, fast fire MTV style editing and completely acting arm. <br /> <br /> It is not to say End Days is not visible. The movie was of interest to me because I found Ah-nuld's latest action movie ridiculously stupid because it is as intact and stupid as it concerns logic. Without the sense of the logic, the movie dies faster, so End of Days deserves a huge drop of trade union reception in its second week after its opening in the US. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to explain in the details why the end of the day violates the law of film logic, but here are several issues with this movie: <br /> <br /> (SPOILER) <br /> <br /> After the devil goes out, the restaurant explodes without any trace of how he did it. No finger finger, no suitable energy gas to light the fire, nothing. How can this happen? <br /> <br /> Arnold and his annoying sidekick Kevin Pollack somehow get the name "Christine York" following the investigation into the phrase "Christ in New York" being carved on the body of a victim , run the database Computer and Viola, Christine York, the only person with the exact name in New York City! Beyond my suspension of unbelief. <br /> <br /> How did the characters that came into contact with Arnold's character later attack him in the film? I laughed aloud when I recognized the good-natured rebellious stepmother, the same actress who played a nanny in William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. Her ironic transition from the movie to this was absolutely hilarious if you could imagine. <br /> <br /> All the subconscious explosions and firearms. What did you expect in the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle? <br /> <br /> The devil has taken a man's body consisting of flesh and blood, but he is invisible to bullets and explosions by healing the body. Logically, this is impossible. <br /> <br /> As the devil demonstrates the illusion in the apartment, Arnold's character walks in the solid Christmas tree that seems to be an illusion and physically falling. <br /> <The devil is able to hit the person's brain and turn a victim's head 180 degrees, but he could not kill Arnold's character as he always intends to do. How the devil's object of desire's parents died and why the evil New Yorkers run to Arnold and the object of desire is not explained at all. <br /> <br /> In the sequence that is Speed ​​of Speed, Arnold and the devil's object of desire to escape the subway train wreck through the short distance within intact. It's beyond my comprehension, as the power will be enough to Arnold and the object of desire to violently kill and kill fatal wounds seconds after impact. <br /> <br /> Arnold is suffering from the cruel beating of the gang by the Devil and puts him on the cross to hang against the wall, but the devil forgot to take the time and opportunity for him of ease to kill. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, after the devil took over a man's body, Arnold suddenly became his bodyguard ??? Is it a coincidence or just an example of bad editing? <br /> <br /> Arnold's recitation of a circle-inducing dialogue in particular to legitimate scenes such as "YOU ARE COMPARED TO A BOOKBOOK TO ME!" is the perfect feed for MST3K, just as Eraser did with the classic line: "You're the luggage!". <br /> <br /> The whole theory of 666/1999 is really ridiculous. So are the pseudo-religious chatter about Christian theology that includes the midnight end of the world and the fanatic killers who know the location of the devil's object of desire. <br /> <br /> (END SPOILERS) <br /> <br /> It is highly ironic that End of Days uses the scattered profanities that abuse the deity as they walk about Christian theories. The level of violence in the film is excessive and abominable, and therefore unnecessary to serve the plot. The director's belief in excess is a factor here. He certainly does not know how to make a coherent action movie of the author of Air Force One who only had to write the writing for a large amount of money. <br /> <br /> So, End Days is a worthless movie with no redeeming value except for campus - Arnold's worst since Hercules in New York. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
