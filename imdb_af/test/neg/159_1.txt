This movie fails on every score. For a start, it's pretentious, striving to be "significant" and failing to fail. The writing was utterly banal, no one said anything at any time. It was impossible to care about any of the characters. Knight was a self-related waste of time while Sienna Miller was just a waste of time. The little bit about the soldier who went to the war was a cliché even before the performance of the film. The use of World War II as background was in itself a cliché ... the bombs, the shelter in tube stations, etc. ... employed to introduce some much needed drama. Why someone thought for a moment that this movie was worth making is quite beyond my understanding. It was another case of "let's see the costumes authentic, never matter the story, the script or the acting!"
