my friends and I are always on the lookout for chuck norris movies to just bash and have fun. One of our favorites so far is Lonewolf. I went to a Christmas shopping and I got this movie in the 5,99 bin. I had to get it. I had a high expectation for this movie and although I was sometimes completely hilarious, we agreed that bells of innocence were the worst movie we ever saw, made, produced, thought, and so on ... what hell would think of it is a good idea. Not only is it sometimes confusing, but the acting is just hard to watch. The man who plays the game, I can compare with my own vomit, and Chuck took a dive on this one, he is not the greatest actor, but it was terrible. and what kind of names are ears, conrad and jux ........ jux. come on people. If you honestly thought, this movie is almost visible, good for you, because it was hard for me and I had a serious headache and stomach ache after watching it. I tell you now if you haven't seen this movie, DO NOT! For the love of God, do not subject yourself to such a terrible 90 minutes of your life.
