I don't care what someone says, this movie is hilarious! It combines the darkness of Threads with an anarchic blend of alternative comedy, and the results are a very dark, yet exorbitant, funny satire on both Western and Eastern blocs. You have to give the filmmakers credit for even trying to curb the "Duck and cover" or "Protect and survive" one day! <br /> <br /> Imagine someone made a movie based on the Dead Kennedys track 'Kinky Sex Make the World Go Around', and you're pretty close to wieops! Apocalypse. Add Rik Mayall on top form as a bad OTT SAS commander and you got it exactly. A valuable companion to Dr Strangelove, and it says something.
