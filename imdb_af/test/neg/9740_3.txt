It's a silly movie. When I saw it in a movie, more than half of the audience left before it was halfway. I came to the bitter end. To show strength? I caught it again on television and it was very funny. Never a classic, or even consistently hilarious, but the kinda family has grown on me. I love Jessica Lundy anyway. If you have nothing better to do, it is free at t.v. you can do worse.
