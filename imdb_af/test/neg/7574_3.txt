Amando DeOssorio was never one to let a lack of budget tell one of his stories. His "Blind Dead" series started big but has some nice moments, like shots of a small model boat in a water tank for "The Ghost Galleon". In "The Sea Serpent" he hits the rock bottom and takes some notable actors with him. He tells the story of a foolish soccer monster bringing google-eyed terror to some water tanks and miniature aquariums. <br /> <br /> A vague opening series sets the stage and shows an apostate military mission where American pilots, for some unknown reason, abandon an atomic bomb in the coast of Spain. The military commander orders this from an office with a prominent American flag and a portrait of a devastated Ronald Reagan, one of only a few things this movie really looks like the Eighties. The other two are the hilariously inept subtitles stating that the year is "1,985" and Tyria Power's dated Sheena Easton hairstyle. It would seem to be really cool next to some torn neon sweat. <br /> <br /> One of the most beautiful monsters you'll ever see rising from the depths, disturbed by the explosion that causes the bomb. We learn that the ominous atomic bomb has killed much of the local fish. Throwing us away, it has no effect on the Sea Snake, which descends quickly on the coast of Spain for a small mini set. <br /> <br /> Now when I say the monster is unrealistic, I'm not exaggerating. It's not just a kind of a fake look. I'm sure the filmmakers did the best with the ten bucks they seem to have been awarded, but most of the time it looks like Crayola tags, a table tennis ball and an old sock. Not only that, it has this ominous music that accompanies it wherever it goes, music that sounds so much like the "Jaws" theme is that it is a miracle no one has argued. <br /> <br /> Trapped with Tyria Power, Timothy Bottoms and Ray Milland, dialogue could no longer be foolish. Through a series of plot contrivances, our leading actors are thrown together in search of ... well, I don't know what the purpose is. Bottom and power must prove that the snake is really saving their buttocks (he is guilty of a snake-induced shipwreck, she is trapped in the loony bin after an observation). None of these things is important, because by the end of the movie nothing has been solved. No one admits the snake is really, and it is not even dead. Furthermore, Power and Bottoms are still on the lamb of law. <br /> <br /> As illogical as it seems, no one except our heroes knows that the snake exists (despite numerous disappearances, a garbage lighthouse and a crushed railway bridge), and they start with an extension non-adventure to track down and chase the monster away ... don't kill it because they know they're not a game. Their big plan is to use torches to deter them. Although their scheme is broken, the snake causes a huge explosion in the water after attacking a bridge support (don't ask), and the giant sea snake is so scared that it is swimming. The critical viewer would wonder why the snake did not frighten into the movie earlier when it caused some major explosions after crashing into a dock. But never mind. It swims away, and our heroes are sure it's gone forever. The end. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine the horror that the stars felt if they saw the finished movie they were just working on. A lamebrain scripts and a few dull reaction shots could never prepare them for the embarrassment of sharing screen time with a sophisticated doll / stop motif. At least, the supporting characters have fun shouting and pretending to be swallowed by a giant snake head. I'm not sure what was going on when they made this movie; The monster is cheap, but there are some clear thumbnail sets, so someone spent time making it, not the stop motion animation involved. It seemed to be right, though the movie's sense of humor may have gone over my head. In the end, the movie is nothing more than an easy target for a drunken comment. Look at a party for the best results.
