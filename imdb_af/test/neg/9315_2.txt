Historical movies always take liberties - conversations are closed where no one can actually know what has been said, customs are adapted to be understandable to modern audiences, and so on. However, historical films about real historical characters must at least make a minimal node for history. This movie doesn't. The only scene I actually remember is when our hero surprises an assassin who invades his room at night. He confronts the dangerous intruder with, "I don't remember sending for room service". The main entertainment value is in its weakness; I recommended placing my local video story on the "Turkeys" shelf.
