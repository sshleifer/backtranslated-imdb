Not quite a bomb? The only thing missing was the enriched uranium. Actually, the writing could have worked if the lead roles were cast with younger actors, but the drama of an aging Diane Lane as if she were a teenager (or even twenty) was too much to stomach. Every time she (Adrienne) would jump into the arms of Richard Gere and then pull both heels behind her, you could almost see the grimace of pain on his face as he probably thinks: "Oh, my painful back ... this Babe probably no longer knows 125 pounds! "Anyway, both characters were clearly unattractive, especially Richard Gere's: a self-absorbed plastic surgeon (Dr. Paul Flanner) who was on a sort of soul competition after a blunt operation left him with a dead patient (an older woman from a small farm). Then there was her angry husband and son he had to deal with to explain what had happened. Dr Flanner is on his way to meet the angry man (on the man's request) when he meets Adrienne. She was recently split from her treacherous husband (shock) and helped a friend look through her beach home residence. Of course, this is where Dr Flanner finally lives and they both fall in love with MADS (especially after finding out he is a wealthy doctor and a plastic surgeon). Between romantic interludes and a deceptive song / dance routine that Lane (Adrienne) performs while listening to an old LP (no CDs), they try to see how their lives are so scattered. Dr Flanner was not much of a father and had a son (who is also a dr.) Who upset him that he was not there for him while growing up. (Of course, Dr. Flanner was more interested in his medical career at the time rather than getting a turbulent, distracting son.) To shorten a long (predictable) story, Adrienne Dr Flanner helps face his inner demons staring at, and confronting, the wife and son of the woman who died at his operational table (after having had a "routine" stain removal from the face). Dr Flanner could finally tell the man (suddenly sympathetic by Scott Glenn) that he was sorry for what had happened - even if it was the fault of the anesthetist. "I told him she was too old for that lot of juice!" Glenn's character, (Robert Torrelson) seems to accept Dr Flanner's apology. It's hard to tell because his emotional response is so passive by this time you're wondering if he's even the good dr. Hear or think about an area he should plow. More and more carefully, dr. Flanner had to visit his son (now practicing medicine pro bono in a third world country) to restore their relationship. Unfortunately, this means that he must temporarily worship Adrienne. Of course, while entertaining the natives in Timbuktu, he writes a love letter to Adrienne every hour (which every time a schoolgirl arrives, every time she gets one) and tells her that the hardest thing he ever had to do was to tell her goodbye. Apparently, apologizing to Robert Torrelson for his wife's death was the second most difficult thing. In the end, he is killed in a freak mud slide (poetic justice as in muddy suit?) And she only keeps the memories of what could have been ... hopefully no more Gere / Lane prosecution!
