This is the first and, as far as I can tell, the only completed production of "Heart of Darkness" ever released. Before the start of "Citizen Kane," Orson Welles shot some test material for a version of "Heart of Darkness" that would be filmed entirely in what is now called "POV", where we would all be from the point of view. see the main character Charlie Marlow; he would only be briefly seen in mirrors, windows, water, etc. The film was never made. The "POV" technique was used in 1947 in "The Lady in the Lake", not too successful, with Robert Montgomery starring Philip Marlowe. Presumably the coincidence of the two "Marlow (s)" characters is the same. Of course, Francis Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" was based on "Heart of Darkness." <br /> <br /> The short novel "Heart of Darkness" by Polish writer Joseph Conrad, born in English, first appeared in a British literary series magazine in 1899, featuring one of his favorite alter egos , shipwreck Charlie Marlow, who also tells the short story "Youth" and indirectly tells the story of "Lord Jim". Marlow, who is temporarily out of work, decides to take a river boat for a Belgian company involved in the brutal exploitation of the resources of King Leopold II's personal fiefdom, the cruel, failed Congo Free State. Marlow travels from London to Brussels, signs up with the company and is told that his mission is to take a boat on the Congo River to a distant land station led by one of the company's most productive colony agents. A German called Kurtz. Ivv, latex (rubber manufacturing) and other products from Kurtz's station stopped and no word came from Kurtz for quite some time. There are rumors that he has "become indigenous." Marlow is investigating, taking any necessary steps and making a report on his return. He crosses the West African coast to Congo, weeks are delayed as he is forced to repair his boat at the corporate coast station. He eventually ends up finding Kurtz's station. The river, the heat, the vegetation, the wildlife, the insects, the people, take their toll on his endurance, imagination and mental resources. He finds Kurtz sick, half crazy and close to death. The final meeting and death of Kurtz is almost an anticlimax, especially since Conrad is so unclear about what actually happens that we are left to throw it out to ourselves. This is a novel where you make the book vaguely dissatisfied with the end, yet entertain the story for its amazing atmospheres. <br /> <br /> This "Heart of Darkness" was filmed with Guyana in Central America who had been in West Africa. . It's best where the novel is at its worst: In fact, we are showing our first World Urbanites that will look like a boat trip on a tropical river. But the rest of the movie was forgotten. Tim Roth does his best as Marlow, but so much about the plot, characterization and character relationships has changed without mind that you wonder why they were bothering. If the goal was to make Conrad's story for the screen, why didn't they leave it alone? It is unreasonable to expect that no compromises will be made when a book is made in a movie, but so many changes have been made that have no theoretical justification for me, whether you are simply dealing with incompetent writers and film people. Most disappointing was John Malkovich as Kurtz. He was completely ignored and simply the role. Everything about him is wrong: His looks, his acting, his voice, his accent, everything. A much better choice would be someone like Bruno Ganz (unlike Malkovich, a real German, like the character). <br /> <br /> This is a very disappointing production and I will recommend it only after you have the book if you want to add more of your imagination to a visual picture of a cruise on the Congo River around 1900 get.
