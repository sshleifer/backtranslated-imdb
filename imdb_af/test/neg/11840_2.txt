The story of this movie is clich√© and obviously ripped off from Jurassic Park. The filmmakers didn't even try to hide it. There seems to be not enough budget to make decent dinosaur dolls, but instead the viewer sees some robotic toy dinos (of a cheap star) moving in a very unnatural way. It's funny because it's so bad. The acting is almost as unnatural as the dinos. No one really looks excited to be in this movie (which I fully understand). Especially in the last half hour is extremely boring and it is almost impossible to see it without falling asleep. The one positive comment I want to make about "Raptor" is that it doesn't take a full 90 minutes.
