Rozema's 1999 adaptation of Mansfield Park is by far better than this seemingly more faithful movie. The 1999 film is ruined by many Austen purists, but I admire the work that Rozema did to make Mansfield Park's own. It may not be Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, but at least it was well written, beautifully shot and well done by a superior cast. I don't see how Austen-purists can be any happier with this 2007 version of ITV (and re-broadcast on Masterpiece Theater / PBS). The screenplay is slenderly slammed and plunged to begin, the production values ​​are slim, and the cast (apart from Jemma Redgrave and Blake Ritson) is largely guilty of bad acting. I can't think of a worst miscarriage as Billie Piper as Fanny Price. Her appearance was wrong (bleached hair and dark eyebrows ??) and her talent was simply not suitable for the material. Mr. Thomas looked hard all the time. Michelle Ryan as Mariah was on autopilot as well as the actors the Crawfords portrayed (if I think the better Alessandro Nivola and Embeth Davidtz were in the '99 version, I just shook my head). <br /> <br /> I didn't see the 1983 version, so I can't comment, but I highly recommend someone curious to give the '99 version a chance. Read the novel before or after and make your own mind.
