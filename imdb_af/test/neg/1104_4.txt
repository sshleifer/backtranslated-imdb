J.S. Cardone directed a little-known "Video Nasty" in 1982, called The Slayer, and has since gone into a handful of feature films; including the garbage 2001 vampire movie The Forsaken. His latest feature film, Wicked Little Things, boasts a sounding sound plot, as well as a creepy looking poster that I apparently remembered recording a few years ago, in connection with a movie that Tobe Hooper had to lead. Well, I think he felt that this one was too similar to his silly zombie mushroom movie "Mortuary," and so this one turned. Neither did I accuse him. The plot focuses on a mother and her two daughters who move to an old house in the mountains that once belonged to her late husband. However, what they do not realize is about a hundred years earlier; A group of kids used as miners is trapped in a mining post. Of course, this is not the end of them and they managed to survive their ordeal and now the area in search of revenge? <br /> <br /> The movie is essentially a collection of clich√©s; from the youngest child with an "imaginary friend", the mother who rejects it and all the usual zombie rubbish. J.S. Cardone tries to get rid of horror fans again with shocks and giant zones (mostly kids), but that's not enough. The story doesn't play very well and reminds me too much of the previous Mortuary, and that's not a good thing (although Mortuary is actually a better movie than that). The acting is nothing to write about at home; Lori Heuring is decent looking, like the oldest daughter Scout Taylor-Compton; But don't drive an interesting performance. Chloe Moretz is slightly better than the ordinary child actor. The plot is given little credibility and the screenplay cannot even be bothered to explain the reasons why the children attack the local population. It all comes down to a typical and fairly finite and overall I must say if you know your horror movies, you can feel free to hit this one!
