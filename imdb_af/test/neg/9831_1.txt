I do not know if I hated this movie as much as I did when I watched it two weeks ago, but if you expect the events described on the box, forget it ... it would be a good movie have been. The big descent described on the box is nothing compared to the descent in the extreme dispair that I watched this movie. If you saw HBO's Taxi Cab Confessions, it's the same thing, just fiction, and not even remotely, so interesting. If you really want to see something about a taxi driver, check out the 20 minutes that they run on Encore from time to time. It's really worth looking at. I have never asked for money for a movie until I saw this thing. Drilling, Drilling, Drilling. It offers one unique feature, what is it: It lets you decide what happens to each of the passengers, and lets your imagination fill in the gaps. What would be good if you really care about any of these people. Instead, I screamed myself on the screen and cried like a child praying for the end of the movie or my own death. The taxi driver himself (although well-played, predominantly) runs through emotions seemingly random, from sarcastic to sympathetic to rage Sometimes it is appropriate, most of the time it's just a show for that reason. "Dammit, I've learned all these emotions in acting, and I'm going to use it!" Now that I think about it again, I hate this movie as much as I did!
