THE QUICKIE (1 out of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Pretty poor movie ... an old-and-the-hills story about a high gangster who wants to stop, passing his empire to his turbulent son. Of course it won't be easy for someone in that line or job to just stop ... such a contract is put on his life. After wiping out a big party, an exterminator (Jennifer Jason Leigh, who I think) is never again in something other than TV movies or a low-budget direct-to-video waste. Our "hero" succeeds in her ... offers her big money for a "quickie" ... she turns off his offer, although she needs the money ... but at least wakes up ... even afterwards, the overwhelming boy who thought she was sent to kill his father was brutally harassed. Ugh. The story just goes on and off ... you can see every "turn" and "turn" come a mile away. Weird soundtrack from a group called "The Tiger Lillies" will drive most people's nuts ... but I thought there was some kind of cool track at the end. Or maybe I was just excited because I could tell that the movie was almost over? Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer ... what happened to you?
