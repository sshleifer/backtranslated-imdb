The acting was very substandard. You've had Costas Mandalar like Triple H's deadly forest custodian, a Scott McMahon-like as his depot, which I'm supposed to care for, but there's no emotional involvement. You have the stupid lesbians, not that I have anything against lesbians, I just don't do stupid people running around in a penalty like a shirt and a grunge like a hat that keeps asking if someone has seen her dead lover. <br /> <br /> The Villain can be scary and there is a moral story about trying to fight age and death, but it is lost in this movie. Costas Hurst Helmsley points out that the victims must be back in the village. There are obviously lights behind him. <br /> <br /> Also a mispronunciation of Ed Gein, but it pronounced Gine. As a Wisconsin citizen. We had our share of Monsters Gein, Dahmer and McCarthy, but if you are going to use it, that's right. <br /> <br /> God Why do I watch all these horrible movies. Oh yeah, I'm a wrath for the punishment and I look at it, so you don't have to do it.
