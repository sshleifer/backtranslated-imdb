This movie was so bad, it got nice. If you want to see a soap opera, decide to do an action movie, it's for you! Overreacted, irrelevant incidents, indisputable dialogue - it has everything. The main character has a split personality and cannot lose sight of whether he is a thief, a loving father or a hero who will threaten his life for others. He is plausible in none of these roles. It sets the default for many of the other characters. The boss of the company whose building is abandoned shows the same unpredictability, and also his wife. And the punch line - who took the "chip" - beggars believe. I laughed myself, and so I advise you to see it.
