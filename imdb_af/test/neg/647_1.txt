My wife and I saw it in the theater when it first came out. <br /> <br /> There were only 3 couples out there and we all walked out about the same time. <br /> <br /> It's the only movie I've ever run. <br /> <br /> It was just painful to go through. <br /> <br /> The theater actually ran out of our way and asked if we wanted a refund. <br /> <br /> It never happened before or since Pleae didn't rent. It will really regret it. I'm really sure about the summary of votes. Perhaps personal taste has something to do with it.
