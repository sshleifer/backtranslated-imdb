I saw a fan of the first demons last night, and I hoped the successor would have the same prosperous ghostly spirit. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The set-up is similar to the first, in which a horde of carnivorous demons erupted in reality by being released from a horror movie being played ... (The first was a movie, this one takes place in an apartment building and on TV.) Once the demons are released, madness and mass-bloodbath come in. It's pretty much it going so far as plot development. It worked well in the first part because of the ghoulish makeup FX, fast pace and unpredictability. However, the successor does not cut it. The first problem seems to be that there are too many characters that we don't really care about. If they were annoying or idiots, there would at least be some kind of satisfaction when they inevitably slaughtered / demonstrated / eaten. But these people are just waiting to be slaughtered. The fact that most characters are in different apartment blocks (and out of them) constantly pushes them back and forth between them, which let me out of the story. There are some entertaining pieces, courtesy of the devastating FX and campus. Like a constant flow of dripping blood going through one floor's construction to another, as if it were alien acid. The first devil's possession of a cuddly birthday girl leads to the destruction of her entire party and a creepy devil's child clutching his way In the room of a child's pregnant tenant. But that sequence parlays in a ridiculous-looking rubber demon baby puppet thing that bursts from the breast of the human child who is constantly flying over the room at his intended victim. I found a few guys out of that scene, but I don't think it was Bava's intention. The scene would probably have worked better if they just kept the child's devil to attack the woman, but hey ... Other small things like the zealous actions of most characters and the bad dubbing do not help. In summary, I got the unprecedented version on DVD, and I can't imagine having to completely put through the previously available R version, because the makeup FX and Gore were the only thing I got from it. . Also worth mentioning is an early role of producer Argento's future hottie daughter, Asia. In fact, she probably gives the best view of the entire cast and she is barely on the screen. Argento / Bava fans may just want to see it, but will probably see their watch as I did. Gore fans can get a kick from some of the fx, but will step out of their seats at the most goofy-evil evil puppet since Little Selwyn of Dead / Alive. You can do worse, but it certainly doesn't live up to the original.
