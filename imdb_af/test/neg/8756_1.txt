A majority of exclusively made-for-video low-budget frightening flicks from the 80's always stink worse than rugged old socks. This exceptionally dull and amateurish, non-budget Chicago-set cellar "nasty necrophilic nutcase on the loose" massacre serves as a prime confirmation of this boundary-inevitable fact. A beard, flowered shirt, long-haired, bead and flowered shirt wearing a wild-eye psycho-hippie fruit tray, starts with your standard everlasting gruesome deadly spree, which beats graphic killing young couples who are in severe coitus to play when the Mansonesque lunatic attacks are ignored. (Hmm, do I discover a pretty obvious and self-righteous-puritanical sex-and-death message here? Give it, man, man.) Boy, is this spiritually unbalanced sicko a true way off: After he cut his female victims , our certifying crackers killer enjoys love for their sleek bodies. (WARNING: Possible * SPOILER * ahead. By the end of the picture, the copse copulating crazy is uncomfortably interrupted by the police while in the middle of the unthinkable with a nubile cadaver, expelling the foul pervert to release with an understandable distress and over-cry of "Nooo!") Now this gonzo man is not a definite loved one and a half? <br /> <br /> Bad, this movie was done so badly; If it was only made with a lot of flair and skill, it could have been a thin ginger of an abomination exploit item. Unfortunately, Wally Koz's ham-fisted direction, Lamar "Larry" Bloodworth's stubborn static and petty filmography, Frankie "Hollywood" Rodriguez's indifferent, monotonous head-on "hard rock" count, the zealously cheap and unconvincing makeup f / x, flat, strikingly awkward plywood that acts by a ruthless all-thumbs and unpleasant non-pro-cast lethargic pacing (too much screen time is furiously crushed on the police's lethal attempts to capture the wacko), a particular lame will be shocking "surprise" that ends (the mysterious killer's true identity guarantees you in disgust), the uniformly boring, ceaselessly bitter and positive braindead characters, and a steady sequence of boring softcore sex scenes that are so erotic as two sweets for 90 watch. minutes straight, adding everything to a deep and bad, unobtrusive, sleeping noodle of a crummy clinker. To be honest, however, this movie has one stellar virtue: The crazy dog-shooter undoubtedly has great taste in a tropical, lazy-as-Thursday-glove Hawaiian shirt.
