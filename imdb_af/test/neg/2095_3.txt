Snakes on a train (2006, Dir. The Mallachi Brothers) A zombie curse is placed on a woman, causing her to have live snakes in her. Brujo, who cares for her, tries to take her to Los Angeles on the train. After several confrontations on the train, Brujo's collection of snakes succeeded in securing themselves from their owner and going on the hunt. While all this is happening, ordinary everyday passengers are relaxing, which is unknown to them, that something is deadly on their way and that they are not out. <br /> <br /> After watching the wonderful fun snakes on an airplane, I had to look it out. I knew it was going to be a rip-off and that the movie would look cheap, but what I found was the worst to watch. The whole curse plot was stupid and never had to be included. The special effects are not terrible but do not look the best. I didn't have an idea about the end. It was stupid to look and pathetic. The acting was absolutely terrible and looks bad. They just couldn't act to save their lives. If you want a good laugh, watch it, otherwise you should really avoid it. <br /> <br /> "We have a runaway train. I repeat. - Conductor (Stephen A.F. Day)
