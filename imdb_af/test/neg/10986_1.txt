It's the worst movie I've seen in a long time. It reminded me of a Cirque du Soleil show I saw in Vegas six years ago - without the athletics. By this I mean a few striking, artistic images, appearing randomly without any sustainable framework. The fake sepia-tinted film is really tough. This device is almost never justified and is certainly not in _Tuvalu_. With apology to Abe Lincoln: sometimes you can mislead some of the people.
