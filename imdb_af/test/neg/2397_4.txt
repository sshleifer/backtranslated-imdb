Your time and brains will be much better spent reading or listening to Charlie Wilson's War. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays the most pleasing character in the movie, Gust, the Greek, and he plays him as an eunuch. Gust, in the book, is hard core and completely free to speak his mind. In the movie he is not even as important to Charlie. And poor Charlie is never shown to donate blood (which he did every time he visited the camps in Pakistan). In short, the film is too vague, and history is too old for our modern times. We do not really end the end of the Cold War and the defeat of the Soviet Union (despite Reagan's failure) by a well-funded group of people who were extremely willing to fight. Not the lesson we need to hear and see how well the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan go. (As I read the book, I still kept the deja vu feeling, except if it was today).
