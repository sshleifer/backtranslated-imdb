I was so disappointed in this movie. I am very familiar with the matter because I have not only read Mark Fuhrman's book but also the far superior "A wealth of evil: the true story of the murder of Martha Moxley in America's richest community" by Timothy Dumas. Anyone watching MURDER IN GREENWICH must be aware that they are watching the Mark Fuhrman story, not the Martha Moxley story. This movie is nothing more than an ego journey for Fuhrman. Just look at his character support as if he were the second coming (yes, even by women). The actors playing the kids look too old for their roles and the flashbacks to the 1970s are totally unconvincing. If there is a hero for this story, it's Martha's family, her mother Dorothy and brother John. They kept this case alive for two years before Fuhrman entered it to make him a name. They and Martha deserve the true story being told.
