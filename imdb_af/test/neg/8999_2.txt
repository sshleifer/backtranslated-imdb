What a waste of time. I climbed into it for about five minutes and wondered, and soon went ahead, and the desire to remove my thumb from the fast button was immediate. Actors Mark Redfield and Barry Murphy did a very good job, I thought, but no one else I've seen gave everything like a good performance. Again, take this review with a great salt grain because the movie was just as unbearable that I couldn't make it to the end. Heck, I couldn't do it in the middle !! <br /> <br /> I find myself unable to submit this review because it is not long enough. Maybe this last sentence will put it on top.
