This movie is terrible. Not only is the story incredible, the situations in which the characters enter themselves are so stupid, to the point where it is not shocking. I find it sad that Daisy Eagan, the star of Broadway's The Secret Garden, decided it would be a career. The idea is interesting, two young girls come out very quickly. But the generation didn't even wake up. The movie is stupid, the story is stupid, the performances are stupid, and the whole concept is interesting when it comes down. I'm sure all the 14-year-old girls come out with guys after they had their first time and tried to flush their pants in the toilet. Good luck next time guys. My Scale * T-scale *
