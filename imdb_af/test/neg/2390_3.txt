Although it was not a complete waste of time, "eighteen" wasn't really as nice as it pretended. Or are the ages of the actors depicting them? 18, my buttocks. McKellen could actually have turned up in the movie we told him he was 30 and ask us to believe it. Even Michael J. Fox was more credible than a teenager in 'Back to the Future' Parts II and III (okay, maybe, they are probably equivalent credibility.) If you can go beyond the obvious age, you will have either full void of acting or simply persuaded (Paul Anthony's so-called anxiety, Clarence Sponagle's lifetime moments, and although I plead for Brendan Fletcher favor, it is better to watch him, and more in 'Freddy Vs. Jason') incomprehensible scenes ( a quicker than the Britney Spears marriage, a point to prove and a man who needs help urinating, but one hand free? I guess it was the author's fantasy.) A full movie of despicable characters (Anthony can play someone who is 18, but act like he is 12 and throw a little strange "john" so Anthony's character. Pip can save the day? Was there really a sex scene before a baby?) and virtually every character questioning their own sexuality through strange actions / scenes . On the positive side, I enjoyed Ian McKellen's voice, as a (rarely well-pictured) straight / gay friendship, puppy love (from someone who collects stuffed puppies, that is) good score, a decent dialogue (love for the Separation of gays and pedophilia Want more people realize this and because of the female lead (as well as Cumming) I can't really recommend it because it's really too much? gay tolerance, gay hustling, homelessness, WWII epic, priesthood, first love, defective judges, etc. etc? on a shocking budget.
