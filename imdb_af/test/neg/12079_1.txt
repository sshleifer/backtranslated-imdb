It's just when a group has tours, and only one original member. It's not the same as the classic line. All new actors play the lead roles of Rag, Scotty, etc., with Ashby as virtually the only return of the first movie. And he was of a lesser note from the first movie, which was the only redeeming group of the three guys trying to meet Scotty. The film is poorly written, with the stupid dialogue on this side of Armageddon. Even for a T&A movie, this one is a turkey. Not even die tough low budget 80's movies fans will want to put through this movie, which has no plot, and lots of bad acting. This movie would have been better to never be released. Just plain bad.
