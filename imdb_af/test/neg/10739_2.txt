The only reason I gave this episode of "Masters of Horror" a 2 instead of a 1 is because the two main players are good, and it's not shot at VHS. The story, the dialogue and the plot are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Talking / Driving zombies coming back to vote for political tide against the war! Give me a chance! What, next, zombies coming back to go parachuting? Perhaps zombies coming back to present QVC performances? <br /> <br /> I never supported the war of Iraq, but I support the courage and sacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces; and "Homecoming" was disrespectful in that it mocked the TRUE horror of the war. <br /> <br /> With zombies produced in today's market, it is the SPAM of zombie-related entertainment. How "Homecoming" made it on "Masters of Horror" is beyond me.
