Cyclone is a piece of drunk with a little bit of reasoning, even on such a bad, entertaining front. A friend of mine took the band of a crowded St Vincent DePaul robe. Well, it can be a bit dodgy, but it was meant to be a clothes box, not an old old VHS bin. The less fortunate members of our society do not have to make their lives better. It can be considered a grace. Watching a movie like Cyclone really just adds to their problems. In any case, the basic premise of a woman with a super-powerful motorcycle armed with rockets and lasers is not even properly exploited. The two 'high-speed' pursuit empires involve vehicles driving at less than 40 KMPH hair raising speeds and a super-fast motorbike that is in danger of crossing an old station wagon is not awesome when you come down . This. There is only one scene where the bicycles are rigidly used, in the climax of the movie, and it's nice ineffective, or just laughing when it is. These include laser beams that seem to be out of the hands of an evil wizard out of the hands of an eighty-year-old sword and wizardry that causes great flames, which have no significant effect on their targets, even when they hit directly be. The rest of the movie is just hard to look filler. Many bad actors, yes even Combs and Landau suck in it, most of them seemingly raised from the set of a porn movie, to exchange a very bad dialogue in a desperate attempt to plot the scarce coherence introduce. There are some poorly advanced battle order and some ominous comic relief scenes with some policemen and the owner of the motorcycle repair shop. Comedy from the sub Benny Hill old old man can't stop staring at the female lead breast variety. Basically, the 'money' scenes involving the bike are actually doing things, little and lame and the rest is a fine material. Skip it.
