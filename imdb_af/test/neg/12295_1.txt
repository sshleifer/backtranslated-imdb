Oh, the horror, the unspeakable horror of this movie. If you can even call it a movie. It looks like a first-year art school project that is quickly thrown together. <br /> <br /> The "talents" here will experience a painful mix of under-and-over processing, and virtually all the screens are terribly confronted and pretentious. <br /> <br /> The film in no way reflects Malaysian culture or social conventions. Nobody even speaks here. I live in Malaysia, VAT. <br /> <br /> Spinning Gasing seems tailor-made to pick up a foreign film category award from a Western film festival. And unfortunately it seems like it worked. Some reviewers will undoubtedly describe it as "exotic", but a more accurate word will be "atrocious". <br /> <br />
