This movie is terrible. It has absolutely zero lag. Hebrew Hammer (Adam Goldberg) sets up Hannukah from Evil Santa (Andy Dick). Perhaps a promising enough foundation for a plot, in fact, the film goes beyond this premise. While there are a few (far and little) fun touches and the plot is relatively coherent, it is hardened, hackneyed, and eventually ceaseless. This despite the fact that Goldberg, Dick and Greer (Hammer's client / love interests) all have considerable screen presence. Despite what is played for what can be described as wacky over-the-top gags, this movie is consistently middle-class mid-of-the-road muck. Don't waste 85 minutes of your life in this. (Note: the music was good ..!)
