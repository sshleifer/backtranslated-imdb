A few years ago, I remember reading an essay by a feminist film theorist who briefly called Rosalind Russell. This theorist wrote that the "strength" of "strong women" played by Rozzie R. was partly in their ability to stand with their husband (even when he wasn't worth it). <br /> <br /> I thought of this essay after looking at 'Crime of Passion'. <br /> <br /> Kathleen Turner has the same power and style as Russell in her depiction of prostitute China Blue. She is the object of love for two men: the rewarding priest who is played by Anthony Perkins, and a white white kid who slowly fades her marriage. And she won't let one of them have a piece of her until ... <br /> <br /> I won't give up - but I'll say it's finally Bland Whitebread Boy's fantasy. No matter how hard Ken Russell tries, he can't conceal the fact that this movie is basically a 1940s melodrama for the MTV generation. In addition to the declining class and gender politics, the old black and white films seem to be revolutionary.
