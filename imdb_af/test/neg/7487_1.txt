I thought it was a very bad movie. The whole time I watched this movie, I couldn't help but think again and again how bad it was and how it was $ 3.69 in the drain. The plot was so jumping. They did an excellent job at first to explain who dated in high school, but they never really explained anything. Was it a supernatural thriller? Was it a regular thriller? Apparently you can decide for yourself, because they didn't have the need to explain. I basically understood what happened, I think. What I was upset about was everything before, what was the matter with the bloody noses, phone calls, etc.? Was this man back? Was the woman who could channel "Carrie" or something? Who knows? You will definitely not watch this movie.
