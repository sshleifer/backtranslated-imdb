My mom and I went to see this movie because my brother in the US Peace Corps serves in the same region in which it was set up. Halfway through the film I decided that since the failure to measure what it pretends to achieve, the title is pretentious. The subject it deals with can have made for excellent documentary work, but because of its poor performance, it has made me much less educated about the issue than I was hoping to become. I agree with Laura-Jane of Canada ("Powerful Message, but Lack of Focus."). I also agree with the user who said this movie's story-free style is the opposite of Michael Moore, but I disagree that it offers different views and invites the viewer to decide for him or herself. I agree with one user's remark that a lesson is better learned when we draw the conclusions ourselves'; However, our conclusions can only be poorly founded if we provide little relevant information from which they can be drawn. <br /> <br /> The main points of the documentary were 1) The Afrikaners living near Lake Victoria are very poor and suffer greatly. 2) The introduction of perch to the Lake Victoria, which was administered by Europeans, destroyed its ecosystem. 3) The communities around the Lake Victoria are financially dependent on the perplexing economy. <br /> <br /> The best thing I can say about the movie is that it attempted to relate the perspectives of the average people in sub-Saharan Africa, which unfortunately is an anomaly among movies and that it attempted to portray poverty as a result of a dysfunctional economic system rather than a universal, inevitable phenomenon. I like the irony it has caught in the massive amount of fish leaving the country in the face of a famine. I appreciated the portrayal of how indispensable the US team assigned to the region was with the people. As almost all the documentaries that do not have the word "women" in the title, this film fails a good job representing women's voices. Most of the interviews are men's. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I should see the movie a second time to get some important points I may have missed, but I have failed to get Sauper's theory on the relationship between launching bass. experiencing the Victoria lake and the unfair living conditions for Africans. near the lake. Furthermore, I might be wrong, but it struck me that Sauper could do well to improve his maintenance skills. Not only did the questions he asked and the responses he included seem to be arbitrary, but he apparently had a real talent to make the awkward and awkward maintenance of the entertainers. <br /> <br /> The most compelling development in the film is the suggestion that the export of perch now functions to mask the import of weapons and that the real economy of Tanzania is screwing, not war. Unfortunately, Sauper disappears from the thorough expose of the idea (or at least the interview with the reporter he knew to know about what he was talking about the arms import), and with a decision to decide for himself. <br /> <br /> If Darwin's Nightmare was to eradicate the myth that the world's first world exploitation would "give them a chance for a better life," it didn't do well. If it was meant to describe how the arms manufacturing industry in the US and Europe is responsible for many armed conflict around the world, it did not do well. If it's supposed to portray what drives people to prostitution, it hasn't done a good job. If it were the intention to relieve the inability of the US to carry out its mission, it did not do good work. If it was meant to say that the scarce income that Tanzanians earn from the perch does not make the human cost of maternity seizure to make a lucrative product, it did not do well. If it was meant to mean that Tanzania would be much better off if Europeans never came, it didn't do well.
