In the dusty village of Furlough in Texas, an animal beats the cattle and the local population. When Tommy Tommy (Michael Carreo) is murdered, their friends, Anna Furlough (Erika Fay), her Mexican-American boyfriend Miguel Gonzalez (Gabriel Gutierrez), Jill Gillespie (Sara Erikson) and Rosie (Martine Hughes) find a Mexican werewolf Chupacabra is the killer and they are planning a plan to kill the animal. <br /> <br /> "Mexican Werewolf in Texas" is an amateur shit and among the worse movies I've ever seen, or not the worst. Nothing works in this movie: the script is laughing, with some of the most horrible lines I've ever heard. The direction does not exist and the camera follows the "style" of "The Blair Witch Project". The amateur-like play seems to be a prank of high school students or a high school. The "special effects" are horrible and extremely poor and the "werewolf" is the cheapest I have ever seen. Ed Wood movies are cult, but this "Mexican Werewolf in Texas" is pure garbage. In the end Jill says no one can resist her teats (actually the most beautiful thing in this movie). But I believe the correct quotation should be: "No man (or woman) can resist watching this movie to the end". I was driven by my curiosity to see how bad a movie could be and I lost 88 minutes of my life, but I believe most viewers will stop watching with less than 20 minutes. My voice is one (terrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Um Lobisomen Mexicano no Texas" ("A Mexican Werewolf in Texas")
