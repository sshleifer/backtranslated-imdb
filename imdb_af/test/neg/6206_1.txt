It's not a good movie. This is a proven remake of the English movie 'The Hitch'. But it insults the original. It's hardly a movie you'd expect from a veteran director like "David Dhawan", who is credited with good movies like Raja Babu, Coolie No.1, Hero No. 1. <br /> <br /> The main theme for this movie was taken from "The Hitch" with a few changes to appeal to the Indian audience, but somehow the story and the script are not convincing enough. Plus the acting role players, Salman Khan and Govinda, are miserable. They seem to need the slightest provocation to remove their shirts to reveal their bare breasts. I don't see this fascinating and least of all comic things. What did the director think? In addition, viewers should play the case of Govinda's Over-acting. It was simply unbearable. I ADVICE THE PEOPLE TO STAY AT YOUR OWN RISK. My rating of 2 for this movie can be considered a very generous one. <br /> <br /> Instead, I would recommend the viewer to watch the English movie "Hitch", which is much better.
