The Net is a movie I have never seen before. I remember donating it on the mediocre reviews and since then maybe noticed a slip here and there if it was on TV. If I see it now, fourteen years after it's original release, I'm a little flabbergasted about how time flies. Being in my mid-20s made my childhood feel feelings of old. I felt as if I had to exercise before my body began to stack up the wrong places. Cut down on fat and sugar. Too much coffee and cigarettes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this was the best part of this movie experience for me. I want to say the first 30 minutes of this movie really kept me busy with the retro sky. Look at the big cans they call computers. Look, they're chatting in classrooms! I remember those tank tops! They look .... silly. And hey, it even dies Sandra Bullock. First Invoiced! Look at it. <br /> <br /> As a movie, The Net is just an imaginative, simple and completely routine Hitchockian cat-and-mouse thriller. Nothing archaic about it, they made them as much as they do now. Bullock plays a reclusive computer nerd whose job it is to solve software for people who do not get the whole computer thing. As it happens, she bumps into some delicate information and after her holiday trip ends with her, she is almost killed by a sexy lick who appears to be a killer (played by Jeremy Northam, and she had to be suspected by the the fact that they are in an American movie and the man smokes and has a British accent!) she gets her "identity wiped out". Her house is empty, for sale, and after being checked, it seems she now has a new identity. A convicted prostitute and fraudster, no less. <br /> <br /> Now you can say it's unlikely. How can they possibly do it for her? Even in 1995 it is impossible! This is true, but back in 1995 many people didn't even know what the internet was. I can see how it was a plot hole you could have accepted again. However, what is much more disastrous is the contradictions that nothing to do with technology. Of course, the movie hangs a lot on Hitchcock movies (it is one of those thrillers who play a fun night round), but Hitchcock always made sure his movies were credible. The characters did not act like confused maniacs trying to prove their innocence and the plot did not conveniently lay down for a structure where one obstacle inevitably led to the other. The characters also tried a bit before they kept the whole mourning rush. Did Bullock's character really have no friends so ever? Couldn't an old high school teacher confirm her identity? Or like ... her nearest pizza man? Oh right, she ordered pizza from the internet. Do not worry. You watch the movie pretty soon. There seems to be hope in an ex-boyfriend. Do you really think so? You should always count on at least ONE surprise. The internet offers nothing. <br /> <br /> The internet poses a lot of danger, this movie looks predicted. But if the movie is made today, present the problems that the villains have to go through to ensure identity defect. Not only should they do all the boring literal things, she will still have her Facebook membership, with at least 100 friends or so, and photos, and not to mention that they may be on YouTube or Linked-In, and what about her video blog with like 150 daily hits, or the webcams in her home and recorded video of her in other people's cell phones, webcams, web downloads ... her IMDb membership?
