Overall, the movie "Heart of Darkness" was miserable compared to the book. Anyone who has ever read the book and understood it adequately will be able to see many obvious errors. There is an immeasurable difference between the two. It seems to me that the director has been in a lost battle. I couldn't imagine anyone having the monstrous task of recreating "Heart of Darkness". The enormous detail and magic of the story will be impossible to interpret fairly. Conrad's story has so much low and so much depth that it seems senseless to try to make a visual interpretation. <br /> <br /> First, recording the details of the story is unattainable. The colossal fine points created by Joseph Conrad cannot be legitimately recreated through film. Marlow's feelings and emotions cannot be interpreted equally in the film. If you used the enormous task of tackling Conrad's work, you know as well that I wrote Conrad only half the story. The additional half is a series of connections made by the reader. You, as the reader is able to derive and connect Joseph Conrad's ideas. As a result, several important details are absent in the film. <br /> <br /> Even though the film was of sufficient length, the film looked. It seems that Conrad could pack more details in 75 pages than the movie could take in an hour and a half. The speed of the movie did not become the viewer of the characters unaware. Marlow was much more of a stranger. The point of view of the book puts you in Marlow's shoes. In the movie, however, you almost watch Marlow. I began to think the director was trying to use the same "read between lines" method as Conrad did. However, the compounds were weak. I know that if I didn't read the book, I couldn't understand the depth of the situation and the characters. <br /> <br /> Finally, Kurtz also misinterpreted. His role was short and the details were not all included. It was impossible to understand the true Kurtz to the extent that he was shown. An important detail in the book was that Kurtz became a god for the Afrikaners. I didn't think meaningful details were defined. Also in this book, Kurtz represents a sultry being. He died long ago. I believe the director understood this detail. Instead of recreating it, he just ran Kurtz and mumbled everything. In addition, the director seemed to have tried to make Kurtz mysterious, but instead he was completely unknown. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie reminds me of a teenage profession to complete a science project because of the next day. It seems to be effortless and in almost any time. The characters are alienated, important information omitted, and the central plot is lost in translation.
