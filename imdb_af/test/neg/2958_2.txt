The film starts with Ingrid Bergman and her two fiery servants arriving in New Orleans from Paris. Apparently earlier her mother was involved in a scandal and Ingrid returned in an attempt to irritate a friend who had previously forgotten that his or her mother had existed. That's because his reasons if they are shocked enough, they will pay her to get rid of her. Then, with this money, she is going to leave New Orleans and look for a millionaire somewhere else, as she is a Countess. Along the way, Gary Cooper shows up and looks completely out of place as a love affair. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that this movie was not the reason Ingrid Bergman's film career dropped - her performance and character was so bad! Instead of the elegant and female woman she usually played in movies, she is probably one of the most annoying characters in the movie. Her counterfeit Contessa was flat, demanding, unpredictable and stupefyingly dumb. How she was able to vampire any man was a mystery because she was less vocal than just ordinary nuts! I'm not exaggerated to say that she sometimes behaved like someone with a combination of a serious mental illness and a personality disorder. All this makes me think "who in the world would fall in love with this mess?" . Honestly, I couldn't stop looking at her histrionics and narcissistic behavior and she looked more like a guest at the Jerry Springer Show as a leading lady! Confusion, terrible and overworked are words that come to mind when I think of her role. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is frankly overwhelmed by Bergman's ranting and hysterical. While Gary Cooper is generally an excellent front man, he is dominated by her and looks just lost. And strangely, they throw two total weirdos as her entourage - Flora Robson and Jerry Austin. Me. Robson is best known for her portrayals of Queen Elizabeth I, but here, for some reason, they covered her in makeup and the end result looks much like the love child of a cigarette Indian and Tannie Jemima! Her face was very wood, she played strange eyebrows and she dressed like a slave. As far as Mr. Austin is concerned, he was a dwarf and although it should not be held against him, his role was written as if he were a court doctor - a very, very grateful role for someone vertically challenged! Overall, the rotting acting, writing and backwards makes this one of the great stinkers of the age - almost as useless and sowing like such famous turkeys as PARNELL and SWING YOUR LADY.
