I just watched this dramatic depressed drama and realized that, in view of recent dramas like this, the only ones that can be considered abnormal are those who are least aware that life is nothing more than tragic. I would guess how sobering defeat and counterproductive this conclusion is, even though relationships and views are similar to those presented in this movie. But instead I realized that these films made the determination of the great "tragedy" trivial when the same boring situations, the same suffocating dysfunctional families and friendships continue to play out, only they are over and over again in some kind tries to eliminate past distortions of family life (much of it in the 1950s and earlier with personality and character deviations ever made so subtle), and instead replaces it with the "reality" of what it really is. It is in fact no longer the dysfunctional, but it is a normal existence and sets circumstances that have actually existed, but which we were previously unaware of and thus ignored or at least ignored. denied. <br /> <br /> Only problem is that too many movies are trying to make this point. And by doing it in almost identical form. When I read the synopsis for the movie, I immediately thought of Ice Storm. Looking at the depressive life-style of the Travis family, which is repeatedly emotional, I immediately recalled American Beauty. And in some respects, the interactions between parents and middle child, Tim, I drew similarities to 'Igby Goes Down'. "Imaginary Heroes" can be a new experience, perhaps a refreshing one that is considered so for an honest character image that, as mentioned before, is often not allowed to exist in the films of the family (what is idiot to think anyway, as we are already seeing these types of relationships that already appeared in movies like 'Ordinary People' in 1980 and which go even further. But to the benevolent viewer, these movies can offer nothing new. Indeed, they have become a very tired testimony of too many filmmakers trying to perform the other, with the amount of trauma and apathy they can pack in one family (and this goes to neighbors and friends). In fact, 'Imaginary Heroes', the latest in this genre (I think there are plenty of movies to declare it a 'genre' accurate), so many disasters and surprises in one family, that they host a day's talk show host. This is the story of a family tested by the suicide of the eldest son, a talented and decorated swimmer who hated the sport with passion. The youngest son knew it, the father was in a fool and blinded by the pressure for competitiveness in his all-star star. And it is not clear that the mother and sister had much of a relationship with the young man. <br /> <br /> Admittedly, it's no less entertaining (to some extent, for those who are very fond of this material) and the performances are pretty good, especially by Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels. But I certainly hope that in the future, filmmakers want to add to the comments of struggling family relationships (which happen to be or may not always be the middle-class white suburban families) intending to provide something new with materials and insight. I will see no distinction (and therefore no purpose) differently.
