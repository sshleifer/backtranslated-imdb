I'm not one of the people who make every effort, a movie based on an old TV show comes out. I usually walk out and see it (If I watched the show) and try to get nostalgic. But if someone feels that movies are based on old shows, it's an exhibition A (So you can say something more than just "McHale's Navy"). "Mod Squad" is furious, tiring and fun. At least the original series was anxiety mystery long before anyone knew teenagers could be so glamorous, making it groundbreaking. It's just boring. Claire Danes is nice to look at, but does nothing but swing and sneak around to spy on the bad things. Giovanni Ribisi's acting scope in this movie is that Droopy the Dog looks for an hour and forty-five minutes. And Omar Epps seems to want to flee the set, but the essay by Chlostraphobia caught him. Sure, the production is nice, with the now seemingly mandatory rave nightclub opening action series and shooting in general. Oh, and the kids scream and get angry at each other and their superiors too. It's kind of like deciding to use the Scooby Doo Mystery Machine to go to Hollywood with a family vacation with your teenage years you and your spouse need, heavy therapy and prescriptions. I wanted to keep this movie, and there were promising moments, but the next scene would suck life out of it. You can beat another Spelling remake, "Charlie's Angels," whatever you want, but at least the movie knew it was going to have fun. "The Mod Squad" makes you wonder where the inspiration of the original series went.
