I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad. I'm surprised anyone took it seriously. Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys. The only merit here is that it's so lame, it's funny. Actually, for me, there is the added benefit of being shot in a state park, not far from where I live, so you'll see some local attractions on the big screen. The main character is an off-duty cop, and a big point to teach a good guy that vigilante justice is not just a bad idea, it's against the law. Imagine how long it takes ... <br /> <br /> Most of the movie's Northern California characters are blue-dried Hollywood cheese searches, which seem to have never been in battle. The story line is completely predictable. This movie is ripe for a MST-3K lampooning. Only CAMP value. I am nice forgiveness of movies in general, but I see the old positive reviews I had to speak. It's a dog. I give it a 3 out of 10, and then just for laughs.
