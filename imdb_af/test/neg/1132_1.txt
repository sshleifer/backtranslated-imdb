Who gave these people money to make a movie? There was nothing funny about it. The fact that the flying dog was the funniest thing about this disease says it all. First, it has nothing to do with Christmas, it just took the name and counted on all the people who liked the Chevy Chase original. They took Randy. I have no talent, I'm just a fat and sweaty pig. Quaid (the only wrong thing about part 1) and made a movie about him. There are only morons in his family, but not the 'Are they not cute' kinda moronies, but the 'do not touch me' kinda moronic. If you look at this pile of dirt, you can hope that everyone who participates in it is THEY! They didn't even bother to get the effects in order ... when they got on the boat, the only thing moving, the fake wallpaper ... when the Quaid pork is in the water you can tell by the lighting it in a studio. This film was sexist (Uncle Nick), racist (Uncle Nick) and never had to be made. More ... to throw the money into a volcano would have used so much more. <br /> <br /> Well, I hope I have reached some of you. No one warned me and now I have gone for life. Merry F * Cking Christmas
