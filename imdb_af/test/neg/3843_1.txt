I actually joined this site just to write about this movie. I sat in my lounge and this movie came to one of the local channels. I made it about an hour before I just had enough. Curious to see what general movie-like public thinking of this movie, I watched it on this site. I was absolutely shocked to see that there was an overwhelming amount of people who thought it was wonderful. I had to say, and here it is: This movie is absolute rubbish. It was a task to go through. The "jokes" were uninspired rehashes of others, better performances and movies, and Leguizamo's manic depiction of this indignant character should only appeal to the age of ten and below. It can actually be a stretch even for that age. I'm all for slapstick ridicule, but there's not even the worst tip of whiteness or smartness. I have an idea, let go of bad, uninspired, obvious jokes and play them at twice the speed. Now it's funny. Ha. Ha. <br /> <br /> Movies you should watch, take stupid humor and add comic timing and originality: The Marx Brothers A Night at the Opera, Monty Python's Meaning of Life, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, ... and the list goes on. Don't lose an hour and a half of your life on uncomfortable crap. <br /> <br /> By the way, I can only accept that the reason why David Bar Katz (the other author) is very little in film after This movie is because he is immediately blacklisted. I was actually impressed that Leguizamo could recover after this debris.
