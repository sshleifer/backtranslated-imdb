The movie Razor Blade Smile has an interesting title as well as starring. Now most may not like this movie for the plot and play, but it's a little cheap, but it's the appeal of a movie like Razor Blade Smile. In a way, it was supposed to be bad movie. <br /> <br /> But if you see this movie all the way through the end, you'll see it's like I said a cheap vampire movie with some humor. (Also, how they are manipulated colors in a few screens is very interesting.) <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie is a type you rent and laugh with your friends and enjoy it for what it is . Because no movie is very bad. <br /> <br /> As Lilith Silver says, "People just don't laugh enough ..."
