I didn't think Haggard was the funniest movie of all time, I love CKY and Viva La Bam much more. I think a lot of it was just really stupid and had no plot to be a movie. I strongly recommend not paying much money for this movie, but anyone who likes viva la bam, CKY or Jack Ass should see it. I loved many parts of the movie and then there were parts to be cut off. I think Jonny Knoxville had to play in the movie, because he is a much better actor, then most people of Haggard are probably the movie more fun. I think Ryan Dunn was probably the best actor and it had to have more kidding.
