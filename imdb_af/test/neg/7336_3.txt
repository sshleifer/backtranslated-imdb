First, let me mention the fact that, despite its title ("stories", in plural), there is only ONE kitchen story. On the question of whether Isaac is dead in the end, I am not so sure, since HIS PIPE is seen in one of the last screens next to the table next to the two cups. On the DVD cover there is a reference to Tati. It claims that the movie is 'très drulle: rappel Tati!' ("Very funny: reminiscent of Tati!" The great Jacques Tati relied mainly on mime and silent dead attitude to achieve his comic effects and his critical satirical view of his 1950s French "modern" society. Of course, "Kitchen" place in the 1950s and it offers some (rather vague) satirical references to the absurdities of bureaucracy and there are a few long moments where no words are spoken - but they are not really funny. "Kitchen" to make a "Tatiesque" movie - I must admit that "kitchen" is the sometimes false objectivity of scientific research towards the truth of human subjective emotions. , with nothing much happening - with hardly a dramatic impulse: the parts concerned were the setup during the first 15 minutes or so and during the last ha For an hour or so. as - FINALLY !!! - interesting and moving. It may seem like a short topic, less than an hour, stretched out to about 90 minutes. Now, about the setup (a scientific observation of the behavior of single men in their kitchen): it was initially very promising - with the maps of the arrival and secretions of bachelors in their kitchen as a way to determine which new inventions are most useful would be up. But very quickly, this premise seemed to be just a prologue, an excuse to propose the real topic that was just fully developed to the end, and that was about loneliness and the valuable bond of friendship. Sorry! I honestly wanted to keep that movie. Yes, it was so promising when I heard of some of his unusual little anecdotes - which was indeed there and what I enjoyed - like burning a man's rhino (instead of using a pair of scissors cut) the «investment» to stack a large amount of «valuable» black pepper stacked, the roll reversal (the perceived being), a man's mouth sending sound from a radio program . And there is also a sick horse that becomes the catalyst of a semi-stolen human despair, the relative importance of right or left-hand drive in Sweden and Norway (a reflection of the importance for each of these many neighboring countries to confirm its individuality ?). Am I the only person who didn't fully enjoy that movie? Does that necessarily mean I'm wrong? Perhaps it is almost generally priced, "fine points" was actually too subtle for me? Perhaps ... My individual views on this movie may, ironically, reflect the essence of the movie itself - which would be the need to have the right to disagree, to confirm your individuality and not to blindly the tendencies and opinions of society. not follow? Each of us has the right to have different personal views and not be a slave to the demands of the bread-winning "dictatorial" claims: often we have other alternatives that each of us can help our society while one's inner being respect principles. In short, be true to yourself - the way in which the film ends Folke (Isaac's scientific observer) by giving up his work while he prefers to stay in his new friend Isaac's house and help him with the tasks of his farm ... And so, "Vive la différence", as the French say!
