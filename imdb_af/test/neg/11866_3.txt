Yes, this is your typical live video action movie. And of course they do their best to change it a bit, but they fail miraculously. Snipes delivers his perfect blatcher he always does. Colloca proves that you don't need talent to die in a movie, but just call on sex. The worst part is that it doesn't cover my bad movie basics which is: 1 ?? Cheap looking villains. 2 ?? Completed one-liners. 3 ?? Intense motor hunt with huge explosions. 4 ?? The hero joins the hot chick. 5 ?? A lot of naked or slim-dressed women for no reason. OK, so I lied, it covers it, but it makes it so terrible.
