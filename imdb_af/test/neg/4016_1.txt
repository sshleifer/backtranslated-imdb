An "independent" movie that promises promises, adventures and an emotional adventure from the back of the box will never be forgotten. This film also seduces us to watch it by starring Rachel Lee Cook. After the first twenty minutes you realize that this movie won't give you anything. The story goes on purposefully and reveals nothing new or important to us. All three "disturbed" characters only have small grains of back story that force us to care. Just as you reach the end, everything is changed about the story, and instead of catching up with the audience, you're without any idea, and more importantly, no interest in "why." The director, who also thought it would be a good idea to die together, appears to be in the film without any previous experience or knowledge of useful films. The whole piece looks like a college "art" film made by a new film student trying to hide a lack of real talent.
