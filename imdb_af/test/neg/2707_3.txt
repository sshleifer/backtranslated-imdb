The laugh is far and wide in this dull movie, and I can't help but wonder how this mess was ever made in the first place. The only good thing in this movie is the talent of Griffin Dunne, but his best efforts are easily overshadowed by Madonna's stupid performance. I could sit through this without getting bored, but it's probably the most beautiful thing I can say about this time warmer.
