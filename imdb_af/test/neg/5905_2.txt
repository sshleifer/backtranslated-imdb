This movie starts with the main character in a coma in a hospital section, attended by two orders. The subconscious character is heard in a voice saying the orders are gay. The orderly kiss. I watched it in a DVD version and I suspect it's supposed to be funny ?? That said, "Comedy" on the DVD case, and so it goes on. If I saw it in a movie, I would probably have heard that part of the audience was screaming with laughter because it was so funny and because they were supposed to be in a comedy. While it's fascinating to think about what it's funny and what isn't, this movie unfortunately only delivers arguments about what. Brilliant brain MAKES Anything funny, like Ernst Lubitsch, Billy Wilder or Mel Brooks, has proven this. But you have to know the mechanics, "I suppose. Director and co-author Dani Levy doesn't bother about that mechanics, he thinks some things are simply funny, the fact that two orders are gay and for example a man in a coma kiss. "Don't get me wrong, some people can make it funny, Dani Levy can't, not me. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I have with this movie is that I'm not a reason can't see the way the main characters behave, I couldn't understand why the two brothers, one of orthodox Jewish from West Germany, were so strong in third-class carbon copy of Fast Eddie Felson from former East Germany They are both mere characters, their children are boring apart from being sexually attracted to each other (Well, one is lesbian but raises the daughter she has with her cousin), but even this turbulent relationships, if it is something that embarrasses them, come only as an excuse, because the writers could do nothing better. <br /> <br /> The acting is not bad, Udo Semel. I actually looked very much alike, although he reminds me more of Chancellor Helmut Kohl (a lighter version) than of a venerable Orthodox Jew. The direction in itself is not really bad either, but Levy may have to stick to the direction of movies, so the writing is conveyed to someone else. Now I heard he did a comedy about Hitler. Oi, Vai!
