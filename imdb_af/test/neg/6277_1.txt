I wish I could have given it a zero. Certainly, I will admit that I have also accidentally chosen it because it was the Spielberg version. A smart marketing ploy releases it at this time and is prominently displayed in the video store. However, I was willing to give it anyway - I wish I didn't. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? I read some of the other reviews here and have to say that I disagree with anyone who thinks any of the acting was good. Sorry, even C. Thomas Howell stank. None of the performances was good. Not one. <br /> <br /> Even if the play was decent, the dialogue is terrible! "Ginormus" and "Dick Skinners" don't really cut it. <br /> <br /> Now, as far as the story is concerned, it was terribly adapted and had to be edited by a 5-year-old. The main character is constantly in convenient situations - or at least as a result of how the film is composed. For example, he is trying to get to a place called New Hope to find his brother. During a short break someone randomly gives him directions to New Hope. What is hell? When he comes to New Hope, he just happens to be on his dying brother. Then there is the part where he has been away from his destination for days and just happened to come over the car where his wife and son entered. He went in a different direction, then how did the car end up where he was? He has a black backpack that appears randomly and disappears throughout the film. There are parts of the movie where the characters only wake up in the morning and then two seconds later it is night - or worse still dusk the next day. Nor can I forget the main character, and the preacher does not fall through the floor of a house for any reason - we do not even know that a stranger landed on the house later. What reminds me of the moment they walked and suddenly found themselves under a stranger did not notice them. As for hell, the aliens are like two stories long with big bodies and multiple legs - how can they miss it? There is one point where a stranger kills an eternal citizen, presumably by spitting a little junk on him - but you never see the things flying, but only appears on the guys' face. The special effects in general are terrible. The whole movie is like a bad train wreck. When we finally get to the end, after this man tries to get DC to find his family, they just appear. No one is looking to ask questions. Just oh there you are, I'm so happy. The end. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry if my review has been slightly affected, but this movie was so bad that I organized my contempt hard. Save yourself the time and don't look at this sneakily showing stack of movie stench. It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I'd rather get a root canal - it would have been less painful.
