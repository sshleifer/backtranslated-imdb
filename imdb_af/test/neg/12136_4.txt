can someone please help me, I missed the last moments and I don't want to pay money to see the whole movie again. I just got where they were in the train wagon, and she said, "What is it going to drink now?" and smile. what happens next? Is there more dialogue or action? surely it doesn't just end there? I was a bit bored in the movie and hoped it would get better. I love Kristen Scott Thomas does anyone remember the British TV series she had in about a few nuns? I want to know the name. Sean Penn was brilliant Madonna eats your heart! Everyone else in fact made the movie a little predictable, it was a 'place a star pouring'. the end surprised me, I really thought she was burning her boats ... if you're a fan of any of the stars worth watching.
