The Bermuda Triangle, which we are told in this waste of celluloid, is the gateway to a different time and dimension and can be crossed using cheap special effects by bad actors spitting unnecessary dialogue. <br /> <br /> I simply couldn't decide who the creators of this looking mind would be his target audience, as it seems impossible, anyone can even get a pleasure from the outcome. Avoid - it's not even bad enough to be good.
