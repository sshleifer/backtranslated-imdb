I caught this movie a few years ago, and it was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. But since it's supposed to be an action movie, I can't give it any more stars, as the humor was unintentional. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris plays a truck driver coming home to see his family, and within the first five minutes, Chuck's conflict leads to revenge for the rest of the film. Good thing too, 'cuz the sub-par that was involved by everyone started to grow very fast quickly. Actually, the judge was pretty good, but I really can't describe what makes him work, but you should investigate it yourself. <br /> <br /> And the custom Van Chuck Norris drives are spectacularly classic!
