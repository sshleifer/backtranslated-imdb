I congratulated online reviews for abandoning this dark outing as a combination of gory horror, spicy black comedy and frontier art house; The movie has all three elements of all three, but they are serving such a stupid performance (the title immediately gives away the game)? and amateur production to start ?? that its long-term neglect due to lack of proper distribution? In fact, Cult Epics picked it up for the release of DVD a full 30 years after its inception! ?? was not a big loss for cinema or even the genre (s). The bed is apparently created for the purpose of accommodating a devil's dalliance with a woman; Anyway, a dying man who used the poster and even painted it, stuck in the wall behind the canvas (!) And gives continuous comment on the 'action'. Several people (from teens to flight to gangsters in hiding) provide feed to the ever-hungry bed; Newest on the menu is a trio of girls ?? However, one of them remembers his mistress long ago and, consequently, the bed apparently scares her! See several items? From cigars to pieces of fried chicken? and people are swallowed (the stomach of the bed is portrayed as a barrel of honey-colored liquid) sometimes makes the film almost amusing (especially when a young man's hands are reduced to their skeleton formation, which he rather prefers to take easily into his speed !), but also terribly repetitive ?? so that the whole senseless exercise, even in a short 77 minutes, feels tense and straight desperate.
