Even according to the standards of most B movies, this movie is by far the worst I have ever seen. The graphics are so poor that a man in a monster suit looks more realistic. The ocean water effects are especially lazy, including the one scene where they control the mini sub, and the "water" seems to be frozen in place. The trouble with this movie is so much that I'll just stop with the details here. Needless to say, I don't baby you when I say that even your Toilet Boll could do a better job. Avoid this movie at all costs, there are other B-grade movies out there, which are, after all, terrible, at least a good way to pass the time.
