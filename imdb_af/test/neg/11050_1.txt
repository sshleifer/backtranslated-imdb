This movie was very simple and simple. It will probably be respected by those who only see "movies" and not "movies", and so I will feel sorry for having such a limited understanding of the theater scene of this movie, but I'm safe enough to do it. says this boring, self-conscious and painfully stretched movie was a waste of two hours and nine dollars. <br /> <br /> I was suckered to see it through the inexplicable good reviews it received and thought from the theater that the reviews had been written by over-excited film students and the aforementioned group of regular movie use, perhaps for fear that they might one day enjoy one. <br /> <br /> The storyline is quite a promising one - a man has been jailed for 15 years and never knew his prisoner or his crime. He is then suddenly released and given only five days to discover the identity and reason of the man who has captured him. However, the big concept is soon dissolved in a pathetic joke, as Oh Dae-Su runs to hit people, try sex with a young girl trying to use the toilet and eat a live, writhing squid ( presumably for dramatic effect, because there is absolutely no other reason for it). He's already trying this horrible thing he did to earn fifteen years in prison, and when he finally finds out, it's ridiculous and a great fall. His nemesis, a man who allegedly went to school with him when he was a young man, looks like a banana republic model twenty years younger than him. Hey, I know prison is hard on Oh Dae-Su, but is it too much to ask to find an actor who looks a little closer to his age? Of all the things that are wrong with this movie, this one looks the easiest one. <br /> <br /> And the big secret - the one that kept me in my seat for 90 minutes when I could have been something productive - is a joke of a plot line that includes incest and a rumor begins in high school. Come on! Do we throw a bone here - was it really the best they could do? I sat through silly dialogue, overworking, gloomy sets and free violence for this? (Incidentally - I'm not against violence in a movie if it seems to fit the story, but I seem to have been forced to see our hero stick out the front teeth of someone and his own tongue with a ' a pair of scissors to guide me to find me, I spilled my afternoon and a pretentious piece of garbage.) Take my advice - do something different with your time and money. Or take your nine dollars and go see a low "movie" - one you might actually enjoy.
