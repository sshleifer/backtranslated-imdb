This tortuous story of gang revenge is simply not very interesting, even with Ed McMahon in a ripe role as the head heavy. Jim Brown kicks effective ass, Gloria Hendry proves she can bring the poorest even the poorest roles, and Brock Peters is decent as the cop playing at the book. It's still dull and poorly built, and even the pressure shown on the cable is now being emasculated from its original James Brown score.
