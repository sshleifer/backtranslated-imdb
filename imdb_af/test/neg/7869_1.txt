Best Movie Director: <br /> <br /> In the future, when you try to create a sense of urgency, it's best to have your hero * run * instead of jog / shuffle. Especially if you are trying to strengthen a timeline. For example, if you try to convince the audience that the bad man will really kill the hostage if the hero does not find her, then it is probably a good idea to give the feeling that your hero believes it can actually happen ... Let's see it all. Of course, making a good movie is not your goal. Your goal was to pump garbage that would make more money than it costs. Otherwise you may have hired some actors. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Bored Viewer. <br /> <br /> It's the worst movie I've ever seen. I can't say it's the worst because I could finish it. It was bad, bad, bad but bad. Dude, where's my refund?
