Anyone who thinks that Kool Moe Dee, Carol Alt and Corey Feldman are a list of good actors, should smoke something I would like to try. Where to start: lousy soundtrack, hammy acting, "action" in places. It is the typical amateurishly written hack feed that has been washed, and never was the love to die. I actually embarrassed the "stars" in this "movie". The only thespian missing at the end of this maze was Gary Coleman, who, if he'd been in the movie, would at least make it a bit hateful, rather than just bad. <br /> <br /> There was one part In the movie where Carol Alt shouted, "Do you think I'm an idiot?!?" Yes, Carol, I do, do your agent, and PLEASE for the love of everything that is decent and sacred ... GO GO AND STOP YOURSELF! This movie is something Anna Nicole Smith would take part in. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you what the plot was, but it would be one more point to this article, plus my thoughts have often driven during the movie. Anyway, so I barely paid attention.
