I would give it a zero if they had that rating. Fun wasn't fun at all. I got tired of the movie for about ten minutes, but thought at the end that it had to be better. It didn't. The others I watched on this movie also agreed. The acting was annoying. I'm tired of Jim Carey's about the topam trading. The supporting role was not better. While this movie was a statement of corporate greed and the condition of the worker being attacked when a big company went under, the vehicle would have worked better for it. I didn't really like the leading characters (Dick and Jane) so much that their fianc√© was never funny but pathetic. I try to remember one scene where I or someone with whom I was laughing and not. A worthless movie and a total waste of time.
