This movie is terrible. Initially I thought it might appeal to kids because of the cuddly Ewoks, the rage, the little people of Stars Wars. After putting this monster off a movie, I'm sure not even a 4 year old will find this movie interesting. The special effects are by far the best of this movie and compare well to other 80-year-old TV movies. The script is bad, the actors, especially Aubree Miller and incredibly bad and the movie is so predictable that I still can't believe I couldn't hit the forward button on my video recorder. However, I came close to eliminating this mess more than once.
