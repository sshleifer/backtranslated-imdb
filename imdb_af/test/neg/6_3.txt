A hard sell: British playwright Ronald Harwood adjusts his autobiographical stage drama into a harsh, bulging movie about World War II's Shakespeare Scene which, in turn, features an old, blustery, brilliant but unreliable star at the end of his teeth anointed. Actor assistant assistant works diligently to get his master and bought for a production of King Lear (during an Air Raid!), But both men lose their grip on their unraveling situation. Based on the declining years of actor Donald Wolfit, whose dresser Ronald Harwood was, this proclaimed production would be a welcome haven for the cold thespians. Unfortunately, Albert Finney (at this stage of his career, not the elderly at all) seems too strong and quick to think of the actor; Finney (and Oscar-nominated director Peter Yates) cannot modulate Sir's moods and controversies of coherence in a way that makes sense to us, so that at one stage he stops a train with the transfer of his voice and in the next he is strangely falling apart. With such a man's wreck in the midst of lack of health and skill, one would assume that a dedicated assistant would largely go to protect his boss (and his future), but servant Tom Courtenay rather than rest . Courtenay, who played this role on stage (and was nominated for an Oscar with Finney for Best Actor), is much more focused on his role, and eventually his only lack of action and confusion becomes the only true feeling in the film. These two, thank you, do not peek at each other's heads, and scenario artist Harwood is careful not to fall into a love-hate pattern (which may be considered in the film's first act); But without an assault by a servant against a known person, there is nothing to see in this portrait, except for the degradation of narcissism, the hint of what was once. * 1/2 of ****
