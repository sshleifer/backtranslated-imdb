I'm BOUT IT (1997) <br /> <br /> Developed and published by No Limit Movies <br /> <br /> >> For: Absolutely no <br /> <br /> >> Disadvantages: I know not even where to start! <br /> <br /> Plot summary: Master P plays a drug dealer who looks, speaks and acts more like a live action cartoon character. It's all the plot I got from this movie. <br /> <br /> Overview: I remember when I was in the ninth grade during his release and everyone in my class praised this clown known as Master P. This movie is so bad, it's not even funny. All the characters in this movie are extremely tired stereotypes, the sound is only audible when music is playing, and the movie looks like it's been publicly accessed. Fortunately, I didn't buy this movie like all my other city-degenerate classmates. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1 out of 10 <br /> <br /> My pronunciation: Avoid this video as she is a sexually transmitted disease.
