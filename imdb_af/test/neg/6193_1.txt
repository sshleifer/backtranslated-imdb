let me first say that I was a great carlin fan in the past. I think george is one of the smartest people and best comedians on the planet. What made George so great in the past was his ability to look at things in his own way and give us his unique perspective on those things. It wasn't always meant to be funny, but you always respected his opinions because they were presented in such a clever way. But you are all sick is just a long rant. He doesn't give us a unique perspective on anything, he just gives us a long list of things he played. There is no insight, no cleverness, just an old man who complains about things we've been complaining about for an hour. And, moreover, it wasn't even funny. you are all sick, appealing to stupid people who can handle nothing more advanced than anything simple and direct. I don't mind, anger has fueled comedy, but george could have done so much better. I really hope George Carlin's next performance will meet the quality George has shown in the past.
