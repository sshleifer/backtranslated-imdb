I found the first 90 minutes of this movie to be very interesting, although some were ridiculous (Philip Seymour Hoffman's character). The last 60 minutes were unpleasant and I lost interest in the movie. The last hour lasted forever. It seemed. <br /> <br /> The movie is beautifully activated and I can see why Rene Zellweger won an Oscar because her character was so interesting. The film is also beautifully filmed and the story is an emotional one. However, I found that the message is a bad one: it's not surprising in Hollywood. In this story, "Inman" (Jude Law) desert the Confederate Army during the Civil War. His reason: his girlfriend misses him and wants him home. He is also disillusioned with the war. (Can you imagine whether any soldier who was in a similar boat left the army in the two world wars!) <br /> <br /> Of course, in this movie everything is perfectly acceptable. Which Liberal filmmaker has ever had a nice thing to say about the US military? To add to their left-hand side, they display a vigilante-like posture that goes into disarray as cold-blooded murderers go. Well, in the world of movies, as we know, well portrayed as bad and bad is good ..... and only liberals would portray deserters as heroes.
