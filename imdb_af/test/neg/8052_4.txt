I only looked at Kindred in 1987, along with another movie called "Waves". I remember back and I both hated them and I never really bothered to look at them again. <br /> <br /> But I recently started a crusade to collect as many as 80 horror titles in their original boxing form. It has been removed for some time. I have a rather proud collection with many more titles on my list! <br /> <br /> The Kindred, although I haven't received a copy yet, has high priority, since all the old movies I didn't keep before, I now own and now look and think again is brilliant and the bits I remember about the Kindred now drive me to get a copy as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> Hurray for the 80s and long life horror!
