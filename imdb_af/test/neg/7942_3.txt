The opening scene keeps me from absolute zero. I wish the whole movie was just as eager and actually like the intro. <br /> <br /> To enjoy some movies, many can be forgiven. (Handguns with 60 shots, hero's with superhuman powers, all women are beautiful AND half-naked), but Puuulleeeese this "Attack on My Intelligence 13" has been so accomplished that I was surprised that the film arrived for a second day of filming. <br /> <br /> First, how did these guys become policemen? Based on stupidity, I think. How do the main characters justify being half-naked in Detroit mid-winter or wherever they are. In fact, no character responds to the elements whatsoever in this movie. No windows, no electricity (which miraculously inexplicably returns) during the storm of the century and they are all comfortable as insects in a carpet. Which technology eliminates all cell phones, radios and brain function. It must have the same power, which means that Maria Bella can walk deep in snow with no dress and almost any dress from her disabled car.
