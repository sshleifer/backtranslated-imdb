Maybe I'm just a simple person, but I prefer movies that somehow care for people in them. I couldn't care less about anyone in this movie. It was supposed to be a comedy? Perhaps the humor was too subtle for me (to the nano level). The thing about it, it missed so many things. There were characters that could have been funny, but they weren't. There were characters you could have had, but you didn't. For example, the man who thought the Beatles had ripped his songs. There was so much potential there, but all he did was like a Beatle and complaining about how they counted him out. Haha. And the previous poster talked about the 'I am the Walrus' scene as if it were special. What? He played and sang on an old piano 'I'm the Walrus'. Is there an inside joke there? It certainly appreciated family. This movie feels like a movie people say they love because it sounds "intellectual" or "hip" to say you like it, that you get the whole metaphysical art / rubbish message the artist expresses. If you want to be entertained, stay away.
