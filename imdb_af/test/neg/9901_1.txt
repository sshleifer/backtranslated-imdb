What a mess - and I'm not referring to the "destruction" in the title. I can go further on the chopped plot, the eternal consequences, the (actually notable) grimacing if they deliver the worst lines of their careers, etc. I'll just say there were no palm trees in Chicago the last time I checked in and let it go. <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... needs ten lines to get it on IMDb. Well, I think a DVD edition with excerpts can be interesting. Perhaps Dennehy will reveal what kind of favor it has called for to appear in this case. Perhaps Dianne Weist will show us the bag of money to get her involved. Maybe CBS will excuse excuses ...
