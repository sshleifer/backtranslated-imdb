I literally ran to watch it, expecting a movie that made me cry or touch my heart. <br /> <br /> What I found was not heartbreaking, but a lame exploitation of a strong human character. /> Interwined between a few young lesbians and an obese man. <br /> <br /> In a substantially uncovered environment, not to mention the most common. <br /> <br /> It wasn't quite BAD, as I saw the worst - and I left the theater $ 10 poorer but wiser - that a well-advertised FILM is not the same as a MOVIE WELL MADE.
