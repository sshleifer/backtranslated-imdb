A good friend of mine said, "A monkey is funny, anytime, anywhere." There is one exception to this: GOING BANANAS. It's simply the WORST MOVIE I've ever seen. It is worse than PLAN 9, worse than the BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS. It's terrible. The talk monkey stone is about three minutes old, and I believe it's all there is. Make sure you have a lot of people to revive you after you go to TOXIC SHOCK in GOING BANANAS, the worst movie ever.
