** SPOILERS ** The killer in the movie does not wait a moment as we see him sleeping in a girl's shower and slamming her in the heel and taking her cut and bloody arm while breathing away. We then get this official search prologue, as if a true story is being watched, stating that a number of gruesome murders were committed in a small mid-western collage in the late autumn of 1985. Grandfather, Sheriff Ron Delboys is banned by this murder and later as the murders of local collage students, all women, continue to jeopardize his run for the state's senator, the investigation is being initiated at every turn. There are at least twice when Delboys says they will never again be a murder, as long as he is on the case and within a few minutes another murder happens. <br /> <br /> finding a golden amulet at the scene of every murder the sheriff's daughter, collage librarian, Tina finds this reference book on Withcraft indicating that the amulet is a symbol of a witch cult originated in the early 1700s just after the Salem gate trials. This cult was out to avenge the 19 accused witches hanged by local villagers in 1692. They went out at night and slaughtered men and women and pulled off with a body part. When the body parts form a complete person, they will be burned in an occult midnight bonfire ritual. <br /> <br /> You never get a handle that exactly happens in the movie "Bloodcult", not just because it's completely incompatible. story, but it's ever more scandalous and primary school course, especially by Charles Ellis who plays bottle finger sheriff Ron Delboys. To make himself more difficult, even the assassin could get him. The bumbling Sheriff Delboys ends with his head brushed spiked coffee and burned almost alive, after it was dissolved. The only reason he was not was because he dreamed it, while under the influence of a strong and unnamed drug. <br /> <br /> There is a strange dream sequence in the movie suggesting that a number of highly respected community members are members of the Witches Cult responsible for the murderers. The movie does not have to be declared as the dream, which the drunk Sheriff Delboys had, was a dream, or was actually a real experience by dropping the whole thing as if it had been cut out of the movie! <Br /> <br /> Getting out of the hospital and pushing out the collage sorority house, while a bag of McDonald Cheeseburgers comes apart, Sheriff Delboys finally comes face to face with the murderer. Shefiff Delboys finds out from his shock and surprise that he not only knows who he or she is, but he is also prepared to escape the murderer! <br /> <br /> The first straight to the video film and show it. Not only would anyone not be their right mind, it would be enough to give in, at least with the video you can tie it to. Thank you, God, for seeing this disaster, but no owner of a movie house will risk it on their screen without tearing the danger of the angry patrons, in a righteous display of righteous indignation!
