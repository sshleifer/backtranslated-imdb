I had to know when I heard that Anne Rice had left the project that the movie would disappoint me. I couldn't have predicted that years after it was released, just thinking about the movie, still make me angry. The novels are incredible, and while I understand that many are lost in translation to the screen, this movie was a great middle finger for her original work. One day I hope someone tries again, the right way, start with The Vampire Lestat. They change the roles and look of big and minor characters for no good reason. They destroy Lestat's history. The queen's acting is exaggerated to the point of comedy, but I can't just laugh. The charm and enjoyment of the novels is just not there. The movie is a bad excuse to catch up with as many musicians and dark footage as possible in a movie, hoping that America's teenage boys will upload it. Part of the appeal of the first film, Louis's story, is that he is caught between his humanity and his curse. Lestat is supposed to take over and display the vampire world's magic and excitement. Thanks, I first read the books, or I never touched them after this movie.
