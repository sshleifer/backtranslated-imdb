What I liked best about this movie was the chance to see Joan Woodbury, who upset me as one of the various beauties in the Charles Boyer classic "Algiers" in a leading role. She does well like Rita, an orphan who rises up to make good as a woman crime boss. Her rise to the top reminds me of Joan Crawford's characters, e.g. Mildred Pierce, realizing their ambitions with keen determination and willpower. If you're looking for a movie noir classic, look better elsewhere. On several points it is difficult to know where this story goes. For the first time I got the impression that it would include Rita's plot for revenge against the father and son who got her in the rap for a drunken driving death committed by the playboy boy. But repayment time has just become a tad, and a springboard to the somewhat confusing second part of the movie, where Rita is increasingly involved in city corruption. Anyway, it's just 72 minutes, so a second show should be unclear. My copy comes from a Platinum box called "Mobster Movies". The picture quality is good, but the soundtrack sucks, constantly keeps fragments of the dialogue. There are eight movies in the $ 5.50 box, making each movie a fair 69 cents. Look for Anne Archer's father, John Archer, as Rita's childhood Bob. Alan Ladd doesn't get much screen time. It's definitely Joan Woodbury's picture.
