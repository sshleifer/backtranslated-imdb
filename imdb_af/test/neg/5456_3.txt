The use of "astral projection" to exist outside the body, with the result that the terrible death (which causes the inside of the victims who break the spine and broken organs) strikes those close to one with such ability, is the threat of ETERNAL EVIL, which gives Karen Black (.. like Janus) with another "unique" character to tire Paul Sharpe (Winston Rekert) for a deviant marriage with a woman who influences a commercial director dull career. In fact, she dies and has his body, her spirit potentially harmful to his wife and son. His son has a "special friend" who speaks to him, even poisoning him at one point. A detective, Kauffman (John Novak), investigates the unusual murder of those killed by the benevolent spirit, linking Paul to death and revealing Janus by Janus. Soon both realize that Janus should be stopped or she will just go to another human host. What Paul doesn't know is that his new secretary is Janus's lover. Both are actually older intellectuals who are in his documentary astral projection called WANDERING SOUL. <br /> <br /> Director George Mihalka (My Bloody Valentine) definitely creates a strange atmosphere with this movie that contains a bit of strange performance. Paul's son seems to be moving the spirit in the form of a "blue man" who manipulates the child into disorderly behavior. Black, despite the star treatment, is rarely shot near and is used by her face which can cause the type of malicious harm to her character warranties. Instead, she was shot from afar, called her voice, and she never puts her right with the proper threat that I believe was an opportunity. For some reason, despite the intriguing (as oddball) idea of ​​astral projection that causes a spirit to kill people from within, the film never takes off. The soundtrack is very "Yanni-ish" and the lighting (and sound), while sometimes moody and effective, it is often very dark. The pacing is also a problem, like the story of the mules. The cast is pretty slack, especially in anticipation, its performance is volatile, at its best. It does not help that there are few characters (except Paul's wife) who could give us less, and what really hurts is that Paul himself is not exactly the most beloved person in the world. It can be very difficult and Moody, his unfulfilled career is a reason for such behavior. Swart had to be a more prominent figure in the film, but she mostly stays in the background, talking about the dialogue between Paul and Kauffman, but rarely gets the opportunity to entertain us with her histrionics, which is a pity.
