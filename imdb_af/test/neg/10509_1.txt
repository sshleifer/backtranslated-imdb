This movie almost made me cry. <br /> <br /> For the start of the false teeth. Then you see a nice plastic or drawn set. To make it even more boring, all the action is followed by a bright flash. Then the noise levels speak so differently, sometimes too loudly, then too softly, never exactly as good movies. Also, it echoes so much that I think they have one microphone on the whole set. And to make things worse, EARTER heard of stereo? If the camera is switched, the sound will always remain centered. The actors speak as they read of a board standing behind the camera. And the hem in another scene, how terribly childish. <br /> <br /> The music was chosen so badly that it never added anything. It just destroys an accidental excitement. <br /> <br /> To complete this, the fighting ... will make my 3 year old cousin a better fighting scene. <br /> <br /> This movie is not even good for a laugh, it's just as bad.
