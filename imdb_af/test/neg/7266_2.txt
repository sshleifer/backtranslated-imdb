What can I say about the PLEASURE PLANET that I haven't said about many other boring soft core porn movies yet? Very little . It's just another movie with a very poor plot used to compile many unconvincing plays between male non-actors who spend too much time in the gym and bimbos that naturally have silicone implants. Actually, the sex scenes in this movie are somewhat less convincing than you usually see in this type of movie, as the popular members grind their hips, giving painful expressions, as they have constipation or something. No wonder many people claim that sex has been exceeded, they probably watched too many of these movies at late-night cable stations
