The other Boleyn Girl - not confused with the book he claims to be based on. This movie is not even close to a faithful adaptation. I could understand that they changed or worked out on a few things. The book is not perfect, but it was well written and became very popular. I could understand whether the BBC wanted to make it a little more faithful to what actually happened, who Anne Boleyn really was - but it's not even close to historically accurate. It's just fluff. Mindless, made fluff. A real shame. <br /> <br /> Initially, the author and director seemed to be a good idea to compile the story because it was a reality program. Seriously. They put the Boleyns in front of the camera and confessed how they really felt about what was happening in their lives. Anne Boleyn sits in a confession (not the church type, the Real World kind) and chooses what she wants to tell and what she just wants to sit and smile. She seems stupid to use such a modern film in a movie that takes place in the 1500s. This is "The Real World: Tudor England!" <br /> <br /> Jodhi May is a very good actress and after "The Aristocrats" and "A Turn of the Screw" I became a real fan of her. But she should never have been like Anne. Actually, I think she would have been a better Maria. Natascha McElhone was a poor choice. She is a good actress, but she has many modern features and does not seem convincing in the costume. (Honestly, I spent the first half of the movie trying to find out if she was the "Truman Show".) She's too old to play the teenage Mary, for some unknown reason. Mary made the eldest of the sisters. It doesn't make sense, I know. It's like the BBC seems to forget that these people actually lived. They turn the story around and make things left and right. I feel ridiculous to fix the BBC on historical inaccuracies, but really! <br /> <br /> Apart from the two sisters, the rest of the cast was actually very well chosen. Steven Mackintosh struck me as a brilliant choice for George, and his decisive was the reason why I decided to pick this movie out. Big mistake. He does a good job, but he is almost not here. How can anyone pretend to fit the other Boleyn Girl and hardly call George Boleyn? It's just absurd. Philip Glenister was another very good decision-making decision, but again it was scarce in the final product. <br /> <br /> The real problem with this is the writing. There just isn't to get it. It's bad. It's really very bad. It's too melodramatic and not tempting. Anne is portrayed as an airhead, Mary as the chief and George as the follower. Mary's first husband is almost mentioned, her relationship with the king is never explained - they simply don't tell the story Phillippa Gregory wrote. The whole thing comes as a huge waste. I have no desire to see this thing a second time. I think I will only have to read the book again and hope that the Natalie Portman version coming out next year will be much better. <br /> <br /> * Note: This writing is the only way to get it. Miniseries in the US are on the last slide of the miniseries 'The Six Wives of Henry VIII.' It's a good miniseries, but can cost $ 50 to $ 60 and it's too much to spend if you're just looking for this piece of garbage.
