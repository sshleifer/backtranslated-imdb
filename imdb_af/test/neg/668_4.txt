Well, let's be realistic about this. No one is going to be placed in a movie by WWE Films (whose owner has challenged God with a wrestling), directed by a former porn director (the man gave the world the Interim Trilogy), with a wrestler named Kane , head and expect some cut art on a golden dish. If you do, you probably have to find something different than watching movies to occupy your time. <br /> <br /> So what can we expect from such a movie? Well, I'm looking forward to: <br /> <br /> 1) Bad acting. 2) A fairly non-existent, clich√© storyline. 3) Canes that roam with a crunchy, acidic face indicating its nostrils just a month ago found the potato salad. 4) Tons and tons of gore. <br /> <br /> Well, if you are hungry for some "so bad fun" entertainment, then it can satisfy your appetite because it delivers on all points. <br /> <br /> It is clear that movies like this are best seen for free, but if you choose to offer boxing dollars, then you have a little fun and make a game out. The filmmakers are nice enough to introduce us to each of the annoying criminals by flashing their names and legal offenses. This makes it easier for you to write down what you want to kill and in what order. You and your friends can see whose predictions are the most accurate. <br /> <br /> I also suggest that you and your parents write down every moment of stupidity and turmoil you can find. Pull them to the end and see who gets the most out. I think my grand total was 107; can you beat that? Personally, I want to know how the abandoned hotel has electricity, running water and a working lift after 35 years and a fire? <br /> <br /> I know, I know, the filmmakers accept that if you pay to see it, you obviously don't have to think much about what you spend your money and probably won't think much about how stupid the movie is. is not, but that doesn't mean we can't point it out and laugh <br /> <br /> I also like how the city wants to change this big hotel (which would be condemned and recommended for demolition by any sensible inspector) in a homeless shelter and they think the best way to get it. was cleaned to give eight punks a few mops and brooms. Uh-huh. <br /> <br /> I think you know pretty much what to expect, but I feel the need to give you some warnings. First, if you hate crowd interaction no matter the movie then you may stay away. The people in the audience acted like they were at a real wrestler. Shouting "Kill him, Kane!" and "I hope you die first!" and "Chokeslam!" echoed by the theater, showing what I hope is NOT the best of what America has to offer. I don't usually appreciate such hearing interaction, but for a cheese party like this I thought the commentary added to the entertainment value. However, I can see how others can be irritated by it. <br /> <br /> Secondly, and it shouldn't even explain, the film doesn't shy away from the gore. When you look at a big ugly man, eyeballs rip right out of their sockets, not screaming "fun night at the movie!" For you, you know well and good to save your dough. <br /> <br /> I must say I was a little surprised by the lack of dialogue on Kane's part. I didn't expect him to set up a theater, but I hoped he would have a cute little fingerprint like "Say goodnight" (his character's name is Goodnight) just before killing a victim. Instead, he has spoken four words throughout the film - "Nooooooo!" and "I see it." But hey, he delivered them flawlessly! <br /> <br /> If I was a bad man in a movie, my catch switch would be something like "Post your PAY!" or "All BETATE is off!" <br /> <br /> It will rule and you know it. We need a new genre term for bad horror movies such as Sea No Evil which causes so many unintentional laughs that you almost have to name their comedies. Feel free to send me your suggestions. For now we just call HOR-larious!
