OK, I saw this movie by Mystery Science Theater 3000, but I saw the movie, so I thought I'd comment on this. I just love how Joe is held up with the crumbs, while his brother and cousin only get the Oscar-winning roles left and right. Soultaker is technically what you would call the movie that was meant to be good. It seemed as if the director and actors had taken this film very seriously and had many caseous effects, a story that didn't make much sense, and not to speak. This is one of my favorite MST3K episodes, simply because many they call are what we think through the movie and I'll explain why in a moment. <br /> <br /> Natalie and Zach are some who have broken and are now trying to overwork. But since Zach is in the upper class and Natalie is in the middle class, it just won't work. But on their way home and Zach's friends hit in a car accident and now the angel of death / Soultaker is after them to meet his quota of soultake. But also, it seems he has had some kind of other life relationship with Natalie and just can't seem to. So now Natalie and Zach have to race against the still five million times a minute clock to save and live their souls. Well, I think Zeppelin was wrong when he sang that there were stairs to Heaven, I wonder if Black Sabbith was wrong too, lol. In fact, there are many plot holes in these movies, as no one can see the characters and they can't be murdered, but somehow they can still push buttons and open doors? The Angel of Death had a very strange face and was a bit distracting from the story itself. Soultaker was just a bad movie rushing and just as bad for Joe, the undervalued Sheen / Estovez brother. <br /> <br /> 2/10
