I'm a pretty acceptable man, when it comes to movies, even B-movies. I regularly watch some B movies for fun, and they can range from surprisingly good, just plain horrible. I usually set my expectations low before watching these kinds of movies, and even afterwards, Descent was just terribly horrible. I really didn't think they were denying the core of the nucleus, but they had absolutely nothing to do with the material. Some scientists are concerned about the seismic activity of the earth and must move in the depths of the earth to stabilize the mantle. So what we get is a monotonous long set-up in which two twin scientists played by Luke Perry and Rick Roberts work together on a top-secret mission called Project DEEP. The man in charge, General Fielding played by Michael Dorn, secretly holds important information from assistant Marsha Crawford, played by Mimi Kuzyk. The finalization of the film is Natalie Brown who plays Jen, a missionary specialist, who created the "Mole" a drill that is pushed into the depths of the Earth. <br /> <br /> Unlike some good special effects, and Set designs, nothing about Descent is worth it. The movie is quite entertaining, but it is quickly killed in a tiring story of unmanageable seismic activity, which has been killed in other films such as the Core. Ancestry also has a poor writing, with useless, forgotten dialogue between the characters. To make matters worse, there is literally no action, no real threat or danger. The attempts at comic relief are painfully unfunny. The plot has gaping holes and some of the subplots are detached at the end. Leave a bad taste in your mouth. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie was just a cheap way for anyone involved in getting a salary. There was no thought behind this movie, no innovation, it's just there. Apart from some special objects that look nice and set designs, this movie fails at every other level. The story is from the Hollywood bin, and the characters are uninteresting to start. Descent will only make you bored in boredom and frustration. Avoid at all costs.
