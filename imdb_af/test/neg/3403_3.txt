The first movie I saw of these people was "Children of the Grave" and when I heard that this one was going on, I thought it would be good to look mostly, because Waverly is a real place that rumors are being pursued. This documentary / film was AWFUL! There were too many false comments from producers, directors, camera men ... they had to keep their faces out of this movie. Waverly is rumored to have been pursued for some time. If anyone doubts, they will no doubt start believing that every story about the place is as false as this documentary. The paranormal evidence was terrible and almost non-existent. I heard better EPPs from high school students with tape recorders in a bathroom! They tried too hard to make things scary and the end result was that nothing was scary. Not the stories, not the vague too dark to see any videos, not the pictures, not the tape recordings! Children of the grave were also bad, but it had at least some and a bit of a creeping factor. The only reason I give it a 3 is because the history section of the show was very good and informative. To learn how the hospital arose, daily life there, and how it ended, was the only thing worth doing in this 2 hour piece of shit.
