This is what was previously called a "women's photo", and later a "chick's flick" when times and movies became younger. The plot is just soap opera for women and will only appeal to those types of occupations. The only appeal for most guys is if they want to see too thin Mary Tyler Moore in leotards. (If you're of a certain age, like me, might still be enough to watch it.) Otherwise, MTM gives one of her typical by-the-numbers performances she's given since the early 70's when she took them At heart she was America's Sweetheart. Christine Lathi gives one of those oblique and unpleasant performances that seem to be a real part of her as a person and probably just appeal to those of that kind. (Sorry, but it looks true.) Ted Danson is too young as MTM's husband and usually gives a slightly appalling appeal, unless he has an acting partner who can soften it. And this doesn't happen here. Allan Burns wrote and directed it, probably because he had worked with Maria before, wrote it as a project for her and she had the juice at this point to make it. There is no other purpose for that.
