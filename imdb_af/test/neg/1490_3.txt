Found an old VHS version of this movie in my home, so I thought I'd give it a go. From the start I didn't expect much from this movie and I'm happy about it because the movie wasn't good at all. <br /> <br /> The acting overall was very poor, even for a Nicolas Cage movie. One scene with a radio controller seems like it's a pity that I find it hilaries that this scene wasn't cut. The first 30 minutes of the film had almost no developed plot and I didn't know what was going on. <br /> <br /> The story itself had the opportunity to be decent, but either the director was just bad or trying too hard to give his own unique touch to the style of the movie. I managed to watch the whole thing, but I will never see this movie again.
