An anonymous film directed by anyone. Where is Anthony Mann, the director of such classics as El Cid? The naked spur or the man of Laramie? are wonderful shots flying in the clouds, lovingly filmed. The story is very thin and almost completely without dramatization. The couple live an almost routine life and the user complaining about June Allyson's choice for the woman, IMHO, misses the point. With her less attractive appearance, her whore voice, she was the perfect housewife who needed the script. At that time, women were barefoot and pregnant: there is not one single woman among the base staff, even working in the desk. All they had to do was worry about their hubbies, fighting for democracy and against an enemy whose name we never heard, but in 1955 it wasn't hard to guess. <br /> <br /> One wonder why a young man who has never seen a Mann movie should choose this one among all the big movies he made.
