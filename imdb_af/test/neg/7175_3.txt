It is a bottom of the type B movie of one of the poverty studios, Monogram, in the mid-40's, the type that filled a dual account. <br /> <br /> Only reason I watched was to see what JACKIE MORAN was in a leading role as a sidebar at a radio station trying to kill. He played Phil Meade in GONE WITH THE WIND just two years earlier, and that was one of his last teenage roles. He's not Mickey Rooney. <br /> <br /> The script is as indifferent as the production values ​​and is full of cliché-ridden situations with a cast of uniformly unlisted individuals. WANDA McKAY is the switchboard girlfriend discovered by a radio producer and SIDNEY MILLER is the northern friend of the hero who is afraid of his own shadow. <br /> <br /> It is mercifully over in an hour when the murder was resolved after a round of all the suspects. Terribly over-emphasized, the only silent show of any interest is given by JON GILBREATH as Tex, the cowboy, but he bites the fabric to blemish a look. <br /> <br /> There are several songs, but everyone is forgotten, just like the lame jokes and dialogue.
