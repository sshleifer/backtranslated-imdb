If you, like me, the rare and strangest (and often the most terrible) provider of world cinema, actively seek out, do not look beyond Hong Kong's supernatural deterrence in the early 80s. Often, bizarre black magic blends with kung fu and stupid comedy, and usually packed with many creepy crawls (snakes, worms, eels, centipedes, etc.). These movies are about as bizarre as they get. <br /> <br /> Success is definitely a case: a mountain tribe of which the women drop their husbands by giving them nasty spells (they would abandon them with writhing creatures and a painful death ), some such as martial arts and many animal lethal animals (many of which are committed by a geek, which has absolutely no influence on the story), this film is just strange. <br /> <br /> An extended scene in which the tribal women hunt for snakes and insects, and throw the creatures on their backs in the baskets, and it is fascinating; a tribe that sees a poor ox grounded and then torn apart is utterly disgusting; And the moments that show that worms are crawling in open wounds and being thrown onto the floor will lose the body for a while. <br /> <br /> However, the live animal rescue that Succubare really qualifies for legendary status among fans of that movie. It is thoroughly dirty to watch and yet strangely enforce: the geek chomps on a snake, cut off a fat, juicy path (nasty!), And hungry consumes a mouse (bites off its head and then moves the rest after). /> <br /> Not a good movie (hell, it's not even a mediocre movie), Succubare is only recommended to people who think they saw it all. This one gets 4 out of 10 of me, which is probably more than it deserves, but I mistakenly understand it to make me feel slightly sick.
