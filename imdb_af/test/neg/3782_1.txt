It's a very bad movie. However, I read that it was made by a high school teacher. Perhaps I should give it a little praise for its ambitious (but terrible) special effects. Here's the plot: A monster comes from a heap of waste and pollution in the town of Milpitas, California and begins on a devastating rampage. I'm going to spoil the "big surprise" about how the monster looks, so please read the rest of it at your own risk. You have been warned! The monster looks like a gigantic, two-legged fly with a gas mask. In some scenes, the monster is an actor wearing a costume. In other scenes, the monster is created by stop animation. The acting is terrible. The dialogue is terrible. The special effects are terrible. The plot is predictable. Stay away!
