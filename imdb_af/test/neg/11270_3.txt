I saw almost all the movies of Kurosawa and dozens of other Japanese films. Compared to these other films, it's a pretty average for poor movie. The plot features two warring brothers - not one I cared for much - and it's very confusing to keep up with who is connected. The music and cinematography is pretty good, but the special effects, sometimes, are terrible - rubber heads fly off with the same realism as the average high school game! Over and above these complaints, the whole picture is completely destroyed and the end of the film is undermined. It seems that the end is not true, but it was completely "fudged". What is the point of this, then? If you've seen this movie, you understand that there are much better movies there, don't give up!
