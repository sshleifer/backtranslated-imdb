I really want Hollywood to come up with some new ideas and fast. Instead, they go around making a perfect movie with a re-make. This movie is awesome from the DeMille version. All the way through this movie I told myself, Huh ??? - What ???? - I don't remember that part. The only exciting thing in this movie so far was the farewell to the Red Sea. And in Heston's version, it was a lot better than this version. Did anyone else see an atomic or nuclear bomb cloud in and out of the Red Sea? I think I did. Anyway, I might be watching tonight's last night tonight. <br /> <br /> Wishing Hollywood to address different ideas and topics when making new movies. Instead of repeating old movies. <br /> <br /> They should be left alone enough. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: <br /> <br /> Well, I watched the last part. Did Moses make the second copy of the ten commandments with his own hand - or did I see things - please someone - email me and let me know. terribly
