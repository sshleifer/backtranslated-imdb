Hellraiser: Bloodlyn is where the sequel mediocrity of the Hellraiser series works well. Gone is the imagination and invention of the first two movies. Gone is the ethos of Pinhead and his minions. Away is the sick desires of man. Virtually everything Hellraiser made so original was ruined by this mess of a picture. <br /> <br /> All that remains is the basic premise of Christian mythology that there is hell with demons. What happened to the evil that men do? This excited excuse for a Hellraiser movie is stuffed with endless Psycho Babble, so Pinhead becomes a nonsense that emits a philosopher and not the oath of punishment than he intended. <br /> <br /> The movie uses the most basic movie formulas with characters that are killed separately and individually. Pin is not Alien. The link between the box and the 'demons' or 'hell' is never fixed, it just comes on a sacrifice and sits on a plate. <br /> <br /> The main female character is called 'Rimmer' and the producers are, of course, thinking it is really funny, because everyone is still talking to her name. Actually, the movie had to be titled to name the characters. <br /> <br /> Shame on you Kevin Yagher and Alan Smithee.
