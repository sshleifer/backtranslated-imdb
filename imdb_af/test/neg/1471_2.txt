This film was rewarded to the point of ridiculous. "American Movie" is a boring documentary about a boring person, so you find equivalents about every corner in America. It takes a long, hard look at a man who has failed about just about everything in the interest of an independent film. Or two. Were his failures for others as his own selfish pursuit or were they in the name of real art, the movie might have had a chance. America has an abundance of better stories to tell. This one has to be flushed and many critics have good reason to be ashamed. Two thumbs indeed!
