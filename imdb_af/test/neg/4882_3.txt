I think I win the competition for this movie because I have it as part of a DVD collection of Martial Arts Movie Classics with 50 movies for $ 20, which means that I paid something like 50 cents for the chance to " Black Fist "version of a movie released as" Bogard. " <br /> <br /> For a basic "revenge" movie, "Black Fist" is not bad, although it is obviously hampered by low budget. One of my informal "rules" to watch a movie is that if the main actor is better than his production and script, the movie automatically gets at least three stars. This is certainly the case here; Lawson has some presence and some charisma, and probably earned a better movie career than he got. <br /> <br /> The street fight choreography (the apparent reason for the movie) will really not impress anyone who has ever been spared in a martial arts school or even fought in a school yard. I just learned about basic kung fu for about two years, but even before the front bump kicks, armrests, and roundhouse bumps I will never be shown. But the atmosphere is good - dust and blood and crowd crowds, and the actors felt a bit in the fighting. <br /> <br /> The plot is less credible. Dawson's character "Leroy Fisk" is portrayed as a street-smart, sharp young man looking for work as a bakkie in illegal, untouched street games. Yet he is surprised and indignant when he has to pay the police? Excuse me, but I was educated in a small town of Iowa and even * I * knew (from "Hard Times" with Charles Bronson) that the police should be paid for this kind of action and that the guys fighting, the fixers to get their matches, and that the fixers were worth the money. So you have to watch this movie with some deliberate suspension from your critical faculties to accept it as a "black brother being suppressed". (Most of the other non-black fighters in the stable are also hit in the face for the same deal, yes?). <br /> <br /> The movie suffers from a short attention span. Of course, the director did not have the budget to roll off the screens he needed, so he had to fill in the gaps with a little ridiculous outline concepts (The "I won him, I ate him and then I killing him "just not working" with voice surplus and clumsy and unconvincing settings. This is especially true with the entire romance angle that seems to be filmed as if it were an afterthought. It's a little scary if you think the death of the "Visser" woman's death is supposed to burn his revenge. <br /> <br /> But as soon as the movie goes all the way from a young warrior by the ranks "to the revenge, it picks up some steam and plays with a little more conviction. I'm not sure the final payout is worth the build up - Roger Ebert calls this kind of thing "a long drive for a short day at the beach" .. but it makes things pretty satisfactory. <br /> <br / > If Sylvester Stallone made this movie with a real budget and the same castings, clothing sets and costumes, and himself as the hero, people would have considered it as the next "Rocky", which goes to show you how circumstances and seizures can destroy play with dreams made by the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Once for several decent shots and lines, and watching Dabney Coleman embarrass himself.
