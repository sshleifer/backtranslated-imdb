The trailer for this movie has promised to make a new turn on the zombie genre: it puts it in the Old West. Of course, this is not the right Old West. It is a kind of future west, in a world where some apocalypse has an apocalypse, killing people and then turning them into zombies. This is again zombie virus time, people, and you know what it means? Get bitten and become one of them. <br /> <br /> So, in this dusty and dead world comes a hero. He is a bounty hunter who is paid for the care of zombies. It is not exactly clear who is providing the funds, but it looks like a small house industry has turned up in zombie hunting. But, as the trailer tells us, there is a problem. They run out of zombies. The only way to earn is to infect new towns and cities with the virus. <br /> <br /> I don't think it's a bad idea for a movie. But unfortunately it takes a lot more than a good idea and a crowd of people trying to make a good zombie movie. What we actually get is a Clint Eastwood clone (the actor's even called Clint, crying out loud) and his "hilarious" sidekick, trying to catch zombies, while some still living bad people are left to pay a great reward. get. The entire subplot about the contamination of other villages is only mentioned in passing, more than halfway through the film. Instead, there are many Western movie clips, poor zombie makeup and some world-class bad acting. Really bad. The kind that wouldn't even make it on Hollyoaks. Both the hero and the villain chomp on cigars, quips are thrown, people are bitten. While the movie comes to a conclusion, the only thing worth ending with the cliché is that the hero is the only living person, the one he loves, killed, or the cliché of him in the final change. frame. (It's the first one by the way) This film was written and directed by Gerald Nott. That's the only thing he did and hopefully it'll be his last. At the beginning of the film there is a heading that reads "Nott Entertainment". At least they have one thing right.
