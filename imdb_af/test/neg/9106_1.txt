Seriously, this movie is not. Steve Guttenburg constantly forces his tough old dialogue and then gives all the evil eyes all the time. He just wasn't credible, he looked like he was trying to be a badass and he sucked with it. I just remember him as the millionaire dad with the Olsen twins in It takes two ... so, that's a big change. I rented this movie for Sean Bean, and he dies (as usual). Only this time did he not hit a boat anchor (Patriot Games), hit by a giant satellite dish (Goldeneye), or overflowed by cows (The Field). He just shot, became really quick and sick, and that was all I got from this movie, that they didn't kill him in a very grotesque and morbid way. How sad is that? I just watched it for the 3 seconds Sean was in, and then the rest was rubbish. I actually tried to look and understand the plot, but there really wasn't one. Looks like Mission Impossible with the hole, "Oooooo! There's a mole! It's the leader of the group, and no one warned it! Let's get stuck! Let's get hold of the religious governor so we can get away with it ! " Cliched and tired, this movie was a waste of time.
