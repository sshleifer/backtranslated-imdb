Hell to pay was a disappointment. It didn't have the content of a B-Western movie and shouldn't be compared to a fantastic movie like Silverado. The dialogue was dull, the plot was foolish, the soundtrack was unnecessarily unnecessary, and the acting was terrible. Even the professionals could have taken some lessons from the Sunset Carson School of Acting. The only positive thing about this movie is that it has shown some of the top Cowboy shooters in the country, but you can see them better in any SASS video. The packaging of this feature makes it very tempting, and the preview is decent, but it is all after that.
