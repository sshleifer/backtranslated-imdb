I wanted this movie. A movie with zombie kids coming out of the mine to kill people at night really looked like a horror movie. Unfortunately, the film in the bottom 3 movies played at horror festivals. <br /> <br /> A mother and her two daughters are trying to continue after her husband / father has fallen off a disease that spends a lot of money on their family. They need to adapt to their new environment. They struggle for different reasons due to the environment. (The Crazy Zombie kids are in this category) The film never gives a sentimental attachment to anyone who lives or dies, the film does not produce scary or worthy moments. The movie barely shows the kids do what they are supposed to do ... kill! With a bigger budget and a better cast, this movie can have hope. Until then, send it over. <br /> <br /> actually.
