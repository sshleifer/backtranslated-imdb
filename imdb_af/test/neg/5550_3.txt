Say what you want about the movie's "Wizard of Gore", Herschell Gordon Lewis, it must be conceded that of his first films (1963's trashy "Blood Feast" and 1964's cracker barrage "Two Thousand Maniacs") to his last (1972's The Gore Gore Girls "), the man remained faithful to his muse, which cut up the bodies of young men and women for the imagination of the camera. In" Gore Gore ", for example, someone is at the Tops & Bottoms Club avoids the decorated and decorated strippers, and a turbulent ex-detective Gentry is hired by a hottie-young reporter to help the case, the film features remarkable, annoying and repetitive background music, terrible lighting, abysmal acting, repugnant characters, problematic sound AND, of course, of Lewis's patented spare parts, so, one of the strippers has shifted her face into cooking oil, one tore her head open, another stroked her face and cut off her nipples; it's her bum covered with a meat maker until its entire back is covered with what appears to be a Tomato sauce. (I could be wrong here, it might have been Ragu.) The movie also throws a little lame humor, though some of the lines are pretty funny. For example, we learn that the real name of the killed stripper was Suzie Creampuff ... Ethel Creampuff! A bottle of acid says "Made In Poland" (don't know why, but I thought it was funny). And some of the strip club owner Henny Youngman's lines are of course amusing. Yet it is not the movie to show to Tant Ethel or Sister Agatha. It's one of the sickest things you'll ever see, with just one sure fire, a spectacular moment - the title card in the film's conclusion, which reads, "We are proud to announce: This movie is over!"
