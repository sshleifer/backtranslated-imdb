Compared to director Kevin Connor's later ARABIAN ADVENTURE, this is a masterpiece. However, it doesn't say much. In fact, at the globe is a stupid fantasy adventure in which Peter Cushing - who looks at something strong - and another actor (I don't know) uses a huge excavator called the "Iron Mole" to the Earth's core - just to find that the inside of the earth is pink and populated by ape-like creatures that have enslaved the people. There is also a giant bird that controls the monkeys by telepathy, and we see that it cuts its eyes around the film. The most important thing is that Cushing and his name also experience the lovely Caroline Munro in the underground caves. And here's what I really got against this little movie: why, why is it that when Munro is in a movie, she only gets about. 5 minute screen time? In the spy that loved me, MANIAC, DRACULA AD 1972, GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD - always in the background! How could Kevin Connor think we'd rather listen to Peter Cushing's false accent and look at a ridiculous monkey whose voice sounds like a scratched CD as a look at the beautiful Munro? I don't get it. Please, someone directing a movie where this English brunette is on the screen all the time!
