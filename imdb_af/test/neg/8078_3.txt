A lot of teens dirty cyclists are in the bush around in circles. They have fun; little do they know that nature is about to be released by an emo refugee from a Salvation or Hills Have Eyes movie. He is armed with matches and rockets. And he has an eye that bleeds or something. Why Torch a Park? I do not know. Maybe he doesn't like Smokey the Bear or anything. But he wears army / navy stores, if that helps. <br /> <br /> The rangers send a single helicopter to fight the resulting fire. It's all you ever see, except a lot of people in a base that talk a lot about the fire, but don't do anything. Some policeman or ranger or military or whatever he falls on the helicopter on a defective tower. <br /> <br /> Everyone is now driving their dirty bikes like their audition for motor cross. They are jumping forever, jumping Evel Knievel, turning around etc. They constantly argue. Shots of the fire are as false as a $ 3 bill; It's the same footage of a dozen different angles, and the flame never grows or moves. And you never even see a fire fighting equipment. <br /> <br /> SyFy channel film that attached about 0% science fiction to it. What you can expect from this: bad acting, cheap effects, and a story that goes nowhere (like the bikes and fire go nowhere). Low-level insomnia cure.
