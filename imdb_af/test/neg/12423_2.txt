Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear! <br /> <br /> To think that movies like this were made, and probably enjoyed by thousands at row ins, the mind really starts. How innocent we were in those days. <br /> <br /> To put it bluntly, this movie is shit. The hero is so wet that you can hear his dirty footprints in every scene. My Lord, but he is just one of a lot of terrible, terrible actors in this turkey. No wonder MST3K chose it. The story, as it is, centers on a stock car driver (who is so incompetent, you really believe it's the car driver) he gives up and "enters with the wrong crowd" Oooooh! Scary things. The wrong crowd, however, seems to be the biker equivalent of The Three Stooges and their "hand-round" biker chick slut. As an example of how paralyzed this whole thing is, the writers obviously wrapped their minds to make a terrifying name for the gangster - if four people can be called a gang, it's. The result? The gang is called Satan's Angels! I don't kid you. <br /> <br /> Such a horrible play and dialogue, along with ridiculous scenes, make for a wonderful beer and slide movie. But otherwise it's just the worst kind of garbage. <br /> <br /> As I said. Once it may have been well considered. But today it only makes you laugh every minute. Avoid it except for a good laugh. And make sure you are more than half-drunk!
