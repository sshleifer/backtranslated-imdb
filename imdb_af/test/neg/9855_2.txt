Looking at Enterprise for the first time, as we all undoubtedly do with all performances, I used it with open minds and enjoyed about half of the previous Star Trek efforts and the other half of the others. <br /> <br /> Business has fallen short, but this episode "A Night In Sickbay" seriously questioned me why I am disappointing the shows of Monday night on Sci Fi. <br /> <br /> To make sure that it's one of those 'A Day In The Life' episodes, in which we learn what makes certain characters work as humanoids, the authors forgot that it was a star ship. had to be, not the Ricardoes and the Mertzes. <br /> <br /> A planet, especially one whose people offended by the Enterprise crew (for public eating habits), was no place for a dog. As an animal loves me, I would never have taken one of my pets in a past-proven environment. <br /> <br /> But what made this episode even more ridiculous was the endless problem with all of these ST shows, which constantly portray things that are sacred and abusive to other cultures, as they provide insight to American religious zeal. <br /> <br /> The strangers were now offended when the dog was drained on a sacred tree. but the strangers were quite able to urinate the dog as an insult. <br /> <br /> Strange how the dog's urination is not considered some form of worship. I wonder how the one got with the authors of the show. <br /> <br /> From there, we were subjected to a captain who was deceived by his duties. When I watched the episode, I found it very easy to forget that Bakula had to be the ship's captain. <br /> <br /> He chose to sleep in sickbay and from there we get more injustices of behavior (sighs) We're not supposed to understand, and that makes us prosperous. <br /> <br /> The doctor cuts long, hairy scenes non-chalant and nourishes them to hungry dressed animals. Ewwwwww! Then a white bat world escapes. <br /> <br /> How's anyone going to sleep with all this stuff! Toenail clipping, crying out loud! I was waiting for something to be fed on vomit. <br /> <br /> Then we were inexplicably given the idea that the captain was in love with T'pol, and that he might have masked the feelings with his concern about the dog. <br /> <br /> Endless amounts of litter. <br /> <br /> "Your dog is sick, so is sex. You'll feel better." And of course, the captain had to apologize and our people had to regard his apology as completely ridiculous, because we are so (everyone smiles very sarcastically). Saw depictions as they were endless on TNG. <br /> <br /> Oddly, the only thing missing from this horrible episode was that traveling person offering his smirks and downhome boyisms, and Bakula already has that stupid dog. <br /> <br /> Oh, the dog has survived, so is gonna play.
