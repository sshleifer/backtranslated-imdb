Looking at the documentary, you will notice that the director is totally inexperienced and was actually a co-worker of Quentin Tarantinos in a video store. Put two and two together and you realize Quentin makes a favor for his old button, despite the button being quite talented. Was it difficult? Well, see this movie and you'll realize it's not. Too slow in the beginning, too uncomfortable in the middle, and too slow to finish. It's about it. Eric Stolz & Delpy were the only two showing some charisma. And Kemp actually got a good performance. But the rest was really bad. One case of stupidity was when a main robber accidentally broke his mask during the attack. So what happens then? Well, the other robbers decide they can remove them as well! What a good thought. The violence was relentless and insane. But not in a "cool" way. Rather, in a boring way. I wondered if it was a comedy. More foolish Tarantino because he linked his good name to this garbage. More, fool me into watching it.
