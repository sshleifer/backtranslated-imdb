A man builds a hotel with a partner. He finds out the hotel is overinsured. Things just get worse. This movie has a large number of scenes. They had to put together. It jumps from place to place. It doesn't stay very focused for a long time. The end starts on Christmas morning with a hotel fire. It then cuts to a night scene of that fire and then cuts back to the day. The DVD soundtrack is terrible. It takes a fair plot and turns into the worst movie I've had in a long time.
