Repetition: Simon leads a small team of specialist agents who have specialized in discovering and returning people at every possible opportunity. Their latest mission is about the granddaughter of a friend of theirs. She seemed to have caught on the web of a particularly brutal criminal and everyone who was looking for her was missing out. But now the librarians are on the issue. <br /> <br /> Comment: This is pure B action, through and through. The key phrase for this is unlimited supply. There is unlimited stock of ammunition, they don't have to reload once. There is an unlimited supply of bad guys, so the heroes have something to shoot. There is an unlimited supply of breasts, many of them bare, in vain (and always fail) trying to derive from the plot holes. And there is an unlimited supply of bad acting (it's almost like Erika Eleniak's performance here, how's that?), And actors who don't look like the salary (and why should they when nobody else looks like? ). <br /> <br /> And as in most B-action movies, there is an unlimited supply of bad gunfights. But it looks almost of a ridiculous kind. I think I saw more realistic gunfights when I played a child as a cowboy. <br /> <br /> But then I didn't expect much, how can I get from an action movie called The Librarian? And it actually delivers what can be expected. 90 minutes of more or less bad action with some scenes linking the dots. But I'm not sure if I can mention it significantly. It didn't last long for my interest. <br /> <br /> 3/10
