OK, so it's about 30 minutes of gore with no story whatsoever. There is no spoken dialogue, no captions, not even any right characters. You see three people in the whole movie (who live) and two are just there for very little reason. The chief has no emotion and does not look like bodies at all. This is the whole movie. I love to see a lot of fake movies, especially since it's really good in America, it's not very common in modern movies. So yes, the gore effects were pretty cool. But it is not really disturbing. Why do everyone think it's so disturbing? There are no characters at all, there are only 3 living people and 3 bodies. No one has any personality or storytelling. You see that three bodies are chopped apart and you can't really identify it unless you identify with death and how it can happen very well (despite the man losing his job and going to jail shortly thereafter). viewer must care and care, they must identify with the victim. For example, in a good horror movie you should really care about the main character. Here it is just a man and a body. It is as deep as a puddle made from just a single rainfall. They never give you a reason to care for someone in the movie. Though it is a guy who hooks a few bodies, he has sex with a body. Now with the sex scene here is a strange thing about it, he certainly wears gloves, but doesn't use a condom. So he can't care less about catching a bit of strange SOS because he has sex with a body, but as long as his hands don't get messy, there's no problem, it's really logical. I don't really like the movie, I like it being very sorry, but when it ends, there's no reason to see it again, no reason to even care, and it's just not a very compelling movie not. I say if you can get it for less than $ 10, you can get it, but if it's more, it's just not worth it.
