If I love you, you enjoy the first movie "Bruce Almighty", my advice to you is not to get your hopes too high; actually ignore any hope you have for this movie if you are above the age of 12 and have any movie sense. <br /> <br /> Without giving away too much, the story Evan (Bruce's nemesis co-author of the first movie) sees with his family moving to the Virginia suburbs to change the world with a new political path . What follows is a rather far-fetched and rather stupid story, which is of course aimed at targeting young children as the main target audience. Unlike its predecessor, Evan Almighty is a family-oriented film with the ambiguous genre of 'comedy' marked on the deceptive position of 'successor', some of which regard a contemporary comedy classic that is slightly more mature. upscale audience. <br /> <br /> Generally, Evan Almighty consists of horrible movie values. The acting; omitted Steve Carell and Morgan Freeman were stiff and many of the characters were apparently thrown in to use the unnecessarily large budget issued for the production. In addition, the movie includes acting legend John Goodman who looks like a witch and is only seen a few times in the film's whole. However, I did not buy the character completely and thought of the storyline in which he was deeply involved, even for a family comedy. Every other character in the movie (especially the wife and children!) Deserves a mention for their performances so cheesy it can fill a king-size Kiev. But be warned; This is the typical Americanized Cheddarfest associated with many mainstream family-oriented movies, so I suggest you defend yourself with the closest grid in sight. <br /> <br /> It may seem that the movie is worthless, so far, it does have some aspects. The CGI was outstanding and it was clear that much time had gone into the Ark's modeling and ended the water effects and animation of the computer-generated animals. The particles, renders and textures used were aesthetic stars. Although a part of me couldn't help but think it wasn't a movie with such poor ideas and I was "too good" for this piece of cinema and spent the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, I see this film as a disaster in terms of the ongoing franchise with great potential, but unfortunately it was not a bad conclusion in the Almighty series and I have the end approached the movie. I set my expectations high for an epic and somehow meaningful final to make up for the mediocre content I have seen so far. This was not the case and I was very disappointed and confused the final credits. While I was unhappy, I couldn't help but think the movie wasn't as close as 'Mighty' as I had hoped. In many ways the film reminded me of a watered "Night at the Museum" as it showed similar styling and features, but unfortunately there were leagues below. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3 out of 10 because it's watchful, but it's definitely one that should be avoided! If you have to watch this movie, be prepared for disappointment as 'mildly entertained' is the best you can hope to get in that production.
