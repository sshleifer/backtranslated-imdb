When I first saw the previews for this movie on TV, I thought it might be a funny movie. I was wrong. Although I'm not totally against movies that make others fun. Some are actually funny like the first, terrifying movie. It was one of the many that was made before. The humor in this movie was nothing but funny and was pretty dull. <br /> <br /> I feel that one of the biggest problems is that they have had lots of fun on many movies like Varsity Blues, Friday Night, Paste It, etc. And if you're something like me, try choosing each movie instead of paying attention to what happens in this one. Even the mature humor in this movie was dry. Do yourself a favor and save money and time and rent do not rent this movie
