This movie defines the word "confused". All the actors stay true to the writing. More is a pity, because the acting is good, but the writing is a confused pastiche of pseudo-psycho-analytical random ideas. The pacing is annoyingly slow, and the soft-focus lens cinematography quickly gets on the nerves. I give it 4 out of 10.
