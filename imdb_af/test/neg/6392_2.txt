Michael Caine's character has problems. He is a clear, cautious, uncertain man in his mid-40s. He is married, but his wife no longer looks to love him. He has a poor relationship with his only daughter. But his most immediate problem is that a beautifully beautiful young woman, played by Michelle Johnson, is haunting him, kissing him, greeting him, and trying to start sex at every opportunity. What is the poor fellow to do? <br /> <br /> This movie must be taken from the Comedy section and placed under Science Fiction. Only an intergalactic brain disorder can explain the actions of Michelle Johnson's character. Let's see - 3 billion men in the world - she can pretty much choose her - she goes with a clumsy, aging loser. It goes beyond a middle-aged male fantasy in something so deceptive, but you just hope everyone who volunteered for the therapy <br/> <br /> is not really funny here. There are a few quick attempts at Caine, which often looks like Hawkeye Pierce as a new character. Joseph Bologna is like a fingernail on a plate. Michelle Johnson is not an actress - she has one crying scene that doesn't play in a high school, but she's beautiful and she takes off her clothes. So buy the DVD, skip to screens 4 and 9, and forget about the rest.
