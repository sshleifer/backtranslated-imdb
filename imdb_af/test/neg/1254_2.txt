After reading the book 'One of a Kind' a week ago, I thought, "It'll make a good movie, especially now, when people know a little about poker and poker players." I was totally shocked to find it while browsing at the video store last night. I had no idea that anyone really made it into a movie. I immediately grabbed it and looked with great anticipation. What a great letdown! <br /> <br /> All the interesting things about Stu Ungar were quickly overwhelmed, and instead I had a biopic face that could have been about someone. Ungar might have been a burnt out but he was also a brilliant thinker who could read people instinctively. It made him so fascinating. Why not focus on it? <br /> <br /> Talk about the right truth water. This man was over all about absolutely everything: drugs, women, gambling, famine, sleep deprivation. He worked on sports events from dusk to dawn, and he was missing for days while running away in crackers. His body is constantly wiped out, but if he ever needs money, he can always win just about anyone when playing cards. Now it's a story! <br /> <br /> Spending too much time on childhood and personal relationships (though hardly touched with Vincent and his daughter) and almost anything about his drug use (which was outrageous), his crazy gambling and his incredible card game abilities . <br /> <br /> Probably too late now, but I hope someone will recover this movie properly. I had no problem with Imperioli. He is excellent. The author just left him with nothing interesting to say.
