At the start of the film Ramgopal says Verma that "Sarkar" is his tribute to The Godfather. This one feels more like an insult. It looks awful compared to the Coppola classic. Although no one expected Ramgopal Verma to fill Coppola's shoes, the movie made a lot of expectation and buzz. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan plays "Sarkar", a character who immediately makes comparisons with the Indian political party Shiv Sena's Supremo Bal Thackeray. Abhishek Bachchan plays his son, Shankar, who returns from overseas and is caught in Sarkar's home. Just like Al Pacino in the original Godfather. <br /> <br /> Like most Bollywood rates, incidents and characters are openly simplistic and without any fixed base. Quick calls and sudden announcements make the movie one way to another. Abishek takes political crime-nexus like a duck after Mumbai's dark underworld. Amitab Bachchan as Sarkar is supposed to look powerful and powerful, he just ends old and undecided. Most of his acting is centered on constantly watching different things around the film - the actor in front of him, the floor or in any other direction. <br /> <br /> But Kay Kay performs extremely well as the wrong older boy, Vishnu. So does Zakir Hussain as Rashid, the Dubai-based dope smuggler who wants to get his foot in Mumbai. This actor has wonderful screen presence and can send chills on your spine just as he looks. The moment he enters the screen, you want to run and hide under the bed. <br /> <br /> All the obvious flaws didn't come across, the movie did well at the box office. The buzz and the big star of course help. Verma also manages to keep your interest, even though it is soft at the end of the film. He is actually pursuing this one I am sure will be more of the same rate.
