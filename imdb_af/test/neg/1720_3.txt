Oh, son, it's another comet-hitting-the-earth movie. Come within a year or two from Deep Impact, Armageddon, Space Cowboys and several other stupid flicks with rap stars in them, you think people will be burned on this concept. Apparently, since I rented it, and hope it can't be terrible. Dennis Hopper was there and he's a good actor, right? <br /> <br /> I forgot something important: along with Peter O 'Toole, Robert De Niro and quite a few other valued actors, Hopper has a fondness for horrible movies. Not only that, but he seems to be preparing for them by taking forget-how-to-action classes. His performance in Tychus is so terrible that you expect Divine or Edith Massey to appear in some scenes. <br /> <br /> I don't know what else to say about this junk, other than crashing into Earth movies, watching Deep Impact, and then Armageddon and Space Cowboys on a piece. Forget the other altogether. This one is really under the hope.
