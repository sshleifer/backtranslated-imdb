Zoey 101 is basically about a girl named Zoey who, in the first year, joins an all-boys' school to integrate girls into it. That raw plot line is, I'll admit, a pretty good idea. Although this show is intended for children, a five-year-old is likely to show his fatal flaws. First, Zoey is a clich√© character, she is super popular, super attractive, super smart and there is nothing wrong with her; No girl is like that. It feels like the show on the Jamie Lynn Spears has taken place and her fame is increasing. Dana, who appeared at the beginning of the first season, is simply mean. However, I was probably the most realistic character of all of them, who is sad because Dana is never nice. Nicole is too ardent and acts like a full-blown head but becomes mysteriously straight A's. Lola seems to mislead anything with her Emmy-earning acting skills. Quinn is supposed to be super smart, and although she can create the most unrealistic things, she is also made strange and she never gets guys, though she is beautiful and smart, while Zoey, Lola and Nicole get guys and they are all beauty and no personality. Chase and Michael are very similar, and sometimes I get confused. Logan is unrealistically rich and gives millions as if they were dollars. No one is so rich. I also noticed that every character on the show is common to the Stacy girl, who does nothing but does well with them. It's not funny! It's common and it only affects young girls to act for many nice people. Eventually, the school itself adds the icing to the unreal cake by offering the students 5 star facilities, such as a beautiful place, sushi bar, warm lounge equipped with free soft drinks machines, pool and jacuzzi, movie, and allowance for boys and girls. To go freely into the other sleeping residence. At most boarding schools, if a boy goes to a girl's residence or vice versa, they will be suspended. <br /> <br /> Finally, Zoey 101 was poorly written and had to be set up for a few more years.
