River Queen's sound record must be dismissed. At this time and age there is no excuse for poor recording on the set. Mumbling voices were the end result, and cinematography was at its best average. The story has potential and I feel sorry for the overseas actors who had to know they were on a turkey shoot while filming. It is obvious that the movie is struggling with the cheapest budget syndrome, and the scene where Temuera grows inside the house, while a fight rages outside, is just too stupid for words. <br /> <br /> I noticed a few shortcuts taken on the Maori protocol side of things, but that was probably due to movie length restrictions. All in all, I was not impressed with this movie, the Whanganui River has many beautiful spots, but this movie gives us a cold, deadly and claustrophobic image, with nothing of beauty. The movie needed more sunshine and better camera angles, less on screen confusion, better sound recording, and more thoughts had to be seen in moviegoers on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Hats off to everyone involved, but to complete what was a very difficult shoo. I have the greatest appreciation for anyone who can make a feature film, unfortunately I did not enjoy this one.
