This film has the potential to be a very good movie in my eyes, Nicholas Sparks is a great romance writer and this movie had every chance to be as good as The Notebook, but what are the two apart is The notebook has a dream team from McAdams and Gosling, but here the balance is miserably thrown off by the improper conduct of Channing Tatum. I felt that many of the scenes were unevenly pure because of his performance, much of the emotion in various scenes was lost because he could not perform, but Amanda Seyfried gave a good performance to let Tatum drop the ball and the mood was lost and the scene cannot recover. <br /> <br /> This story deserves to be thrown right, but what it has was a nice boy who can't act. Tatum has to stick to what he's good at, movies that are more about his physical ability, though terrible, like GI JOE, step up, and Fighting. The less he speaks, the better. <br /> <br /> Try not to think of me as a tear of Channing Tatum. I went to this movie with an open mind, because I was very surprised by the love of Adam Sandler in my reign. I was given the same chance for Tatum, I didn't see him here as the sum of his past roles, just because of his performance in this movie, which was unfortunately a mess.
