Save some very early Norris, "Breaker, Breaker" has nothing to offer that can't be found ten times better on any broadcast channel. A pathetic effort to make film, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In spite of that, I watched it and dipped the fast forward button, because the acting was so terrible that it was comical. Of course, the film is supposed to be an action / drama, but is evident from a treatise on how not to make a movie. Everything that can be with film is on the screen in this "dog". If you do that, give it a look. It's so bad, it's funny.
