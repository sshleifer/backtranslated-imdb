I consider myself a big fan of low budget horror movies. The more bizarre and imaginative the movie, the more blood and intestines, the better, and I really fall in love with cheapest flicks when done right. Luther started well enough ... his origins in the circus, a fiery race at a supermarket, an old lady attack and his disturbing occupation of a woman's farm all created the mood. A hot sex / shower scene occurs when the wife's daughter and daughter's boyfriend arrive home. When Luther steals the boyfriends motorcycle, the movie is getting worse. <br /> <br /> The characters are presented with numerous opportunities to: A) save their loved ones, B) help the police, C) escape, or (mostly) D) KILL LUTHER !!! I can't feel empathy or fear of characters who are too stupid to help themselves. Chareters snub chances to arm themselves with guns and knives while Luther is gone. A policeman eventually arrives and is equally ineffective at stopping Luther, although at one point he has a gun that is entirely aimed at Luther, while Luther slams and performs his version of the Polish chicken dance. I briefly enforced my television: "Make sure he is dead!", "Hes gone, get out of there!" Or "Kill him already!" <br /> <br /> Luther is a bloodthirsty wilderness, but he is barely Hannibal Lecter. If you can't disassemble this egg cup, you deserve what comes for you. By half through the movie you will be so deadly for the fortunes of the semi-conscious that only morbid curiosity will sustain you to keep the generously amusing end. This movie was noticed as one of Fangoria's 101 best movies you've never seen. Well, Fangoria is half right in the case of Luther the Geek.
