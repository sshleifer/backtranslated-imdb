The film is an adaptation of a Japanese story by respected author Yukio Mishima. It simply does not make the transition to a credible story about British and Americans. <br /> <br /> The story moves slowly, especially the part where Miles and Kristofferson are separated and the director fills in with the cut shots of a ship's screen cuts through the waves, and the small route line fills in the cards while their letters are being heard. The film moves so cowardly that I even move through the sex and masturbation scenes, which, although long, is not really passionate or erotic. The film reached some notoriety when Kristofferson's former wife divorced him for extra-mural activities with me. Miles during the filming. I think they enjoyed the sex scenes, but it's not quite the same for a viewer. <br /> <br /> There are no characters to hang on. The sexually frustrated widow is unlikeable, the little child is contemptuous. Kristofferson is enjoyable enough, but he does not have the acting skills to play the role, although we may not really want to get involved with him, as he is considering his ultimate fate. <br /> <br /> If For the little child, well, he falls with a bad crowd to die his father, and they help him to plan evil things against the man entering his mother's life. Now it's a very bad crowd. They do not just shoplift and smoke dope, nosireebib. They slip a microphone to a cat and divide it. This is shown in commemorative details. But of course, it's just exercise, so they can do the same thing to Kristofferson! <br /> <br /> So, the movie moves slowly, without characters, and when something happens, it is indecently morbid. <br /> <br /> The end is about as unsatisfactory as any movie you will ever see. <br /> <br /> This made everything possible if the Japanese local and cultural context was preserved. As it stands, it's just uncomfortable. <br /> <br />
