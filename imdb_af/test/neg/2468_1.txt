This movie is terrible. If you are considering watching this movie ... two words. It's tasteless, the storyline is really lame, and the jokes are even worse. The acting is really pathetic. I can't believe this movie was made. Rather look at American Pie, Going Greek or Road Trip if you're in the mood for a teenage comedy. It's about two girls who break Malibu on their spring. As usual, they didn't do much planning and called them (I think her names Michelle) uncle to crash at his Malibu home. Uncle Bennie strictly forbids them to have any kind of party, and as you would guess, they go ahead and do it. Please, I request you, don't see this movie.
