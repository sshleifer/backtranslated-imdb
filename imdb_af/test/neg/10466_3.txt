Another Indian legend you've never heard before has been released. As the name suggests, it is an inventive revenge that likes to absorb the skeletons of people while they are still using it. As usual, old cemetery (can you say, "Poltergeist?") Disturbed by clich√©d-avid land developers who were built. <br /> <br /> If it was better, the CGI could make the effect more treacherous, but they hit the budget, and it shows - to comic effect. The detached creatures probably had to be kept on the scene during the first few murders - which might add a mystery or impending doom atmosphere - but the unfair director decided to show us in the first five minutes what it looked like, and it was not impressive. The deaths were only poorly done, again with clumsy CGI. I think old spirits always kill by using cheap special effects. As far as the "victims" are concerned, they seem to be laughing for a moment while shouting. It's always obvious who will get it: a character with only a few lines appears, strange sounds are heard, CGI spots fly, exit character. Repeat (several times). <br /> <br /> However, there are some chase scenes with the monster that really made this thing happen. Unfortunately, it seems the director uses it as a device to fall back (so it is used too often) when he can think of nothing else for his characters. Overall, it's pretty stupid, but I've seen worse. This movie is cheap, but it's strange to watch.
