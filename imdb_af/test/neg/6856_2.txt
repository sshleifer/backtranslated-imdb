Lame is really the best way to describe this movie. It has a real poor script, uninteresting dialogue and characters and it is lacking in basically everybody else. <br /> <br /> There are too many characters and the problem is that you don't care about any of them. What the film lacks is one good and clear main character. Instead, the movie has a bit of everything, it has a bit of a hero, it has a little love interest and it has a little villain. I wish it had just a little less Ghoulies, because they are mostly irritating in this movie. <br /> <br /> Ghoulies are supposed to be devilish creatures who murder for pleasure. In this movie, however, everything they want to do is drink beer and watch naked college girls. In addition, someone had the "brilliant" idea to enable the Ghoulies to speak this time. It works really bad and irritating. The Ghoulie dolls were definitely upgraded for this movie, and they are more detailed looking and can do more, but at the same time, they are much fitter than the previous Ghoulies movies. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the purpose for this movie was more comedy than horror. The movie is like an 80-year-old high school comedy (even though this film was released in 1991). It's humor is really the worst and most lame thing about the whole movie. It is so incredibly annoying and not funny at all. <br /> <br /> The story doesn't go anywhere with its story and the movie is basically one big mess that never seems to end. The Ghoulies plot line actually looks nothing to do with the other plot lines of the movie that human characters entail. The movie is not about the Ghoulies who terrorize a college, with the people they are hunting and stopping their disasters. No big surprise that it is Brent Olson's only written movie. He simply has no talent for it and I think he also discovered it and returned to college himself. <br /> <br /> Even compared to previous Ghoulies movies; this movie is just awful! <br /> <br /> 2/10
