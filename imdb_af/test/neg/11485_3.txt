'The Shining' has white, visual flair and an iconic performance by Jack Nicholson. "Ausentes," however, has nothing of these things; although it borrows from its classic ancestor; In view of a man hooking through a door and a woman running around shouting while squeezing a large kitchen knife. Unlike Stanley Kubrick's great psychological horror movie, 'Ausentes' is a work that resonates with a particular lack of genius. It's wonderful, comic awful; This makes the Spice Girls movie look like a work of vital art. 'Ausentes' is the story of a family moving to a gated community in the suburbs. Everything must be good with the world. They will live in peace and quiet; They will calm down their business away from the old street people. But no. Ariadna Gill's character Julia starts spooked by the things that insist on bumping into the night, by empty supermarkets and doors closing themselves; and her husband Samuel, played by Jordi Molla, immediately switches from a retired family man to a wild crop, permanently uncut nutter, spraying Julia with a drug to keep her under his sudden cosh. Molla, much respected as an actor, is absolutely horrible in this. Comic rather than imminent, he simply cannot provoke an imminent expression. He comes just like a limestone ball that has drunk one too much. So is there anything to release this movie? No. The writing is bunch, the plot is not existent and the role without merit. Quite without tension and full of scared moments, 'Ausentes' is an exercise in how not to make a psychological thriller. It's ridiculous and overblown, but being one of the most unintentional hilarious films of the past year is worth a watch.
