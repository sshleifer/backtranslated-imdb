It was on TV last night. I made my way painfully through it and almost went through it. First, except for Leroy, Hilary, and possibly Coco, NO of the other students we're supposed to take care of any observable talent. It's as if HSPA had no standards, just sign on the dotted lines and you're in. <br /> <br /> The story lines were red and obvious. Doris was just impossible terrible. The gay man was such a discarded clich√© (funny, how that school has only one gay man, right ...) I had the Leroy character, but called your teacher an obsession and then had to vandalize the school, Leroy packaging sent. Lisa looks like she's nowhere else, and because she wasn't a talent, I wonder why she liked her. <br /> <br /> I would have rated this one star (terrible), but the music wasn't that bad and I kept the point. It would have worked much better if the students were attractive and actually had talent.
