"The Next Karate Kid" is a thoroughly predictable movie, just like its predecessors. Its predictability often leads to a feeling of impatience on the part of the viewer, which often wants the story to move a little faster. However, despite his delusions and his utmost familiarity, this fourth entry in the series is painless, almost exclusively due to Morita's presence. He does not look tired of his role, and he injects some life and humor into the movie and becomes the best reason for you to see it. Not terrible, but nothing.
