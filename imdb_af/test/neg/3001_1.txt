'Northfork' is what is wrong with indie movies. For all their heavy comments and the attack of major topics, studios will not be the sacrifice we make. For almost two hours, I was under the torture and pain of a movie that started walking like a blind man in a new place and ending up without covering any new ground and happily dying. <br /> <br /> There are parallel stories. It describes a dying town and a dying boy. Two black-dressed men (one of them James Woods) have to force the remaining Northfork residents to leave before opening a dam and flooding the town. The other story returned a boy to the priest (Nick Nolte) who gave him the parents. He dies and is visited, I think, by angels. Among them are Anthony Edwards with bizarre glasses and Daryl Hannah in a bizarre costume that reminds me of Seinfeld's pirate shirt. <br /> <br /> Although it's the plot, it's not what the movie is about. The movie is about nothing. It does nothing, says nothing, does not go anywhere and has nothing interesting to show. Perhaps by design, more likely to be a poster effect of the pretentious, surrealistic David Lynch wannabe - we are an important artificial film that you cannot see - directional. The whole movie is filtered through a gray, pale background that, I think, fits a movie about death. Instead, it simply makes the movie much more difficult to watch. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie about men in black, see 'Men in Black' movies, not too impressive, but compared to 'Northfork' 'They are lifted to' Citizen Kane 'status . If you want to see a movie about a boy's dying watch 'Lorenzo's Oil.' If you want to see a movie wrecking the destruction of a town by water "O Brother, where are you?" If you want to see a movie better than 'Northfork', there are hundreds. If you want to watch a worse movie, there is only a handful. 0 * from ****
