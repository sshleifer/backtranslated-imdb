This is the kind of a late-night cable usually associated with Andrew Stevens or Shannon Tweed. Although it's different from most Tweed and Stevens T&A powered vehicles, it's deadly boring! <br /> <br /> Let's cut to the chase. The real reason to watch this non-thriller is to see Shannon Doherty's breasts. Anyone who says otherwise is a LIAR! However, most of her steaming sex scenes seem to be all smoke and mirrors. <br /> <br /> Note that all shots where her head and chest are displayed at the same time are quick-look-a-boo flashes. The frames where the camera hangs on her naked body, there is little or no face attached or she is behind a dripping wet door. <br /> <br /> All you know boob viewers out there means what it means - Body double! <br /> <br /> However, I must admit that the final where Doherty is bound, blindfolded and threatened with a knife, has provided some fetishist excitement. <br /> <br /> If you find a VHS copy anywhere, buy it! As everyone is involved, it's probably too shy to ever come out on DVD!
