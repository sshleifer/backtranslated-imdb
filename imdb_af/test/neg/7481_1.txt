Nothing Carson Daly ever said or did on this show ever made me laugh, or even a little smile. I don't understand how this show survived for so many years. <br /> <br /> Even the "funny" band member is just like one of those high school kids who thinks nobody is good enough to even watch him. Daly and that man are just arrogant frat boys. They didn't even try to try a little funny. <br /> <br /> AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL show. <br /> <br /> It makes my soul cry. <br /> <br /> I just can't stress enough how terrible this show is. Don't look at it. But if you absolutely need to, I recommend clipping your eyes and clog your ears in advance.
