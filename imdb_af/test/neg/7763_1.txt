"Sex and the city" has some good things for it. The problem is that it was sown with a number of negatives that hurt the eventual assessment and review of the six seasons. <br /> <br /> The good stuff about "SATC" is that many of the conversations are true to life, the romance stories are interesting, and the characters are fun. <br /> <br /> The bad thing is that few women act like full whores. These four women have so many partners, even lesbians in some episodes, that you have no choice but to roll your eyes to the extreme absurdity. Men on the show are mostly portrayed as shallow, degenerate, liars, cheats and buffoons. The dirty language these women use is far above what a normal conversation entails. Why do the writers do these things? Obviously you are on top and need your attention. <br /> <br /> Another thing that bothered me (without spoiling) is how some of the relationships ended. They simply didn't call me or others. I also discussed it. <br /> <br /> Although I gave the show 2 stars in the end, I'm glad I watched the show. I actually watched several times every season. I recommend the show to anyone who doesn't offend strong profanity and soft core pornography. I could have done less with the offensive language and the nudity and sexual acts, but the romance was very good and the saga ended pretty well.
