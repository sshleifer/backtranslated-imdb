The seasoned actors in this do know how to act and prove it before, but the director, who also wrote and produced this travesty, is incompetent at so many levels. O.K. It's a low budget, but I know movie students with lower budgets and lesser-known actors who can do much, much better. For example, since there were people who need to know better, some of the rifles were completely out of place and never existed in those days. The stuntwork was clumsy - the story is over and hokey. If someone uses you a copy of this, give it to a coachman. By the way, I love Westerns and have known many stuntmen and even went to the high school with one of the actors, so I searched for it to be good.
