I hired a copy of this one from Netflix - big mistake. The DVD version titled "The One-Armed Swordsmen" was produced by madmen who thought the battle series would be valued, better pasted into one major chapter as part of a consistent, sequential story. Some of the story is left in separate chapters, which you can choose from the main menu, but the DVD is still a mess. Don't rent or buy. Not that there was anything wonderful about the original story, an absurdly intricate piece of nonsense. Just as I have seen Wang Yu in his head for years, this one is a total waste of time. I had dishwashing detergents that made a better film than that. What the copied DVD version shows us is that no matter how stupid a Chinese writing might be. You need to see some kind of story to worry about how the battle order comes out. <br /> <br /> But the One-Armed Swordsmen "gives you the chance to see both Wang and Shaw Brothers stalwart Lo Lieh busy making a nice son David Chiang. It's always a pleasure It is happening here, Lo plays a rogue villain here, and serves as a good example of why some people really need orthodontists, his film is also characterized by the participation of Taiwanese actor Chang Yi as magistrate. > <br /> Another comment above mentions the compulsory battle-in-the-inn scene (there are actually two) where Wang and Chiang are attacked by a pack of comic barbarians who use what looks like cavalry weapons, what Bruce Lee sounds as they fight, none of which makes sense, but it is good if you don't expect clarity or common sense. It was nice to look anyway. <br /> <br /> Another peculiarity of this production is that there are no significant women characters, there are some female roles, but they play not a serious role in the action or plot. <br /> <br /> If you can find a copy of the original Shaw Brothers One-Armed Swordsman movie, the one explaining why he has just one arm and why he uses a broken sword goes for it.
