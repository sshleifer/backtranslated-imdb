This one is a real stinker. <br /> <br /> The story just isn't the same as most other TZ episodes. It's pretty boring, though Peter Falk's view is like a Fidel Castro look alike, amusing. <br /> <br /> When Twilight Zone is aired on an unannounced hour in my hometown, I will have a sandwich and a drink and establish for some quality entertainment. 9 times out of 10, it's about to be this episode! Strange thing? This often happened to my mom (another TZ fan like me). There were so many times that one of us would say to the others: "I was all watching The Twilight Zone_ and guessing what episode the Cuban dictator episode was!" Of course, some people like this episode, as it gets a score of 6.7 ... how it happened, I have no idea - but it would in itself make a great Twilight Zone plot!
