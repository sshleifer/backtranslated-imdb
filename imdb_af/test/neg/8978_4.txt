Although it was the first Hunter S. Thompson documentary, I saw that it was at its best, despite the involvement of big star gigs like Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, Gary Busey, and a few others. I was dropped by this and yet it was a bit interesting. What watched me was from the old tracks of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and where the Buffalo Roam. Not so good, mostly because of the old guys walking around and things that any fan already knows. I still think they were talking because it could be compressed by at least half. If you're a fan, you'll love something. best wishes
