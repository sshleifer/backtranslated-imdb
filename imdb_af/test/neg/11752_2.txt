I know the original Psycho was a classic and reminded it was a mistake, especially a shot-by-shot remake. I think it's more or less proven by the rest of the comments here. But it's much more wrong with this movie than this. <br /> <br /> The first problem is the color. The original film was shot in black and white, but what few people realized was the original shot after color film was invented. The choice of black and white film was partly a budget affair, but it was also a quiet choice of Hitchcock's. Now, it's not to say that the remake in black and white had to be redone, but the colors of this movie are too wrong. The most dominant colors in the film are orange and green, especially on Marion, which is not supposed to be a flashy character. The bright colors make it look like a happy movie and when events occur in these color schemes, it looks like a cartoon that is more than anything and the audience tends to laugh rather than shout. <br /> <br /> The second problem is the lighting. It is a dark, dark story that needs to be highlighted by dim lighting, but these remakes not only seem to fail in this, but looked in the OPPOSITE direction. Most of the screens are brightly lit even when it is illogical to do so, because it is at night! <br /> <br /> Another obvious problem is Vince Vaughn's performance. Yes, he pulls Norman Bate's discomfort and madness down very well, I don't deny him. But there is one element to the character he couldn't show: the softness. There must be some misleading kindness to the character, at least first, which then disappears as soon as we realize the truth about him. Apart from being a trait of Norman Bates, it is a recognized feature of ALL PSYCHOPATHS !! <br /> <br /> There are some good aspects of this movie. Some of the shows are wonderful. As I said, Vince Vaughn came very close to pulling off a decent portrayal of Norman Bates. Viggo Mortensen and Juliane Moore were great together and their chemistry was very different from the characters in the original, which was a welcome change. Anne Heche might have been frightening, but unlike Janet Leigh, who was unfairly advertised as one of the biggest stars in the film, Anne Heche gave last accounts in the opening credits. <br /> <br /> I read on the cover of a copy of the Psycho novel Gus Van Sant claimed was not a remake of the Hitchcock movie, but rather a new adaptation of the original novel. I now wish that I bought that book and saved the comment, because the commentary is probably the funniest thing I've ever seen. There was no attempt in this movie to conceal the fact that it was a ripe of the original and it would be much more credible than Van Sant tried to tell us that he was really a three ton monkey from the planet Zafromeulax was. So many shots were copied exactly without any real thought why Hitchcock composed the original shot that way. Like the scene in which Sam and Lila speak while their faces are completely covered in shade. Hitchcock covered these actors' faces in the shade because he thought they were bad actors and wanted to hide their faces so that no one could see their terrible performances, not because of any artistic or stylistic purpose. <br /> <br /> In other words, My Review is about as useless as the movie itself by repeating something already mentioned. Like everyone here, I advise you not to waste your time on this movie and get the original one.
