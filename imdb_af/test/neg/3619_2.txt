Snake Island is one of those films that, while sitting and looking at its incredible level of stupidity, makes one wish, the film camera has never been invented. The real reason why Plan 9 From the Outer Space will hold the first title of the worst movie of all time for a while is not so much because it's bad. This is because it's the most entertaining bad movie you'll ever see. Snake Island is the other kind of bad. Snake Island is just as bad it is unbearable. A stupid approach combines with a script written by monkeys typing single keys on transparencies that then overlap to appear dialogue to make the most obvious problems here. Filmed entirely in place in South Africa, the environments in which the film takes place are about the only element that can be considered truth. Many snake shots consist of close-ups so surreal in appearance that you start wondering if specialized snakes are CGI, dolls or real snakes that have been fed very hard drugs. <br /> <br /> William Katt stars, if you can call it that, as a writer going to an island resort about what a river transport seems to be. Coming with him is a variety of very generic, poorly defined characters. It's all about random screenwriters about who survives to the end, but Katt definitely wants to consider shooting his agent. The rest of the role-play is evident from the Home and Away acting school, where any consideration of an unpleasant plot point is accompanied by an open mouth and one's eyes in every direction. The follicle effects are often worse, with an unforgettable scene where a double-legged shotgun sounds like the slightly flat sound effects used by popular boots in such games as BioForge. Meanwhile, snakes explode randomly or jump over. It would be more accurate to call the movie Snake Holocaust. <br /> <br /> Of course, today no Z-grade horror or sci-fi movie is without free scenes of nubile women in a state of disguise. As every woman in the scroll hole, almost, shoots off their clothes, the movie begins less Snake Island and more Snake Island Orgy. But like all the worst stacks, everything is really in this case a lot of setup with no real payout. The sex scenes are never possible, and the death of characters is so flat, so uninteresting that the whole movie becomes meaningless. Unless you're considering watching William Katt run through a blunt forest carrying bad cricket, and hitting snakes in all directions with a cricket bat. For the record, I don't. I thought Anaconda was the worst movie ever made about predatory dreams. I was so much, very wrong. At least Anaconda had a snake that could be scared if they had been suspended for a long time. Some of the snakes shown are man's rifle, and it is no bigger than the shoelaces of some pairs of boots I wore. <br /> <br /> So far, we've got the checklist for bad horror movies running around. The unrecognizable, lame cast is accounted for, as well as poor sound and visual effects. The dialogue is so miserable, so uncomfortable, that I saw better writing and delivery during some of the school games I performed in many months ago. Unfortunately, where Slang Island falls in this respect, the area is deadly for all bad movies. In essence, it's so bad that it's funny. It is so bad that it ceases to be good at opening credits and is painfully the second to start talking. Compared to William Katt's performance in Snake Island, Jon Voight's performance in Anaconda was Oscar-worthy like Russell Crowe's in Gladiator. Not that Voight of Cat is necessarily bad actors, but with so much material you are hard pressed to say a single word. Listening to some of the lines here was like being the victim of a violent crime. One's tendency tends to clear the experience, primarily as a self-defense mechanism. <br /> <br /> Due to the aforementioned failure to be entertainingly bad, I gave Snake Island a two out of ten. My special score for movies that are so bad may not be good, but not bad enough to entertain. It's all just as boring or useless that you can also look at the test pattern. The right way to play "crap" is S-N-A-K-E-I-S-L-A-N-D.
