When a group of dumb children (including an unlikely racist bitch) live at an old home, it awakens four murderous Toltec spirits. Can La Rue save La Rue the day? You will be able to look to the end because of the terrible comedy that appears on the screen. <br /> <br /> "The Dark Power" is the kind of really bad horror / comedy hybrid that Troma has released regularly. Thing is, they don't. release it. It does not excuse the whole thing because it has a terrible synthesizer score (including bad efforts on native American music and worse "comedy" music), bad makeup effects (basically Halloween masks) and horrific acts (Ok The fat guy was good, though everyone else is different, and La Rue, a Western movie animal, seems shy to be there - not that I'm really guilty of it.) The worst thing, however, is the comedy aspect. Certainly, dumb teenagers are one thing, but if the movie is still talking about the Toltec spirits, as if it's the ultimate evil, it's just for them to be terribly annoying, turbulent fool. The combination of horror and comedy takes at least some skill. There is no skill on the screen here, because it's just stupid, and not "so stupid it's fun too". I mean "smoking pot and listening to bad Punk Rock, I'm not stupid" stupid. <br /> <br /> Not even a decent torn face and a chick in small clothes can save this disaster. Terrible movie, and not even worth a rental.
