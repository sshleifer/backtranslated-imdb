One of my co-workers recommended that it be one of the scary movies she ever watched. I checked it with my girlfriend and we gave up after 50 minutes. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I had a long conversation with my colleague (we are still friends!). <Br /> <br /> This movie is as original as the latest movie by Steven Seagal. It does not bring anything to the table at all. The haunting parts were done a thousand times before. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake, however, is the painful slow pace of this movie. The periods between the scares are completely messed up with a meaningless dialogue and many ... nothing. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10 Molotov cocktails
