THE STAR PACKER is one of about 152 million westerns that John Wayne performed in the 1930s. Well, the number is a little exaggerated, but it almost looks like this. This is because these B-movies were quickly made with very low budgets to be the second or lesser feature in a theater. Most Bs were pretty inexpensive and tended to cut corners to keep costs down and the STAR PACKER is no exception. To save costs, accidental music is not used, runs are kept up to less than an hour. The writing is often rather distracted and the actors are mostly less talents - and Wayne himself was far from a household name at the moment. Some of these Wayne features are pretty good, while others, like this one, are viewable, but rather stupid and unimportant. I enjoyed this movie and most of the others, but it's probably because I cut Bs a lot. <br /> <br /> Wayne stars as John Travers - an American Marshall investigating the actions of a local gang to chase locals out and steal from the stage. It's strange, as the movie was apparently in modern times or near as they used phones and modern machine guns - things you just wouldn't expect in Old West. Such anachronisms are actually quite common in B Westerns - as Gene Autry films (for example) abound with them. Wayne's sidekick is Yak - played by Wayne's stuntman and real life friend, Yakima Canutt. The bad guy is an unknown figure referred to as "The Shadow" and gives off his instructions through a black screen. hiding his face! It sounds exactly like a character from a movie series - the kind of bad that kids loved, but adults got hurt because they were so stupid and on a bit like Blofeld or Dr. Evil! The problem is, if you listen to his voice and don't pay attention, it becomes clear early in the film that this "Shadow" is George Hayes. Now, talking about Hayes, it's the same man who is later known in films as Gabby Hayes, but here and in several of Wayne's early films he looks and does nothing like Gabby. In the STAR PACKER he was well-dressed, articulated and clean-shaven - think so! In real life it was believed to be the real George Hayes - though I doubt he was evil! As you can say from the last paragraph, there is no secret in this film. You are left with acting (prudent and nothing more) and stunts - which were really great. Over and over, a wonderful stunt took place after another - such as men riding horses to horse and some great fights - all by Canutt and his friends. Canutt was often John Wayne's double in films - and this has been going on for decades. The problem with some of the stunts, however, is that it seems that the filmmakers actually killed a few horses to get the big "stumbling blocks" later seen in the movie. Until about 1940, filmmakers often hit thin metal wire and ran horses over it at full gallop! In the process, the horses' legs are usually broken and the horses are then gracious! One of the worst examples of this was the film JESSE JAMES - where several horses were brutally killed - leading to the American Humane Society, and insisting that a representative of the organization be on film pictures to certify that animals are NOT in production being hurt. So, since about 1940, these films carry this small indemnity. THE STAR PACKER was made good for the indemnity, and I can't see the horses doing these "tricks" without killing them. <br /> Overall, this is at best a time-saver due to a poor plot, sometimes poor acting and an incredibly brutal attitude towards the horses. I'm not a thriving heart, but I just can't understand this disobedience to a poor old animal.
