I'm not afraid of bad movies. I like bad movies. I enjoy mocking them in the company of my friends. We are really good about it. That said, let me tell you how much I hated this movie. <br /> <br /> Initially it was incomprehensible. Rob Lowe attacks some people, they catch him, but he escapes in this great ol's shooting. There is this singer who we thought died, but she didn't do it unless maybe there were several of them who all looked the same. Cue Burt Reynolds comes in and asks the singer. He looks as if he has just fled into the movie of the Walker, Texas Ranger series and is confused. Then Rob Lowe dies, just he doesn't ... And the worst thing is, there's not enough dialogue or action that doesn't mean people are killed or even trying to enjoy even this movie! And don't start me at random chihuahua. Then there was the fact that it had to fall over the old power structure in Eastern Europe. We didn't know where we were, all the accents seemed "Eastern European" and what was Burt Reynolds and Rob Lowe in the first place? <br /> <br /> I desperately wanted to block the people I thought of this movie and to get my money back, but because I got it as a special (only $ .99), I did decide on it. But what I want to know is how the director got GREENLIGHT to make this darn movie, and what did the "stars" think when they signed up?
