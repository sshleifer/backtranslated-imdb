Ok, I'm normally pretty open-minded about movies. I can usually see a good side to a movie that has been completely thrown by others. This is an exception. <br /> <br /> I won't waste too much energy telling you what's happening, but think Bill and Ted meet the worst police academy movie from them all and you've got "I'm far off away. <br /> <br /> The thing that really gave me this movie was the stupid pure racism that was continuously visible. The general theme of latino / black guys = cool, white guys = lame is slightly amusing for the first few jokes, but when the same joke for the 500th time is repeated (not an exaggeration on the road), both become tiring and offensive . <br /> <br /> For months, I waited for Karma's laws to come back to John Leguizamo for this movie. I almost gave up hope when the 'My VH1 Awards' were shown live in the UK. What followed was Mr. Leguizamo performing the scarce thing of a comical bombing on stage. You must be a complete sadist to laugh at him. Ahem. Ha! Ha! Ha!
