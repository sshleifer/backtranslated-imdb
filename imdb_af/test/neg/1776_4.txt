I was, as Eugene Morris Jerome, in my high school adaptation of the play and this film certainly does not live on Neil Simon's screenplay or imagination. I know this game backwards and forwards and I can honestly say that the play was off. The production was cheesy. The changes in the drama's writing were poor. If you really want to enjoy this play, you should see the real play, not a Hollywood movie adaptation. The Eugene character lacked soul and was too sarcastic in everything he said. The other characters were also off the key. A general disappointment, sloppy, dislous to the play, performed amateurly!
