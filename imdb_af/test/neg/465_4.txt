I must say I was not impressed at all, probably because I expected much more from this movie. Perhaps an emphasis on religion towards science or on the meaning of life, not just a few lines. So, if you expect something to think about after watching this movie, don't do it. It is more psychological than philosophical. I vote 4 because of the end, it makes a little and because I have great respect for the BBC documentary. There are some very interesting scenes that actually made sense. It was a brilliant idea to add it to a movie related to evolution theory, too bad that it wasn't the major. Oh, I just forgot to say it for more than 1 hour, the movie is rather boring and somehow cruel.
