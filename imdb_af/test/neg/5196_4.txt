It must be one of the most annoying, arrogant, sober movies I've ever seen. What a waste of budget and actors. Angelopoulos reached new levels of pretentiousness. Obviously, there is virtually no plot, even though this part of Greek history is important for big movies. He simply had so-called symbolic (actually shambolic) scenes in his mind and he built a whole film around them. Death is the main theme and is repeatedly due to illusion, along with litany, marches and the like, which is just a vehicle for the movie, but unfortunately it is the movie itself. A totally incoherent result, which can just let you say "huh?" or "oh dearest" every two minutes. <br /> <br /> There is no character development, nada, zilch. I usually complain about some movies that have two-dimensional characters, but oh boy, he managed to create one-dimensional characters. It's annoying to us and humiliating to some of the actors. He even managed to make one of my favorite Greek actors, Giorgos Armenis look. <br /> <br /> And go to the core of Angelopoulos movie-up: No, we're not idiots. We don't want cold food. Please tell someone this man symbolism should be subtle. Theo underestimates your hearing so much or you are simply incompetent? Personally, I think he was trying to make a Greek "Underground". No matter how he tried, he couldn't reach Kusturica. <br /> <br /> Only savings: Photography, costumes and the music.
