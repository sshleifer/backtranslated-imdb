This movie wasted 2 hours of my time and just made me "LAME". Nicholas Stoller writes the movie "Yes Man", but straight "it", maybe he should write. <br /> <br /> I'm so disappointed because I've heard the good review. I expected something to be clicked. They say it's from the author of "Gekoppel"? why can't I see the deal? but it just felt like a shallow, exaggerated, kind of movie. I'm so disappointed. Actually, it's not bad if you consider it your average chick movie, but the character of the "bandman" just comes to my nerves. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just didn't pay enough attention to the movie, but yes they have some funny lines and scenes, but I didn't feel the originality. And the end makes the movie a little better. At least the end is not a boring clich√©.
