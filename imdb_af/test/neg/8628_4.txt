A couple is divided during a holiday. Early scenes lead us to believe Barney's character, Jeff Bridges, kidnapped the girl in an inexplicable but preconceived kidnapping. The film plays a few years later, where Jeff (Kiefer Sutherland) is determined to solve her disappearance despite a new love interest. <br /> <br /> The storyline is definitely interesting, but some bad decisions were made when making this movie, which resulted in a nice, clumsy job. <br /> <br /> OK here we go. The abduction scene - apart from two major continuity errors, there is a point where Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are made to perform a small-drawn pet love ritual that drowns in sentimentality to the point of nausea. We know they are in love; The "I swear never to leave" speech only moments in advance was thankful. Jeff Bridges' robot accent is another example. What is it for? Starman is back and it looks like a decade on the planet, he got dirty. The whole plot can then be solved by the introduction of an unnecessary character who, by a rather happy course of fate, has quite wonderful powers of observation. The climate range itself is essentially done much, much better. It is hit with further annoyances and another blinding continuity eclipse. I can go on, but something positive should be said. On a piece, Kiefer Sutherland is the only one to save the face with a reasonably decent performance. <br /> <br /> The 1988 original of the same name (changed from the Dutch title 'Spoorloos' for English speakers) was recommended to me, just for an online rental company to accidentally send me this later Hollywood version . I was surprised that I was both director by George Sluizer and would be interested in knowing his motivation for the remake. I am reliably and thankfully informed that it is of a much higher quality in all areas, including plot. Horah for that, but it doesn't take much.
