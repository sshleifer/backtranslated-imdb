I watched this year on television when I was sick (I don't know, I tend to be smoother with my TV watching when I'm sick, too much trouble to use the remote, I think). <Br /> <br /> From what I can remember, all aspects of the movie - casting, acting, writing, directing, etc. - Best rated. I could have forgiven the historical inaccuracies if this film had a sense of what it was like to work on the Trinity; but it didn't. There were attempts to humanize the scientists, but they were insufficient and never crossed caricatures. <br /> <br /> I didn't know much about the people involved in the Manhattan project, but the depictions in the movie were so awesome that I was interested in learning about the right personalities. And I did it. So I think this horrible movie did a very small amount of stuff. <br /> <br /> It's not an in-depth review, but FMLB doesn't earn either. You can enjoy it if you're a fan of bad movies.
