I hired this movie with my friend for a good laugh. We actually laughed at the video shop by the clerk because of our dubious movie taste. Unfortunately, I don't remember the first half of the movie, because everything I did was to Jane's huge metal bands. and I didn't hear anything because of the incomprehensible lash. The other thing that could get my attention except her metal mouth was her dubious fashion sense. This movie was made in 2005, but it seems as if the costumes have been returning for the clothes in 2000. If you remember the days when Aaron Carter is regarded as a "popstar", and you like high-weaned jeans, single socks and knee-length skirts, then this tiny little drive-up path is perfect for you.
