Artificial melodrama with a script adapted by Mel Dinelli from his play "The Man" relate to an owner of a boarding house that takes in a troubled handyman who may be murderous. In spite of the solid work of Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan (both trying their best), this boring yarn is not very inventive in its one primary set (which is rapidly sowing visually) and the downfall of characters (however, there is a cleverly tries what senses the worst!). Hokey and humorous, with a quiet direction from Harry Horner (maybe Lupino should be targeted?). Where is all the tension promised by the ads? Dinelli was also co-producer. * 1/2 of ****
