My Caddy Limo is destroyed !!! Well, I just had one like it - Over the few years, the Hi Polloi and many of the Elected people were drying around Manhattan. <br /> <br /> It was much more entertaining than this movie I can tell you. Lord, what a bomb - like in RPG. I also rode a lot more stars in my white Caddy than it appeared in this dud of a movie. <br /> <br /> Robert Patrick is a very serious actor and has done a credible job with the nonsense he had to work with. Unfortunately, Rutger Hauer played his role as a red-cross circus. If he can't take it seriously, why should she hear? The director had to kick off his buttocks in the first hour of filming. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was written by 10 yrs. Old for 8 yrs. Surprised there wasn't much more on the sets. Oh yes, I'm a movie fanatic - ergo - you have to take the bad to do good.
