for people who have absolutely no idea of ​​what a comedy is. This not only includes the people who love this movie, but the people who made it. What could they possibly think? Madonna play Judy Holliday? Please, she can't even play MADONNA (if there is actually a Madonna). I hope Griffin is thinly paid. He deserves every penny he has, because if it doesn't kill his career, nothing will. I'm sure the few people who actually paid to see this movie made it feel like their pockets were chosen. Madonna is obviously over the fact that she has embarrassed her about her actual lack of talent as an actress, but you can't be embarrassed anyway. She has no connection with the rest of the cast; She seems to have appeared on the set and said, "OK, I'm here, I'm going to make myself ashamed of the absolute worst Judy Holliday impression someone has ever seen, stay out of my way now, and then continued to do exactly that. I know the phrase "rotten Madonna film" is superfluous, but it certainly does. It is painful to look at a totally inactive and talented actress, make a fool of herself, but it does not disturb her, as she does it again and again. <br /> <br /> The only remote thing about this "comedy" is that she actually managed to find people who gave her the money to make it. Now it's funny.
