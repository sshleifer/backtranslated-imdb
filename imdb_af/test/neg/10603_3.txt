I wanted to like this movie, but I couldn't. It had the potential to be a very cool, hip remake of a cool show, but that's where it fell apart. It was too hip, too cool. First, all the cool lines and scenes in the preview are displayed, which I have seen many times. And the editing was very diverse, so the screens didn't seem to flow together and they all looked out of place. Claire Danes, who I love as an actress, has failed to break her into other high school acting roles. The only light spot was Giovanni Ribisi as Pete. She was a little stupid, but actually smart style was funny and refreshing. Overall, I would recommend just watching the previews rather than watching the movie and wishing it was more.
