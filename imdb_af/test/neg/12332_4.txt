"Love Life" explores a very culturally relevant scenario of a comfortable marriage between a lesbian and a gay man. I found the subject compelling, even if the conflict was a little forced and too easy to solve. For example, Thomas falls for Joe a little too fast and convenient for the plot. There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses ... the one who got the most from me was the fact that Joe's face-to-face haircut configuration changed. In the end, I switched myself more by this movie than moved. Stephan D. Gill has a pretty body and has been showing it with pornstar skill and exuberance for quite a few times, and overly frequent cheats to suit. Many times the movie seems to be full of porn. Stephanie Kirchen does a good job, but my moment of relief at the end was a little sullied to me, because I was in the mood for a good skirt in the shower at the end of this movie.
