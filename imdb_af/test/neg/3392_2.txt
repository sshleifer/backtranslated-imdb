This DVD is barely 30 minutes long and has dull interviews revealing that the average Slipknotian has an IQ of about 30. But these aspects are the least problematic here. <br /> <br /> The real problem is that Slipknot is one. some of the least talented metal bands ever sell more than 100 000 units of their crap. (The only reason I say "one of the" instead of "the" is because System Of A Down is even worse.) Like Ed Gein's friends, this band's music is cut down from centuries-old metal cliches, which must Be found in both their image and their ultra-dull music. In fact, their image is so nice; their videos are like bits of cheese-like horror movies, so they fulfill at least some purpose or entertainment. <br /> <br /> However, their music is of no quality - whatsoever: just a bunch of clumsy, hearing-a-million-before-play-only-on-the-guitar neck riffs that are in no way interrelated and yet randomly grouped to form "songs" that have no cohesion, no highlights, nothing. But if the riffs are really bad then the fever is even worse: Slipknot's singer has a stereotypical and therefore uninteresting "evil" growl - the kind of 90% of all metal bands today - but this is nothing compared to when this fraudulent hiccups started trying. to sing! Still, what can one expect? Rule 39 of the handbook "Nu Metal" says very clearly: "You will alternately growl and sing. Ignore the fact that the two styles do not mix well, because most of your fans are so deaf-deaf, they will love even if you are **** in the microphone. "Slipknot is at their worst when their" singer "starts to" stick out "melodies. <br /> <br /> But back to their image. It is stolen, copied, ripped off, clipped, borrowed, taken without anybody else. Bungle not to ask. You've never heard of them? Of course you don't. You just listen to nu-metal, and Mr. Bungle is quite far from that, and beyond any categorization anyway. They also had masks - grotesque, horror, similar to those of Slipknot, which I could add - in the late 80's and early 90's. This band, whose foreman Mike Patton is from Faith No More, never made it big because their music was not aimed at the average music fans (to put it mildly). So, basically Slipknot aren't even original in the image section. They have nothing more to offer, so it will be forgotten in a few years: as soon as the masks become boring for the legions of their visually-devoted fans, that is when Slipknot will be forced to only with their generic music in the music market. compete. <br /> <br /> Talking to Mike Patton, it is interesting that a number of nu-metal bands often make his song a big influence. Predictable - and grateful - Patton was not so flattered and denied that he was ever proud of having an impact on one of the worst metal subgenres ever. <br /> <br /> Having said that, enjoy it. this short DVD and the inexpensive voltage it can offer to the untrained ear and bored eye. And then the Slipknot posters polish, because in a few years no one will care for the poor. <br /> <br /> After I saw Corey in the documentary "Get Thrashed", I finally understood why he was wearing a mask: he is a blue eye with baby-colored ginger, like Dave Mustaine's younger brother! Not exactly scary. <br /> <br /> For more of my music worlds, go to: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/1 <br /> <br /> Please bid me hard, very hard, by on "no "click below.
