Cameron Diaz, James Marsden, Frank Langella: It's an all-star power cast but "The Box" proves it's not a solid movie guarantee. The premise sounds promising: A couple gets a visit from a mysterious person offering them a million dollars. The downside is that someone will die, a person they probably won't know. So what are you doing? It gives us an interesting story for about 30 minutes. Then the story is completely closed. Vague uninspired plot lines on an alien conspiracy regarding NASA, nothing is really explained here. <br /> <br /> "The Box" is a disappointment, could have been so much better. But since it is based on an ultra short story, it explains the continuity errors.
