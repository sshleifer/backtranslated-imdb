How can anyone who likes the previous JP movies even sit through this 1 hour reel? There are so many stupid things about this movie, it is sensationally fascinating !! I remember seeing JP as a kid, this was my favorite movie and franchise, the play, the SFX the Music, the direction! All fantastic, JP2 was OK to me, and it is exactly the same, apart from a few dumb moments (such as the gymnast who kicks a raptor ..), but on a whole a viewable and reasonable movie experience. <br /> <br /> But the third has no point !! It is supposed to be a successor to Carry of JP2 and yet it includes brand new things in the franchise that was impossible to miss on the previous 2 movies! for example: 1) The "new" mega Spinosaurus - Serious, what the hell !! This thing follows them everywhere they go, they can't escape its presence and yet in the lost world (same island) you see it once? do you hear that? does anyone even know it? NO! It's ridiculous! The strong character in the previous 2 movies was and will always be the T-Rex. What are the d (urr) irector "Joe Johnston" going to? Kill it! as soon as you see the great T-Rex in all its wonderful roaring glory, it is killed and you never see it again. A new Dino in town is the excuse. Where did it come from? not a single explanation! and don't start me on the whole satellite phone-in-the-dino belly thing! 2) Just when you start to find out how stupid the Spinosaurus is, you see the Raptors. Except for their new "Punk" Haircuts, it looks very credible! * Phew * they will make this movie visible right? ... WRONG! now they talk to each other !! and the excuse for those who speak in this movie and not in the first and second ... wait for it ... Evolution! - Yes, the process of millions of years in just a few months from when the second movie ended, wonderful! Certainly, they had to become opposed thumbs and created tools! OK, I'm not going to say anything about the plot anymore, because it goes on my nose, so I'll shut it down: Jurassic Park is a classic, JP3 is a bad sucker punch for any of the original fans of the series, me favorite franchise was good and really dead after you watched this Monstrosity (no pun intended). Avoid this movie like the plague
