This low-budget film about a writer working in a London casino has a terrible screenplay, wood performance, and not much to recommend. Of course, it will appeal to highbrows for whom "mainstream" is a swear word, and which automatically adds 20 IQ points when they hear a British accent (excuses to Jeff Foxworthy). <br /> <br /> The script is full of holes (did he write another book or not?), clichés (relationship problem: his work days, he works nights) and offers so little insight into such basic principles as character motivation that it needs a speech story to just move the story together. <br /> <br /> In an effort to keep the audience out, it includes a street battle scene that is about as realistic as a high school production by Julius Caesar. <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​scintillating dialogue is, "I'll see you ten and increase you twenty," then RUN to see this movie. Otherwise, save your money. <br /> <br />
