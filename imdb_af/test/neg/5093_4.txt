I was really looking forward to this movie, but unfortunately it did not lead to expectation. <br /> <br /> A good movie has identified / empathized / sympathized with the main actor. Unfortunately, it was very difficult to do with Samantha Morton. <br /> <br /> The storyline was very unfounded and does not flow as it would / could have done. <br /> <br /> Keifer Sutherland seems to be a little more than window decoration and has made me wonder why he agreed to play what seems to be a bit of a part. Beautiful scenery and the acting of Tem Morrison and Cliff Curtis were about the only plus. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's a kiwi that I make the bar higher for locally made movies. Perhaps the change of director / presumably difficult to work with chief actor, my opinion biased. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm trying to make excuses for a movie that might have been good. <br /> <br /> Many Maybes still don't explain why this movie is just something special. <br /> <br /> It might have been good, it wasn't.
