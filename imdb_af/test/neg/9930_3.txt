This film tried, but eventually it was a waste of talent. It was hard to try to be "sexy". I don't do the work of such actresses as Ellen Barkin and Peta Wilson (who will find something other than TVs "Le Femme Nikita" worthy of her talents.) I just didn't find even in me. Wilson's so-called near-seductive scene with Mrs. Barkin any real emotion, although I know the thespians have been trying very hard to make the scene work. If the sexual elements of Wilson's hidden sex victim do not touch our heart (which did not even end it, it did not deserve), not even the murderer of the plot. Maybe it was the writing or maybe the direction, but I didn't feel like someone in this movie, and without this feeling, a movie didn't work for me. If you are interested in a movie about lesbianism, there are at least two films on either side of the spectrum to check: 1.) The gulity of "Bound" which works well in a noir environment; and 2.) The more honest and touching of a lesbian growing up in hell's kitchen, called "All Over Me." It is a well-defined indie from the mid 90's that deals with the age issue with feeling, not forced sexuality. Both are better rented than mercy, which has almost nothing.
