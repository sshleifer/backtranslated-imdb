It's 1 hour and 24 minutes of pure boredom! <br /> <br /> In this Action movie even the gun sucks Baldwin (HK G3A3). It was sent to recycling in the mid-1980s. It is only used by terrorists, bankers and military museums. <br /> <br /> If I knew this movie, it was bad, I'd rather watch 10 episodes of MacGyver saving the planet. <br /> <br /> No groove, no ride and no feeling. View the Tupperware channel ?? it is more exciting than sorry for a movie. This movie does not earn a '0' on the scale. Best luck next time, Baldwin. Until then, I'll sit here watching my teens grow? It's much more exciting than 'Target' ??.
