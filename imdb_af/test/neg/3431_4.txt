This (very) low-budget movie is fun if you are a John Krasinski fan, but is otherwise disappointing. At least it was short, so I didn't feel I wasted too much of my time. John's scenes are funny enough, but the attempt at 'deep' scenes with Lacey Chabert is pretty misleading. It looks like it might be a funny movie, but some characters are just as exuberant while the others are too much to just flatten. Don't start me at the end. It was completely unquestionable and didn't even fit with the rest of the movie. I would say, however, that I was not bored, so I rated it above a three. Fans of John Krasinski will enjoy seeing him with a bandana and socks to eat his head and eat Cheez-Its. Oh, and make sure you look at John's deleted scenes, they are better than some actually included in the movie.
