I saw it on a screen DVD, a few months before it was released. <br /> <br /> I like the main characters and the overall story, but some scenes are pretty messy and confusing. The sets were alright, but a few looked just like a remnant of Freaks & Geeks or reminded me of a cellphone commercial shot in a middle-class home. Certainly not what the DVD cover claims to be, "Barely the next stoner classic". <br /> <br /> Wardrobe and hairstyles are well done and yes, there are really really nice girls in this, always nice to see a nice look. <br /> <br /> Almost every scene contains guitar that just drank up and down. Sound design was a little poor. I think less would have been the best.
