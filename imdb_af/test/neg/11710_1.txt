This movie turns the facts of Anne and Mary's lives into something unrecognizable. To make Mary Boleyn, who was actually a dull and foolish, and make her the "good" sister, is just stupid. It's Anne, who was actually the more interesting character, and that's why it's her life, not Mary. It has been said so often. <br /> <br /> In response to a previous review, I failed to see how Anne's life was so "criminal" ... to me it was Henry who was the right criminal. Whatever Anne's motives for winning the king and keeping her love for a crown and husband, must be taken in the context of the time these real events took place. Anne, compared to most courtiers in her time, was a relatively innocent figure. Most modern historians discount or have reprimanded most of the myths and reports that this movie continues over her, and I have never heard of anyone telling the rumor that she slept with her brother. This movie is so sensational and fake that it is disturbing to think that anyone without knowing anything of this era in history can run away to believe something that gave this movie a fact. <br /> <br /> I didn't even get into the strange filming of the movie ... but I'm pretty sure cameras were not invented in the 16th century, so I don't understand why Anne and Speaking Mary with one in the movie ... this is a very bad plot that is devised and frightened and annoyed to put it mildly. <br /> <br /> Anne of the Thousand Days is also not accurate, but is infinitely more entertaining and at least approaches the story of one of the most intriguing women of history. Don't even consider renting it. It's two hours, you'll never be back!
