Ever wonder how the worst movie ever made? Stop wondering. I tell you, Michael is it! <br /> <br /> It's not "heartwarming," "entertaining" or "Travolta at its best." It just sucks. If I had children, I would show them to Deep Michael before Michael! <br /> <br /> A chosen John Travolta, an excited and naked William Hurt, and a moment to die Jean Stapleton lifts this maze of a movie. <br /> <br /> But wait ... you'll sing Andie McDowell! Yes. Hollywood is really about us with this one!
