This horror film has no horror or even light tension. Even the gore is not good. The plot would have some promise if it was done by someone who cares about what they are writing / filming, but the people who made this movie obviously don't. Basically, the movie goes into a series of passes and starts like this: <br /> <br /> The main character insists she's not crazy. <br /> <br /> "Milo" sneaks into his yellow raincoat or rides ahead of a car on his bike. <br /> <br /> The main character insists that she is not crazy and touches her passion as a teacher. <br /> <br /> Someone is killed in an unsatisfactory manner. <br /> <br /> Main character insists she is not crazy and builds up some fake sobs. <br /> <br /> Do we see a pattern here? If you don't, you can enjoy this movie. Otherwise, look something else. The budget is low, low, low and it shows (unlike the EVIL DEAD, which lets you forget about its crap budget), and the play is bad, bad, bad (with the exception of the caretaker). Generally, the movie is boring, boring, boring. I can't think of a single scene that was actually well done. In fact, I didn't really love the movie, I actually turned it off ten minutes before the end, something I rarely do ... heck, I watched the non-mixed MANOS, THE CLONE, and wanted to go through. <br /> <br /> 3/10. Save yourself and look again at PHANTASM.
