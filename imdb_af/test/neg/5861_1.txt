* Spoilers forward, but it shouldn't matter, because I hope you won't see this one anyway. <br /> <br /> If you were planning to see this one, I strongly recommend you not. Because it was one of the most wasted 1Â½ hours I experienced. <br /> <br /> First, it's a complete rip-off of the big movie "Battle Royale". It's so stupid to watch a lame American TV show like "Cops" or "Candid Camera". <br /> <br /> The plot is completely predictable. One challenger who is pregnant and another is a nurse. Anyone who does logical thinking understands in the beginning what should happen between them. <br /> <br /> The concept has been torn as before and the film has the pleasure of making this movie enjoyable. I mean, the preggo shoots a man in the back and no blood or even a trace of the hit in the back. <br /> <br /> I can go on forever without getting something good about it, so take your money and get a copy of Battle Royale instead of watching this piece of shit. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10, too bad, I couldn't rate it lower. Almost Scream 3 makes a masterpiece.
