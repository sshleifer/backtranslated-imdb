The Salena incident is by far the best film director, Dustin Rikert, who doesn't say much. In the past, movies (and I use the term "movies" loosely), the director takes ideas from Hollywood blockbusters and makes them very marginalized. The Salena incident is no different. The movie is basically Con Air meets Aliens which was done with the estimate of your average film school production. The movie is played with out-of-focus shots and is plagued by special effects that may have problems with most high school computer animation classes. For example, almost every screen blast is mated the same fire effect across the screen. <br /> <br /> The poor effects and production value are only compromised by a flawed plot and rocky dialogue. In a sense, the story coincides like an outline of overused Hollywood clich√©s. The movie starts with the worst CGI Alien ship ever crashing into the worst CGI earth ever made and an army team investigating. Subsequently, a prison transport bus, which is the worst of the worst across the country, is being overthrown by the prisoners with the help of their blonde girls armed with silicone implants. The prisoners escape and walk in the village of Salena where they meet the strangers who ... SHOCK ... escaped from a strange prison transport that carries the worst of the worst from across the galaxy. The inmates and their inmates armed with just guns and sad words must flee the aliens and escape the city before the International Space Alliance. * Calm eyes * Bomb the city in oblivion. <br /> <br /> The only true enjoyable parts of the movie is when the actors (who are clearly undermined by the scriptures) give the freedom to improvise, and also when they flutter the smaller of the alien creatures. fire gun. Other than that, the movie is not really worth anybody's time, let alone the plastic that makes up the DVD. How terrible was that? Let's just say the Secretary of Defense is about 90 years old, working in a high-tech office of 1950's real estate office and wearing a Looney Tunes tie. Yes, if it hadn't been enough before, the man in the cost of the PENTAGON is a tie with legs and the path. The movie ends basically (HAHAHahhaaa I said, culminating ...) with the last remaining soldier walking in the group of prisoners and guards and the newly formed team fights away from the evil aliens - who, for some strange reason, lead them straight back to the Alien ship? yes ... <br /> <br /> The movie has a heart but is working with a horrible direction and even worse camera. Someone needed the DP to beat and tell him that there is more to cinematography than repetitive, stagnant, breast levels. This movie is not really worth renting (if ever so far) that it is not as terribly bad as the latest films made by the director, which reduces the lag, but is nowhere near the sight theater.
