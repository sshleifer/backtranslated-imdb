Even MST3K couldn't make this painful, long and ultimately sensible breaking bug funny or entertaining. While most bad movies in themselves are hilariously bad, this is one of the few videos that use the word badly in its literal sense. <br /> <br /> The element that makes it so painful to look at is not a lack of story, but the fact that SOOOO is packed in the first half hour is that it is completely ridiculous and harder to follow as a highway while driving without headlights. <br /> <br /> The hero of the movie, Ator, is no more than eye candy for this literal energy sucker of a movie. Dressed in a cloth and sport "like melons," as Joel put it, he belongs more in a fitness magazine than here. <br /> <br /> I would only recommend it to die hard, and I mean die-hard followers of cheese. If you have an enemy, they recommend this movie. If you do this through this, I praise you. You should do it by anything.
