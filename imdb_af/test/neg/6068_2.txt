For a movie I really see, I was very disappointed. I had no expectations of the fact that it was another Amadeus, but expected a more meaningful portrayal of Beethoven's last years. <br /> <br /> The performance by Ed Harris was wonderful, but the story line was so poor that the movie simply moved <br /> <br /> The only pleasant part of the movie for me was the performance of the 9th, and from that stage I could run out happily without ending. <br /> <br /> I felt very dissatisfied and still felt something was missed.
