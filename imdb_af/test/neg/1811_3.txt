To be honest, I've never been to the Congo or even Africa, and after watching the TV movie Heart of Darkness, I don't think I want it. The film totally shames the book at the highest possible level. Although the book was not the best I read, I appreciated the book a hundred times more after watching the movie. Nicolas Roeg, the director of the movie, did a horrible job depicting Joseph Conrad's novella in a movie. I give Roeg a little credit to try the impossible by making the book in a movie, but it might not be the job for him. The film was unsuccessful in expressing any part of the novella, except the basics of the plot. The set and scenery also lacked the beauty of Conrad from Africa in the book. In the book, Marlow saw so many wonders, but in the movie you didn't have the same experience. No, I don't blame everything on the director; the acting in the movie was just awful. All the actors were boring and uninteresting. Throughout the movie I felt as if the actors did not protest any emotions, as if they were reading the scripture all the time. Tim Roth, who plays Marlow, did not portray Marlow's sense of adventure well for his trip to the Congo. Marlow's journey to find Kurtz was supposed to give businesses, but I didn't experience it in the movie. I would not recommend watching this movie, especially if you have already read the book. It does not come close to the justification of Joseph Conrad's novella. Conrad's words catch the reader and take them on the journey with Marlow, on his quest for Mr. Kurtz, like the movie. A great novella, but a very poor movie. Heart of Darkness, the film, is based on the book written by Joseph Conrad, also called Heart of Darkness.
