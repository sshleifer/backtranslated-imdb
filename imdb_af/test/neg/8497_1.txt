This movie made me crazy. I believe the original of this movie, The Mask, was a great movie, worth buying and watching. I strongly believed they had to make a successor, but when I saw it, I thought again. <br /> <br /> This movie spoiled the whole idea of ​​'The Mask'. Masks off? A baby flying around in a room? My little brother, who is seven, didn't even laugh, and he's in this childish movie, but it was worse. A clumsy shit !! I'm telling you now, please don't look at this movie, it's a waste of money and a waste of time. Instead, you can actually have fun! See 'The Mask', but don't, I repeat, look at this drunk of the junk. Thank you.
