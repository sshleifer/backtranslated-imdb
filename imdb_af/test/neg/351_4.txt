I saw this movie as part of a Billy Graham program. The church I attended was part of a community outreach to give God and Christianity to our community (Hartford, CT, USA). I was one of the counselors who helped participants (who were invited to come forward and make any kind of religious appeal they wanted ... and to follow them up to the movie. As such, it did what it did I was supposed to do, and I personally found it a medium to strengthen my faith in God, and I found it very useful for those I consulted, especially in the work of Kim Darby This movie And the parents (the Wintons?) were, in a way, a little overdrawn .... no one tells their child if they think he or she can be the parent of an illegitimate child , something like the Wintons has "oh no no, not it." is not exactly what they said, but the sympathetic audience I saw had a laugh at whatever they said, and also at the boy's stressful "No, MOm, not me."
