There seems to be a spectrum of theater. On the left there are movies that are mostly made for entertainment and / or commercial purposes. In the middle there are movies that are both entertaining and artistic. On the right are movies that are not so commercial, but more cinema than art as theater and product. <br /> <br /> I'm not here to say that one part of the spectrum is better than any other, but if a movie goes too far to one side, it's rarely good. This is the case with Naqoyqatsi. <br /> <br /> I had no idea what to expect when I see advertising. A few friends went and asked if I wanted to come together. None of us knew what to expect, and eventually none of us was satisfied. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are awesome images. Yes, I'm amazed at how long the filmmakers went to search the archive. Yes, the soundtrack is enjoyable to listen to, and probably the best part of the experience. The thing is, it's going so far to the right of the spectrum that I said I can't say anything nice about the movie as a whole. <br /> <br /> This is preaching. This is a stumbling block of symbolism and clear morality. It says nothing new or forces the viewer to explore life in a new way. It just tells us things we already know (that is if we can even find out what it says). <br /> <br /> This movie is simply art for the sake of art. An attempt to say, "See how deep and foolish we can be by fitting!" When a movie becomes more about how clever or intelligent its creators are than its subject, it ceases to be a movie and it just becomes celluloid self-satisfaction.
