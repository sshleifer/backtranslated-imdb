No, * Hitch * is definitely NOT a romantic comedy about an earlier-left-pundit-driven reactionary-pundit Christopher Hitchens, though it would surely be a cleaner movie. A submissive English Englishman, who burned black cigarettes and Guinness, gave advice - and sharp political comments - to loving men: "Look at her OLD when you talk to her, and your utility! And remember: name someone" a neo conservative "makes you a de facto anti-semite! Can you get nothing straight, your liberal pantyhose?" <br /> <br /> Oh well. Instead, we get Will Smith, whose continued success at least stays with me. I'm apparently alone in this regard. Smith is the strongest man in Hollywood because of this writing: Americans just can't help throwing their money on him. I, on the other hand, find his smugness impenetrable, unmasked by a scene here (spoiled by the trailer) where he experiences a drastic allergic reaction to seafood. We know Smith will jump back to his meager, over-muscular look, as there is a fat sit-com actor (Kevin James) at hand who makes him foolish. We have to laugh hysterically when the slum starts to dance like a jackass (cue "Everybody Dance Now!" By CC Music Factory), but why would a straight arrow accountant act in such a way? I've been working with several straight-line accountants for years, and I can tell you that in Norman Mailer's unforgettable phrase, "tough guys don't dance" and don't do straight-line accountants. Do I take it too seriously? Or - and here is a daring thought - perhaps the authors cannot draw a logical character to save their lives. <br /> <br /> With the authors, they talk with a wonderful idea for Smith's love. interest: a writer for a tabloid newspaper (Eva Mendes). Since when do tabloids earn love? Which universe am I anyway? - Everyone here at IMDb is actually talking about these trips. Or you all need to collect the bar in terms of entertainment for your money, or I'm just a skunk at the garden party. (I and 150 million other long-suffering boyfriends and men.) Anyway, if I can simulate Smith's Hitch and give my male readers some smooth advice: if you're dragged to see * Hitch *, tell you better Half, "Hey, it was pretty good" after the movie was over. Don't be overhistoric; Don't bother about it - she'll know you're lying to her. Praise it in a slightly surprising way, as if the movie was better than you expected and was not the indignation it actually was. But what do I say, hello? - We know all movements. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10.
