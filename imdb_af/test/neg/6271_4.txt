One of my favorite "bum" actors, C. Tom Howell, stars in this low remake of WOTW. He walks a lot, while a CGI-generated spider machine goes to kill everyone. Of course, the budget for this one was pretty low. It was also one of the Asylum productions. Have you seen any of these? Yikes! I'm not sure why anyone could do that, while the big-budget Spielberg version killed them at the box office. And if the truth is told, the version isn't that hot. The George Pal version of the 1950s remains the best representation of the H.G. Wells novel, primitive special effects and all. Maybe because Gene Barry was much more convincing than Howell or Tom Cruise.
