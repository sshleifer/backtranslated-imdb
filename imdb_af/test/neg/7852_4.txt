Paul Muni and Bette Davis dominate monsters, while the shabby studio Archie Mayo seems distracted and unaware of this racially challenging film that evokes his "bittersweet ending" by condemning segregation attitudes. Heavily handed over and poorly constructed, the film collapses under its own weight within the first fifteen minutes, with an out-of-court court in which it never recovers, since Mr. Muni begins to chew the landscape by hollering the yard and crying in an almost incoherent way. <br /> <br /> Johnny Ramirez is a Mexican American on the other side of the track who, through determination and grit, reaches a degree of store-front night school. In his first major case involving a car accident, he is simply unclear and quickly made to see the fool by his benevolent opponents and an impatient judge who recommends that he be dissatisfied. Destroyed by the setback, an evil Johnny takes a job at a gambling joint where he is befriended by Mr Charlie Roark (Eugene Palette) who likes his style. The owner cuts him in place, but problems arise with Mrs. Roark (Davis) who also wants a piece of Johnny. She kills Charlie, implies Johnny and slowly gets angry before being acquitted and is free to be with a high society Wasp who declares to him that they are "different tribes, cruel" and it will never work. When she flees to escape his anger, she is killed by a car. Ramirez sells the casino and moves back to its poor environment, rationalizing that it is best to stay alone. <br /> <br /> In addition to this terrible denial, Bordertown has a series of bad appearances to compliment the overall ugliness of the story. . Unfairly, as his fate is possible, Muni's Ramirez is so shabby and arrogant, it becomes difficult to show sympathy for such a bumpy blunder. Davis is no better than the less-than-loyal woman who is similar to the same adolescent emotions of Muni. Her Lady Macbeth crazy scenes give no indication that she will be the best movie actress of her era. Margaret Lindsay as Muni's American Dream is cold, remote and flat. <br /> <br /> Bad as Bordertown is (and that's a lot) it remains an interesting indication of times and acceptable attitudes. The rest is just a mishmash of bad-acting and uninspired direction.
