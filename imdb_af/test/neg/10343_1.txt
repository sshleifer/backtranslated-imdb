Stealing is a crime, and these guys, Kenny Yakkel and Corbin Bernsen, look like they're going to get away. I didn't even see this movie, but I don't just know it's sucking, but the fact that it steals the story of another movie, or 2 movies, for that matter is such a shit (and if IMDb will allow much more than just a bonkie) that I am filled with anger and feel like I just throw myself out of the window and just have to end everything. I think it's a bit, but stealing is worse. <br /> <br /> Ever seen Pontypool? It was this wonderful little zombie movie made in 2008, this radio host goes into work, and then this zombie attack happens. We just see what's going on inside the radio station, and the only guess we've got on the outside is the occasional calls from their eye in the air, Ken Loney (easily the funniest moment in the movie in my mind) and the BBC asks for an update on the situation. From all the reviews I've read, and from the conversation I had with my friend (who saw this movie and Pontypool), this movie was exactly like the story, with little tweaks here and there. So throw originality and creativity out of the window. As for the zombies, or the infected, whatever you want to call. They are exactly the same thing, just because they are infected, they do not change the fact that they are unconsciously walking, and have an eternal end to flesh. They are zombies. ZOMBIES !! <br /> <br /> ZOMBIES !!! Okay one for many, but back to this crappy movie. The Zombies of what I heard are much like those in 28 days later, another better movie, with their mad anger and even more bad flesh of flesh. That's where Zombie movies define themselves, the story doesn't matter in a zombie movie (as long as you don't take the idea of ​​another movie). Certainly, a zombie movie can be improved by the story, like at Pontypool, but the zombies must be somehow original. 28 days later, the mad raging zombie began. Pontypool I can't even begin to explain those guys without destroying the movie. The Evil Death, I think all I have to do is just type the name because come on, it's The Evil Dead. Romero is the master, and he has gone through all kinds of zombies, from the painted face games in Dawn of the Dead to raging zombies in the Diary of the Dead, and he did each with his own unique style. <br /> <br /> So, after talking about other big zombie movies, I think it's about time I explain why I hate this movie without even seeing it. This movie to the right puts out the original storyline to Pontypool, which I think is called plagiarism and is illegal in this country and many people are kicked out of school to do this thing, but in Hollywood it is allowed, and apparently approved. It's not the only movie that takes the outline of another movie and just tries it differently. The 90's are like the worst movie ever, sure it had a few gems, but decade, and that's because all the movies were exactly the same. My favorite, the crime movie with a twist so big you will never guess it to the end. They force you to feed one suspect, it seems impossible that it is none other than him, then, bam, even this time it was this guy, you just had to look at the screens where he was not there and when he would secretly point out of the blue, "hey guys, what did I miss?" OH! Didn't see that it came ya! Well, I'll leave a cliché as my final statement. This is a movie you definitely want to miss.
