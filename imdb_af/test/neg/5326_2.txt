One of the stupid movies in the history of the theater. Wait, I'll take it back - this movie can't be included in any "theater" category; It belongs to categories such as "waste", villages or similar categories. Ironically, it's even over two garbagemen. The film is "Men At Work", a lightweight crime comedy that starred the 1990s of Estevez (Sheen) brothers. The Asian and undisputed plot line, the bad play, bad dialogue, poorly executed stunts and slapstick, continuity errors and high rate of the name actors who are never seen again, it was anyway a very bad movie (in its core, I mean). It was the kind of movie that could be good for one thing: you can see it about 200 times, learn every line, and in a camp it keeps being completely out and about with your * wasted * friends and assures your status as the biggest dorks in your tenth class. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, I actually submitted an IMDb trivia entry (along with this bad review) to the movie's IMDb website just because I saw a dull little punk - music joke that apparently no one else saw (about the Butthole Surfer image). I was so confronted with the reason I even had to waste my time, which looked like a supportive trivia note, when I really wanted to do that, Emilio's scene was blown up. No, wait, he has already done it. Thank you, dude!) I'm so glad I * wasted * only time on this, not real money. For that matter, may I have at least one tenth of their budget? Anyone other than this director (Emilio) could have made two or three much better movies, just like they spent blowing cars, putting bikini-clad bimbos in the background, and defeating the useless extras (handlers) in hazmat packs. I want to call Emilio's writing credit, but it will be a great deal to write this script "write" - it's more like chalk-scraped cartoon ideas. And Charlie Sheen, if you read it, I accept M.A.W. had to have been part of your career in which you were a cooked, hooker-loving Hollywood brat who had not yet grown up. (Oops! Sorry, I think that part of your life is not over yet. Be quick, you're half a man. "Such a promising talent, so * wasted *? Oh, look, it's again.)
