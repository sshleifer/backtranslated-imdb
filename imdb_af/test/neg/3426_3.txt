A very hip, smooth, gentle reinterpretation. <br /> <br /> They fell in the "because it's modern, it needs to be hip, smooth, etc." stage. <br /> <br /> "Romeo and Juliet" performed this idea much more successfully, but I really think it's time we passed the two extremes here (period vs vs edgy movie). <br /> <just because it is a "modern" narrative, it doesn't mean that the movie should look like a magazine ad, or something with drugs or guns. <br /> <br /> As the bumps as Subtle as the painted words, Macbeth would be a much stronger movie. As it is, read Shakespeare. Read it out loud. Ask your Oxford dictionary a few questions. Skip the movie. Or not, but you have been warned. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the super long review. IMDb let me do it.
