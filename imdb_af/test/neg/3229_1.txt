I hated the book. A man meets a clever dog, gets a virgin girl, and all the time they are rushed by a hit and a monkey thing (both wanting the dog). Dean Koontz can't really write (I read the book according to my sister's recommendation, I needed to know better). When I saw it, I actually criticized myself for being untrue to the book, although it is a book impossible to make a good movie. At least I thought if they wanted to make a movie adaptation of the worst book I've ever read, the filmmakers could be just as accurate. They changed the man and his virgin love interest into a boy and his mother, for some reason most bothered me. (Although I seriously doubt it, it keeps a guy and his chick didn't make it any better). Quite simple; bad book, bad movie, don't see it.
