This is probably the most emerging movie I've ever seen. I watched it because I have a soft place for Leon (everything Besson did was just terrible, in my opinion, with the exception of Wasabi's writing) and Jean Reno. This is proof of how bad this movie is that Reno, one of the most charismatic and effortlessly active actors (although he has just started here) can't make this movie, or the moments on which he is watched on the screen. br /> <br /> It's all very film-like: black and white, no dialogue, people do things for no apparent reason, people are chasing each other while being driven by a shaky camera. And predictably, it's not entertaining. <br /> <br /> It's not a French Mad Max, as some people claim (actually, I think they mean "Mad Max 2") - it's a superficial comparison based on the fact that both movies have a post-apocalyptic setting, and that's just the kind of comment you can expect from someone who doesn't know what they're talking about. Mad Max 2 was pulsating, Mad Max 2 was exciting, Mad Max 2 was worth your time. Le Dernier Combat is not one of these. <br /> <br /> I know it's supposed to be cool like arty black-and-white French movies and equally cool to say you've seen something in them that other people haven't done (or you've succeeded to go through it without feeling tired). Therefore, I do not trust anyone who claims to be Le Dernier Combat, because I see nothing worth it at all; it asks so much and does not give back anything. I drove away after about five minutes and it never did anything to recover my full attention. Anyone who can withdraw is not human or at most psychotic. (Actually, they're probably just trying "cool").
