I only saw it myself to make sure it was suitable for my little one to care for. <br /> <br /> Thank you, good I did, because I will definitely not allow a young child to see it. Why? The violence, death, burial. If you're not ready to explain these concepts to your kids, keep it away. <br /> <br /> Why on earth are these topics covered in a children's movie - especially the one that has a line of "The original party animals". Can also place a gangland performance in a Hello Kitty cartoon. <br /> <br /> As far as laughing was concerned, there was very little and far between. There was no one to talk to myself. The cows look remarkable like the cows in The Far Side comics. I think there's nothing original about this movie apart from the addition of ridiculous violence and antisocial activities for all the young kids to enjoy.
