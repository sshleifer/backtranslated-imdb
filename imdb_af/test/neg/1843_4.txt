The concept for this movie was pretty good. But somehow the performance failed on many parts. There aren't many horror movies I can think of for those used dolls that look so realistic. Especially when these dolls start to blink their eyes or moving hands. So much could be done with this point of departure. There were many scenes where there was room for tension and tension. And I really expected creepy things to happen. But the movie has never been terrifying. One of the main reasons is that the story is too little and predictable. I actually thought they'd done it deliberately to surprise us with a wonderful twist. Unfortunately, this doesn't happen. Well, at least not the way I hoped. The throw also failed to make it all credible. It would have been nice if there were more backgrounds on the characters. In the beginning when we get to know the main character. She and other characters seem to be invited by some artist. But it is also clear that they do not have an idea for themselves. This is, of course, part of the mystery. But it seems unlikely. If I got an invitation without knowing what the deal was, I simply wouldn't want to go. Furthermore, most characters aren't really happy with the end result you never actually care for them. Another mistake is that the director deviates from the basic premise that is scary enough and emerges new elements that are never explained and not even relevant to the "Doll Master mystery". Overall, this movie is a big disappointment to me. If you want to see a good horror movie with dolls, watch "Dead Silence"!
