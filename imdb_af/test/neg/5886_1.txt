Baby boom was bad enough, basically making a series of every straight men's nightmare is worse. Yes, look, some have always made me feel bad after a bad day, it reminded me that it could be worse. Guy was richly successful, single (smart man), dating from singers to actresses, then his cousin's screw is his biggest mistake on him. In fact, it would be straightforward to be foster care. I'm sure it was an elegant series. Oh, and what's the wine changing over the baby, most of the time it's probably a doll, except at that age, it's nothing more than a prop. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm glad it didn't last more than a year.
