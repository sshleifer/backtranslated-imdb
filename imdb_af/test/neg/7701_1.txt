Do you want a good recipe for failure? Take a crappy, leftist political plot, add in some weak and completely undeveloped characters and then throw in the worst rows that a movie has ever been. Leave a stew for a week. The result is 'Steal This Movie', a movie experience that takes bad movies to dangerous and exotic low places that have never been devised before. . <br /> <br /> For all my running time, this movie has completely blown bits. Words cannot convey how painful it was to look. It's not one of the bad movies you and your friends can sit down and have fun with. This is not 'Plan 9 from outer space'. It is a long, tedious and sad waste of time. 'Steal This Movie' is the biggest waste of energy and talent I have ever seen. It crushes me when I realize that people have actually taken time out of their lives to act in these trips, if you call it "acting". But then again, if you have poor direction, poor writing, poor ALL - "acting" is the last thing to criticize. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a big, disgusting doom that you desire to rinse out of existence quickly, afraid that a friend or loved one might somehow see it. I really wish I could somehow destroy every copy of this movie so that it would not pollute the thoughts of aspiring filmmakers. Thanks, Robert Greenwald, for giving me new secret respect for every other movie I've ever seen. You showed me what's really terrible and why do I appreciate all the movies that are just crazy and / or boring.
