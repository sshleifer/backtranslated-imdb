OK, let's start with the good: beautiful landscape, Channing Tatum is easy to watch, Amanda Seyfried has beautiful hair, it's about it. How much of this movie went to the room of the machining room? Probably the plot, action, good dialogue and point. Terrible play. Let me tell you how bad it is: my friend who is always crying on movies has come to call the tears, and she laughed so loudly that we thought she was crying! The film wants a bump on too many problems - war, loss, autism, cancer, but failing to cover such a topic satisfactorily. Make sure you have something to boot and your phone to send text messages back!
