This last-mentioned attempt by Freda plays as a modern day (70's) is a Gothic thriller, but comes short of tension. Certainly, it's not a terribly bad movie, but it does have the feeling that many of Freda's later films have come from someone who gave up when he saw the first daily. It starts out well enough, almost like in tone, then takes a turn in Gothic areas with a decent (though terrible clich√©) set. Suddenly, Freda suddenly lost interest in the film and all we get is long shots of Camille Keaton and burning candles. Then we get about an hour in the film a kind of violent climax with decent to bad special effects. This is followed by a slow-paced outro with a very clear turning end (if even meant to be a spin). And throw some very half-hearted explanatory scenes along the way and you have a tragic ceremony. So in parts it has its features. But suddenly you stumble and fall in front of you. Sorry. <br /> <br /> VAT remains away from the SHAROMA DVD, a useless dark pan & scan edition that kills what can be a good visual experience.
