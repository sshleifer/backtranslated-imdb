OK by the time you read it, I may have stopped crying. This movie was so horrible that it was pretty worried. The creatures are cute, but the only really good thing about the movie was the increasing imprisonment of the prisoners and waiting for them to maroon on this daffy island. Even though Barbara Bach saw her hair, it wasn't a discount for buying this sterling kid. She goes over with a whisper. I'm never-used-my-voice-before-breathing that just wasn't when one was shouting bloody murder. (Hey, the front man was also cute, but I'm not satisfied yet.) It's a cry-in-your-beer ripoff of the good ole island Dr Moreau. Poor Richard Johnson, who was certainly born for better things, is unfortunately just as bad as the bad man. I mean, how bad can an evil man be? (Ask Richard Johnson). Joseph Cotten tries hard not to be shy, as he sticks through his cameo look. In the name of all that is sacred, do not rent this darned bomb.
