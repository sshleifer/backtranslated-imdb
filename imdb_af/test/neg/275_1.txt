What a ridiculous waste of time and money !!!! This movie was the biggest loser of the year. All the hype was a warning. I'm disappointed by Julia Roberts, by far she's the most talented member. I think her ability to act really wears the film. The buddy buddy boys club was a bit too weak, and to add insult to injury, why is Catherine Zeta Jones bothering? She has only the ability to ruin a movie. She does not have the ability to have chemistry with anyone on the screen, not to mention that she does not have the ability to act. She didn't have the chemistry with the other characters: kind of reminiscent of America's Love. She made the terminal terminal. This movie is nowhere on the head, what a shame, please don't tell me "13" is on the go!
