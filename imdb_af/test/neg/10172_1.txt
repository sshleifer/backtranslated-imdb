This movie was the biggest piece of garbage I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is marketed as Sci-Fi because it is nothing but a Christian recruitment tool. <br /> <br /> It tells you quite a bit about the state of the Christian church, when they have to resort to fraud, just to let you listen to their point of sale. But then again, what do you expect from an organization that will make so much effort to protect such a large number of child molesters in their organization. <br /> <br /> Religion is full of nothing but sexual abusers, hypocrites, and warriors. Let us not forget, our former president, has already come out saying that "God has told him" to enter Iraq. And no one questioned whether he heard voices or see things? <br /> <br /> Anyway, go from the box here. No, this movie has nothing to do with UFOs at all, it's nothing more than a religious production.
