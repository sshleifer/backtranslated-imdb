In the quotation above it all says "Slipstream". I had to call out of this movie after the first half hour, but I had to be fair and give it a chance. I won't see it again, so if someone with the bravery to do so can come back to me with the number of clich√©d lines in the movie, I'm sure it will set a record. <br /> <br /> Some other fine and talented actors blended with this clunker; Mark Hamill depicts a futuristic bounty hunter and Bill Paxton is his quarry. Paxton's character hijacked Hamill's prisoner, an android who took his name from the poet Byron (Bob Peck). Tasker (Hamill) shoots Owens (Paxton) with a dart containing a tracking device so he and his companion Belitski (Kitty Aldridge) can keep tabs on the pair. The real question is why did he not fire the device at Byron, thereby cutting off the middleman. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy a scene after a deviant scene with boring characterization and craftsmanship, then you assume you're "Here's something important. But you can't convince me that the movie makes sense at any level. Scenes of a futuristic Stone Age make way for a high society snobbery, but the pinnacle of poor taste is achieved when Paxton's character is displayed after a night of thrill over his torso. If someone thinks there is a hidden meaning here, you really stretch. <br /> <br /> Beware of the frame that "The End" proclaims to watch, unfortunately, even this is denied. If beauty is in the eye of the observer, then it is understanding; This movie does not have any. Yet, there was a single reasoning feature, as the closing credits started their run-up - a massive view of half a dozen hot air balloons. Apparently the movie keeps them on the right track.
