This film is much more than a replacement Verhoeven. The filming is supposed to be tele-realistic, but is just sick. The parody disappears after about 15 minutes to be replaced by a story that takes him seriously. The Brechtian breaks for non-existing advertising brakes are boring and even painful; No doubt there was no real intention to deliver this movie, Brechtian, it was just an accident that happened. If you want to see a parody of the reality TV, watch Celebrity DeathMatch - it's smarter and whiter, and more importantly shorter. I rarely felt so much pain while watching a movie. To be avoided like a rabid rabbit.
