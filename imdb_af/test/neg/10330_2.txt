Sandra Bullock is my favorite actress ..... But this movie was so horrible, I couldn't help but in the accident throughout the movie I actually looked at something like that. Ha ha. The sound editing is terrible. They are trying too hard to reach creative camera angles. Because they are just weird and stupid. The writing sucked. Acting was terrible, storyline not very good. Very unrealistic, even for a movie. But it's a 20 year old movie ..... so I'll give it a bonus point. And yes, the music was terrible. But we all have to start somewhere. And filing these things is such a bother ..... 10 rule minimum ... bother. Well now I know why I couldn't find this movie in the movie shop. I had to buy it offline to see it ... good thing, it was just $ .58 cents .... although the shipping was $ 2.59. . Oh yes .... I do not recommend anyone to waste their time and money watching this movie ...
