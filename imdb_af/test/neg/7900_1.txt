This movie was just awful. How can anyone like this movie, and for the one who loves it because of the jokes, really take a long look in the mirror and ask themselves if stereotypes are not bad. If I ignored the face of racist stereotypes, it was just terrible. It never had its moments, if it was a tribute to the 1980s, "Airplane!" Must pay it even more. Awful acting, terrible script writing, even for a movie with Mo'Nique or Tom Arnold. This movie was bad from the start, but people might have seen the whole thing, with the idea that the plane would crash. One of the worse movies ever, stay away.
