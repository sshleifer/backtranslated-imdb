First the easy part: this movie is pretentious crapola! <br /> <br /> This kept me in mind with "Magnolia". And then I thought, "Wow, someone made a movie even thicker and more annoying than" Magnolia ". <br /> <br /> I know nothing about the Polish brothers, but this movie seems to be made by someone who has learned a lot in film school but knows nothing about storytelling, the pride elements and sleigh hammer symbolism is bad enough, but the dialogue is just pathetic. <br /> <br /> Detailed comment will only be a laundry list failure, which is supposed to be funny or satirical, is not: the "elega" parts are nice coffee table mats with mediocre music, the "emotional" parts are simplistic. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the movie shows no I love the characters, except for a little coral dignity in the priest. <br /> <br /> I still can't believe the respect some people have given to this picture.
