Give director Stanley Tong of Jackie Chan's Super Cop and Rumble in the Bronx, and what do you get? You get a series of kungfu battles and a lack of Magoo-like madness. <br /> <br /> The limited plot placed Magoo (Leslie Nielsen) in an international plot stealing a world-famous jewel. Of course he has no idea what he is doing. In fact, he has no idea that he has the jewel. <br /> <br /> Within thirty minutes you can be very bored watching it. However, there are many funny moments like when he cooks the chicken. You would wish you were as close as Magoo. It's a fun movie to watch, but it's quite a disaster! You must love Leslie Nielson because he made some very funny movies. It's not his best, but he does a good job of playing Magoo. I thought it was a funny movie, and it should be recommended to young children, as they will probably think it is very funny.
