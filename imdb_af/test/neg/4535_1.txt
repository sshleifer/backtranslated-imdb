It is sad that they participate in film festival today. I had to sit down for more than twenty minutes of this brave. It wasn't funny getting a good place for a feature film I wanted to see at a local film festival. The festival planners have this horrible short with a wonderful feature. I'm just glad the feature was good, otherwise I wouldn't have been a very happy camper! <br /> <br /> For a comedy short movie it didn't laugh. The title says it all.
