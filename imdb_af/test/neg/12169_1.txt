I remember when this show came out. It was originally advertised as a mini-series. At the end of the last episode, it said, "To continue" to the dismay of all the people who have seen all the boring things that were not over. It ended as it was supposed to, so yes, you can blame the series because they don't end. The plan was that there would be another if the ratings were higher, but it was too boring for too long and irritated people by not ending when it said, so they never made it. Many of the comments blame his cancellation and lack of viewing public, when the truth is that this show was not the case, it ended as it was actually planned to end. It's just a common end.
