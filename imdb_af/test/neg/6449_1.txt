This gawd-horrible piece is everywhere in the place. The writing is bad, the plot is bad, the acting is bad. There are some decent actors in it (Charles Durning, eg), but the director didn't get anything from them. The plot line has Santa, feel sad and think no one needs him anymore, take a little girl across the country to get her father back with her mother. It includes a lady in a church food with a stuffed parrot on his shoulder (played by "Isaac" of The Love Boat), the world's largest elf (played by Bruce Vilnach - a very funny man but no actor ) hardened factory owner who works overtime on Christmas night and a sled race where someone cuts one of Santa's skis trying to win. If the plot looks bad, it is worse on the screen. If you see this movie coming next, run, walk, go to your TV and disconnect it. Maybe you want to cook your television to remove any remaining infection. If you accidentally watch over 10 minutes of this, you may need to burn your television and install the cable company completely new lines.
