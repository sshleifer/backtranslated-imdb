Back in 2002 when Matthew Lawrence had The Hot Chick, I also saw Drumline that day. Drumline wins standard! If The Comebcaks were released in March (as planned), TMNT was released at the same time, TMNT will have won by default! <br /> <br /> Allowed, Matthew Lawrence did a good job showing a quarter-finals. He didn't need to pronounce dirty words that are a plus. But when he started playing with his private parts as well as another soccer player and touching a girl's boob, it was the minuses. <br /> <br /> But the biggest minus that disapproved me is that every soccer player participated. in the mock music video except Matthew Lawrence (add the price is right's lost horns)! Another musical opportunity for him, just because he is ashamed to do music. <br /> <br /> In the past, Matt has disappointed me many times (Super Human Samurai Syber Squad) where he came so close to a musical moment, but eventually failed. <br /> <br /> Sure, Joey had a singing career with two albums on his belt and Andrew started his own music career. But it is very rare to find a Matt musical moment. The two who stand out would be on Brotherly Love where he played the guitar and "Dove on your car" (Art Atrack), which he wrote on the road, and that romantic Boy Meets World moment when he "This Lady" sang (As time goes on.) Matt, you played too long. Why not make a musical return. You have a good voice and I miss your musical side.
