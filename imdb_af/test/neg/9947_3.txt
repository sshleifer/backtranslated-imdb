Seymour Cassel gives a good performance, a tour the power. His action as an allegedly excited beach stroll Duke Slusarski will always have a place in my heart. The film is centered on a nerd who just came to the beach hoping to honor his dead brother's dreams. What he gets is lame surf hijinks. Churches cheat, guys fight and guys get drunk on a Friday night to watch documentary documents with the whole town of LA. Duke takes the nerd in and tries to teach him how to play volleyball, to touch a woman. The next time my wife speaks back, I'll pretend to be the ball. <br /> <br /> Back to Seymour Cassel. The end of the movie is going to be a good drama, as the first half of the film really had no point. Duke plays a wonderful match volleyball, the best he has played in over ten years. The way the scene was shot is beautiful. You can feel the heart this man has for the game and the love to be on the beach. The five minutes will be from time to time as one of my favorites. 3/10 Bad to Fair, the rest of the movie was lame.
