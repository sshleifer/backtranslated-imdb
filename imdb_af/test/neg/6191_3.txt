Pepe le Moko, played by Charles Boyer, is a kind of international criminal mastermind in countries across Europe, and to stay free, he finds himself in the Casbah, a mysterious part of Algiers where even the police are reluctant to go to a senior officer sent from Paris to catch Le Moko once and for all. For Le Moko, although the Casbah allows him to stay out of police custody, it also becomes a kind of jail at the same time - a place he can't leave because the moment he does, he knows he will be arrested. <br /> <br /> Boyer's performance was good, and I can understand why he was nominated for an Oscar. He captures the essence of such a character - a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very nice at the same time. Unfortunately, the film itself was quite a fall. A number of parts of the story were contradictory, of which I would call two. First, the idea was that the police would not enter the Casbah. This was clearly stated by the local commander at the beginning of the film, yet repeated references in the movie suggested that the police had actually entered relatively regularly. So, the suggestion of Mr. Janvice that the police would not go in, nor did the statement from inspectors. Slimane (also a decent performance by Joseph Calleia) that they could come in the Casbah, but not out, had a lot of meaning. I also found it hard to believe that Le Moko's hardened criminal warrior masters he was - so quickly swept by Gaby (Hedy Lamarr) from his feet to the point where he entertained the locals by singing love songs and then the Casbah to leave to find her, to give him materiality. I understand the irony of the last few scenes, of course, if Pepe leaves the freedom of his prison (the Casbah) just to get real freedom in his catch (because he was shot dead by the police.) I just got it impossible found to believe that someone like Le Moko will fall into such a fall. <br /> <br /> It is worth looking at Boyer, and to a lesser extent, Calleia, but the story is disappointing and contradictory. 10/03
