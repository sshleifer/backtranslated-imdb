Starting where the last AVP started, an Alien chest burger comes from a dead Predator on a Predator spaceship. This causes the Predator spaceship to collapse into the current Gunnison Colorado, destroying several aliens who are causing havoc. The Predator race sends a lonely highly experienced and armed Predator to clear up the mess. Our human characters are caught in the middle of the intergalactic battle. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this movie is pacing. This movie is moving too fast. The opening credits have just rolled and even though the Predator ship crashes into the Earth after the Alien grows to its fullest, a hunter and son character is introduced, but before we even get to know their names, they both die, and we see The Predator home world and the main Predator fly off to fight the Alien Infection, and all this happens within the first five minutes. This unnatural pass does not allow the whole movie; The National Guard comes to town but within two minutes everyone is killed without first seeing a face. The manager of a pizza shop gets one scene of character development only to be killed next time. Again without learning his name, random hobos, a coffee shop waiter and chef is killed again without learning their names. One moment our main characters are at home, the next in town, the next in a gun shop, the next in an APC, and this random set jumps over and over just never leaving the audience time to settle. to grab them for straws. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the settings and time frame. The film is in contemporary Gunnison Colorado. Every other Alien and Predator movie is shot in intrusive institutions such as industrial space ships, guerrilla war zone rainforests, alien planets and underground labyrinths. Come along with AVP-R, located in a small, modern American city, with some highlights including a sports shop, parking lots, Pizza shops, and small girls' bedrooms. I mean, were they actually trying to make the movie look dull, deadly and uninteresting? It is difficult to see these monsters as frightening creatures as they stand next to a shelf full of Reeboks or sleep in the bushes outside the little girls. <br /> <br /> Continuity is a big problem with this movie. The Alien series is set in the future. No man first heard before the first movie of an Alien, and the Aliens were not just on earth, but if they ever reached Earth, humanity would be destroyed. This film ruins the whole concept by being in the modern day, with average joes seeing the aliens all over the place, and by the end of the film humanity is not destroyed, not even suffering that can be considered as minor losses no. It pisses about the whole concept of the other movies. Efforts to maintain continuity are made with massive Deus Ex Machina's. The Predator just happens to carry a bottle of unlimited magic blue liquid that just melts bodies with a single drop, the army at the end of the movie just happens to go to excessive drastic measures and drop a core chain that just make all the evidence of the alien's existence reasonable despite the fact that there were many survivors of the incident who are witnesses, and much more bad efforts are made to be impossible to cover plot holes. <br /> <br /> Also for a "Verses" movie, it has unconditional bias in favor of the Predators. For the majority of the film, a lonely Predator succeeds in killing dozens of strangers, unless dozens of strangers, all in the multitude series while they hardly get a bit, while strangers are just slaughtered just right and left. kill the Predator without attempting to defend themselves. This movie should not be called "Alien vs Predator", as much as it should be "Predator massacres Aliens". I mean, how can you fight two species with tension and tension, if one is portrayed as much better than the other? <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are one of the biggest mistakes. Not only are they pale compared to the characters of the previous Alien and Predator movies, but even as a stand-alone movie, they are slim, foolish, and even dignified. The characters in this movie consist of: I don't love you, horny couples who want to be laid, pizza-living boys, blonde bimbos, high school bulls, kids and a blatant copy and paste work that Ripley and Newt rip. The worst and most clever possible ideas for characters. Not only that, but all the aforementioned characters are performed by teenagers. While teens' outpouring is a clear attempt to engage younger audiences, it is the only consequence of making the movie look and feel like a typical teenage farmer slasher porn movie. With too young players who have learned to give a convincing performance, with mostly empty voices expressing monotonous dialogue. Not only that, but these characters do some of the most kinematically delayed things, like the use of Predator guns, highlighting the forces when it was hours. It follows stupid plans to get out of town rather than just walking out of town. fast, and so many other idiots that the movie actually had the audience in my theater, which was frustrated. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie is just a horrible B-movie, which is fair to the DVD category. The fact that this movie was a theatrical loss surprised me, because every part of the movie is just ranks of amateur work.
