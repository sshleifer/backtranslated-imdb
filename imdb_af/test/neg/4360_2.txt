It doesn't say much. This Killjoy movie has better filmmaking and is more professional than the last. This does not mean that it sounds more professional. The horrible last movie was about gangsters killing a child and then being played by a voodoo clown. I thought the guy who played Killjoy in the last one was a bad actor, but wow !!! This Killjoy is honestly the worst worst actor I've ever seen in any movie, and I've seen a lot of movies. This last movie entered the clown about 15 minutes, this one is shorter and the clown doesn't even come in for 40 minutes, and it's only 65 minutes long !!! I give it a 2 because the characters of some characters are OK.
