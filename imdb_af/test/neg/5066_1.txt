I admire the effort to reach out to the rest of the world with this tragic story. However, the movie is done so badly that most people I know can't sit through it. The movie has been of interest to me since I lived in Estonia when these events took place, but it has been terribly written and fails to capture the attention of someone who knows nothing about it. The music choices are not going well with the movie, it looks as if someone has just turned a CD player into the background to put the actors in the mood. The acting ... Well, what is acting? The only people acting are Jürgen Prochnow and Donald Sutherland, though Prochnow looks uncomfortable in this role. Regarding the relationship between Erik Westermark (Jürgen Prochnow) and Julia Reuter (Greta Scacchi), it is like a train track. There is absolutely no chemistry and it is painful to witness their "sincere moments". It's not a good movie. There is a difference between trying to get a message out (could have been a documentary!) And trying to make a good movie. It's a failure and anyone else who says otherwise makes me wonder if they are trying to promote it. In fact, as a resident of Estonia, I am insulted by this unfortunate attempt. This tragedy deserves more than just a homemade low-budget ghostly excuse for a movie. It could have been much more!
