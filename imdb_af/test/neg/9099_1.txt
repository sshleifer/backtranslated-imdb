If you look at the first few moments, you realize it's going to be a parody - and it's definitely a parody, but I don't know what (a fairy tale? An opera? A Hollywood C movie?) , and I can assure you that it is not worth looking at. It's just a useless movie (like a good parody is anything but useless), with pretentious, shallow speeches of extremely sharp characters. It's like a commedia dell'arte. Or better, it's like a broken commedia dell'arte. And the score ... sang in a deliberate unauthorized way (something Greenaway will use much more effectively) is * painful to listen to (unless you wear a few earplugs, haha). Go for quality movies (eg A. Mitta's How Czar Peter the Great Married Off His Moor, 1976) and remove this error.
