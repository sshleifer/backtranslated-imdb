I have to go with my son Allen (who also reviewed this movie) ... ZOMBIE GANGBANGERS (as my copy is entitled - think they left out the NINJA section after realizing there is no single "ninja" or reference After ninjas not everywhere in the movie!) is a total waste of time. Honestly one of the boring, delayed "movies" I ever had the negligence of viewing. <br /> <br /> A hooker is repeatedly (ungraphically) raped by two zombies, and then by a policeman (again, ungraphically) if the police do not believe her story. She met a man who was beaten by the zombies and the two tried to find a way to give revenge to the wicked culprits. <br /> <br /> First, there's no "gangbanging" (or really other "bang") that had to be in ZOMBIE NINJA GANGBANGERS. I was hoping to get at least some kind of horror / pornhide, a la PORN OF THE DEAD, or RE-PENETRATOR, or maybe RELATED STORIES - but no - there was absolutely NO sex in this movie. At least a little o 'the ol' in-out can somehow redeem this boring rubbish, but without it we get a lot of badly shot scenes of complete boredom with zero payout. I'm all for movies and most other sklock, gore, porn and exploit material, but this one is struggling in every possible way. Save your time, pass this one on ... 1/10 (and the one is only for a few short shots of some sub-par boobs ...)
