The real problem with this story is that there is not much story to the story. There is hardly a plot to talk about. Widower buys an electric grandmother for his children. One child resists electric grandmother. Then she finally accepts her. Then the children grow up and grandmother leaves. Really, very little happens. It's much more of a performance than a story. <br /> <br /> Strap it off the skmaltz, and you have a story already done, and better: The lonely. The same basic idea: A person cannot initially accept the love of a robot, because it is just a machine, and eventually gives up and loves the robot. The biggest difference is that The Lonely is much stronger, as both the lead role and us, the audience, are suddenly shocked to reality and forced to remember that the robot is just a mechanism. <br /> <br /> I also find the story very wrong because the electric grandmother just * is * perfect. She is not just "human", she is superhuman. She is wiser than a real person, she has no trace of mechanism, and she makes marbles out of the air. It's really really believable to think she's a machine.
