I saw the trailer for this movie before I watched Titanic, and I have to admit it was my appetite. Volcano was pretty spectacular and full of promise. But what a damp squib. Corny is not the word for the writing, and the characterization is often ridiculous. The stupid daughter is just out of faith - she's supposed to be no 4. But then the scientists, firefighters and peripheral characters no longer offer. This movie is just before Cruise II and Twister, but only because these 2 movies are absolutely horrible. It does have reasonable consequences, but overall it is 1 out of 10. Don't waste your time
