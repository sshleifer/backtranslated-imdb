I love documentaries. The Andy Goldsworthy doctor was wonderful. I looked forward to this one - but was very disappointed. I knew about Kahn and was intrigued by the idea of ​​his lonely death in a Penn Station man's room. There must be a story here, I believed wrong. The only story here is of sad fraudulent women who had business with an ugly, small, well-known, married man. In the absence of anything like an explanation for this man's abominable behavior, we get endless repeated cuttings from Kahn to walk around and painfully long - presumably contemplative - shots of his soulless buildings. In practice, some of the buildings are interesting, but the pressure of the film asks us to think about the man himself. The overweight soundtrack refers to an emotional tug that is completely absent from the film. Kahn's apparent gifts do not excuse his behavior or martyr's mistress. This film wants Kahn to give the free artist's free pass and thus make the director and his mother sympathetic figures - I don't buy it.
