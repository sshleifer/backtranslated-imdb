This film gives new meaning to the term "unequal", which gives us some intriguing characterizations accounted for by an awkward realization plot that relies on a few well-placed stingers to deliver the majority of excitement. <br /> <br /> The plot relates to a group of men who have a secret that caused a curse to visit them in the form of a ghostly female device that causes death. She can also seduce their sons. <br /> <br /> It is quite a spectacle to have all the notable veteran actors in one movie together, but unfortunately it is not very convincing, especially the scene where Melvyn Douglas is going to beg the deep end the other to listen to him. It's no shock then that the actors playing the same characters in their youth are terrible, especially the giggling Ricky. They deliver the worst scene I've ever watched. <br /> <br /> The movie has some savings, namely Dick Smith's great ghost compositions (but misplaced in this movie), and Alice Krige's fascinating display as Alma / Eva. I have never read the novel this movie was taken, but I plan to read the rest of the other reviews on this page. However, you don't have to read the book, to realize it's just a shadow of the original story. There is a good story here, but it is lost somewhere, amid an exposition that shows the men what nightmares over and over, and makes impeccable references to the secret they all share. <br /> <br /> As it turns out, about half an hour of material has been removed from this pressure, especially near the climax. After all ... how is it that Fred Astaire can soak up a dam from the dam? What did Gregory Bate and the child have to do with Eva? And while we're on ... what was she anyway? Why did she leave her out of the car because the appearance disappeared? If it was an appearance, how could it have sex with two men and they didn't know? <br /> <br /> These and other questions will never be answered, at least not by this movie. Unless a recovered footage is discovered somewhere, it will probably remain a curiosity with a few oozing makeup, bizarre sex scenes and nudity, and some attractive appearances.
