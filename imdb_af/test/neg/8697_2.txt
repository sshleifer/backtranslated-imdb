This movie had a lot of potential. Certainly with today's technology, one would expect real special effects. But movies aren't just made with special effects, of course it is needed. This movie is missing both! <br /> <br /> First, I say to those who are upset about what doesn't follow the bible: why can't a movie take an artistic license? If you want to know about the story of Moses, read the Bible. I saw very few movies that follow a true story fact. Look at the movie of his artistic quail. <br /> <br /> Reading this movie, you will inevitably compare it to the 1956 version. It fails. Heston and Brenner had PRESENCE. They became their roles. You don't see it here. <br /> <br /> Even if you didn't compare, it stands by itself, this movie rushed too fast. Parts where a scene needs to be developed do not. It gets boring. <br /> <br /> My advice: Skip it and look at the other. Like champion like the other, it is by far the better movie.
