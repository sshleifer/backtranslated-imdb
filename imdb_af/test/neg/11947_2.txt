What a bad idea was to regain an almost Oscar-worthy movie?! MASTHLY MARTHA is MUCH MORE BETTER, has depth, finesse and so on and especially: a wonderful and talented actress starring (Martina Gedeck). It's a joke and ugliness with the handsome Aaron and the whole atmosphere ... again a ridiculous attempt by Hollywood. There are more and more remakes and the movies are full of schemes. Is there no one who can create a good and latest script? Or is it a security solution to make reminders or movies of the well-proven cartoon characters? The movies are becoming less interesting these days. Oh yes: If you want to see a VERY good movie, look at the original movie. It's definitely worth it.
