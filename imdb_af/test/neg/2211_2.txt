Meltdown opens on a scene of scientists preparing to develop an important test on a missile system developed to deflate asteroids if they are on a collision course with the Earth. Nathan (Vincent Gale) mentions some displeased, but the test seems to be an unqualified success. Then the asteroid breaks apart, and the largest piece is pushed into a direct collision path with the earth. Fortunately, the big rock is jumping off the outer atmosphere of the earth and ricochets in space. Unfortunately, the lightning block is just enough to change the Earth's orbit, and the planet is spiraling closer to the sun. <br /> <br /> While it's all about their heads, Los Angeles police Tom (Casper Van Dien) and Mick (Greg Anderson) are on an interest. They are supposed to gather evidence against an alleged drug dealer, but the deal they are seeing is rapidly being transferred into a shooting match. Then Tom interviews a local television reporter for a few minutes, who is also his girlfriend, Carly (Stefanie von Pfetten). <br /> <br /> At a nearby hospital where Mick is being treated for a minor injury, Tom has a brief conversation with his ex-girlfriend Bonnie (Venus Terzo), who is a nurse. He tells her that he is worried about the fact that their 17-year-old daughter Kimberly (Amanda Crew) is a man named CJ (Ryan McDonell). As soon as Tom explained to Bonnie that he was discovered that CJ had a criminal record, she was a little worried. <br /> <br /> It's not long before everyone has to worry about anything else. The temperature is rising rapidly all over the world. Carly is one of the first non-scientists to learn what really happens. Nathan, who is her brother, calls her to say he can have a way to survive. Carly calls Tom; of course he quickly switched Bonnie. <br /> <br /> In a relatively short sequence, the common group is on its way. However, before they can reach their ultimate goal, they have to move through looms of looters, handle a catastrophic water shortage and succeed in moving high enough to kill. <br /> <br /> Casper Van Dien is a good guy, and I actually enjoyed him in Starship Troopers. This can be because he is good at action scenes. It could also be because he didn't talk much in that movie. In Meltdown, unfortunately, he only gets enough lines in situations that are only dramatic enough to show his completely average acting capabilities. Amanda Crew is also ok, and Ryan McDonell is also not bad. Vincent Gale and Stefanie von Pfetten are also pretty good, but Venus Terzo is unfortunately on the same scale as Van Dien. <br /> <br /> What really makes or breaks a movie, however, is the story and the writing. While the story is good here and actually has real potential, the writing is just awful. The scientific part of the science fiction has not existed, starting with the asteroid pushing the earth out of the orbit and escalating with the idea that the "gravitational balance of the solar system" can retract the earth back into its ordinary orbit "with the passage of time. "When the temperature in LA hits 120 degrees, cars start to blow. <br /> <br /> You know what's worse than bad science? The bad continuity. Good, very hot. Why don't people in the movie wear long-sleeved shirts, but jackets? Why do people work for bottled water instead of making the taps at home? Why are the streets completely empty, but the highways are completely full? And why are the highways full of unexploded? It is almost unnecessary to note that the sets, costumes and production values ​​were good, especially if it just forced me to say that the changes were not. <br /> <br /> So basically you take a pretty good story idea and combine it with mostly mediocre acting, a horrible script, low end special effects, totally irrational plot twists and poor editing, and what do you have? A movie that is even less than the sum of its insignificant parts. I'm sorry to say that I can't recommend the Meltdown: Days of Destruction to anyone. <br /> <br /> POLITICAL NOTES: It is mentioned here that Congress has finally unleashed the purse strings to finance the trials that begin the rollout. While the tests were completely irresponsible here (with a view to an asteroid with a nuke and not knowing that the composition of the large rock is, it is far beyond irresponsible and approaching the insane). The fact is that such scenarios are a huge danger to the planet. Unfortunately, we didn't find anywhere near any earthly asteroids that would be a little worried; and our ability to see something on a collision course with us is at its best limited. <br /> <br /> Once we have discovered, we will be hit, we literally have no system in place to handle it. There is no question of nuclear weapons that we can introduce; the spacecraft is completely impossible to go beyond the Earth's orbit, and if it was, we couldn't start enough of them or they started fast enough to make it. I'm not big on the government to do anything beyond its constitutional mandates, but I certainly think that the protection of the planet from destruction coming from outer space can be explained to defend the country or not? FAMILY FACILITY: Meltdown: Days of Destruction are rated R for some violence. I found the violence here nothing more than a fairly typical T-rated video game. If your teens want to see Meltdown and you can't talk about it, the R rating shouldn't stop you from showing them. However, it is not a good idea to leave the younger children in the room with their older brothers and sisters. While the shooting is not too graphic, some are dead bodies.
