I'm really disappointed with this piece of work. It's quiet, level, repeat itself, is usually not exactly and sometimes about to be wrong. I think it was made for primary school, especially since it is repeated repeatedly, leaving huge gaps. A young child can actually enjoy it and learn from it, but a better way to make a child to appreciate theoretical physics is books such as a short history of time or "The Tao of Physics." If you are familiar with the topic at a very basic level, you will not get any new information or views from this series. Don't waste your time with it. Beautiful eye candy already.
