This movie is so bad they have to burn the master. You can't spoil the plot because this movie doesn't have one. The graphics are less than fake, they are terrible. Then you stacked up the rural star gazer work-a-holic who jumps between his own lunacy and the crazy rantings of the mad preacher. And if he eventually makes it to GS, they don't even have the decency to kill him; the monster (you don't know) already dies, but how ... who knows and of course it has the ultimate juicy end ... everyone else on the planet is dead or dying but his family and a handful of stragglers survive. Imagine that! It will be the movie that C Thomas Howell goes to his grave and regrets ever dying. It probably gives him nightmares.
