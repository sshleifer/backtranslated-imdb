Over the past few years, Ron Miller's son-in-law of Walt Disney's cum producer has ruled live-action crap on a stick that often sticks out the boring Dean Jones. The whole career was based on the kind of light, leading rate. Other horrible films from the same period include Pete's Dragon, the last flight of Noah's Ark, Unidentified Fly Oddball and the dreaded Condorman. I won't call Tron, because I thought it was ambitious and Miller was only the executive producer on it, so he had little to do with actual production. However, he was in full force when this divine piece of human rubbish was expelled from the creations of creativity. Herbie Go to Monte Carlo. Second follow-up to the loving Love Bug story, Herbie enjoys another car that also has a brain and heart. There is a race, some bad guys, a diamond and Barney Fife. In France, the film is actually beautifully photographed and the countryside is nice. But one gets the idea that the film is made so that everyone involved can have a three-month holiday in France. The rest of the movie is a wreck. Prat falls, bumbling thieves, evil German racing rivals and a pretty bouncing feminist all fall under the stock supply category. The biggest insult to the film: try to develop Herbie's love personality through shaking, squeaking, flickering lights and movements indicating that a secret is seventeen years old. It's an injustice to our cute VW. Then I would think it would be hard for anyone to run Helen Hayes who runs Herbie around a skyscraper ridge in the second outing.
