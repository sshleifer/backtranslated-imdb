Movies like this give independent movies a bad name! It is just a boring composition of fingertips, with no structure whatsoever. I won't be surprised if the scriptwriter is completely stoned. If you want to see a good stoner comedy, see "Half pastry." It's not a prize winner, but at least it made me laugh. Of course, the film was made on a micro budget. Every scene also takes place in someone's house, someone's apartment or a place outside. If the writing was good and the dialogue was interesting, I would ignore the film's budget (as in the case of Edward Burns's films), but of course that is not the case. <br /> <br /> I call Robert DeNiro from "Bronx Languages" when I say, "There's nothing worse in the world than wasted talent." Everyone in the film is talented. Luke Wilson, Alicia Witt, Brittany Murphy, Jeremy Sisto - all talented artists! And they're all in much better movies. The actors give it their all, but they can't go too far with such a lame script. The only scene I found interesting was Jack Black's cameo, where he sang a song to be in the bush. And of course in the beginning there was the short strip club scene, which I also found attractive. <br /> <br /> The characters are uninteresting and the story hardly exists. Many movies are terrible, but at least you understand your intentions. What was "Bongwater's" intention? The world will never know. <br /> <br /> My Score: 2 (out of 10)
