Author / director Brian Burns, of course, has seen some romantic comedies, and he seems to have discovered the formula for success: many space shots in New York (preferably in winter), alluding to old Hollywood movies (especially musicals) , enjoyable musical soundtrack. Unfortunately, this is all just compensation for Burns' lack of talent as a writer. (The great mystery of many authors directors who make independent films is not why they can't continue with big studios, but how they get some support for their films.) Normally our interest in romantic comedy is motivated by the main characters, but the couple in this movie simply have no profession. It is not the fault of David Krumholtz or Milla Jovavich; their characters are only poorly written. What we respond to in such classic reactions as when Harry With Sally or Annie Hall or older films such as his girlfriend Friday are quirks and flaws of the main characters' personalities. Lacking the ability to create individuals, Burns gives us an aftercare school specially inspired by Men Are From Mars, Women is from Venus. <br /> <br /> How anyone can see Burns as the successor to Woody Allen is beyond me. I did not laugh at this movie once, and the screenplay is full of echo room dialogue ("I want to paint the town red." "You want to paint the town red?"), What most narrative language is from someone who is not business write for a life. In one of the early plays we see Krumholz's actress girl filmed a sensible TV sitcom. It's the only moment in the whole movie that dialogue feels right; Perhaps that indicates what Burns talents are really suited to.
