There is one sequence where some water in the sunken plane is storming, everything that happens in this movie is stock 77 for Airport 77. You can even make Jack Lemmon and Christopher Lee in some shots. A total rounding off? Well almost by definition. There may be more stock images in this movie than in Plan 9 from outer space. <br /> <br /> All the new stuff, actors put in an airplane, is vague and dreadful at every level. Dennis Weaver is totally wasted in a career-low movie, but it is true for everyone other than this movie director Fred Olen Ray, who uses one of these many essential false names to stay in work. <br /> <br /> There is a level of bad professionalism that makes this movie such a waste of time, would it be better than someone who has no technical knowledge, because Ray has just enough knowledge about how to put a scene in the worst old school. fashion that this movie, like most of its films, is completely without life. The worst kind of hacking. The worst kind of movie. Boring. <br /> <br /> This type of movie is a waste of money, a relationship where the crew is at all levels ghosts and hopes to get what scarce payment controls they can and that no one will see or know they are appearing did not / participated in this rip off. There are so many people who want to make movies, it is disgusting to see Ray burn the money given to do nothing more, but to fill time. <br /> <br /> His commentary is interesting because he has to start by explaining that he is really Fred Ray because he is not credited to the film himself. It tricked me into seeing it, don't be fooled.
