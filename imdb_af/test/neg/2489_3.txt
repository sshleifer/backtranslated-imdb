There's no real story, the movie looks more like a drama-documentary flyer than a real movie, so this piece can be a spoiler in itself. Teenage drama about 3 young Singapore children (very similar to British chavs) playing with school feelings, running with gangs, getting in the battle, insulting people on the street, getting tattoos, doing nothing to do something, etc. To be tough and each so often challenge challenging rap chants in the camera. Filmed in MTV style, fast cuts, crazy camera angles, close-ups and animation interludes. The dialogue could have been brilliant in the original languages ​​of Mandarin and Hokkien than in the captions, and I have no doubt that some of the contemporary Singapore references will shed Western head as well as the cultural and political context, unless of course you are familiar with Singapore. This type of teenage movie may be a first for Singapore, but it has been done better and better in other Western countries, such as La Haine (1995).
