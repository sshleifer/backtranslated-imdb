It has been around since 1982, about every two or three years we get a movie claiming "The Next Officer and a Gentleman." There is another movie that lived up to this demand, and this movie is no different. <br /> <br /> We get the usual torn scenes from OAAG ("I want your DOR," gives the instructor Richard Gere character his overdose drills hoping he'll stop, the Gere character returns for the girl , the Gere character realizes that the instructor is big, etc.) And this film is as predictable as the sun rises in the East and is terribly mistaken on top. Costner plays his usual "wise teacher" character, the only character he can play, and you really get a sense of his limited acting abilities here. Kutcher is terrific in the Richard Gere character, but with scarcity of acting skills hardly a notch above Keanu Reeves. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this OAG wannabe is the two main characters are so incredibly one-dimensional, you never care for the least and when Kutcher's character eventually turns (just as Gere did in OAG) you just go "So what? The movie doesn't leave a plot point and never seems to end as saying" oh wait, we forgot to exclude the girl story or what happens after he graduated the story or the other six plot points in the movie ... "What's even more amazing is the big" reviews "I see here. The general opinion's opinions never stop to stun me.
