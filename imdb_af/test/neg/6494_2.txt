THE PROTECTOR. You hear the name. You think, "ah, it's a crappy Hong Kong movie." Guess what - it's not Hong Kong. And yes, it's crazy. This amazingly stupid Jackie Chan movie that has been devastated by us, yes we, the Americans (I'm angry with anger, oh, I think I'll jump out of that window!), Chan as a New York police chase hunt, avenge the death of his mate. Sounds cool ... but it's not. Don't waste your money to rent it. To prove he can make a better police film, Chan made the incredible POLICE STORY (1985).
