I'm partly a fan of Miyazaki's work. I say "partially" because most of his films fall into two categories: brilliant and boring. Unfortunately, this movie falls into the later category. <br /> <br /> This movie suffers from the same fundamental problems as Miyazaki's recent movie "Howl's Moving Castle". An intriguing point of departure is set up but then immediately reduced to a little more than a backdrop to some incomprehensible events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than explain it. <br /> <br /> The first third of the film reveals the post-apocalyptic world in which the story is set, and actually it looks like a very interesting story is about to unfold. From then on, things are going down hill. The middle part of the film consists mainly of thin-veiled eco-propaganda, and the end is severely affected by the dependence on the kind of impenetrable spiritualism that destroys a large number of Japanese animation films. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie feels as if someone has depleted every other page from the script before being transferred to the animators. What remains is something that is visually astonishing (although the version I saw was, unfortunately, a copy of the Nde generation, with a poor color - resulting in the general myth that Nausicaa shows her bare bottom as he flying) but making little sense and eventually left me confused.
