It's a rip-off of all the crappy Hollywood movies like Scream and I know what you did last summer. The story is classic, some high school students try a prank on the class's asthma misfit, but something goes wrong. Terribly wrong. If you watch the movie, you know what will happen before it always happens, not good if a movie is scary. The actors are pretty good and the girls are cute (they were Asian at that time), so I give it two out of five on the Mojave'o meter.
