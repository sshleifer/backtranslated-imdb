May I not get it right. I mean the movie. It doesn't make me happy or whatever. Maybe because of my mood. Anyway, this one is a simple family movie with children for actors. Just admit that - all movies of that kind cannot pass the 4 out of 10 barrier, but that plays in the movie (for example Antonio Banderas was in that kind of movie ... two or three of them can't remember the exact score ). I'm getting bored. I almost fall asleep just because the subject is so clich√© and the actor play was so predictable. But I'm sure my child will love this movie if he grows up ... Hey, I'm not a monster. I found some hilarious or good moments in the movie. The owls in the movie were so cute. The trick with the painted police car windows and the hits the child received in the head by a golf ball ...
