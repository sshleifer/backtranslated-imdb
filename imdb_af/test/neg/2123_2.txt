A perennial match in the IMDb bottom 100, it's not hard to see exactly why it's apparently failing in virtually every bloody section! <br /> <br /> Take the editing for a start; To mention this choppy is too much complementary! Indeed, if the creators of this one got drunk one night and cut the film rolls with scissors and children's cloth, then the resulting rubbish could not be worse than we actually had here. In addition, the rude story is mercilessly dragging on what looks like a painful infinity before finally reaching the particular clumsy climax. <br /> <br /> Apart from the eternal game Michael Sopkiw, the poor performances of most of the other players also do not really help. And the real beast that causes all the problems is somewhat less than convincing to put it mildly. Yes, it is indeed a complete pile of shit if I have ever seen one. <br /> <br /> Deary, dear me .... and to think that Lamberto Bava did it .... tut, tut indeed. <br /> <br /> Note: It was released in the UK under the alternative title of Devouring Waves, although most of its gore screens were robbed. Ironically, this is just the only reason why it might be worth looking at.
