Maybe in the day this movie was special. But five decades later, it looks beautiful, just another movie about the horrible 1950s. Stereotypes abound in this fluffy story about three female gold diggers sitting in a Manhattan penthouse store, in an attempt to attract rich men. <br /> <br /> I don't care about the level theme. But the film's prospect is lame. And the execution is worse. It's a romantic comedy, but I didn't find much to laugh. The plot point about an extremely nabysighted bimbo is about the only clever element of the story. Overall dialogue is flat, and so is the delivery. And the scripture structure is disturbing. The plot still remains to and fro among the three ladies. It's as if the author can't mix the ensemble roles. The result is a plot that looks hooked. <br /> <br /> Marilyn Monroe was a good choice for her role. But Lauren Bacall was too old for the role she played. And Betty Grable, with her wheezing voice and horrible hairstyle, was just annoying. <br /> <br /> Color kinematics are conventional. But there were many shots using the rear screen projection, which contributed to a dated look. The footage is made even worse by costumes that have a "shine" in the 1950s; they are just terrible. Viewers must endure a fashion show, a plot point that enhances how the film's director was beaten by the trashy cheerful clothes. <br /> <br /> And then there's that band. In what is probably the worst movie opening in the history of cinema, the first part of the movie has an orchestra that plays a bit of sound. Initially I thought I was looking at the introduction to the upcoming attractions. But no, it's actually part of the movie. And the band plays on, and on, and beyond. It has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with the story. What did they think? <br /> <br /> I enjoyed Marilyn Monroe, with her breathtaking voice as she made her way through the plot bimbos. But the movie would have been much better if they plunged the other two ensemble roles, plunged that band, strengthened the comedy dialogue, and played that gaudy, scary costume.
