With Hong Kong punch Andy Lau and veteran star Ching Wan Lau, "Aau Chin", everything went for the start of the movie, unfortunately the movie was disconnected. <br /> <br /> Andy Lau plays a sophisticated thief who has only 4 weeks to live, but has one more thing unfinished ... He draws a comprehensive scheme that will let the police fool him But the police are hot on his tail .... Can he pull it off before being caught? <br /> <br /> Building the movie is good. Bits of the clues are left behind for the audience to try to guess the right intent. Unfortunately, building up leads to a disappointing final confrontation. It feels like in the middle of the writing the author has changed and all the build-up is disconnected. <br /> <br /> A 3/10 ....
