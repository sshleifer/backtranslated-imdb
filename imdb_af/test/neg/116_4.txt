Blind Date (Columbia Pictures, 1934) was a decent movie, but I have some problems with this movie. First of all, I do not estimate the actors in this movie, but more or less, I have a problem with the script. I also understand that this film was made in the 1930s and people wanted to escape reality, but the writing made Ann Sothern's character look poor. She kept going back and forth between the travelers and I felt as though she had to stay with Paul Kelly's character. He really cared for her and her family and would have done something for her and he eventually gave her the capricious Neil Hamilton who was, in my opinion, a good time. Paul Kelly's character, although a workaholic was a man of integrity and truly loved Kitty (Ann Sothern) to Neil Hamilton while he loved her, I did not have the depth of love he had for her character , not seen. The production values ​​were large, but the writing could have used a little work.
