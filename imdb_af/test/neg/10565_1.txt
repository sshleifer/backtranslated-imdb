After the opening credits on a black sheet of paper with speckled white paint sprayed on it, oh I will be generous and call it a star field, we see an alien spacecraft crawling into a meteor and forced to land on the earth to land. A terrible search model spacecraft landed on a horrible search model. Three nearby campers explored. From the burning spacecraft a reptile comes out like a stranger, the 'Nightbeast', OK, so I lied it's a guy in a dodgy rubber monster and silver space suit. The campers are quickly murdered by the Nighbeast's laser gun that creates frightening special effects on humans. The villages of Sheriff Jack Cinder (Tom Griffith) are informed. He warns his deputy Lisa Kent (Karin Kardian) and gathers a mansions together to investigate. Meanwhile, the Nightbeast killed an unfortunate motorist who had stopped at the side of the road for a leak. His two annoying children run for help. They approached a house, kissing within two young people, the girl said "someone goes to the house". The man stands up to take a look and is attacked by the Nightbeast, it also kills the girl. Then he manages to kill the two children with his laser, maybe the Nightbeast is not that bad. As soon as the Sheriff and his men arrive at the scene, they have a gun / laser strike with the Nightbeast. Possibly the surviving rifle battle in film history, the Sheriff, his deputy and a local man, survive Jamie Lambert (Jamie Zemarel). But the Nightbeast is still alive, bullets have no effect on it. The next day, Sheriff visits Mayor Bert Wicker (Richard Dyszel) and his girlfriend Mary Jane (Eleanor Herman) to get permission to evacuate everyone in town. He refuses to say that a party he holds for governor (Richard Ruxton) cannot be canceled and he does not want to create a panic situation. The Sheriff evacuated the town anyway. Two doctors, Steven Price (George Stover) and Rut Sherman (Anne Firth) are attacked by the Nightbeast before they can leave. However, they succeed in scaring and surviving the Nightbeast. Together with the Sheriff, his deputy and Jamie, they decide to stay behind and fight the stranger. Written and directed by Don Dohler, it must be an amateur movie, with family and friends, look at the credits and see how much Dohler's involved. For that reason, I should probably cut it badly, but it still doesn't stop, or excuse it as a horrible movie in every section. It has no story or purpose, things just happen to waste time, how is Drago (Don Leifert) strangling his ex girlfriend Suzie (Monica Neff)? These and many more scenes don't add anything to the movie. The script also has no logic, why does the Nightbeast bump around the town if it is supposedly vacated? The special effects are embarrassingly bad, just look at the effect when the Nightbeast shoots someone with his laser, a computer effect will be an 80-spectrum shy. There is not much blood or gore in it, an open open stomach, a cut arm and a decade, but they all look predictable. Credit where this is the result, the Nightbeast itself looks good in most cases. There is a sex scene between the Sheriff and his deputy who must be seen to be believed, music that would even shame a porn and two very ugly naked people make it a tough series to watch. Less than star acting, photography, music, lighting and editing make it a real job to go through. And the worse thing about this movie? It connects the mortal sin to being boring and not pleasant in the slightest. Sorry Don mate, but don't give the day work! Definitely one to avoid.
