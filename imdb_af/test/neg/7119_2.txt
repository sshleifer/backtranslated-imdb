My best guess is that this piece will come on DVD a few days before Christmas. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible. The timeline jumps all over the place. It wouldn't be that bad if it was a bit stressful for the end. It was completely predictable. Bitch girls opt for outcasts, wiping out to know why they hate her so much, bitch girls die a terrible death, outcast girl goes home and looks crazy. Extinct girl brought evil spirits with her, neighbors go crazy and kill each other. Creepy child understands what is going on. Oh, and the younger sister is not good enough for Mommie, sick mother sends younger daughter to bring the golden child home. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there were good moments here and there. First, Sarah Michelle Geller's character dies in the first few minutes. Some plus. Not seen one coming. I didn't expect the woman to throw bacon on her husband's head. If the movie stopped that kind of excitement, I would have loved it. The beginning showed so much promise. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed because I enjoyed the first one. It made me jump, I didn't expect the most from it, and although I questioned the movie, it was still a fun look. I didn't see any previews for this successor, because I wanted to be surprised. I was, but in the wrong direction.
