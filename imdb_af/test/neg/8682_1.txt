<br /> <br /> Very dull, laborious adjustment of Amis' amusing satire. The hero is not portrayed as a detachable loser, but a mere adultery. Most of the rest is pure caricature with just Helen McCrory giving real quality and something of the novel's white. The period setting was camped as if it were the 1920s, not the post-war period of horror comics and rock'n'roll. A real dud even according to the standards of the bad British TV. <br /> <br />
