It starts out like a very serious social commentary that reminds you of other Clark movies like Kids, Bully, etc. But then it becomes as fast as it gets in a direction less messed up. Who is the main character? Is it a serious movie or a Gregg Araki esquire about the top goofy movie? Is it a skate documentary with moments of dialogue taking place? I have no idea. I watched myself watching the watch and wondering when this turd will end. I thought there would be a big shocker who never came. I cut a good 20 minutes out of the movie by quickly moving through the pointless skate scenes. Yes, it does not illustrate the changing landscape between people. I got it again in the beginning. Children and Bully have been done in such a way that I actually felt that I saw the realities of that group of friends. Wassup has become very phased, poorly built and getting worse. Teen Caveman, who did not write Larry but did live, was horrible. But at least it felt like it was supposed to be a terrible movie that didn't take itself seriously. Wassup Rockers was just bad.
