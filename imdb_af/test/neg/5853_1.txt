Michael Allred's comic strips, especially his work on Madman, are usually fun. "Astroesque," Allred's non-budget indie movie, is the opposite of fun. <br /> <br /> The worst acting play, along with a really horrible dialogue, makes for a brutal cinematic experience. Pretty sure Allred understands WTFs, but he is the only one. If you dare to watch the whole mess, that's not enough. Defending yourself to see the whole mess is more on the target. <br /> <br /> "Astroesque" is a kind of movie band for Allred's "Red Rocket 7" comic book, which, ironically, is mostly illegible. So if your Astroesque experience is not terrible enough, you should definitely find the excessive comics and the fun. <br /> <br /> Sorry for Allred, who was completely out of his depth to try a movie. Also felt sorry for myself, which is an incredible waste of my time and money. Please buy my VHS copy, which is now available on eBay. Hurry up.
