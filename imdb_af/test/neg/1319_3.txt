A very wonderful cast and many talented technical staff have wasted their valuable career time, and our equally valuable free time, by supporting this completely predictable and clearly formal piece of commercial junk. The movie is based on a very good and up-to-date idea, but both the producers and the director applied the standard Hollywood disaster movie formula to destroy any potential value of production. <br /> <br /> An exceptionally high tide and very strong storms combine to create a record high storm record that overwhelms London and overflows most of the Thames Valley. The plot centers around a heroic scientist (Tom Courtenay) who warns the authorities of the danger and eventually saves the day, a glamorous female police chief who looks the whole show and an appointed deputy prime minister (David Suchet) who looks important . <br /> <br /> But it's so unreal that you feel like an extended tea after just 30 minutes. The young glamorous female police commissioner demands complete authority over the army during a declared emergency and gets it (as if!). The experienced general is only set aside, such as a complete moron that must lick her boots because of her obvious better capacity. The problem is that our female supremo, now responsible for millions of lives, spends most of her time on the fate of her two daughters who traveled to South West London and didn't call to say they were good . So our mighty wife sets her staff to look for them and decides that the only priority for all the army and rescue services must be South West London and not any other quarter of the city. Of course, the Minister, the army and the entire entourage accept her priority without any question. One can only assume that everyone had property there. When her children are finally found out of endless reports and efforts by her staff, they are told by our male hero, "Thank you, God is safe, that's the most important thing." Never care about the millions of others or all the other responsibilities she's supposed to control; As long as her own children were safe, everything was fine. <br /> <br /> This film is just another excuse to push the same old, feminine chauvinist sexist trap that women are clever, sensible, caring and clearly capable of being leaders, while men are good at nothing besides physical bravery, senseless power and many specialist knowledge. And yet the one simple instruction she could have given the population was; namely to go to the nearest high-rise building and go calmly to the 4th floor or above and wait for instructions when the water falls back, never given by this female superhero - or even someone else. The whole problem was so easy to fix and yet millions of people apparently didn't think they were just going up! Pathetic rubbish.
