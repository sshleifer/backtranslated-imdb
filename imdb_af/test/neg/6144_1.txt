What exactly is the intention to keep people out of things like skiing passes and pizza? I don't see a point. I don't want to be smart or original and it seems to me to be extremely useless. <br /> <br /> Skyler Stone doesn't seem to be a very down-to-earth or even a nice guy. He has very little charisma and just about everyone can do what he does in this show. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this piece of crap is the fact that many of the calls are being restarted, so it's not just that they charge the poor people on the other side of the phone, but they Also, keep the audience who does not have enough time to read the "denied" that flicker over the screen for about half a second at the beginning of the show! <br /> <br /> Not only that, he also claims to be living his whole life. What a lie. No one can live their lives so much and the fact that he says it's not just another concept to see his show, but it's also one of the most crafted, blatant pieces of bullet I've ever heard. This guy is a @ $! <br /> <br /> What makes them think it's hard to write and record a song, get someone to pain a great picture of you and two friends, get dance lessons and actually traveling to a ski resort, is it just worth getting free ski passes and food? What's the point? It is very difficult to just go for a few ski passes and some snow. <br /> <br /> As far as "comedy" is concerned, it's underneath the stuff.
