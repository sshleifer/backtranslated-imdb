When I reviewed the review for this movie after I watched it, I was surprised that there were people who gave good ratings. <br /> <br /> It's a movie of bad camera work. Everything terrifying happens on the screen, usually accompanied by a close-up of someone shouting "Did you see / hear it?" Well, no, we didn't see it! We can't! And when there were no close-ups, the camera did something strange like turning upside down or back and forth, really shaking fast, or transferring action or making us physically sick. <br /> <br /> The characters were unattractive because they shouted the same thing over and over every two minutes. It doesn't matter to me if it will be so real, I haven't rented a scary movie to see reasonable things! I expect unreasonable things like strangers, demons or good acting! They were also stupid. Let's have intimate relationships in a cave! With all our clothes on! About the fact that the end is somewhat inconsistent with what Domingo immediately said before he died. It got me a little, but not so much as the fact that the end to a ... serious raid of one girl's privacy led. <br /> <br /> No plot, no climax, no good acting, terrible camera -work. What's left? Oh, right. The end might have had a 'twist', but generally with horror movies, the turn at the end actually has understandable relevance to what happened during the film. Sixth Sense does - it explains a lot. Hide and seek as well. But the Cavern had a lame turn that served as an "explanation," if you could call it, like that. Explain. Anything. <br /> <br /> Don't see it. Please.
