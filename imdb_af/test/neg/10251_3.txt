Yesterday I watched this TV production, and I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I didn't have great expectations when it was a TV production, but the whole movie was painless. I spent it for 3 hours, but it was just me who was bored to death. Every minute was a long struggle and I really fought hard to stay away from the switch. <br /> <br /> The film is about a doctor (Dr. Verghese) who gets many AIDS patients. , and most of them die during the movie. It is difficult for Verghese to live together so that his family is punished with his frustrations. However, this movie has problems with both sides. It mostly focuses on his conversations with the patients, and sometimes we see flashes from his home, but we don't get much. The trouble of showing more than one part of Verghese's life doesn't get any better with the poor who are acting at Naveen Andrews, a man I (hopefully) can't see in any good future movies. <br /> <br /> I believe it has 7.6 because of the subject (taboo?), but I'm sure there are better movies on this topic on the market. Stay away from this movie, do not earn more than 3/10. <br /> <br />
