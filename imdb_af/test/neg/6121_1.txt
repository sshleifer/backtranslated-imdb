This movie was a waste of time. It looks nice, nice settings, beautifully behaved, looks serious and looks like a leader, so you keep quiet in anticipation of a meaningful payout. It doesn't happen. <br /> <br /> It surprised me that so much trouble can be put into a movie, it was obviously very professional and has an outcome that looks no less than a b movie. <br /> <br /> Save your precious time and see a good French movie like Les Visitor (funny), Jean de Florette or Manon of the Spring. I can't recall the language in Europe Europe, but it's another great movie, but it's very worth watching. <br /> <br /> This movie looks very promising, but doesn't deliver anything.
