Have you ever thought of watching a horror movie with a group of friends, "Wow, it's so cool! We're gonna make a horror movie soon. I bet it's not as hard as it looks"? Well, it had to happen in the minds of the young Campbell brothers in 2003, presumably just after Sam Raimi's "The Evil Dead" or a similar independent horror classic was watched. However, this "Demon Summer" is so bad, it's embarrassing! Of course, these young amateur filmmakers worship the horror genre and know their classics, but they do not make them talented. In my years I saw quite a lot of evil movies as a horror fanatic, but it is honest as one of the biggest pieces of shit ever made. And it's rather sad to be open-minded, because the whole team and crew clearly had good intentions. There is no script at all. A Duo devil simply steals a mysterious book from a bum and, while some parts read it, changes one into an ominous demon that kills the members of all the different teen groups: dorks, hot Catholic girls, stoners and troublemakers. It's about it, except of course for all the compulsory clicks, such as the hot girl for the biggest dork etc. Etc. Fall ... The performances are really painful to listen to and none of these annoying teens use mime! They are standing there motionless until the writing says it's their turn to communicate. I hate it! Some of the makeup effects are remotely decent but still not spectacular and contain the soundtrack of the most terrible punk songs ever. This movie should never be released. I can very well suggest that it was fun to be part of the production, but it is completely immaculate and does not contain the slightest redeeming element. Not even a little amateur nudity, damn it!
