Awful, confusing little shit of South Africa. I've watched it twice now and I don't really know what's going on. It had something to do with a stupid, blue Aztec mummy, a "human robot," which is the dumbest looking robot I've never seen before, and a woman reincarnating some of the ancient Aztec chicks. is. Most of the story is told by an incredibly dull scientist in a painfully slow and drunk way. This man is a wonderful sleep aid. His nemesis is a fat slab called The Bat, which is a beautiful, unattractive name for an evil scientist. <br /> <br /> I think the boring scientist and his worm assistant dug the mummy and what a shock worker, the scientist's wife HAPPEN just to be the reincarnation of the mum's girlfriend. They keep the mummy in a mausoleum for some reason or other, so I think the excessively bad man can steal it. It takes him five years to do this, finding out a "human robot" to steal or attack the mummy, or whatever. He is after a treasure that has the mummy so he can be rich. But excuse me, if the man had such a great intellect and a strong drive to succeed, why did he not only patience his ideas and become so rich? <br /> <br /> Well, well, it'll make too much sense. Instead, there is ridiculous battle between the mummy and the robot, and it's really hard to tell which one is more fussy or more cheesy. To tell the truth, I watched it because I thought of a movie with a name like The Robot Vs. The Aztec Mummy just had to be decent cheese. Instead, it was just a pity and very confusing.
