A long time ago, back in the early 80's, a late-night TV broadcast "Fridays" came to ABC and tried to hide the spotlight from NBC's bad list "Saturday Night Live". It did not, but it presented some repulsive sketches and semi-talented "comedians" to the world. Like Mark Blankenfield, for example. <br /> <br /> What brings us to a roundabout brings us to Jekyll and Hyde ... Together. What is different in all ways. <br /> <br /> Blankenfield is about as subtle as a pool of adult pillows going to the Lord's Supper. And so tasteful. It's just his drastic druggist character he has played on the bad "Friday" show that is vast. And if you didn't like it, why do you read this review? <br /> <br /> At any time, it takes more than one or two writers to write a movie, it's a bad sign. Then, when it comes to choppy jokes that will throw you from every stage of improvement in the Western Hemisphere and replace the hole with exchange, things can only get worse. <br /> <br /> A comic strip takes a Robert Louis Stevenson story? Just like an idea to make a sitcom from Poe's "Fall of the House of Usher". <br /> <br /> Aside from a few (very few) gags that give a slight smile, this whole movie is an exercise in waste-loss actors, wasted film, wasted opportunities. <br /> <br /> No wonder their original writer Stevenson showed up in his grave. What more remarkable an overview can they give themselves? <br /> <br /> No stars. No, not even for Armstrong, who had to know better. <br /> <br /> "Hyde" of this one.
