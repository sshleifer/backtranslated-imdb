This movie is such a total waste of time. I can't understand anyone sitting around this piece of dirt. Oh, I would love it when I was seven years old. I think a seven-year-old child could write and direct it. <br /> <br /> There is no writing, no acting, just junk. The best thing about it is the fighter planes. I think I can swing this ninjas and I'm not someone you will hardly consider. Totally unconvincing and not the least interested. I stood laughing at the end of the first ten minutes of the film. This is one that will turn people away from martial arts films. Great comedy, bad action movie.
