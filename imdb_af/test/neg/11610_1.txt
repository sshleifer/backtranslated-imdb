At my local video rental shop they have a special place for Two Girls and a Guy. It really is a long running joke. The clerk can hire people for free. They appreciate their clients too much so that they can waste their hard earned money on it. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised to see people giving this movie a good review. Maybe someone can explain it to me. (Or maybe the positive comment was joking? Did people who were involved in the movie write it? Perhaps the director's / author's mother?) Perhaps I saw so many good movies that this one failed compared.
