Wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ..... WHAT! This movie is terrible, absolutely horrible. 1. The only reason Kiefer Sutherland is on the cover is to sell it to Kiefer fans just to break their hearts. He killed one man, was shot and died before half of the movie was over, not to mention that he was only in the first 10 minutes and then disappeared to the point where he died. WHY IS IT ON THE COLLECTION as his character BLOWS. 2. Where are the EPIC screens shielded in the back cover? 3. It was too confusing, I mean what's with the girl? She had to tell the film to try to get our attention. She failed! 4. If Kiefer dies in a movie ... it fails. Now I'm going to see 24 ..... THIS FILM ERROR!
