Ugh. This movie has so many incredible plot contrivances that they have made what could have been a good movie in a horrible mess. The story is halfway decent, but the holes in the plot literally make the performance laughable. We are actually supposed to believe that the Secret Service will go against all common sense and allow the United States President to be placed at incredible risk. If this is an indication of the kind of thinking that goes on for good judgment among the President's patrons, then we are all in trouble. Roy Scheider makes a good performance as chairman, but unfortunately it is offset by Patrick Muldoon (who somehow continues to work in Hollywood because of his good looks and his rude sound of every occasion, of or script requires a smirk). Maybe someone will see it and be inspired to make a good movie out of the box - or maybe someone will see it and say, "Hey, if they can get a movie that made this bad, maybe I can too!"
