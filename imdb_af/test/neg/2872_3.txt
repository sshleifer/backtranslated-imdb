this movie was really bad. It has the quality that many indie films have: moments of humor filled with long spaces that are completely boring. Any death-hard BAM-maga fan will be like this movie, but then it may be the only person to see it. somebody gave me this movie to watch and know I'm a fan of Jackass and was a fan of viva la bam, before the written nature of the show was thin. To explain why this movie does not work, I just have to say the point of departure itself is played out <br /> <br /> A guy who is a girl who is terrible to him. And pretty much the whole movie you have, this Ryan Dunn guy and Bam Magera turned around like a cheerful mistress. Dicamillo's performance is strange at best. It's a humorous little, non-specific Canadian French accent, which is pretty much the scale of its performance (basically funny for 5 minutes and then it's like 'ok you pretend you're already strangely enough'). Perhaps it would work if they went for parody, but all they manage to do is make a movie with an IQ of zero. I like toilet humor as much as the next man, but it's not even that low. humor that comes from this movie is completely inside and the audience, even those skilled in Magera and the company, is left out of joke. <br /> <br /> Next time Magera is a bag of money, let's hope he doesn't blow it on a little pet project
