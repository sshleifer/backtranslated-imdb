Wow ... <br /> <br /> Reading this comment, I see a remarkable socio-cultural clash theme that arises between the US and .... The USA P.o.V. it seems to be a good movie, Parker is a nice hero, the story a light version of what can be a glorified form of reality. <br /> <br /> All three Dutch reviewers see the world through a totally different look. They are categorical and in surprisingly similar terms agree that the movie is a disaster. <br /> <br /> Far from me it is to make deviations in what seems to be a dispute between cultures, on this item as widely spaced as the sea that separates them geographically. Still based on factual observation - I saw the movie with my own eyes. I suspect the Dutch are not too far from the point. <br /> <br /> "Parker Kane" was poorly made, quite boring and really The celluloid was not worth it, it was undoubtedly wasted in its creation.
