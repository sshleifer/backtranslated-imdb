If you like The Three Stooges, you will undoubtedly keep this 17 minutes short. There were definitely some entertaining moments in it, but like all the Stooges' work, it's all about their particular style of slapstick comedy. And I have to admit that the Stooges somehow never really did it to me. Their slapstick was always angry, rather than funny, and although it was obviously fake, their fianc√© always caused more damage than laughing. In this brief, the slapstick turns the efforts to find a wife of Shemp (a professor of music in it) because he inherited only half a million dollars on condition that he marries within 48 hours of reading the will. One of his students is interested, but as soon as a word of heritage goes out, there is suddenly a wide variety of potential brides, and there is a nice cat fight between them. Fans of the Stooges will enjoy. For me, it has all the elements that make me count on them. 10/04
