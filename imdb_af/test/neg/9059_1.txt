John Candy and Eugene Levy star as careless security guards who take a big time. Indifferent is really the right word for this alleged comedy ... some laughs, but mostly groans and thoughts for yourself like "why am I watching this c ** p?" Yes, this is Meg Ryan in this too .. I'm sure she doesn't want to be reminded of .. a waste of a talented cast .. on a scale of one to ten.
