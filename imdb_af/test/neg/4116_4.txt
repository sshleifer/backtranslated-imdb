Sure, the film that has already seen its visuals was terrible and not very promising, but the premise and the movie looked good, so I'm still expecting to be entertained by this movie. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The point of departure is good, but the story is full of unlikely and logically flawed. <br /> <br /> This movie is flushed potential in the toilet. The main plot is interesting and somewhat original. It is good enough to make a good adventure movie, you would think. However, this movie fails to entertain and I think it is this movie's biggest mistake. Maybe it's too serious and a little more humor would definitely not hurt the movie. Instead, it is now nothing more than a crippled and cheap movie, filled with one unlikely event after another, which also steals too much from other, more successful films. Mainly "Jurassic Park" of course. <br /> <br /> The characters also don't help to make the movie more compelling or at least interesting to watch. I still think Edward Burns did a pretty decent job as the "heroic" head. However, the rest of the characters are really caught up in the movie and they are not very interesting to do. Rather, the film relies on its visual, which is extremely poor. Catherine McCormack also plays a very annoying character. Actually, all her character is beating, and talking about how right she was and the rest, oh, so wrong. Her character is just not nice. And the rest of the characters. Well, I've forgotten their names, I think that's enough about them. This is certainly true, although this Ben Kingsley's action alone makes this movie worth watching. He is really excellent in his kind of ominous business role, but from the moment he disappears from the movie, the movie goes off fast. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is extremely poor. It has some horrible CGI effects and they can't even see the more simple 'blue screen' effects in the movie convincingly. The sets are also terrible and inexpensive, as they can overtake and break down every moment. <br /> <br /> The movie is never tense, exciting or adventurous, as the story is brought to the least interesting and engaging way. . It is a very distant movie with distant characters who fail to impress. There are many action sequences, but everyone is so ridiculous and far from credible that they never get tense or good enough. <br /> <br /> So basically this movie is lacking in everything needed to make a genre movie like this one a good and successful one. It is sad to see how low director Peter Hyams sank for the past few years after making good movies in the 70s and 80s. <br /> <br /> 4/10
