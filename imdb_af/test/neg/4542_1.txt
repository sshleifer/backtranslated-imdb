Well, I like to watch bad horror B-Movies because I think it's interesting to see foolishness and incompetence of creators to shoot really good movie. (I always compare these movies with - for example - some Spielberg's works and again and again don't understand the big difference in what I see.) I love Ed Wood's movies because it's so clumsy, it's very funny. But people !!! "The Chilling" is not funny and is not even "interesting". This is EXTREMELY PRAYER horror movie without anything that even makes bad movies viewable. There is no acting, no screenplay, no direction, no excitement and not even blood. This is extremely improper amateur movie. It's definitely the WORST movie I've ever seen (and I've seen many "worst movies" - believe me). I warned you !!! 10/01
