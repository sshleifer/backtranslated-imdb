Corey Haim plays a kid who haunts a dog to pick up a giant trolley and OSA hit (Michael Ironside) with a 30/30 and homemade bombs. (Which probably plays Haim) O and he also protects his mother and girlfriend as well as in this vigilant but disappointing adaptation of a decent story. Corey Haim is terrible, but the film's sheer momentum as well as Ironside's imposing presence make it at least a modestly effective film. Yet the plot is ridiculous and it would be nice if we could have seen a monster or at least more gore. At least this is something else. It's also pretty likely that this movie will be the last teen movie for a while to make a teenager making pipe bombs. <br /> <br /> Matt Bronson 2/5
