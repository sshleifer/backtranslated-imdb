My Tasks: The silliest of the AIRPORT movies, and probably one of the worst of the 70's disaster movies. <br /> <br /> As if the franchise was with all its, the producers of this third successor threw to AIRPORT. In more action, stupid subplots, gratuitous star appearances and goofier elements. In its attempt to be the largest airport, CONCORDE: AIRPORT '79 is still the worst and probably one of the worst of the 1970s movie disasters. With its bad cashier results, it's no wonder the genre overshadowed its welcome. <br /> <br /> Lalo Schifrin backed the film with a rather catchy score backed by some impressive shots of the titular aircraft in its earlier glory (the same plane used in this movie will be in July 2000). be involved in an accident). But then the credits appear, and we get a glimpse of the all-star cast, which is nothing more of faded Hollywood stars, TV actors and non-popular B actors. The plot is cleaner than ever: George Kennedy is back in the role of Joe Patroni, now the pilot of the Concorde (co-pilot Alain Delon, co-pilot) to France after the Olympic Games. Mrs. To prevent her from announcing the news to the world, Harrison sends his most-advance missiles and best saboteurs to prevent the Concorde from coming from the country. <br /> <br /> The cast / subplots are thinner than ever, even sour than an alcoholic Myrna Loy or a singing nun. We have Cicely Tyson transported a living human heart in a cooler (!), Martha Raye, as a woman with a bladder condition (and the character doesn't go deeper than that), J.J. Walker and a pot-smoking saxophonist (probably the most annoying character in the film), married Eddie Albert to the "old" woman Sybil Danning, Avery Schreiber as Russian coach with a deaf daughter and finally a love story between Jon Jon Davidson and gymnast Andrea Marcovici (much to the struggling eye-catching of Mercedes McCambidge). Plus, the movie gets much closer to LOVE BOAT episode than ever with the silliest cameos of Charo (and her pet Chihuahua) and Bibi Anderson. Camp buffs will undoubtedly be a real kick-in-the-ball in this silly entry in a long 70's disaster movie. This one is a real disaster in more than the sense of the word. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 out of 5.
