This movie was really bad, simple and simple. How a movie like this widespread spread is a miracle to me. <br /> <br /> It's a decent idea, but it just didn't come out. Edward Burns, however, is a decent actor. I liked his little role in saving Private Ryan. <br /> <br /> Let's get the big problem here. <br /> <br /> The footage was so incredibly bad, I thought I had an old "Dinosaurs In 3D" CD-ROM point-and-click adventure demo on Windows 3.1 I mean, I saw tracks in pre-2000 console games that make your dinosaurs look better than this. I mean, heck ... the original Tomb Raider T-Rex looks better than this. <br /> <br /> The lizard monkeys were laughing. I thought they were a kind of ripoff creation of "Killer Instinct". I saw better socks, now I think about it. <br /> <br /> You know, there's a ton of TV made. movies that are better than this. How does a jewel like Scifi channels "The Shining" get such a small audience, but this loading of "CGI, easy to make 4 Kidz" is opened? I don't care if it's a Ray Bradbury story. Lameeeee
