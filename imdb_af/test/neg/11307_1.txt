Horrible Horrible movie, I still can't believe my friend spoke to me to see it! No plot, bad acting, unfunny scenes, and very stupid dialogue. All I have to say is that this movie is the worst movie I've seen and it's worse than Halloween III, which I also gave 0 stars. So I give it 0 stars and a 0 out of 10, well here 1, but you get the point.
