If you're in the mood to laugh at a really bad movie (bad in the way only Ken Russell can be at its worst), try this one. It manages to make you feel like you've just landed in a 25-porn camp, and you can just smell the urine on the floor. Kathleen Turner bumps into a blonde wig, to get her kicks of 'pretend' to be a two-bit hooker (she really does have a good solid work in the clothing industry and has been so badly hurt by men that it only way she can connect), and Tony Perkins plays a hysterical "priest" who is out to kill her (another movie ending with Tony Perkins in tow). Annie Potts appears and may not give an ounce of her usual white, which is enough reason to hate this movie. The kinky will love the sex scenes, so rent the Unrated version in the RED box so you can see Turner, give a policeman a taste of his Billy Club (I had to break the video recorder until we stopped laughing).
