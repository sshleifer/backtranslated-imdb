Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renne Zelwigger. They are all terrible. Especially the star, Jude Law. <br /> <br /> It is directed by the same man who did the English patient and it is based on a best-selling novel by a man who dares to return to his lover, but unlike the wonderful English patent, sucks this movie. It's really bad. <br /> <br /> Worst dialogue ever. "But we only know for a moment." "But they were a thousand moments, like diamonds in a bag" <br /> <br /> or <br /> <br /> "In some cultures you just have to say I marry 3 times with you and you is married "lovey-dovey-" I marry you, I marry you, I marry you, I marry you ... "<br /> <br /> I am ashamed I put it through. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was horrible, terrible .... Uhh, no words, I'm sick. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (the one is for the very hard bullet sounds, the sound staff did a good job)
