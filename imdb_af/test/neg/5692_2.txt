You see a movie titled 'battlespace', what are you going to think? Space battle with cool as heck explosions and all shoot at each other. What do you get with this movie? Well, you get some space battle goodness, but for a great majority of the time it's just stupid people wandering around to do almost nothing. Nobody talks !! What is this nonsense? We get a narrator, and a ton of British computers, but that's about it. The main character must be the worst I have ever seen, as she doesn't even have a dialogue, and sleeping both scenes (literally!). Some of the things that happen are just stupid, as they use a rocket (like going to space) for the basic transport plane, why not just use one of those dirty spaceships? Anyway, the music is almost non-existent, with some boring dull lifeless monsters, but the most important thing you'll see is the Atari sound effects that ships use ... you have to treasure me. I can also say that the budget was low because everything looks fake, it's not what you would expect from a movie, especially a super cool space battle movie. I seriously think the budget should be in double digits, it's so bad, so you laugh more than you need to know about how bad it is. I start thinking that they paid the actors based on how much dialogue they had, because they are very few here (if you can't say that, it's my biggest grip here, as I've said it three times ).
