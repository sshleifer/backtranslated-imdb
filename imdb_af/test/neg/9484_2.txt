A silly movie, with a silly plot. Feel like they throw every conceivable clich√© into a blender. I especially sailed the section, where two teenage girls get the French president to clean the water. Because we all know how dedicated America is to conserving the environment. Kyoto, anyone? And the French chef, who apparently never saw or tasted a hamburger ... That's why people think Americans have no culture. It and the fact that we meet your children when they come to Europe to see the world (ie eat at McDonalds in foreign capitals). They are not as stupid as the two preteens in this movie, but they only have the same amount of cultural enlightenment and good manners.
