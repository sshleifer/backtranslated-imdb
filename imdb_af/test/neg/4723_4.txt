Dr Krellman wants to save his son Julio who dies of heart disease. He decides a heart transplant with a monkey will heal his son (no, I'm not joking). He does the transplant and (in one way or another) changes his son from a weakened man to a muscle-bound man with a dime-like mask that looks like a monkey! Of course he comes out, kills men, tears of women's clothes and destruction. It's all about the boring police romance. Arturo Martinez and lady wrestler Lucy Ossorio. We also get useless feminine battle order that doesn't add anything to the plot. It all ends by copying the end of "King Kong"! This is (of course) a little silly movie. The plot makes little sense, there is the free female nudity (a staple of any exploitation click) and many graphic gores that look nice (except for the open heart transplant). However, it does have earnings. The whole role play takes everything dead seriously and actually is not bad as actors. The baptized dialogue was (well for a movie like this) well done and interesting with surprisingly good dubbing. I also have an excellent DVD printing with a bright strong color (which helps). We're not talking here a classic, but a good exploitation click.
