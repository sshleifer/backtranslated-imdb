Geologist realizes a big earthquake is coming but no one will listen. What's worse, his father-in-law predicted the Tokyo disaster in 1923 and he was called unworthy to be his successor. Of course, the big one comes and Tokyo is knocked down. <br /> <br /> A poorly baptized Japanese film that is pure soap opera for the first half. The second half after the earthquake destroys a model city, it's an escape drama. There are a few nice moments, but the film also wastes them by suppressing the action by too many poor miniature or by making people unreal. Hokey and not very good, it has an end, you won't believe ...
