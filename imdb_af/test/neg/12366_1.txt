I hope this is not a sign of things to come. High definition video cameras are becoming cheaper at all times (although I wouldn't swear it's used here), so it's open season for all Wannabe Scorseses and Tarantinos. <br /> <br /> There is no cheaper hiding. Of this stinker, and call it a 'movie', the industry would make a big disservice. Photography is of a standard you would expect on a family outing to the zoo. I could build a new house with all the woodworkers. What is remarkable about it is that no one is sticking out as the worst. They are all equally terrible. Like a lot of Ben Afflecks. Or Steven Seagals. <br /> <br /> What struck me was the title. I'm a sucker for this kind of thing, like Frankenhooker, or Monsturd. Frankenhooker was also bad, but at least I laughed a little, and the acting was just bad, not terrible. I can't comment on Monsturd, because I got another copy of it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I hope the people who made it have no money. Otherwise, they may be encouraged to try again. Please, guys, pledge the camcorder and go back to your normal job.
