First of all I would like to say that I am a fan of all the actors who appear in this movie and when I rented it, I wanted it. <br /> <br /> I think it was the main reason I was so disappointed was that the outhouse promised me a frenzy. In my eyes is an exciting thriller for British movies like something from a Ruth Rendell novel, which turns and turns dark, leaving the viewer with an end that probably won't soon be forgotten. <br /> <br /> This movie started with the promising note to be such a movie. We have our main character, who suspects a man he doesn't like, to be involved in a hit and run that murdered the man of one of his servants. His ideas seem to be right, but the idea that his wife might be involved does not come before him, until she confesses that she was part of the crime. <br /> <br /> The elements of a good thriller were in place, but from there I felt that the movie took a different direction and almost became such a soft soap about who to be with whom and what the love of a true relationship is. The movie would have been pleasing to me if the outer case of a twisted lover's triangle spoke and was not spoken as a suspense thriller. It was more of a soap opera story and the initial setting was a gentle distraction to the true content of the movie. I felt that this movie could do much better than it did. I felt it kept the viewer going for a big event that never went. So, I have to give it a lower rating than I would have liked and say it didn't meet my expectations.
