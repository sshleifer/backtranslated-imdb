I'm sick of the open mind argument. I am generally completely open minded, but this kind of line is basically made by people who enjoy things that should not be "enjoyed". You know what, there is a reason why so many people become disgusting. And just because someone is out there doesn't make it any less. After all, there is a reason for the feeling of horror, and no amount of "open mind" or "push the envelope" should eliminate that feeling. Otherwise, we are no better than senseless living things. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. Another argument is that this film sets women in the roles normally reserved for men. That's why men don't like it. But just because it makes people more rebellious than otherwise, doesn't make it good. Perhaps men should not be switched on by what the movie industry dominates, but is the answer for women to do the same? Maybe, if you don't like movies, TV and entertainment, with so many sexual objections of women, so much violence, don't look at them. <br /> <br /> And if you're a director, don't make them. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, someone will ask an open mind when it comes to this "movie" in real life. <br /> <br /> Heck, some people like or like it.
