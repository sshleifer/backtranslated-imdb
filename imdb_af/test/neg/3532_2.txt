Sigh? The stupid government once again tried to create an inexhaustible and indestructible soldier, and of course the experiments went terribly wrong and burdened us with a half-man-half mutant that made a terrible peck and squeak like a little girl when he is upset. Lance Henriksen stars as the honest scientist who immediately ended the experiment after hearing it was a military project, but he comes back (bring the whole family with him) when he finds out that his beloved trial king is deadly spree. "Mind Ripper" is definitely a watch horror movie, but it is very original and features pretty much every lame clich√© you can think of (including the estranged father / rebellious teen boy sub plot ... yawn). The characters are like wooden puppets, the stupid things are said and done and there is a completely useless dream order ... come out of the monster !!! There are a handful of interesting tones to enjoy, and some of the isolated desert sites are scary. Lance Henriksen is, as always, enough, even though it is another inferior production he stars, and Giovanni Ribisi surely deserves a better film to set his debut. For some reason, this anonymous 90's thriller is also known as "The Hills Has Eyes Part 3". Is this because it is being dealt with by members of the same family who are made in the desert terror? Is this because Wes Craven was once again involved as a producer? Or maybe it's because after the end the monster gets naked naked like the freaky Michael Berryman in the 1977 original? Who knows ... Who cares? Wes Craven has probably funded this project because his son wrote the script and it always moves to discover that your offspring is as unmatched as you are. Not recommended!
