I just found Super Troopers almost amusing (looks like a glorified Police Academy ripoff to me) and I hired this movie in the hope that it would be better. It wasn't. <br /> <br /> The writing is absolutely terrible and the pacing of this movie is even worse. It doesn't feel like much in this movie, or it really gives us a reason to give a damn about any of the characters. <br /> <br /> The actor playing Felix is ​​completely uninspired, though possibly due to the dialogue he had to work with. In short, this movie went just as wrong. <br /> <br /> I get the impression that since movies like Clerks, independent filmmakers think they can make such movies with long, fluctuating scenes of dialogue where characters try to be funny. But, where the dialogue in Clerks pushes the story forward, in this movie, it weighs hopelessly. Films are supposed to have a decent balance of action and dialogue, and as tempting as filmmakers are trying to have tons of funny, funny dialogue, it doesn't always work. Especially if they are not so good at writing a dialogue. I hate to say, but even "Extreme Heist" was more interesting than this movie - and that movie was so low-budget it was shot on video.
