I'm a fan of some of the holiday movies, but when a movie franchise goes from the big screen to the TV screen, you know it's out of steam. Made for TV National Lampoon movies don't do well on TV. This movie is another reason. <br /> <br /> I think many of us were excited when it came out, but we also had to face reality ... it's a TV movie. Randy Quaid is fine as cousin Eddie, but is better in a supporting role than the lead. Dana Barron sets history as the first actor to repeat her role as one of the Griswold children. She is just as pretty, but it doesn't help a thin script. <br /> <br /> Why was this movie even made? This was probably because NBC recently hosted a few years of X-mas Vacation. There is nothing wrong with the acting. It's all in the writing. It's just not funny. People need to think before they write such things. It's a Christmas movie I don't recommend.
