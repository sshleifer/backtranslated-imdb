I was supposed to be the cat and mouse duo, but it wasn't in place, it was something that didn't even have to be done for his time. They disguise themselves in the "black plane" mode because they fly to Africa and they even act like Stepin Fetchit and all the other role in one. There are some cartoons that are racist, but they are classic, a mixed woman. I have the right to say this, but if you are in the historical aspect of these cartoons, Merry Melodies "Coal Black and the Sebben Dwarfs" or "Angel Puss" you will not get it on DVD because the distributors have promised not to put it in the mainstream, but you can find it on a website like YouTube. I do not recommend to small children to see it, but if you want to see how early America was racist and ignorant, it is better suggestions, not to mention that this particular cartoon has bad animation, I know it was 1932, but I saw better for his time. <br /> <br /> "Aircraft" unnecessary. -1 out of 10.
