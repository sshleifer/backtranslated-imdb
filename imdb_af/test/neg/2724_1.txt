Am I the only one to see that the "realism" of the 19th century ship is faulty. Actually, it's a 15th century, right around 1620, if the memory serves me, because the "realistic" ship in the movie is the Mayflower, now that I know the Mayflower never went to Australia or even a trip to Australia did not try. I don't know who dealt with R&D for this movie, but the use of the Mayflower and the hope that no one will see it is indeed a poor job. <br /> <br /> They even printed it on the cover art and the DVD. I wonder how can other people notice this little blunder? Not to mention that the movie itself was just awful, I'd have expected Sam Neill better.
