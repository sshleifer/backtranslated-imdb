I woke up and it was a beautiful day; The sun shone, the birds sang and I wanted to get a movie, something new, a horror movie maybe? Like many other reviewers, I found what can only be described as a piece of poop in a golden cover. The cover is great, and the comments on the back are fascinating. "That will scare the crop out of you" ............, How I look back at such naivety and ignorance. <br /> <br /> One of the many things that is scarcer than this movie is the acting skills of these 'actors'. I think no, I actually cheered when they were beaten by these "scarecrows", wearing some classic costumes. I ran rather quickly past the maize, because I found that they were terribly scary at night, but when I saw this movie, I almost watered myself (just as much laughter) just at the face. <br /> <br /> I have barely seen omelette, but not mine, I'm a dab hand at the cooking omelets, and if anyone affects this movie with my omelet, let's just say I'm a would create a situation in which they would be forced to watch this movie 3 times in a row. <br /> <br /> If anyone has good movies, they can recommend it, feel free to let me know. It's a big comedy if nothing else, OK, it's nothing else. Enjoy, but a little advice - before pushing the play button on your DVD player, throw it out of the window.
