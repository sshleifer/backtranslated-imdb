In the 1980s, this cozy middle-class sitcom became the subject of much hatred by the new breed of talented comedians, such as Ben Elton. Did it deserve such anger? Well, Terry and June were never smart, it was never a well-written story with different threads that did not conclude. It was the show your mother and father and probably grandparents watched. Rather, they climbed or laughed, but they were never inclined to offend. The fact that they never challenged them was unimportant. <br /> <br /> One foot in the grave initially suffered because it appeared on the first face to be just another Terry and June. <br /> <br /> A few days after Terry Scott's death, an episode was broadcast on rural TV, and it's his final outing. There are few repetitions of the show on any TV channel. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, TV comedy has progressed since Terry and June. It's hard to find good words for it - Terry Scott made the best of bad scripts.
