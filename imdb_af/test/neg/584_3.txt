Although the Our Gang comedies still have their followers, I have to say that their effort to upgrade movies has been a pleasure for Hal Roach. Why Roach had to choose the Civil War as it is subject to all the accompanying racism that would follow. <br /> <br /> Dashing southern cavalier Phillips Holmes takes the young orphan Spanky McFarland and his young black friend Buckwheat Thomas to Spanky by accident in uncovering a map error on a river boat. Everyone is quiet and calm in the old south and then the Civil War fails it for everyone. <br /> <br /> But even kids can be the worst in the world and there's nothing worse than the damse Yankees. They just come south and ruin it for everyone. <br /> <br /> Critical though it was for the southern point of view, Gone With The Wind made a good cause for the Southern cause and the blacks portrayed, although they would serve themselves. Being out of necessity is still three-dimensional characters. Hattie McDaniel would not have won her Oscar if it wasn't. Butterfly McQueen's character of Prissy as silly and empty as she was, has some dimension. <br /> <br /> Here, however, some of the worst racial stereotypes were ever born in Hollywood. The company of Spanky and Bokwiet show that children come together, racial feelings are not innate. It is not the ministry of the blacks that is offensive, but there is total acceptance of it. From the horrible watermelon song sung about the title credits, the message of General Spanky is bad. <br /> <br /> However, it received an Oscar Sound Record nomination, probably one of the few Hal Roach ever came from the short term. <br /> <br /> However, General Spanky is far from Gone With The Wind.
