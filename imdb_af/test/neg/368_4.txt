Some spoilers **** a soap have wonderful moments to recommend it. When Charlotte and Veronica come close to intimacy, a beautiful, low key, is really a erotic scene. I also loved the music score and the soft, muted cinematography. I'm not clear whether the curious stop and start structure of the movie comes from originally consumed in serialized form (the announcer describing the action in sections is pretty annoying). My biggest problem with this movie is his rather absurd portrayal of a transwomen and her life. Of course, as a sex worker (who else), scatterbrained, impractical, absurdly frilly / girly, she must be shown totally hopeless when it comes to garment and is unable to make any interpersonal attachments in the world. In addition, she is always shown with two-day growth of beard (for a bizarre reason) as to emphasize how foolish her life is. And she's waiting to get a heroin operation when she seems to have done nothing else to send her over. In fact, the character looks like a drawing queen, not someone in the transition. <br /> <br /> These are typical fantasies of people from outside who aren't really connected to transpeople. The film's fetishment of GRS operation is a way of objecting to people who are passing through. Not impressed with this aspect of the movie at least. At least, why not the character played by someone who is really transgender ... I thought the male actor depicting Veronica was good, but not better. Much better was the woman depicting Charlotte, a very complex character full of energy, self-rejection, desire and contradictions. If she is so fascinated by someone with female energy, a Charlotte can go out to a women's bar within two seconds and find it. Yes, she was drawn to Veronica, but more than an abstract idea of ​​someone with male / female characteristics (a gentle touch but with a good punch), not as a unique person. Yes, what a soap says about love is often beautiful and moving, but that doesn't mean that an overall stereotype minority needs to be more standardized in the process. <br /> <br /> This movie also shows that devils are dancers. For such a promising point of departure (better performed in a film like "Different For Girls"), the final film is a decay.
