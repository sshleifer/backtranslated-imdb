Irwin Allen's first venture in every star spectacle was one star disaster. The story of mankind contains some of the most incredible decisions of all time. Virginia Mayo as the blonde Cleopatra, Dennis Hopper, who visits Napoleon, Peter Lorre, for weeks as Nero, Marie Wilson, as Marie Antoinette as a road show, Marilyn Monroe, is just a few of them. <br /> <br /> The film is also known as the last movie that contains all three Marx Brothers, although they all have different roles. Chico plays a monk who is Christopher Columbus' confidant, Groucho euchres the Indians from Manhattan Island like Peter Minuit, and the most astonishing of all, Harpo Marx, and Sir Isaac Newton, who discover gravity when an apple puts it on bean chop. <br /> <br /> Keeping all these depictions together is a story where man himself is judged. A Super H bomb is about to be discovered and let go of the world's population. This is the day of judgment coming. <br /> <br /> But man has his advocates and opponents. Speaking for the persecution is Old Scratch, which has brought the worst in mankind in the form of Vincent Price for centuries. But the man also has his good side and who better than Ronald Colman to demonstrate the man at his most civilized best. Colman and Price plead their case before the judge played by Cedric Hardwicke. <br /> <br /> In those three individuals, you have the most beautiful voice that the English language ever knew. When the movie is on them, because they bring the exhibits to their cause, it is a pleasure to listen to. Then, when the focus is on the individual stories, you want to scream in fear. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying to find out what Irwin Allen managed. Was he deliberately established with some of the ruling decisions? If it were satire, it just didn't get off the ground. <br /> <br /> It was Ronald Colman's farewell movie and while there is almost nothing I would like to go out of, I can't tell any man who has bettered civilization. <br /> <br /> So when you see the story of man, forward through some of the exhibits and treasures every moment the advocates are before the judge.
