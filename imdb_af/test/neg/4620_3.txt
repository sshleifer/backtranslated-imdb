I have a love for this twist on British social norms and it is rare that anyone loses me. But we better lost a little. It's a story of social climbers and their joy to break the rules, but personally I found it a little dull. <br /> <br /> I love the Duchess, though she eats a little too much and Constance Bennett fulfills Lady Greyston's role, a role Bette Davis has played backwards. <br /> <br /> But the movie comes alive in the third act when Ernest joins the festival. He is so lively and fun (and in truth it probably carries more makeup than Lady Grayston). He gets the last line of the movie and it's a guest!
