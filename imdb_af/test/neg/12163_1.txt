Okay, I think I'm pretty much a spindled fan, mutilated, and destroying Stephen King stories (when they reach the "Screen") as any of our sad Masochists out here. I know very well that most of them are poorly done. I expect it. I plan on that. I humbly give it ... <br /> <br /> But, this time ... GEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZ ... Okay, so I think I saw this thing a few years ago ... good. I thought I remembered that it was pretty good ... wrong ... As I say (dedicated in a late, annoying, roundabout): I really didn't try to be snobby or expect a lot, but what was it a thing, a mini series? I just have one thing to say: D ...... R ..... A ..... W ...... NO ..... U ..... T How can YOU SHOULDN'T RIGHT TO DRAW THAT DUTY, MINUTES OF MINUTE, SCREEN AT PLYGININE 'ENDLESS, COMPLETELY meaningless, and sensible, cowardly, SLOW dialogue? I mean EVERYONE ** that scene is two people DISCUSSION how they feel and back and forth and D ... R ... A ... G I ... T bl ** you good Oh ... You .. T After about half an hour, I think about 1/2 of the run (I didn't check it, sorry) I HAVE BEEN FINANCING totally brave! After half an hour what happened OTHER than the original accident ...? They ran away while the "shop" man killed eye doctors, news photographers and LOTS & LOTS & LOTS of winding dialogue. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, I promise it doesn't I have to do ceaseless thoughts; I love movies where not much happens but in them at least when they talk and such meaningful things are said and characters are deepened, thoughts are conveyed ... ANY !!! ??? Okay, I admit that the actors in themselves were not too bad (except Stephen King, of course) I loved the shopkeeper, I thought the two parents were good. I like the general and the main lady. It's only when they cut out all the hours of stuffing, that's all I say. I mean, it's SUPPOSED to be a Sci Fi Thriller, kind ... right? You know what the price really did when the merchant made one of his many phone calls unnecessarily, this time talking to God. WHAT everyone gets emotional (for him anyway) and acts like he can't handle it. .. WTF !!! ??? The man clearly showed that he was a cold bloody, effective killer. What the HELL was about ??? So, just increase it by about 500 and that's basically why I'm finally halfway past; it was either it or myself, I swear! I mean there are other King 'adjustments' out there that are lame, but at least they're moving ... !! Oh yeah, I think maybe if you're in the 'story' and don't mind crawling together and the SUPREME & DIVINE have the patience to wait until the end, it might be worth it. <br /> <br /> But, I doubt it and humbly do it ... <br /> <br /> I don't write these things very often, but this time I just had or I couldn't sleep at night (as I did) During the show! :)
