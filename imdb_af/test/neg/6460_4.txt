Why does Guy work for Buddy? Probably because Ari wasn't in 1995. Why does Dawn want to be with Guy? For access to Buddy. Why does she stay with Guy? I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> There are many things about this movie that I'm not sure about. But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, oral tsunami like Buddy Ackerman? and totally credible because he is a good actor. <br /> <br /> Frank Whaley's Guy is definitely not his element that works for Buddy? He wants to write and make meaningful movies, not a gofer that is verbally abused to become equal instead of Sweet & Low. <br /> <br /> Michelle Forbes's Dawn, who also wants to make meaningful movies, looks like Guy's league. <br /> <br /> The end leaves much to be desired.
