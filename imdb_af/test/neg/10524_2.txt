The worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen. Action is terrible, plot is terrible, the idea is terrible, and no research has ever been done so ever! Okay, I admit, 'Air Bud' was a good movie, but not 'Soccer Dog'. This "dog" is smaller than my cat! How can he possibly play soccer? Even for 10-year-olds it won't be a problem to kick the ball hard enough to destroy the stupid dog in half! It's terrible, don't see this movie.
