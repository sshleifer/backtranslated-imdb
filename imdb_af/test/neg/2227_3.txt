Apart from some good moments of fairly rough violence, this painful movie is known to make 68 minutes look like two hours. <br /> <br /> It starts with an unforgettable long intro that launches the Leeds family, including two insatiable thieves and their adult brother and sister, totally cleaved Dad and Mum, and incredibly annoying Grandpa (played by Charles Chic ). While the lunch is being set, the family is disturbed by the sounds of gunfire, and rushes to the window in time to see that two men are being shot down by the gang. The murderers flee through the family's home and leave them as witnesses of the crime. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is Walter Huston, because the DA cross-company sometimes interrupts long anti-crime speeches to make half-hearted efforts to try and protect the family from the crowd. This is all predictable. <br /> <br /> Good points about the movie include some decent shooting ranges and a really nasty knock, Nat Pendleton as one of the shooters, and the beautiful Sue Blane in a small role as the Leeds daughter . <br /> <br /> If you want to see Huston playing his early brand-breaking lawyer, try 1932's "Beast of the City." Avoid this one as possible.
