weird.this is a TV movie, but the rating on the box says it's rated. There is nothing in the remote-qualifying movie for an R rating. From there, the film is very slow and senseless. Idea was good, but nothing was done with the storyline. It's just not soft. It's scarce, and the acting is pretty good, better than the movie deserves. I don't see myself again to see it again soon, as ever. There were other movies that deal with the same concept, which is made better than this one. I didn't see too much West Craven Movies, so I can't really compare it to any of his others. For this movie itself though I think it is poorly pregnant and poorly executed. For me, I can't give Chiller a higher rating than 3/10.
