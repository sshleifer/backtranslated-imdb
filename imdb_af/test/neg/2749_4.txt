Just as powerful as the true story of Phoolan, this book based on this film came out before she was released from prison herself and had a chance to tell it. <br /> <br /> It is allegedly based on her diaries, but she is illiterate. How does it work? <br /> <br /> It is said, some parts of the movie are accurate and the acting is not bad, with some sensitivity. <br /> <br /> In fact, this story should be old in a TV series. There is far too much going on in a few hours. <br /> <br /> Read her autobiography. Highly recommended. It's a fantastic story.
