Truly, I also love Lucy ... comic genius yes ..... MAME ... NEVER ... she was as ridiculous as Mame ... like the movie adaptation of Divine Mysteries of the Ya Ya sisterhood. Both just missed the point. Roslind Russell was, and will always be, the first and only Mame. Perhaps if a young starlet could have pulled Ball off such a role where her inherent beauty and youth could pass her ... but it was a desperate attempt by an older star to show that she was still alive in the field. . The reason for this is that many Russell's version has so many fans (except that you can't improve on the original) that Russell had a presence, she absorbs every scene, while Lucille Ball can be just as a pattern in the background in Mame for all the attention she commands in the role.
