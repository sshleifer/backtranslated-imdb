Why did I not abandon the film, apart from the sheer ugliness of the actors themselves, that someone could believe such a crap. <br /> <br /> First, Christ's second coming will be at the end of the words, and when Jesus Christ will come on the Day of Judgment, He will not come as He did before, in human form. He will come in full glory as God and we will not only be judged of our sins, but also of the consequences of our actions. All will! Secondly, I illustrated the eternal Gay Pride in this movie with the all indisputable "I read the Bible last night and it is not written everywhere". Well, this is. Moses mentions on 3 different occasions that men who make love to other men, or women who love one another, as if man and woman should be killed, for it will never inherit the kingdom of God, for they are dirty! If it were really for us to follow the Bible word for word, would there be executions, wouldn't it be? But I think misinforming people do more harm than it would ... It was the Old Testament. <br /> <br /> There are many lunatics in psychiatric wards who think they are the Son of God, but to make a movie after really reminding you of how many idiots out there can make a movie.
