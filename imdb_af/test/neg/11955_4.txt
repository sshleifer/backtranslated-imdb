First, it has nothing to do with the much better 18 weapons of Kung Fu with Gordon Liu. I call it my Kung Fu Theater. DVD has a completely misleading picture on the front page, the wrong plot at the back, and why not. The Young Hero starred Hwang Jang Lee. Apart from an introduction to the history of the 18 arms style told by the monk to some children during the opening and the usual mysterious guide that is all behind, the weapons never really appear and the battles are all boxing. The hero is Lee Shao Hwa, whom I have never heard from any of the other actors. The film calls another director, Wu Yuen Ling, as well as the one IMDb lists. The other actors are Wang Fu Quen, Wang Wing San, Chen Fei Fei, Wang Ki San, Suen King Kai and Hwa Yue Suen who sank to this movie. The battles are reasonable and regular, but not great and the 'star' does not have much charisma. The turn at the end is just stupid and the movie suddenly seems to end up being bored. The scenery and the training sequence in the river is a bit different than usual. Unfortunately, the pretty sister is drowned, not the very annoying (though acrobatic) young boy.
