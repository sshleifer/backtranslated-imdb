The Fanglys is in a small Texan town, called Layton, on the eve of Halloween, as the townspeople treat it like Christ's return or something, I mean, Halloween isn't that important? Anyway, Sheriff Pete (Burton Gilliam) was called to another murder when local boy Ned (co-associate producer John William Galt) discovered a corpse in the local forest. Could it be the Fang Lady (Justin Hamilton)? The central character involved in a local legend about a witch killing teenagers, who knows? Mark (director and manufacturer Robert Harvey) is his funny man, and his wife. Kelly (Laurie Reeves) convinced to drive to a cemetery that his partner, Steven (Josh Gobin) found for a Halloween party the previous night. The idea of ​​spending the night in a cemetery in the middle of the forest obviously speaks to Kelly and she agrees with Steven and a girl he picked up named Camille (Natalie Woods) and their northern friend Jerry ( Tim Boswell) for an evening of fun, just as much fun as you can expect in an isolated cemetery. But soon they discover that the legend of the Fang Lady is far from the bedtime story, make a lot of things ... <br /> <br /> Edit, execute, write and directed by Christopher Abram. The Fanglys is a rubbish attempt for a horror movie. The writing is very predictable, sowing and not delivering any kind of entertainment value in the right hands and with a decent budget. The Fanglys could have been an effective horror movie, but as it is, it is not. It moves at a good pace, but the screen action is so poor that it doesn't matter. I don't quite know what to say. The Fanglys is a very bad movie. I can't see. Anyone gets any kind of pleasure from it. The dialogue is basic, the character is cliché and lifeless, while the movie looks much longer than the 90 minute run. There are a few lame attempts at humor that are not as good as the horror elements and what was that delay in the loft? I think the budget didn't allow the filmmakers to show it. Oh, if you want to know what happens to Jerry at the end, then you will also have to keep the final credits, as the lame is revealed truth, if you can really do it that far (believe it requires something). <br /> <br /> Director Abram does nothing special. Abram believes the neon lights are stylish, I can tell him it's not when your movie is supposed to be in the bush. There is no atmosphere, scares, excitement, excitement or any of the elements that make a good horror movie good. Forget about proper gore, there is a little when someone eats a skin of an arm and a lift lift by someone's throat. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the Fanglys had a $ 2,837 filming budget making it one of the lowest budget movies ever to have a commercial release, and to be brutally honest, show it. What about the delayed guy and his fake joke that looks ridiculous? The terrific special effects, the video camera cinematography and the terrible actions of everyone who makes it, make it even more painful to go through. <br /> <br /> The Fanglys is straight-to-video crap, it has no redeeming features. whatsoever, and this is a low IMDb user rating score is fully justified, it is one of those movies that I watched within half an hour and wish the thing just ended.
