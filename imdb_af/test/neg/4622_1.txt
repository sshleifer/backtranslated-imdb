This is the one movie that represents everything that is bad in the movie business. The actors are pathetic and the writing is terrible. The special effects, if any, are so badly done that it would be better to do them with cartoons. In addition, it is wonderful! I think the creators of the movie thought it had humor, but the only time I laughed was when I saw Patrick S. with long hair and the colorful costumes each one had. The screens at the end were good, but they were not part of the movie. Eventually you will ask yourself, "Why did I waste my time and money with that shit when I could see the plants growing or the clouds moving." I don't think I'm a critic or anything, but it's a real lame movie! DO NOT WATCH! STUPIDITY WAR DANGER!
