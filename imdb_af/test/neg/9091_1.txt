I was disappointed. The first Tetsuo made me an INSTANT Tsukamoto fan, from the first 5 minutes of the movie. It was fresh, innovative and just ..... different. I rather enjoy having a movie in your face and pressing all the buttons you make. Tetsuo just did what for me, a few movies can do. <br /> <br /> For those of us who like to get some fresh air, those who appreciate those horrible styles will appreciate what India movies are worth. Testuo II will probably be a discipline. If you are looking for the visceral "HYPER-KINETIC" feel of the first movie, skip this one because it's all stripped away. Tetsuo II is for some strange reason, just a typical Hollywood action movie. I was rather confused. But it's still worth looking at in my mind for any tough Tsukamoto fan.
