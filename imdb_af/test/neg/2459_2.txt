I don't think much about the factors that others have objected to here - acting, lighting, et cetera. For the most part, these things were done well enough to carry the film and transfer its points. It's just a horror movie. <br /> <br /> What fooled me was the points themselves. Because it's a deep moralistic film, and morality is very tough. In fact, it's actually fundamentalist Christian morality, and it's a fundamentalist Christian movie. Look at the sins: <br /> <br /> * Sutherland's character picked a kid at school when he was a pre-teenager, leading to his accidental death. <br /> <br /> * Baldwin's character uses masculine will, persuasion and good looks to keep quite a few women, some of whom have videos. Ooh, the pigs! How unfortunate for him that women are such passive, ruthless creatures that they have no complicity in the matter. <br /> <br /> * Roberts character's father returned from Vietnam a junkie, so ashamed to be caught what he shot. kill himself. Yes, what a terrible sin! Why couldn't he just become an alcoholic like everyone else? <br /> <br /> * and Bacon's character chosen on another schoolchild. How awful! The fact that he was a child himself is apparently nothing. Children appear to be divine according to adult criteria. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe many people support this level of moral absolutism. It seems to have been untouched in the film's comments. Just buy all these things? At least human laws treat children differently from adults, and admit that their ethical sense is partially formed. This film does not have such concerns, and I find it very offensive. It is the idea that women are helpless, dull beings before young men's evil desires. Or that a Vietnam veterinarian who manages drug addiction is so shy that suicide is a valid option. Pathetic.
