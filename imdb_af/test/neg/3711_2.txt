It's hard to find anything with praise with this movie. It's not the worst picture ever made, but it doesn't say much. The plot is rather incoherent and incredible; It seems as if the producers wanted to make a space movie, but decided to submerge it for the success of The Abyss. In some scenes, it seems that the story was initially set up in outer space; The sub has a landing suit, the technicians are worried about a frost in a rubber diving suit at the depth of a few miles, where the pressure will crush the diver and the suit like an empty beer jar. <br /> <br /> The movie is starting well, with planning a recovery from a lost fleet sub. Then the movie takes with the Siren 2. <br /> <br /> Effects are so-so. The navigation screens are all on Commodore 64 (remember, this is 1990, not 1983), the sub is controlled like no other sub ever; Instead of control consoles, the officers have keyboards with which they follow long numbers to control various ship functions. The inside of the ship is also not too convincing. <br /> <br /> The final scenes jump from awkward to absurd. Welcome in the fifties, you can check your suspension of unbelief at the door. <br /> <br /> I don't see pleasure factor here. The movie isn't good, or hilariously bathing MST3k style (until you get to the final scene), it's like eating a slightly bad apple.
