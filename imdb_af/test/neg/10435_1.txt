The acting made you feel like you were playing a toddler. The story is full of holes and gaps and jumping around so you have no idea what just happened. Half of the screens are useless. There is no complicated character development. The score / soundtrack consists of about three songs. In particular, about 70% of the screens are played. I'm glad I just rented the movie, but I still feel cheated. Avoid this movie at all costs, unless you want to see some decent actors do terrible things. The bulk of the budget seems to have been spent putting a few brand name actors in this less than bad movie. This movie is equivalent to visiting a strip club, it is excited and interested you, but just as you think something is going to happen, you are thrown into some unrelated scene and you have been trying to figure out how to get there has.
