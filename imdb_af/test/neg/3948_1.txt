The plot: A group of young people with ridiculous names (Hutch, Swink, Phineaus, and October) are brought along by the death of their equally ridiculous friend Loomis. After the funeral, they decided to divide their former friend's belongings. Among them is a video game called Stay Alive. The group decides there is no better way to show their sadness than to participate in some virtual bloodshed. But the more they play, the more they realize the connection between the game and the death of poor Uncle Loomis. <br /> <br /> The Production: This movie is just another entry to the latest Hollywood budget of low budget PG-13 horror aimed at paying junior high school. The direction is sloppy to say the least with fast-paced music styles that make the action difficult to follow. The dialogue is so severe that it actually kills brain cells. The plot itself is so full of holes that we never learn where the game came from, or why those who play it die. <br /> <br /> The idea behind this movie, though not quite original, has a promise. But the poor performance on both sides of the camera makes this one big dud. <br /> <br /> If you ever have a craving for "killing someone in a video game, killing them in real life" horror movie takes my advice and saves Stay Alive for superior Brainscan.
