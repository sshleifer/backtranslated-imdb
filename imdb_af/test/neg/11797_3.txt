It was obvious that someone had gone on the Blair Witch wave. <br /> <br /> This movie is set up like all the "reality" ghost games that have appeared on television lately (and I must admit I get a kick out of this), but this movie is a lot of stocking! Probably the first three quarters of the movie is filled with the "participants" going home, WINNING. Give me a chance! Spending 10 minutes to go to the attic is not my idea of ​​a good time. Any paranormal events are blatant setup. No strings, but also perfectly captured on camera to be really. The "participants" were also not nice. Two goofy guys who don't take it seriously, one girl scared to the drop of a hat and the characteristic over-played "paranormal" person. Is this the clichéd formula for a ghost film? <br /> <br /> I must admit that the last 15 minutes was pure tension. They each took our tension in the movie and held it in those 15 minutes. I admit, I spent that time in the kitchen. I really wouldn't recommend this movie to younger viewers, even though it's PG13. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for some entertainment, if you don't take it seriously, you'll get a kick out of this movie. There are many situations to make cracks! If you're looking for a good story line, look elsewhere;)
