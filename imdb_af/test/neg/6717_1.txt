I think this movie has deteriorated. First, they shoot lots of scenes and action and explosions, and then the story writers start working to find a story to tie all scenes together. This movie is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen, your average porn movie comes with much better written and much more coherent writing. The movie doesn't make sense. Although, even if you are a Segal fan, there is no reason you ever want to see this movie, unless you are one of the people who like to be accused, because it is a terrible accident and should never be released no. on this world. <br /> <br /> Boran.
