First of all, let me just say that I watched this movie as if I were a sale of goods. Remember you're not the movie's fault that IMDb has it as a comedy first and a horror second (although I don't know how it was entered ... maybe there is a moron of the movie's crew.) A fan of the horror / comedy genre, I checked it based on it and I am so sorry I did. Where to start? First, to get started on me, there is no comedy in this movie. It tries once or twice, but never gets more than a chuckle. My reaction rolled my eyes in the first place and wondered why someone thought so, it would be funny. There is no horror here either. Not a second of voltage can be found. You think I'm exaggerating ... I'm not. No tension, very little blood, and not much violence on the screen (sorry, but in a horrible movie cut away just as the good things start is a big mistake). Hell ... there's even zero nudity. Call me a purist or youthful ... I prefer some in a horrible movie if it can't come with an original plot / premise. And it tired like hell "reality TV show went wrong"? This has been done before and much better. Like Wrong Turn 2 or ... ummm .... whatever the movie was called Edward Furlong. That's how bad this movie is. I don't even remember the name of the movie, but it was better than that. I also enjoyed the one remark that timing as it was good because "reality TV takes over". Has anyone from the past posted it with a time machine? Are you crazy about me? This thing is trash ... and not in a fun way.
