Even with the low standards of a dedicated horror fan, I found this movie to be over. It was a great disappointment as it was considered one of eight Horrorfest movies. I can only hope the other seven is better. I was really embarrassed by the friends I could convince to see it, and these are the same friends I made to watch the remake of The Wicker Man. It has every cliché in the book. In fact, it went out of their way to include them. Let's start with the characters. Instead of one young girl in distress, we get three: the one, hot mom with two daughters ?? An exciting yet mindless teenager and a cute and at the same time creepy girl you just know will have "special" skills, including supernatural knowledge and the ability to communicate with the dead. The little girl is the same one who was in the remake of The Amityville Horror. She was a little annoying but not nearly as annoying as Dakota Fanning. <br /> Overall, these characters were like escapees from a LifeTime movie. I thought maybe horror movies were acting on stage where the female characters are going to sleep in full makeup and run around in the dark to reveal their presence to everyone with ears, but not this one. I also find it unthinkable that none of them can be bothered to ensure the front door of random opening day and night. To give you an idea of ​​how unreliable I was with these characters, I spent most of my time thinking about how cold it was to be, because everyone was in a coat, even in their homes and how white their teeth were. /> <br /> In spite of all the formal combinations, the film doesn't make any strain except to wonder if it's going to be over. There is more atmosphere at the local Giant in the middle of everyday weekdays. As far as dialogue is concerned, I could have quoted quotes from ten other films and put a better credible discourse. The gore level, the eyecatcher for a horror fan, was at best minimal. Without their little weapons, the zombies were not threatened at all. You can probably immediately kick some of them over the room. <br /> <br /> What really kills is its banality. Horror movies, more than any other genre, cannot survive uninspired mediocrity. Give me a horror movie that is comically unrelenting or outrageous over the top with gore. I can even take the newcomers with their so-called invading torture. Every time, I would appreciate a very scary one, anything but that.
