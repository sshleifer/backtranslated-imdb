Good sadness .. to think I saw it all. Danny Thomas looks SO out of place in this mishmash. He looked really uncomfortable. He can't be worth a leak, and when combined with Peggy Lee (PEGGY LEE ???), she's easy. He makes him easy! Perhaps the director saw it and he made the really bad comedy routines he sometimes does in the movie. Peggy Lee is okay, but the whole thing is a shambles. Good for a laugh, maybe.
