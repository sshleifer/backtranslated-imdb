Speckles of white and different shapes, beautiful nude, random images. This is what this little experimental short film is. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to think of how such images can be transferred to film in the early days of film, but despite my love for many surrealistic images and films, and a fascination with the bizarre, this movie just didn't do for me. <br /> <br /> I'm not sorry, I watched it, but if there is any underlying meaning in it, don't get it. Visually it is not outstanding, in my humble opinion. As an example of dadaism, I think it would fit pretty well, as it seems to reject any logic or reason, though I would have preferred to do it in a more visually interesting way. <br /> <br /> But for each one his own.
