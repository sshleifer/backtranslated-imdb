Obviously, with this movie going straight to DVD, I didn't expect much, but this movie is so unfunny it's incredible. The only part of the movie you might actually find funny is before they even come to the island, where Eddie's son is poured out of the bathroom through a jet of water and then it is! Why don't they bother at all? The first Christmas holiday with Chevy Chase was brilliant and hilarious. It's not. They rely on jokes about a dog with flatulence, and a character called Uncle Nick, who is about 80 and still tries to go with beautiful women. As they approach the island on the boat, the island looks fake in the background and Randy Quaid, though funny in the previous movie, just overworked and seems to be trying too hard to be funny. You have been warned!
