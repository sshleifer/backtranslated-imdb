I never really started watching the show until it was canceled and started running again. I actually enjoyed it for the first to third season. As soon as I saw the fourth and fifth, I began to realize. The first problem was that they did that irrelevant scenario of history that repeated itself (Jr. did a child like his parents). The second had to be the one where they all connected with someone (for example: Katie and Franklin). The third one was when they made Jr even more idiot than before, which began to be boring and demanding to the point where I wanted to go in the T.V and defeat the stupidity until he was unaware. The fourth had to be that diligent thief who claimed Clarie as a boyfriend. The fifth had to be Katie, she was too good for herself and treated her "boyfriend" Franklin like the pram he was. The last but not least was Noah Gray-Cabey !! Franklin, Franklin was just scary. It was like a terrible combination of Urkle and TJ Henderson, just more annoying! They jumped the shark seriously when he came to the show. There was little or no realism for his character and the way he laughed was a sign of obvious power that shows Noah cannot act. Eveytime I saw that the child just made me want to knock him stupid. But B.F. (for Frank) this show was funny and very entertaining.
