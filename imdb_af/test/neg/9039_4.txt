You would think that a movie that died three of the largest male movie stars of the Second World War era became classic. These three, which are also three of my favorites, run around in a haze and seem to be a place, but there. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that The Way West definitely had a little bit of a classic. In these days of political correctness, a film about American pioneers and the jobs of their westward migration is something not being done now. It should have been better done. <br /> <br /> Kirk Douglas is a former US senator stretching a carriage train in the west to build a settlement in Oregon's Willamette Valley. Because he is an ex-politician, he falls above the high plow he leads. The writing asks him not only to have a covered wagon, but a car to lead the train. <br /> <br /> You think it's ridiculous, you should see the whistling scene where Douglas ordered his black servant, played by Roy Glenn to whip him. I won't spoil it by saying that causes Douglas to require it from Glenn, but trust me, it's bad. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum is the route guide and of the three stars he makes the most bored. There was supposed to be friction on the set between Widmark and Douglas, but Mitchum just saw through the film above all. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the friction has helped something because the movie Douglas, a widow, calls to look at Mrs. Widmark, played by Lola Albright. Now she's the foremost thing in the movie. <br /> <br /> The film invoice says the launch of Sally Field. It was made between her Gidget and her Flying Nun days. She plays a piece of white southern trash with Mercy McBee's musical comedy name. We first saw her in the movie on the back of her parents wagon, legs akimbo and inviting. Of course she is accepted on her invitation. <br /> <br /> Her character is something that was found in every trailer in America, and again what a wagon train was, but one big trailer park on the move. <br /> <br /> Despite this film, Sally Field had an Oscar career. What that woman had to overcome. <br /> <br /> Victor McLaglen's son Andrew directed this item and along with a lousy script it has become a teasing mess. Shame on Andrew McLaglen, he certainly did better in his career. <br /> <br /> And so, unless you're a star creator.
