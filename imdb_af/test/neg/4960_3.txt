It's terrible rubbish. I like 'How do you want me', 'Father Ted', 'Green Wing' and Bill Bailey's actions, but I put it with 'Hippies' and 'Planets Of The Apes' under the 'Big Family Tree' went very wrong . My guess is that it is appealing to the same people who hold 'Withnail and I'. It is being exceeded, but to the end a luvvie-ish air is coming through and Bernard Black is just a lesser camp Metnail. And I thought it was even lenient even * before * Dylan Moran became the author. But the set-up suggests such a comic potential that I didn't even notice for the first two episodes that it wasn't worth the least bit of chortle. <br /> <br /> The things they say / do * need to be funny, but somehow they can't register as more than almost amusing or "I can see someone writing it may have thought it will be funny. " What I am trying to say is that the situations / remarks are gently humorous and yet too commonplace / soft / self-conscious to be worth creating and depicting in a sitcom. <br /> <br /> Life is too short. Avoid.
