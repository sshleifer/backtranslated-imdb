The first two Bring It On movies were both pretty good in their own ways. The first was pretty serious, the second was successful satirically - and the third chose the usual idiotic low-brown comedy we always see in the completely brainless teenage movies that Hollywood comes out of the woodwork. The whole point in this movie was that the cheerleaders are totally airheads who barely know enough to make a general conversation, and that is the scale of the movie's comedy. Ha ha. Not. <br /> <br /> There is no clever smartness in this movie, no theme, no subtext, nothing for anyone with half a brain to be entertained (and surely, I couldn't sit through it all not). If you are the kind of person being entertained by the jokes, this movie is for you. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
