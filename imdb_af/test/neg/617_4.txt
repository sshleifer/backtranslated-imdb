'Felony' is a B-movie. No doubt about it. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you have a look at the cast lineup, you may have some high expectations for its entertainment potential. This movie is filled with all the great character characters you've grown up, one with the faces you recognize right away, although you probably don't know their names. It's amazing that the filmmakers could get all these people together on one project, almost as they decided to do a B-movie actor reunion. The role-players include a few really first-class actors: David Warner, who will recognize most people from 'Titanic' (although my favorite of his roles is Jack de Ripper in 'Time After Time') and Lance Henriksen, who will remember many as a Bishop in 'Aliens'. These two actors have done excellent work in their long careers and have made many fine films. <br /> <br /> But as impressive as this collection of actors, their talent has never been fully screened. The authors of 'Felony' spent a lot of money collecting a dream team and then missed their golden opportunity because of one important factor, the common denominator of all B movies: a foolish script. <br /> <br /> We start with a stupid premise. The bad guys are caught on the band that commits an abominable murder and they relentlessly do the film crew to acquire the videotape and destroy the evidence. But honestly, why bother? In the time it takes to locate the film staff, a thousand copies of the tape can be made and distributed to each law enforcement agency and media sales. The criminals do not seem to realize how useless their efforts are, and they speak as if one original video tape solves and destroys the whole problem. Silly ... but I think if the bad guys were so logical, there would be no movie. <br /> <br /> Then there's the dialogue. It's sometimes silly, sometimes clich√©, and sometimes incredible ... everything you expected from a B-movie. Of course, I always believed that strong achievements can overcome very weak points in the material. These role players include actors who are definitely capable of delivering strong achievements. Although a number of role players are not good actors at all and have earned B role performance properly, one can still be hopeful that the stronger part of the cast would be able to fill in some life in their parts. However, it is disappointing to see that few of the actors in this movie really take the film seriously enough to give it the best shot. There is not much inspiration in these performances, but then it is again an uninspiring writing. Now I will admit that some of the more colorful actors in the film succeed in adding a certain amount of pizazz to delivering their lines, but frankly, even the very fine actors I mentioned earlier look mostly uninteresting and uninvolved with the story. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the story ... even though the play is of a high enough caliber that makes the dialogue look like, a little less cheesy, it still won't be "Felony" of the fact. do not let his writer commit the ultimate faux pas of low-budget action movie scripts: a plot with as many holes as a block of Swiss cheese. You can watch this movie a hundred times and you will still not find out how everything picks up. In an effort to create tension and always guess the viewer, the writer throws all sorts of surprises and unexpected twists in his writing and ends with a puzzle, but if you come to the end, you find a lot of pieces that fit anywhere and others who miss. I admire a good thriller that keeps me guessing, but creating plot strings that just exist to confuse you and not match the rest of the story is amateurish. There were so many who had never been declared to feel very frustrated in the end. If you decide to see it, be prepared to be confused. <br /> <br /> I didn't even mention any other stupid stuff about this movie, but I won't bother. The funny thing is that despite everything I said, I have to admit that I can't give 'Felony' 1/10 stars. Although I can't really put my finger on it, I actually found this movie to be a bit nice. The folly can sometimes be nice if you are in the mood. In addition, I really like some of these character features, and although their performances are somewhat impenetrable in light of their talents, I still got a kick to see them. <br /> <br /> Now I realize I have this rating. movie from the point of view of a serious filmmaker. It is quite possible. I completely missed the point. It may be that the filmmakers' intention has long been a B-movie. Perhaps the folly is completely deliberate. If so, and if I were to put it on the terms, I should say that 'Felony' is a classic in the genre of a tongue-in-action action movie. B-movie fans would love to see all their favorite actors in one movie, get some chuckles from the screenplay and be entertained by the healthy dose of guns, explosions and hunting.
