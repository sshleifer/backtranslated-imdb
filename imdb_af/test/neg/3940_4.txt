Stay Alive is a horror horror movie about a video game that kills people in the same way they die in the game. The friends who play this game soon find out and then realize that they have to defeat the Bloodgrave from the video game or accept their fate. We have video tapes in The Ring, a deadly site in FearDotCom. Now it's on video games. Stay Alive, do things well; The character development is quite a bit deeper than it would usually be in a horror movie. We really see many of the characters' feelings and pass them by and teach them all very well so that the audience can get their emotions. The movie is also very exciting. Timely, unpleasant moments are often played by the film, accompanied by restless, dirty music. There are many jumps and bumps for the viewer. It can be ideal once or twice, but this fake scares that Hollywood seems to enjoy survive in horror movies these days, wearing thin in Stay Alive. The camera will tend to give sharp corners or quick flashes to give viewers a quick look at a devil or witch, and try to scare them with this sudden on-screen outburst. Why? Of course, the gore is very poor due to the film's certificate. The writing to Stay Alive is very cheesy and fairly lazy and the characters tend to play it melodramatically and confusingly. Clich√©s also come from each side, for example, people wandering around looking for a strange sound or seeing a figure in the dark will investigate it. However, the computer graphics used for the video games are impressive and look colorful and sharp and work well with other parts of the movie. But overall there is just not enough to keep up with this movie. Stretching over just over a hundred minutes, it won't be a struggle to stay alive, but rather, stay awake.
