I don't know if this exceptionally dim movie was intended as an unofficial sequel to The French Connection, but it has many similar disadvantages: the writing is so confusing that the viewer remains irresponsible and feels left out of the picture, and the direction is so cold, so lacking in energy, that even the big sequel can't deliver things. (* 1/2)
