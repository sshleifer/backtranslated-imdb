As many know, this is the movie debut of Edward D. Wood Jr. as author / producer / director / actor. I've been a fan of Ed Wood for years. While I don't like it as much as some of his other films, it was probably the greatest insight that the public's film gets in the course of his Wood life. Everyone knows he was a transvestite. This film is about changing one's sex and how to be a transvestite can cause conflict in relationships with loved ones. This film is far from its time in dealing with this subject and how it deals with it. However, the film still contains Wood's usual pitfalls of bad dialogue, meaningless stock image and hokey special effects. Throw up Wood's regular Bela Lugosi overdose and you have Wood's first attempt at being a director. <br /> <br /> The plot is that a police inspector goes to a doctor after discovering the body of a transvestite suicide for advice on how to avoid further problems in this direction. The doctor tells him the story of Glen, who is also a transvestite. Glen wants to marry Barbara, but can't tell herself about her secret. He also tells Alan's inspector who is undergoing a sex change because he is really more suited to being a woman. Bela Lugosi plays a scientist who apparently commented on what's going on (Lugosi's part isn't really well defined and probably appears to be a vehicle for Wood to get a star in his movie and Lugosi for some to get cash). <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie shows the features of Wood's career. This was apparently shot at a very low budget and quite a few things were rather random. It definitely has the "it's so bad, it's good", it feels. However, I have to make Ed his progressive thinking when making this movie. Transvestitism and gender changes were not extremely open subjects in the early 50s. Wood is at great risk in creating a film that depicts transvestites as non-sexual abusers and a more human face on cross-decorations.
