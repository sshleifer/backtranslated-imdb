A feminist channel in which you believe the viewer: i) rarely invades wild animals by singing but instead attacking, killing and eating (the line that grizzlies never attack unless caused, is a hoot - unless "provoked" means that it sees flesh); ii) Homosexuality is immoral immoral - and its acceptance is almost always associated with history with signs of a society's dissolution and decay. iii) Few women are bisexual (in this one virtually every woman is presented as no preference for men or women) iv) Divorce is much worse than infidelity. v) Land is there for people to use, develop and enjoy. vi) it is like a mother of an adult boy who must stay in contact as it is on the boy. vii) a mother raising her son alone is an unfortunate and real tragedy for the child. viii) The idolatry of a parent for the valuable ideals is a good and healthy thing. ix) adults still have a responsibility for their sexual behavior regardless of their age and duty To get involved in these most intimate and deeds only within the most intimate and open sacrifice of relationships: marriage - believe me, you are NOT going don't like this movie! In essence, it's a Howard Stern kind of fellow put down by a Jane Fonda-type woman (think The Electric Horseman). These are ugly things because the values, the ideals, of the script are all so harmful. <br /> <br /> I share the other objections about the strange things in the writing: a) Why would this man lose every girl he has - because he refuses to reveal that his mother's death and burial don't was able to keep dates with them? It's a mystery why he just says "it was personal" when faced with angry and disappointed women. HUH? <br /> <br /> b) There is a huge contradiction (that is, the scriptwriter wants both ways) by telling that the chief's mother loves the father with everything she had - and later told that there was only one great love in her life - her lesbian girlfriend. <br /> <br /> c) The underlying legal assumptions are nonsense. We are never told that the executor has any right to reside on the property - merely determining the timing of the sole heir's title and the right to occupy the property. Somehow, the movie looks like the executor is the rightful resident - that's crazy. (Try to think of any executor of any will that uses the decedent's property before the will of the will is honored - it doesn't happen). <br /> <br /> d) The assumption in this film is that women are equally signed. for men and women - it's just absurd. So we are told: i) that Penelope Ann Miller's character dates other men at the end of the movie - after having been with the decedent for five years - and previously in a fulfilling relationship with the protagonist, ii) that the protagonist's housekeeper after being devoted to her friendly husband through her adult life - now another wife. iii) That one girl who is upset with the protagonist will now try a woman. <br /> <br /> iv) A male transsexual is eager to be the main character v) that Mary Kay Place's character obviously looked at other women in college ("and they looked back" she says with a idiotic triumphal flip of the head). <br /> <br /> It's all just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I agree with others about the sound of the DVD (I had to keep it at maximum volume and rewind repeatedly to understand names, phrases). <br /> <br /> This is a movie by someone who despises traditional heroism by any man, hates the idea that a man is needed to raise a child, rejects the idea that there is a relationship between marriage and sex is. The film is outside to preach - and that kind of propaganda of false messages is not good.
