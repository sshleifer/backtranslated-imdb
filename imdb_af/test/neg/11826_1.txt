A lot of the comments on this board revolve around debating the validity of some comparison with R DOG made on the DVD cover. Forget it all ... This movie - this - home movie is absolutely horrible. How can anyone with a lot of credibility do it as 10/10? There is no plot, no one. I couldn't believe I spent money on renting it (more later) and deceiving myself into believing that it has potential (based on boxing and some movie awards). The only thing I really remembered was amazing that one of the annoying main characters was probably head-on with a bullet ... and he ended up surviving the wound and making it to the final credits alive. Wow. And look, Killers has a successor. Double wow. <br /> <br /> Real story - I was in so much denial that I lost my money and life force on the rental that I kept the videotape for what had to be six months. I told myself that this never really happened. The video on top of the TV was an illusion - a mental symbol of my self-rejection. After somebody pointed out that it was indeed real and that I had to get hold of it, I decided I couldn't just leave it. I thought, "How many others did I refuse the suffering by watching this masterpiece by frightening Killers everything to myself?" I had to do the right thing and return it to hell from which it came. <br /> <br /> So, as I think most of the IMDb population would do in a similar situation, I created some great courage and drove to the video store at 02:00. After making sure no one was around, I got out of my car (still running), hit the film in the drip box and phoned hell out there to never return. <br /> <br /> I believed I was expecting a few Hollywood video corporate goons to look for me (the account had picked up to $ 1,238.67 at that time), so I moved away from that area. Yet, by chance, like the Killers storyline, nothing happened.
