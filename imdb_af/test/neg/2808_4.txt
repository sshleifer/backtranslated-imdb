I didn't expect too much from this movie, but I was still disappointed. It's supposed to be a comedy, but there are only four or five scenes where I actually laughed, and I think it's pretty poor. There is also no real plot, I always had the feeling that most screens could be anywhere in the movie, because there is no connection between them. But the worst was the "play" by Kim Franke. He has ONE facial expression throughout the movie, as if he had to play some delayed guys, but I don't think that's the case. All in all, I vote four out of ten, I've seen worse movies than this, but I won't be spending money on this one again.
