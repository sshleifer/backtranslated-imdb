... Or is it another way under the bottom of the masterpiece? Preferably both! Somewhere between 1969 and 1972, an army of several horrible horror movies were found, all of which were lost. Nothing more needs to be explained, asked or shouted out loud. If you followed my writings about CARNAVAL OR BLOOD or GURU THE MAD MONK carefully, you know what SCREAM BABY SCREAM is in the store. The title sounds cool; It's just the bad writing that had to be another place! Still, it is the most horrendously written piece of cinematic mastery that ever worked on film! <br /> <br /> If you thought it was an early slasher (which benefits the average IMDb user to write another comment), better luck next time! The real truth behind the screenplay has nothing to do with the movie, which apparently expressed a psychopath with a blue eye to "kill" and make some ugly visuals on its victims. It feels like you're watching another "SCOOBY-DOO" episode. My favorite scene is the monkey cage where the four young hippie teenagers play. And hear an actress named "Eugenie Wingate" to give us the worst style! 1969 has never been so bad, but it is! <br /> <br /> Try to find this 30-year old rarity at a five-dollar winch; It makes the perfect novelty point for returning to those psychedelic days of flower power, bad fashion and trashy music! Interesting note: SCREAM BABY SCREAM is also on Troma's film archives on the company's website. Only time will tell when it reaches the top of the Bottom 100 list along with some more early 70's cheapest; Gosh knows they must !!! PLAN 9 is history !!!
