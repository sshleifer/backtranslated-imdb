When the opening shot seriously ignored the US marines the US flag, a movie has a difficult road ahead, but unfortunately it was downhill from there. A military adviser has been credited, which is apparently a retired US Navy. This makes it even more surprising that this incredible breach of contract and law was unnoticed. Even more confusion is the way they are buried just about how a Marine KIA is reported, in very short order, without the slightest explanation of how they identified the body, or even a body. The US government still finds the missing from World War II, and it takes months to identify the remains. Military shots remain MIA for months or years and are only explained to KIA when the remnants are positively identified, or after years of red tape. Here we are expected to believe that this happens within a matter of days or weeks. Perhaps it happens in Denmark, but not in the US. Obviously, none of the people involved ever had the least involvement or respect for the American army. In addition, there are a number of other completely ridiculous moments when characters come from nowhere with singers. There should have been some very extensive meetings between author and actors if they struggle to find their motivation for such hogwash. Having a script that worked could have helped, but it looked like it was in place, with the work of Cliffs Notes. There is no way to know if the writing was originally this terrible, or if it was the author, or the middle management kids in the studio who were responsible. Anyway, it's a terrible movie that never had to be made.
