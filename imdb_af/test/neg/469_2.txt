How to take Charles Darwin's fantastic intellectual journey and change it into a chick flag. His core and sensory ideas and their radical influence on Western thinking and capitalist society are untouched, except for two short scenes one of which he claims is the death of God. pure demagogy to make the film emotional. And the rest of the movie bends like this: it consists entirely of melodramatic and long family scenes with war music, one of which seems to be crying. Anyone who actually read "Origin of Species" would clearly be aware that there was no break with God in any of Darwin's work; On the contrary, there was increasing awe and respect, and a revolutionary new way of looking at things. A good movie about Darwin can be educational, thoughtful and deeply inspiring, even in religious sense - but this would contradict the soap opera intentions of this movie. It's a movie designed to make people cry and constantly transform them into sympathy, though they can't understand why; It quickly makes use of Darwin's great name as a marketing bout, as one would drop a well-known name at a party to create an impression. Sad that the sets and costumes are so good: production values, apart from writing, were of course high. See it if you want to weep, for the loss of intelligence in American literature.
