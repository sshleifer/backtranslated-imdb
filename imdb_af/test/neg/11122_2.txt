Well, the Sci-Fi channel keeps these turkeys out ... and they look worse every time. When normally good actors such as John Rhys-Davies and Giancarlo Espositto come down as rankers, imagine how uncomfortable the REST of the role is in this waste of your time. The only half decent thing is the creature's rubber outfit (which is being rushed into such quick flashes that you don't really have time to see how bad it is). The dialogue ... the plot ... if this "movie" (and I use the term loose) was food, Jack-In-The-Box would be a gourmet meal compared to it. Watch a re-run of "The Munsters" for the 372th watch-your time will be better spent (and much more scarce)!
