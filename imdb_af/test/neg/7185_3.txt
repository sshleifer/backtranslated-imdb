I will not give too much of the film to tell you that there are many, many, many, many scenes of Lucas (the young protagonist) walking and watching things! Yep. And you'll be glad to know that the first third of the movie is useless, meaningless and virtually ignored for the rest of the movie! <br /> <br /> This movie is filled with dull people doing boring things, and the most beautiful person of them all is young Lucas, going blind and in need of surgery. You see, he has atrocities, terrible delusions! He thinks a murderer is preaching on blind women! He walks a lot around and acts like an insatiable jerk! <br /> <br /> Patience does NOT pay for this movie. Eventually, the plot and events are just as confusing and fun, and it is very difficult to somehow take care of what any nightmare images mean. Nothing is made clear, the movie moves at a snail's pace, and it left me with the same effect of a hangover. <br /> <br /> From the "Dread of the Dark" the British do not come stupid thrillers as the Americans do; they make boring.
