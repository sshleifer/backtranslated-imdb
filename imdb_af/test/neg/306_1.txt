"Fat Girls" is one of the worst movies in the Indie gay genre. <br /> <br /> The premise is promising: An average gay teenager is trapped in an oppressive, small, TX town. His only enthusiastic spirit is the other town that GS has failed: the class "fat girl", a naive immigrant from Cuba and the sensitive drama teacher. So far interesting. In theory, this plot line creates a decent set-up for an attractive lifetime story with a built-in audience --- the thousands of gay men who grew up in small towns across America and experience these adolescent anxiety first hand, peppered with a dose of self-mutilating humor. Unfortunately, rather than a nuanced drama, Ash Christian emphasizes his autobiographical subject with a poor performance of irony and dark humor. The result is a cast of non-adaptable, two-dimensional, derivative characters that the viewer cannot but help to feel indifferent. Sabrina (Fink) is a brush-Goth bitter nail gazer. She is such a spicy, unsympathetic person; There is little doubt about the reason for her friendly condition. The chemistry between her and Rodney (Christian) registers zero. It may have been a bad decision but is more likely due to a script that is simply inexplicable. As a result, one is wondering when such a non-existent bond exists, which might justify their almost constant companionship throughout the story. <br /> <br /> Sabrina's new-found boyfriend, Rudy (de Jesus), and Rodney's mother Judy (Theaker) are among the most exaggerated of the clichéd stock characters that have ripped off dozens of other films. Rudy is the horny emigrant immigrant / nerd who is raised directly from every racial adolescent "comedy" ever made in television or film. Judy is born again, obsessed with Jesus talk and great hair. Just when you thought the Tammy Faye thing was killed, Christian added a scene where Judy's mascara ran with her tears! Is there anyone in the civilized world who might think that this tired old stereotype gag is still funny after seeing the 20-year-old ad nauseum? <br /> <br /> In addition to the failed attempt at sardonic humor, there are many riddles of story contradictions. Rodney sees himself as a "thick ugly" loser. However, at the same time he manages to coincidentally and regularly impromptu trysts with the ubiquitous school jock / hunk, Ted (Miller). Although this link is exposed with emotional fulfillment, most gay teenagers (filled with raging testosterone, just like their heterosexuals) will find it a little enviable arrangement, as the more common alternative is involuntary celibacy. <br /> <br /> Rodney finds an object for his love in Bobby (Bruening), an exotic transplant from England. At all credible occasions, the boy does not only happen in this small TX town, but is conveniently openly gay to start. Like Sabrina, Bobby is an icy, viciously smart aleck and the viewer scratches his head due to his magnetic appeal. <br /> <br /> To his delight, Rodney is invited by his new loved one to the town gay bar, where Bobby claims he is the DJ. On arrival, the boyfriend quickly leaves Rodney solo and heads off to another area of ​​the bar for a quick encounter with a pretty attractive young man. It is still one of the ridiculously inexplicable plural elements, as Rodney's feeling as an outcast is thought to have originated mainly from his lonely existence in a parish community. As small as the town, do they openly have gay students at high school? A secret bisexual soccer captain? Lesbian Moms? A Gay Teacher? and it has a gay bar center (protected by attractive men, no less)? Apparently the place is not that back. <br /> <br /> Ten years ago, Todd Stephens's Edge of Seventeen covered almost the same material with a much more creative, honest, touch and humorous film.
