Everything about this show is terrible. The prospect even sets him up for a cheap laugh with bad writing. A "dysfunctional family" theme has been used too often, especially by the Simpsons, which is an excellent performance with good writing and lots of laughter. Meanwhile, Family Guy has about five minutes of story in each episode, featuring many well-known jokes and random flashbacks. Now, if it was original or funny, I would think it was smart. But no, it's not funny at all. In fact, the only reason why the episodes are so is because it's the easiest way to eliminate episode after episode of this junk. Much of this performance is original, and what is original is just lame. It is also incredibly rough and unrelenting, which can be good if it is still intelligent. Animation is not all, but from an artistic point of view, this show also fails, proving again that the Family Guy is trying as much inexpensive jokes and easy shortcuts as possible. People enjoy this show, and I don't really care, because people can enjoy anything they want, no matter how much they have the least common denominator. But no, I do not recommend it, especially to anyone who wants to become a film or writer one day. It is cheap entertainment that is goal low and has achieved success. The fact that it's so successful says bad things about America.
