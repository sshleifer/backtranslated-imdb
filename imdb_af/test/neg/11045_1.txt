Please do not forget Korea for this bad movie. I'm in Korea (excuse bad English). It made me sad to see these movies that Korea looks like obsessed with blood and sex. It made me even more sad to see animal murders and Americans say this is how Korea is. We do not eat live animals !! So please stop the apology of the film for his crime by saying it's the culture! There are scenes with the man who eats live animals and non-Koreans think it's normal. No, it is also disgusting to us. The director is an uncomfortable, sick individual with obsession with murder and sex with family members. I wish America and France would stop glorifying this bad man who is ridiculous in his own country. Have a look at any other movie from Korea that gives you ideas of how artistic we really are. This movie is junk.
