The only reason to watch this movie is Sung Hi Lee, the beautiful model / actress from Korea who plays "Muka Laka Miki" in this otherwise crappy movie. <br /> <br /> She gets a pretty important role in this movie and looks good to handle it well, though none of the parts is really interesting or well written. Even for a National Lampoon movie, it's really stupid. Stupid humor is one thing, but just stupid is another. I might have laughed once, and that was probably just what I was polite. <br /> <br /> Warning: Watching this movie can be bad for your health in two ways: 1) It is totally bothering. 2) Sung Hi Lee is so freaking beautiful, she can only blow your brain on the head of your head on the first face. <br /> <br /> Don't say I didn't warn you ...
