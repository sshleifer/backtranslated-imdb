This overheated south-Gothic "miller drummer" has a few decent moments - but is too often surprised by a novice director of cliché cliché, and a star who apparently decided to place it on his personal showcase, rather than writer / director Gabel Inge of Williams can update as a kind of contemporary "Midnight Cowboy" at "Lolita" tearjerker. <br /> <br /> Close your eyes, listen to the exaggerated southern accent, and try to decide whether you are a feature film, or an acting class, full of desire amateurs. <br /> <br /> Johansson is tolerant once (ie less pouty than usual) - although not good at all, Macht is decent, though a little too nice boy to believe, and Travolta chews the landscape as Still never before (with the help of a decent editor and direct self-control, his performance could really have touched; as he is, he - and almost everyone else - is too unlikely to ever overtake us beyond the boredom or aversion) ). Kara Unger is perhaps the best of all; If her role was developed beyond a few lines, she might even have received a nomination of best supporting actress. <br /> <br /> Peak is almost saved by Leonard Cohen style, growling theme song, decent production design and locations, and continuous reference to literary works (which earned the otherwise standard script reviews as "poetic".) useful are some old forwards in the role like Sonny Shroyer, and perhaps most importantly, Soderbergh cameraman Elliot Davis - whose fine work will undoubtedly be credited for the first time, which can be learned ten or twenty years from now on to target. <br /> <br /> But probably not.
