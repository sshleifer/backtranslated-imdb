This movie has an incredible role. MGM took some of his best character actors and played them in a movie with the usually lovely Margaret O'Brien. Lionel Barrymore, Edward Arnold and Lewis Stone star as three greedy old bachelors living in the same home. While gaining a fortune over the years, they were selfish jerks. One of them has an idea of ​​donating property to buy themselves a good name (such as Carnegie), but it is evident from the property they want to give away, which actually belongs to O'Brien. And since she is an orphan, they give volunteers to be her guardians so they can give away her property and look like great philanthropists. <br /> <br /> There is also a goofy sub-plot that includes fairies - led by the wonderful character actor Henry Davenport. And since O'Brien is Irish (as evidenced by her outrageous accent), she and the little ones make a lot of the plot. Frankly, I absolutely hated this part of the movie and wanted them to just drop it. Instead, the story could still have been about sweet Margaret melting the old men's hearts - it would have worked. But ... the "little people"?!? Wow! Overall, the actors are trying very, very hard, but the folly of the plot and the deadly seriousness they have tried curled me. I noticed that many people liked this movie - I think I'm just an old grouch! I found the movie terribly difficult to watch.
