Back in 1994, the Power Rangers became a big franchise and t. drivers at the US Network hoped to catch up with the action and the Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters from Beverly Hills, where the evil Emporer Gorganus, who looks like he is wearing a home-made Darth Vader costume and his talking bird, seems like a rubber dog toy visit, come to earth to use it by using giant monsters that look like rejections of a godzilla movie of 1970. Fortunately, Nimbar, a stranger who looks like a giant piece of bright jello, celebrates teenagers on earth to defend. Nimbar gives them each a tattoo of another constellation that allows them to turn into accumulated superheros that resemble dancers out of eighties technology no music video, they can also be combined into a giant knight. Forty episodes were made. The US Network clearly did not have the money to try to adjust a show from Japan as Power Rangers did, and made this show on its own using the budget of a 1950's scifi movie. The battles are generic, the special effects are poor, and some of the sets look like they can fall. The actors almost realized how ridiculous the show was and pretty much ham up and overact. I can only suggest their shock when the show is canceled.
