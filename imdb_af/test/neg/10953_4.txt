At the Movie Gallery I saw a movie I just had to see. It looked like a fun low-budget horror / action / western that I could get. Yes, I knew it would suck, but I rented it anyway and hoped to laugh. There were just a few laughs. It was a very silly movie. It starts with a bounty hunter, our protagonist, who may be the worst main character in the history of the film. He looks like he can accept Chuck Norris, but he can't. His dialogue also sucks. Anyway, he goes into a village, shoots some zombies. You can tell they were trying to make it longer by taking in these boring scenes where they take 3-5 minutes to reload or watch some zombies. At least the zombies look cool. In any case, some people are shot, some zombies die and eventually everyone is killed except our main character, who should have been dead in the beginning when he was shot dead by four.
