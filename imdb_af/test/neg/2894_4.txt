It is a very dull movie with poorly-developed characters, subplots that are nowhere to go and hardly tolerable. It comes across as a poor perception of 2001. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth making is the sets and costumes and visual effects. But even that wasn't enough to keep me from doing that. I would like to get the soundtrack, especially the music during the spaceflake series, for nights when I struggle to fall asleep.
