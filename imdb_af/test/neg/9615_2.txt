Oh, dear - how Alfred Hitchcock (North North West, Spellbound, the 39 Steps) can point out this nasty, inexpensive jacket shocker is beyond me. Do not save to seek hidden depths or deep meanings - there is none. It's just awful, tough and cheap. The one redeeming feature is the home life of the inspector leading the investigation - his wife strives as a gourmet cook and continually serves her riotous culinary experiments to her poor husband. It's amusing and just saved me from putting the movie in the "terrible" bracket, but the movie as a whole is one of the most unpleasant things I've ever seen. I believe it was Hitchcock's next-last movie. Maybe someone was trying to tell him something.
