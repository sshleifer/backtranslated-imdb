An interesting slasher film with several suspects. <br /> <br /> Includes typical girl flashing her breasts (Denise Cheshire) as she changes into her swimsuit, sly suspect - any one of them can do the job of a pass rate (Linnea Quigley), a very unusual fit forward, more naked breasts, a track and field event that will NOT be Olympic Games in summer, and a mysterious secret. <br /> <br /> It's all at a conflicting end. No, there's more. Will this man not die? I bet Anne (Patch Mackenzie) will no longer plan home visits. <br /> <br /> If you like teenage cat movies, you may be a pervert, even though all the actresses are over 18 years old?
