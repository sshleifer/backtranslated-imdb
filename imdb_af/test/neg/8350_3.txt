Although this film (and I use the terms loop) was made in 1997, we only watched it for the first time tonight. My husband said a Tommy Lee Jones movie we never heard made him a little anxious. Anyway, I looked blithely, sure if Jones was in the movie, it should be worth at least two hours of my time. He has been one of our players for many years. Although Heche is not one of my favorite actresses, I am also reassured by seeing another well-known face. The list of perfect actors / actresses continued to grow, so I endured more and more of this film, sure that I would win victory on the other side of the plot because of enough clich√©s and solid social statements. Oh, there was no plot. It seems to be burned by the eternal-oozing lava of punishment. <br /> <br /> The characters were paper thin. The plot was so beat full of holes that it literally distracted me from most special effects and performed in the movie. Was the fee for a short consultation with an elementary science teacher too much for this film's budget? No acid rain ... no toxic gases (such as sulfur or hydrochloride) ... no lethal ash ... no heat-consuming heat just a few feet from the lava. Wow ... this is the world's friendliest lava ever! <br /> <br /> The events were no better than the characters. Each incident was so confronted and far-fetched. It's like the authors said, "We must get rid of the little girl now ..." And poof, she's splashed by a lava bomb that burns her enough, which she has to transport safely (not from the lava, but from her own helplessness ... but only moments later in the car she is without any pain and soon runs through the (groan!) building that is (oh no!) about to be inflated. After all this, your reward is the line of the little boy at the end (about all the people who look the same) ... which is one of the worst movie lines I've ever heard. Though not so painfully written, it was ridiculous timing for all the characters involved. Bokkie and police officer aside, as if the mother is still in the area and just needs to be noticed because she just doesn't speak ... what ... she hopes to go down in the shade and get away from the little once and for all always? I do not think so. The child's mother will of course be missing or dead - or shout her head to find her toddler. <br /> <br /> The token black gangsta sturdy hoodlum with a secret soft spot versus the slide on its shoulder, a narrow copy of a secret soft spot scene made my eyes bleed. Even if such pat characters existed, they would not behave as the film depicted them, given the circumstances. Something about the threatening fiery death and the massive destruction tends to catch people from outside, you know? <br /> <br /> There are too many canned movie moments like calling it ... really, it's just an embarrassment to watch. The poor writers ... where are they now?
