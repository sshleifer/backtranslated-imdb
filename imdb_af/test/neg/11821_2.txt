Imagine an exploitative remake of The Defiant Ones with a black chick and a white chick linked together. Set the story on a Caribbean island where the drug dealers rule and the revolution has come. And the black woman is from Huggy Bear's stable of ladies and the white woman is a watery Patty Hearst and you have Black Mama, White Mama. <br /> <br /> In those deviant days of the driving theater this item should have been a great old hit. All the buttons of the Seventies are printed in this one. Although they both fill their clothes better and get some whistles from the men in the audience, no one will ever miss Pam Grier and Margaret Markov for Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis. Good, Halle Berry and Jamie Lee Curtis. <br /> <br /> Margaret and Pam are prisoners where the guards and the keeper watch the new fish arriving furiously. Margaret is a wealthy state-of-the-art girl, while Pam is your basic high-price call girl serving the local drug kingpin and getting tired of trying to leave the island. <br /> <br /> Margaret's fellow revolutionaries fight the bus that they transport from the women's prison to the village, but they are lost in the escape. Both have their different agendas, but like Sid and Tony, they can't quite agree on who's agenda is for the first time. Make some interesting moments, like the police, the drug dealers and the revolutionaries, all looking for these two unloved chain partners. <br /> <br /> Similarly, you won't get the wrong ideas, the head of the revolutionary and Markov's canoodling partner is called Ernesto by Philippine actor Zaldy Zshornack. The whole mess was shot in the Philippines that started their own film industry. <br /> <br /> Beautiful spot photography in the Philippines is all that Black Mama, White Mam should recommend. But if you're a fan of very bad black exploitation styles, it's one for you.
