It was a rare case of a police telescope made with British funding; Unfortunately, the result is indifferent (except by its unpleasantness and border-camp approach) despite stars and director. The former is led by a wooden Franco Nero and an ultra-humble Telly Savalas as a few robbers (if anyone is able to believe an actor - faithful to me!). <br /> <br /> Are their 'work' wrong (ending in murder and sitting with seeds instead of jewels!)? The mismatching criminals, however, see an opening to their dilemma when they accidentally "kidnap" a British diplomat's son (a miscarriage of Lester, who even kicks-lucky Savalas where it hurts at one point). Yet they never deprive him and their only purpose is to cross the border into France; Nero's girlfriend (a wasted Ely Galleani) was tagged with them: soon enough she had enough and decided to run away while the other was sleeping; the mad Savalas watches this and, following the girl, kills her. Meanwhile, Nero and Lester woke up ?? the former thinks his accomplices may have crossed him twice, so he goes with the boy in the trailer on the lamb; After a short spelling at a rich old lady's estate (which Nero and Lester contain completely free of charge), Savalas comes up. They continue with their move, where the trio run into a family of German campers: degenerate the situation to the point where Savalas locked them in their trailer and cast the lot into the river? although he himself was severely hurt in the process; typically it ends with the heavies killed just as they reach the border. <br /> <br /> So does the movie contain most of the genre's typical elements? insomnia, sadism, violence, pursuits (the aftermath of the initial robbery when the breakaway car in the city's narrow backstones causes destruction and even a funeral process is disrupted, it is quite dangerous), etc .; One lightly interesting aspect of this is that Lester himself is definitely (irrevocably?) Characterized by the experience ?? Get excited when an act of violence is committed.
