I became more and more angry with this movie. <br /> <br /> Basically, Dr Crawford (Dennis Hopper) predicted that a meteor would hit the earth. The "powers that are" do not believe him, so he is about building a survival box in a mountain for a small collection of people. <br /> <br /> Jake Lowe (Peter Onorati) is a discount on his luck reporter for a trashy tabloid who gets a tip from a friend, he thought it was dead there was something going on in the mountains . He goes out to investigate. <br /> <br /> While trying to get into the secret survival food, Jake spends a lot of time killing people or defeating them within an inch of their lives. He spent the rest of his time at Dr Crawford, who gave the doc the right to decide which people should survive the meteor. <br /> <br /> I found that Jake would make the future a great favor and turn a gun on himself. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this turkey.
