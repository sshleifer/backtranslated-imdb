I like action movies. I have a soft spot for "B" flicks with bad dialogue and woodwork. So, I dragged my brain to make one of my guilty pleasures worse than this hobby. I can not. You will be hard pressed to assemble a larger piece of cr * p than this Bruce Willis vehicle. <br /> <br /> Armageddon is the story (and I use the term loosely) of a team of Super-Drillers "flying off to destroy an asteroid before it destroys the Earth. Realistically? Not really. But who cares? It's an action movie. I'm not shooting the point. <br /> <br /> Minor spoilers: <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a few scenes designed to Threat and Characters Introduce Bruce Willis is the team's tough-as-nail leader and spends his first little time getting Ben Affleck with a gun for the unforgettable act of sleeping with his daughter for some reason it didn't make me laugh, it was forced, like everything in this movie. <br /> <br /> The team is called in because they are the only people in the world who can drill the asteroid. to accept that premise if it gets us to the action - the supposed flesh of the movie, more attempts at humor, with every character going out for a little crazy, tired to do something before it explodes. Again, lamb. Finally, they take off. Here's where the movie really left me. They come to the rock and go to work. If you believe it, nothing works right and everything has an exciting countdown !!! Bah! Ten, nine, eight ... one - Oh, surprise surprise, we saved the day again! <br /> <br /> And don't even get me on the rough camera work. When I saw it in the theater, I thought I'd be sick. I can only assume that they cover the gigantic holes left by the incessant performances by throwing them away to another shot every few seconds (and that of someone who was raised on MTV. I have short attention to himself). <br /> <br /> Just when I thought it couldn't be worse ... wait - there's a fabricated tearjerker finish that's so tied up, the rest of the movie made a virtual Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Summary: The witticisms were not greasy. The plot - well, I said I wanted to release the one. The acting was bad. Really bad. Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the writing, which was worse. Camera case - again, bad. (I didn't even mention the stupid love story in the history of motion pictures - think animal cakes). <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10. (I give half a point to Steve Buscemi, who makes me smile at my will and another half point for the times I could see the lovely Liv Tyler and trying to ignore her acting, it's by far the worst movie I've ever seen in the theater ... ever.
