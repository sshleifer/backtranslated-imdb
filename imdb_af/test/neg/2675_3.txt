If Halloween 5 was a cruel joke to fans of the series, then Halloween 6 is like an evil insult. The storyline all went with the dogs. Michael is used as a helpless pawn in this movie and he is not scary at all. He reminds me of an overweight alcoholic man like the bowman who hit fear in our hearts back in the original. There are almost no redeeming features about this feature and I am so glad H20 came out because it would be an insult to fans to care for our minds. <br /> <br /> Halloween 6 had about 2 aspects I liked. Having an adult Tommy Doyle in the movie was a good touch and it links it to the original. Donald Pleasance is here (in his last show ... which is a bad movie to end another good career). When on the screen, he remembers the good old days when Halloween was actually scary. <br /> <br /> It's about my friends. The stem sequences are original. One of them is a blatant rip-off of the Laurie / Michael chasing the original. The other characters are terribly underwritten and just not nice. The music, from Halloween's highlights, even when the movie is bad, is tortured in this movie. we get a stupid rock version of the stalk / chase theme. What were they thinking when they made this movie. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> Their biggest mistake was to kill the character of Jamie (Now played by another actress who is not worth mentioning) We have watched this character escape dead in two movies. We are rooted for her and when she is murdered in this movie, you cannot help but feel sorry for her and realize that the filmmakers do not mind when good characters are established in a movie. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILER * <br /> <br /> The less say about this embarrassment the better. I wish it didn't exist. I suggest moving this movie, and even 5, and going straight to H20. Because if you look at it, you might not want to see a Halloween movie again.
