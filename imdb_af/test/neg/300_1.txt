Jefferey Dahmer was a sick man. There is not much to say about him who has not yet been told, except that many documentaries and films are made about him, probably better than that. It's cheesy. It's so cheesy, a man who posted the entire movie on YouTube made some annotations to make the viewer laugh. <br /> <br /> Carl Crew (Who is he?) Stars as serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, whose killer started in 1978 with a young guy just wanted to be Dahmer's friends, and eventually in 1991 he wanted a man having sex and eating. <br /> <br /> I didn't bother seeing the whole movie. it is basically a documentary that shows all the attacks Dahmer pulled out before he was caught. And since this film was made in 1993, a fellow citizen was killed a year before Dahmer. The death of dahmer is not shown. but it was probably as cheesy as this cheese party. <br /> <br /> 1/10
