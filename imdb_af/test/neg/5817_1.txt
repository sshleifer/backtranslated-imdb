I'm a great lover of really bad B-movies. And I especially love alien / scifi movies. I say the cheaper, cheesier and camper the better. A low budget and a hokey idea is fun enough for most bad B-movies, but this movie is so bad I really feel embarrassed by the people who made the movie and the shocking ad-lib actors. First, there is no real plot, it is all kind of "comedy" (if it can be called). The "comedy" in this movie is more about characters who essentially say, "Look at me, I'm in this crazy situation! Isn't it funny?" But it's just pathetic because nothing that someone does, it's funny . There is no comedic acting skill, nor a cooking plot to carry all the many imaginative scenarios through this arid maze. <br /> <br /> The bad comedy and the lack of anything from a distance comic are only exacerbated by the bad ad lib performances, actors really say stupid things over and over (maybe trying monkey for catches, maybe just b / c everyone in this is so bad), really unattractive women are playing as hot chicks, and people are bursting and going out in bathrooms. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie I could tell, a middle-aged actor had some games and was so convincing in his role. He was so out of place as a solid BM in a weekend detox unit's bathroom. Corey Feldman was filmed for a total of about 3 minutes (luckily we didn't have to stick together anymore) and he was filmed from the site - probably out of his apartment on the way. He has some very funny things about strangers and sex with strangers and that was the extent of his appearance. <br /> <br /> If you appreciate your life and the 90 minutes (and remember years of pain) you will lose by watching this garbage, avoid it. If you do a lot of drugs, like Adam Sandler's comedy styles (and therefore no standards whatsoever), and considered spiritually slow, you might like this movie. <br /> <br /> P.S. I think the people who have been chasing this must work for Troma, or something. I can't believe people can be as lame as really enjoying this movie. (Do not destroy drugs your judgment so much?)
