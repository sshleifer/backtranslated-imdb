Fans of horror comedy will like this one. Others can get irritated and turn off quickly. It's kind of a girl movie, with overarching violence and gore, deliberate stereotypical characters, and much madness. <br /> <br /> It looks like it's been on a budget of about $ 100, through a bunch of fraternity to a big beer party. There is a head start that is a frustrated nerd, and its noisy friend, mocking him 30 times a second. There is a cool monster truck that drives them for hundreds of miles, which is the highlight of the movie. When this thing and its gnarly mask wear driver appear, it's a good scene. There is a mysterious girl who randomly appears in their back seat, and many giant men in overalls hanging in red neck bars. The nerd's friend never closes his jap and gets them in one mess to another. Their arguments came to my nerves, but other aspects of the film made it. <br /> <br /> Sight gags poker fun at various "psychic torments and trying to make someone" movies are everywhere. Choose which one is the most riffed: Hills, Eyes, Saw, and Jeepers Creepers were some I recognized. <br /> <br /> If you're in the right mood, it's nice madness. Sensory-dulling brewskies with your friends can make it more fun; It's a good bet, it's the condition of the filmmakers when they bring this thing.
