Author and director Jay Andrews, also known as Jim Wynorski, serves more of his distinctive safe with a decent throw threatened by grade-Z computer-generated reptiles in "Komodo Vs. Cobra", such as a Mysterious Island rip-off. , meet "Jurassic Park" as you can imagine. The main problem with this predictable yarn over human-eating samples is the incredibly fake special effects. The cobra and the Komodo are hilariously awful. The graphic people, however, do a good job of integrating the monsters with their victims, not that any of these are at least credible. It is clear that "Komodo vs Cobra" had a budget so low that almost everything that is not human in its appearance is as false as everyone comes out. This oyster-like monster epic takes place on a remote island where the American army exports top secret DNA testing on animals. As a result, giant Komodos and cobra thrive in this tropical island paradise. As the action opens, the primary scientist is gobbled by a cobra who likes to swim. Then we are introduced to a group of 'Greenpeace' such as environmental protesters and a journalist. Planet Earth organizer Jerry Ryan ("Hellbent's" Ryan McTavish) pays captain Jim Stoddard (Michael Pare of the Houston Knights) of CBS TV five big with the promise of another five if he takes them to this banned island. Meanwhile, the US military suspects that something is wrong on the island, sending their own team of men eaten by the supersized predators. Our heroes are in the last remaining scientist on the island, dr. Susan Richardson (Michelle Borth of Wonderland), the daughter of the scientist responsible for this insane science project, telling them that the army is going to target the island for destruction. The title match between the two overgrown predators occurs in the last quarter of an hour to our heroes, which were consistently collected by the monsters, get a helicopter and get off early before the army multiplies the island. There is no voltage, voltage or anything worth in this substandard feature. The best thing about this yawner is the orchestral soundtrack of composer Chuck Cirino; it gives "Komodo Vs. Cobra" an epic feel. Usually, Jay Andrews writes and directs tolerant folly, but it is far below its low standards. The sexy women will survive better than the guys. In one scene our heroic group has a river and we don't see wet t-shirts. Drat! There is nothing in the way of unforgettable dialogue or relationships in this liquor. I think the military guys are saluting far too much when they gather their heads to conspire together. Let's hope that Michael Pare got a good payday from this garbage. The end when one of the scientists takes the characteristics of a lizard comes strictly as an afterthought. It's not that bad, it's good, it's just bad.
