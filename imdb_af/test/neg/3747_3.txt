Sorry, but I usually love French thrillers - eg. Chabrol - but it was a shiny shambolic mess. The fact that it is based on a Harlan Cohen book, because rather than being a French film (strong on psychology and character), it is more like a John Grisham esquire roller coaster ride through numbers with ridiculous plot twists, flashbacks that update previous flashbacks, a predictable villain (as soon as his name is mentioned, you think 'hmm, he'll be the bad guy!') and sets of mysterious stereotype characters that apparently occupy different movies. By the end, I laughed hysterically about the inequality of the scene of the movie (the scene where the main character is helped by two street fish shadow characters are inadvertently hilarious), the completely staggering plot, the absurd coincidences and lucky moves (such as guessing the password for an email account) and uncontrollably cool (thought I had read the 1 hour 50min running time incorrectly as if it was 3 hours 50 minutes long).
