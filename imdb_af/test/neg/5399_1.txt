Was it supposed to be a comedy? The black cap and skeleton mask are hilarious. There is like zero plot. The movie starts with an archaeologist and his assistant. They curse a small mention of their digging site. And then, look and see ... ... in the drops of Halloween Costume, dressed in the shiny black cape, with a skeletal mask face, with an ax. So, he killed these two people. Then we cut to the forest with a bad imitation of Predator, only the commandos are being hunted by Halloween Costume Man riding a horse now! More commands appear, but these people are supposed to be disguised as a step group. Yes, production probably ran out of commando costumes. Can you say, low budget? Anyway, they come to a lonely, old Indian man sitting in the woods. He's just too funny. And he starts talking about something, but you really don't know what he was mumbling about, so they flash back to some Indians who are killed. None of this really makes sense. And then we go back to our commandos where more of them are killed. And it's basically the plot. It's so nice, you can't really look away because you just want to see how low it is. You can make the same movie with a camcorder, a Halloween costume and a lot of your friends with fake guns. Don't see this thing if you want a horror movie. If you want a comedy, maybe? Or just skip it and get something like the real Predator.
