"Hero and Terror" is a rather dull thriller - a la: no real character substance, predictable plot, and ... Drilling. For a thrill, I found this movie slowly until its sad climax, because it just seems to be dragging until Chuck's wife's baby is born ... and then pulling it from there until it reaches the end - which I can almost remember I saw the movie just 10 minutes ago. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3 out of 10 - for the first 10-20 minutes.
