I think I watched a highly modified version because it wasn't nearly as graphical as I expected - based on the other reviews I've heard. <br /> <br /> Unlike 1. is written by the same person who wrote The Original Emmanuelle (1974), Emmanuelle Arsan, 2. The main character is a sexual free spirit, and 3. In the exotic region of Asia "Laure" is not the same flair as its predecessor. <br /> <br /> I just talked this movie with philosophical topics that I really aren't interested in, ie the voyeuristic, open relationship between Laure and Nick, "I'm just happy with whatever she has bring pleasure "... something along those lines. I can't relate to this mentality and the movie / characters don't really shed light. <br /> <br /> The second half of the Mara tribe just seemed to be a completely separate movie. One that I don't care about. By that time I just hoped it would be a porn so it would keep my interest. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just didn't get it. <br /> <br /> I'll leave it.
