It's a beautiful photo. It offers nothing unique or original or even interesting. <br /> <br /> A medical student discovers that a secret community at her university is involved in macabre medical experiments. And of course she gets involved in solving the strange deaths at school. This movie has begun promising with some cool special effects in which a man is partially dissected while alive and trying to get away after waking up, but even that fizzles and the rest of the special effects are nice routine plastic models of the human body and the unreal blood that these two-stroke horror movies always look. <br /> <br /> And as if the routine plot and the common play were not enough, this movie had captions. that often does not even match the dual English that you hear and then add it to the mouth movement that does not match the dubbing. Well, let's just say trying to co-ordinate everything in your head is not worth it for this mediocre movie. <br /> <b R /> I at least counted on the skin in this movie and except for a bit during the opening credits, this movie didn't fix it either. <br /> <br /> This is a boring routine run of the mill horror / gore movie --- short on horror and gore. Ship this movie unless "Ernest goes to Camp" is the only rental left.
