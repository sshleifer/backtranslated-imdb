I've never voted for 1 for a movie on IMDB, but for this one I'm sorry, the scale doesn't go down to -10. All I can say abou this movie is what I saw It was in a Sneak Preview, and it was my worst movie experience ever. I don't mind the stupid jokes. I can live with the stupid story. But if I see the stupid grin "main characters" with their pseudo-strange speech (only Germans will understand what I'm talking about), I felt I was kind of dislike I never thought I could. (If they left them out, the thing might be acceptable.) <br /> <br /> There's not much to say about this one. You can laugh once or twice because it's so ridiculous, but it doesn't make it any better. It's certainly not funny. <br /> <br /> If you live outside of Germany, be happy and glad that this terrible work will probably never happen to your theater. <br /> <br /> If you live in Germany, avoid this movie at all costs.
