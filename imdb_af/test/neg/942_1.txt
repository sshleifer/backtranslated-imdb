I see absolutely nothing funny --- even remotely funny --- in this silly movie. An unrealistic, stupid, ridiculous idea - just totally ridiculous. Hard to believe that the main character, who looks so intelligent, intelligent and imaginative, will not be accepted to any college. Even more difficult to believe is that no one has closed the place. The actors depicted characters straight from Characterville. We have seen their lot many times in many movies. Nothing new here. I did it on the night night TV, and since there was really nothing else, I watched the whole boring, silly movie. What a total waste. Maybe if you are a teenager, you can find it amusing. Movies are made for an immature thought, so teenagers go for it. The rest, no way.
