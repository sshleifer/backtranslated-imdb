I heard from the show in the first few seconds when I heard the first canned laugh, but I gave it a chance. You know when someone offers a line that is just slightly amusing and you hear a natural fake laugh track exploding in unshakable laughter that is a show aimed at morons to be said: Yes, it's funny, go ahead and laugh. /> <br /> Ugh. I couldn't stand this show, as it revealed itself. I can't talk to everyone - some people actually like that IDIOTIC display "Stacked" (which makes me vomit). I can imagine that those who hold "Stacked" can actually keep this drift. Some people still get a kick from the old "pull my finger" gag. For me, this show is just as brilliant - and just as original. <br /> <br /> The themes were old and tired. The jokes were lame and hacked. The characters were the ones we've seen before - and the worst of any you think. <br /> <br /> So ... if you want things like some words and neighbors that say "pull my finger". You may like this presentation. Otherwise ... it goes through. It's stupid - and not in a clever or original way. This one is about as old and tired as any show ever was at its premiere.
