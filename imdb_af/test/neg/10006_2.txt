To be a fan of Japanese film for a long time, I expected more than that. I can't really be bothered to write too much, because this movie is just as poor. The story may be the cutest, romantic little thing ever, sorry for not being able to endure the horrible play, the mess that they called, and the standard "strange" Japanese story. If you noticed how many Japanese movies use characters, plots and twists that seem different, then force this movie. Seriously, a 12-year-old told you how this movie is going to go, and that's not a good thing in my book. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Beat" Takeshi: his role in this movie is not really more than a cameo, and if you are not a dogmaker, you do not have to suffer from this waste of film no. <br /> <br /> 2/10
