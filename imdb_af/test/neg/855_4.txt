Spike Milligan was one of the funniest men I've ever seen, and a great influence on my life. <br /> <br /> This movie is sleek and awful, and its memory has no credit. The writing is messy and preserves too many lines of the book intact (the bones here are incomprehensible). The actors' performances are uniformly ineffective, a huge roll-down is wasted, and chief, Sean Hughes, delivers Milligan's critical hostilities in a grievance that misses the point. <br /> <br /> The gentle pacing is a killer as well. Farce must accelerate towards the end. The Goon Shows have often done, the novel "Puckoon" certainly did, but this movie, if anything, only slows down when you want the different elements to merge into a final climax. <br /> <br /> In 1980, Milligan reported a short audio recording of "Puckoon" with TP McKenna, Dermot Kelly, Norma Ronald and Jack Hobbs. Now it's funny. Ten minutes of it is funnier than this whole movie. I believe the MP has been transferred to CD, but I don't know if it's still in print. <br /> <br /> There is a movie of "Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall" with Jim Dale and Arthur Lowe. It is also a divine mess, but it is more beautiful than this thing. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Milligan's spirit is too obscure for the screen. The other reviewers here are dedicated to politeness and wishful thinking. This movie is almost every opportunity and never misses a chance to disappoint.
