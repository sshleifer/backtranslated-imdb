I've never been disappointed by a Kurosawa movie, but it's probably the first. "Doppelganger" is the worst I have seen from this director. <br /> <br /> Tartan Movies advertises it as "The Terrible Movie Still From Kiyoshi Kurosawa". What? The most terrifying movie of Kurosawa is definitely "Cairo". And if you think it's an abomination, it's a surprise. It cannot be classified as abomination or tension. It's a drama and a very bad one. Many screens that were meant to be shocking seem to be funny, and much of the plot is very confusing. And since it is Kurosawa, the pace is slow. But it is so slow that you will lose interest in forty minutes and feel like doing something else. The thing that irritated me most was the use of CGI. Now CGI, if used well, can be really cool. But if it's done with little care ... It can be a disaster. I think it describes one scene here with a very minimal use of CGI. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can give Dopppelganger is that it performs very well. Koji Yakusho gives a good performance, along with the rest of the cast. But it's pretty much ... <br /> <br /> Please do yourself a favor and go see "Cairo" or "Ko-Rei" if you want to be scared. It's a bad, bad attempt at a clever drama. Which is intelligent, but ... Well, there's a lot missing. <br /> <br /> 3/10 for the good acting.
