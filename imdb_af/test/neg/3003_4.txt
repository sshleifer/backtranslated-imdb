"What symbolism!" called out a woman when we left the theater after watching the Polish brother's paean at Ingmar Bergman. Some symbolism is good there. But not much. "Northfork" adds to a fine acting that is weakened by urgent cinematography that fails to make a coherent statement and a clogged story that irritates rather than enthralls. <br /> <br /> Northfork is a city that is extinct into a new hydroelectric dam. It was early in the 1950s and a group of identically dressed state agencies. Everything seems to have answered only a decisive call for "The Untouchables". The job is to put back residents who cannot only appreciate their immediate danger. the filled grace to move. An exciting anti-development film is always a possibility, but let's really be: rural electrification is one of the biggest advances in bringing proper living conditions and a strengthened economy in American history. Dams can be built without forced removal? Not in this country. <br /> <br /> But this movie is less about the fate of homeowners as it is a fantastic creation of a dying young boy's escaping imagination. Nick Nolte is the priest who tends the boy and much of what he says would be interesting if the sound was clear enough to hear. <br /> <br /> Switching between black suitable evacuation agents (working for "lakefront" land when the dam creates the valuable area) and a fantasy magical collection of weirdos, the film does not develop coherently or even interesting. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is poor. An elaborate, muted, and depressing color permeates the entire film to little dramatic purpose. There is no reason why this large site is depicted as slim. Indeed, a contrast between largely untouched scenery and the massive and turbulent solidity of the developing dam and power plants would have been very effective. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
