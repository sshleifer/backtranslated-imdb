It starts out very interesting - the story evolves around the main character, which runs a cleaning business, which specializes in clearing crime scenes. As a former policeman, he is in a strange situation when one job suddenly "officially disappears". Furthermore, he discovered some connection with a police corruption investigation. His "Columbo Feeling" is justified, the deeper he is in the background of the story. The good actors (Jackson, Ed Harris, Eva Mendes) play in an exciting story with a few twists --- but only until the last 25 minutes. (up here 7 out of 10 stars). SPOILER :::: Suddenly the movie loses its touch and eventually there is a completely unnecessary shooting, with the 14-year-old daughter, a betrayal of friendship and an unjustified justice from the character development ... why Om Cutler to investigate for the sake of friendship? Or did the girl discover certain facts? or ... many possible much better story finishes are conceivable ... a truly wasteful end!
