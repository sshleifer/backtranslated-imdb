A boring gangster movie that made you wish someone edited it, relentlessly saved it. I would have thought the story of Las Vegas creation would be interesting, but it fails almost every turn. Warren Beatty's performance as the stupid and unpleasant Bugsy Seigel allows you to watch someone else. Once or twice, he flashes through the mist of his performance to deliver an interesting scene, but most of the time you can't just care about it. Annette Benning gives a competent turn as his unreliable lover, but even she is only slightly more affectionate than he is. <br /> <br /> I really won't struggle with this turgid drama unless you're a Benning commitment.
