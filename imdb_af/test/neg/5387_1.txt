I didn't hear of Soap Girl, but I saw a poster with a movie review of Film Threat outside the theater, so I thought how bad it could be? Well, I quickly found out. My god this movie was terrible. Most woodworkers I've ever seen outside of a porn movie. Absolute malicious dialogue. I just can't understand how it was made and why anyone agreed to be part of it. And I find it completely incomprehensible that it was actually shown in a theater and money was charged to see it. How did it happen????? And most importantly, WHAT THAT THE GUY OF THE MOVIE HAS THINKED?!?!?!?!
