Of all the E.R.Burroughs screen adaptations that Doug McClure died in the 70's, it is the stagiest of all. It's so dumb, you can taste the dust of the sets and feel the present of the lamps above. The thing looks like a very, very big budget school game, or indeed, a very low budget action movie, which it actually is. It has been said on many occasions that this was the last of the genre entries, and I hope it was. The genre did not die peacefully, but in a terrible sadness, amidst many smoke, false blood and bad sound effects. Peter Cushing must have had a boy again, as a nutty professor whose shirt stays white like snow after the men dragged him through the sleek crap holes of the Underworld. What a sport he was, to take part in this mishmash and to do it so bravely. <br /> <br /> Shoot on a good stage and accompany the trendy, now unbearable synthesizer soundtrack, the main anti-attraction of this film is the cardboard samples. Yes, there are always monsters like this in a Burroughs adjustment, but they seldom pass so completely ridiculous, helpless or empty of any credibility. At the increased action battles where Mr. McClure repeatedly attacking the creatures, you can almost hear the empty, hollow sound as his headphones on the side of a triplodactocryptosaurus. Fortunately, the animals explode and go into flames at the moment they travel and fall over. Indeed, there are many unmotivated explosions like the movie (and the genre) after the final draw. And lovely girl. Munroe loses her underworld accent. <br /> <br /> The threefold account, currently on the market, contains this movie plus two others - The Land That Time Forgot and The War Lords Of Atlantis. The first two are very strong entries, especially the first one, with lots of money invested and sometimes even fascinating scripts. Don't expect these features from this movie. Get drunk with pals and laugh at what you see. After all, the makers had no shame.
