"Empire Nero" is the second movie of the series of six productions called "Empire". I have already commented on the first one, "Imperium Augustus". This second TV movie, produced and broadcast by the Italian state-owned network last week, has the same flaws. In addition, a large number of historical errors. Some examples: Nero is a child and Agrippina calls him "Nero, Nero". At that time the name was Claudius. He was named after Nero. Nero did not meet Acte when he was young as in the movie, but after his marriage to Octavia and his appointment to emperor. As an emperor, his sons are not adults: Britannicus is one month old and Octavia one year old. And much more. If you love ancient Roman history, you can find other examples. The series "Empire" continues with four more films: "Titus", "Marcus Aurelius", "Costantinus" and "The Fall of the Roman Empire". Finally!
