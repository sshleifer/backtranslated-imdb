Usually, if I don't see a show on an original run, I find it later on the cable and realize it's a gem. The "Gimore Girls" is one of those exceptional exceptions. I'm glad I missed it. <br /> <br /> I really despise shows that fill every minute of the actor space with a rattling, stupid, boring banter. This is just one hour. The mother, Lorelei, made me wonder if she was Bipolar and of her lithium. She never stopped talking; Every minute, every second, talk to every person she's been talking to. Worse still, her speech is childish and so, like Valley Girl. She talked about guys, her hair, her mother, her clothes. Like, what is the sitch? (for situation). I watched this show three times and still don't get the point of this series. It's not a comedy, it's not a drama, it doesn't make any sense except to make three generations of women in one family look like Planet Mars' Girls. The men in comparison are smart and make the show somewhat visible. If Lorelei ever existed and tried to talk to me, then I have to dismiss her for getting rid of her. Of course, she doesn't know how to take a subtle tip to stop talking and listen to someone else. She also doesn't know how to really see the existence of others. <br /> <br /> In one show, Lorelei comes home from a date near 10:00. She got the date after meeting a man at an auction. She goes into her daughter's room where the daughter asks how it went. She insists on how boring the man was. Her date somehow had a few words in the edge. Lorelei complained about how the man didn't stop talking (choking). Hopefully the date taught how happy he was. <br /> <br /> One other person commented on how the mother behaves like a teenager and the daughter is the adult personality. Lorelei dresses even like her child. This distinctive 40-year-old mother looks as if she has hit the mall with her high school pals in the trail. <br /> <br /> I thought this show had to be followed by "Just Shoot Me" because that's exactly how I felt.
