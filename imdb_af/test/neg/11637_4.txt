I enjoy scientific fiction just as much as the next man ?? but what was hell? Seemingly shot in just three days with the excess of movie stock left from his previous film, 'Nana (1926)'. This Jean Renoir card is a confusing futuristic satire produced on a budget that could not be much more than zero. In the year 2028, after a great war, Africa became the most civilized region on Earth, and previously Europe, was named Terres Inconnues (Unknown Land). An African explorer? played by Johnny Huggins, a black man dressed as a white man as a black man, if you follow me? travel to the ruins of Paris in his spherical plane and land outside the camp of a Parisian wilderness (Catherine Hessling, then the director's wife) and her prime companion, perhaps the creepiest monkey costume I have ever seen. The cruel, as part of a bizarre sexual initiation ritual, begins with the explorer the Charleston dance, which he is delighted to learn. <br /> <br /> It doesn't help the movie that was great for Hessling The next year in Renoir's The Little Match Girl (1928) is not much of a dancer, although the extensive use of slow motion add a touch of surrealism to the ceremony. Furthermore, I'm quite shocked that Renoir would exploit his own wife as such a blatant sexual object? It's not just a surprise to learn about their divorce only three years later! On the positive side, like the general scientific concept, I looked behind the film, and the accidental satirical touch of the reversal of racial roles is usually typical of such stories. But why did Renoir decide to wear his black actor, as a minstrel will remain a mystery forever. Silly, crude and fairly useless, 'Charleston Parade (1927)' is a spectacular peculiarity of one of the most respected directors of the theater, and may be an attempt he'd like to forget. The DVD version came without a musical soundtrack, but I compromised with a variety of pieces by Dmitry Shostakovich.
