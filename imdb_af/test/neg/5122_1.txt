I give "Flashdance" a lowest score of 1 out of 10 because it's nothing more than a series of music videos featuring a short movie to watch the music videos as a feature-length movie. Since when did it count as film? Jennifer Beals plays aspiring 18-year-old dancer Alex Owens, who has incomprehensible work as a welding machine in a steel mill in Pittsburgh. Not a line of work, most older women find their way, much less 18-year-olds fresh from high school. Meanwhile, she works as an exotic dancer, who never actually takes off her clothes, in a greasy spoon bar called Mawby's. Still watching the well-choreographed and well-polished dance routines, do the girls every night at Mawby's, you will think they worked at the best casino on the Las Vegas Strip. <br /> <br /> Alex ends with a predictable romance with her boss, Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri), who is about twice her age. Having resisted Nick's advances, it's not a good idea to go out with the boss, she doesn't waste time completely with him after their first date. Alex and Nick make no effort to hide their relationship on the job. It makes no sense how it will probably look to Alex's co-workers. <br /> <br /> When Beals is not doubled for many dances do not follow the film, her character spends most of her time throwing mood tantrums. Alex's dream is to only get an invitation for auditions at the prestigious Pittsburgh Conservatory. Inexplicably, if her boss / boyfriend helps her get the audition she dreamed of, she throws one of her tantrums. She tells Nick anxiously that she doesn't do the audition because of his intervention and then comes out of his car in the middle of a busy tunnel. It's just one scene that makes you wonder what the hell was the creators thinking when they did it. <br /> <br /> Of course, Alex finally gets her audition at the Conservatory. She puts a dance routine in front of the Conservatory board, which is so ridiculous that you think it was in a movie that was marketed to the MTV generation. Oh yes, it's a dance routine in a movie marketed on the MTV generation. <br /> <br /> I don't think I can judge whether Beals can actually perform well on what I've seen in "Dance". It's because the character she's forced to play is so poorly written that I don't think it's a fair litmus test of her acting abilities. <br /> <br /> You have to make it to the makers of "Flashdance" though. This movie proves that the poorest filmmaking can be covered by a smooth marketing campaign. In this case, the best selling and award-winning soundtrack and music videos for the mentioned soundtrack are in heavy rotation on MTV. If they devoted more of their energy to writing the script, they might be able to find a plot and a story with characters I care about. Instead of what we get, stock characters are placed in ridiculous scenes. Any viewer with a functional brain cannot take seriously. A truly forgotten "movie".
