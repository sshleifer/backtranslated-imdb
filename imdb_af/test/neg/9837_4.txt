This one is one of those classic B-movies that use the exploitation of 2 hobos. It's really done cheesily and Big Stupid runs one-liners like a cardboard cassanova. But Jack Elam steals every scene in which he is in, rather than the Creepazoid Jesse (now Jerome!). My favorite scene is the lynch mob and the father's voice goes up 10 octaves ("You loved her?"). Danny, Big Stupid's protege, is surprisingly stupid, but not as ominous as our star. There is also a scenic scene of a guy poking at the meal. Joyce Meadows is the sweet, fucking gall and probably the least annoying. And the yellow ruffles (RAWR!). Oh, and drink is angry according to Mr. Stupid. <br /> <br /> This movie is a hoot. Watch the MST cover of this and Crow's awesome Elam tribute!
