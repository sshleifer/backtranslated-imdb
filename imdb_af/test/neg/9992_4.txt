Some describe CALIGULIA as the "most controversial movie of his era. While it is debatable, it is certainly one of the most embarrassing: virtually every big name associated with the movie has attempted to renounce it. Gore Vidal has been suing (with mixed results) to remove his name from the movie, and when the stars saw the movie, their reactions ranged from loud outspoken aversion to strategic silence, which they wanted, of course, was gone. had to go. <br /> <br /> For a while it seemed as if it could, CALIGULA was a big cashier office and critical flop (producer Guccione had to hire theaters to see it all), and although the movie released on the home market, so many censorship issues have been claimed to be edited, and the modified version was the only one widely available for more than a decade, but now CALIGULIA is on DVD, available in both edited "R" and original "Unrated" view awes. And undoubtedly, John Gielgud is glad he didn't live to make it happen. <br /> <br /> The only way to describe CALIGULIA is to say it is something like DEEP THROAT meets David Lynch's DUNE through Fellini on a day off. Vidal's script went into the hands of Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione. He used Vidal's reputation to bank the project and attract the big name stars - and then threw most of Vidal's screenplay and brought in soft porno director Tinto Brass. When Guccione felt that Brass's work wasn't explicit enough, he and Giancarlo photographed Lazy hardcore material. <br /> <br /> Viewers who are viewing the revised version can wonder what all the fuss is about, but those who watch the original track will soon realize that it leaves absolutely nothing for the imagination. There is a lot of nudity, and it remains in the edited version, but the original is completed with XXX scenes: there are many explicit gay, lesbian, and straight sex, kinky sex, and a big orgy, complete with dancing Roman guards thrown. to a great extent. The film is also incredibly violent and bloody, with rape, torture and mutilation in the order of the day. In a particularly disturbing scene, a man is slowly stabbed to death, a woman is urinating on his body, and his genitals are cut off and thrown to the dogs. <br /> <br /> In a documentary accompanying the DVD release, Guccione says he wanted the film to reflect the reality of pagan Rome. If so, he missed the point. We know very little about Caligula - and little know we are in doubt. In addition, orgies and casual sex were not commonplace in Roman society, where adultery was an offense punishable by death. And certainly, ancient Rome never looked at the strange, slightly oriental, strange space-age sets and costumes offered by the designers. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, those sets and costumes are often wonderfully beautiful, and cinematography is commonplace; at least it makes them right; the score is also very, very good. The most successful member of the film is Helen Mirren, who succeeds in engaging our interests and sympathy with the Empress Caesonia; Gielgud and O'Toole also escape in fairly good shape. The same can't be said for McDowell, but in his right he doesn't have much to work with. <br /> <br /> The movie does have a dark fascination, but ultimately it is a stranger, more interesting for its design and flat out of content than for content. Some of the bodies displayed (including McDowell's and Mirren's) are extremely beautiful, and some of the sex scenes work very well like pornography. But then some of them are so unpleasant that they can lead you to abstinence, and the bloody. And the grotesque nature of the film undermines his eroticism. Thinking about it is worth seeing once, but once it will be enough. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
