I usually complete every movie or book I start, even if they are poor, because I hate giving up. It was so weak, I was in disbelief. <br /> <br /> I'm not just looking for Spielberg magic - I hire foreign films, and I rent many old sci-fi's (most recently Soylent Green - worth the rent). I like both Hollywood action and slower moving character development. Different films should be approached differently to be appreciated. I couldn't find a detaching element for this one. The action was so wood, I wasn't the least bit on the edge. Character development was virtually absent - you didn't leave to be sorry for anyone, or even identify with them. Eventually there were so many pieces that just didn't add. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time - better to look dry ...
