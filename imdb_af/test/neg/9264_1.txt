Well, after the hype around the movie and after Surya marked the movie as PAD BREAKING, I went to the theater and expected something great. Son, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film's characteristics are so strange! What woman will do what Kundhavi (Jyothika) did? An idiotic, coo-coo one? And what was the point that she was in the rain with her child (Baby Shreya) after she and her husband had a fight? What was the purpose of that scene anyway? To start a vulgar shot "Maaja Maaja"? Not only was the song aesthetically crafted, but it was not necessary in the script. No need! Secondly, the first half had virtually NO STORY. The entire first half was a FREAKING suit. Every scene in the first half of the film had no meaning ever for the real story of the movie. And how did Aishwarya (Bhoomika Chawla) suddenly change so suddenly? And how did Gautham (Surya) and Kundhavi launch a happy life after six years, although they were so unhappy to marry each other? And if Gautham of Aishwarya loved, as he claimed he did, why did he even marry Kundhavi, even if it was his uncle's death wish? WHY? That's the question you're still asking while watching the movie! And how honest is the end to Aishwarya? After all, was she Gautham's first wife? Krishna, the director of the film, claims to have worked on the screenplay of this film for two years, but his writing is full of errors and makes the audience totally annoyed! Third, Krishna's un-imaginative picturizations by Rahman's awesome are just disappointing. Surprisingly, Anthony's editing (usually wonderful) for the "New York Nagaram" song just sucks! The whole song looked like it was a slideshow on Microsoft Power Point! "Munbe Vaa" Rangoli Choir Wasted with Gautham PLAYING FOOTBALL !!! Who wants to see the freaking dude playing during such a beautiful choir?!? What's more, the whole movie needs only TWO songs. Munbe Vaa and Kummi Adi. The rest of the songs including "Machakari", "Maaja Maaja", "New York" and "Jillunu Oru Kaadhal" are just not needed. Rahman's fine efforts are simply wasted on a silly movie directed by an amateur director! Fans of Rahman, you ask why Rahman is still moving to Bollywood. After looking at the way his songs were pictured in Kollywood, why would he want to stay here? What is annoying is that after Krishna decided to include Machakari in the movie, the song was cut half that really annoyed. <br /> <br /> Surya looks beautiful in his new creeps, saves the kids during college scenes and packs in a so-and-so show. His expressions during all the songs he appeared to fit didn't fit the way the singer sang the songs. Was Jyothika even in the movie? All she did was CRY! Will you mention the weeping action? One of her worst shows ever! She also didn't fit her new hair style. She looks better in Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu. Her costumes during the "New York Nagaram" song are far away. Bhoomika Chawla is just beautiful during the film and does justice to her role. Vadivelu's comedy is ANNOYING. If anyone sees him, he wants them to hit him on the face. This is Santhanam who stealer the show during the comedy scenes. And why did Sukanya even agree to do such a trivial role that could only be done by someone? And why is her makeup so heavy when she's perfect? Music by A.R. Rahman is just fantastic. "Machakari", "Munbe Vaa", "New York" and "Jillunu Oru Kaadhal" deserve special mention. R.D. Rajasekhar's cinematography is right and not as good as his previous films, although the view in the Kummi Adi song deserves special mention. Anthony's editing is really very disappointing. The movie is just as cunning and can be severely cut. <br /> <br /> Krishna's direction just sucks. Dialogues (A.C. Durai and Krishna) are just too wheat to consume especially the part where Bhoomika confesses her love for Surya. The script and essay (Krishna) are horibble. The film is moving in the more uninteresting pass. And Krishna's writing is just filled with unexplained sub-graphs. <br /> <br /> And for the sake of goodness, why was there so much advertising in the movie? Pepsi, Maggi, Suzuki, you call it. Was the film producer (K.E. Gnanavel) on budget or was he just desperate? Overall, Jillunu Oru Kaadhal is a damp squib. With such a title, a heart-warming and chilled love story will be expected, but ending a painful love story. Really, very disappointing.
