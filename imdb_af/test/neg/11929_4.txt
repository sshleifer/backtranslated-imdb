It's a little disillusioning when a studio decides to screen a movie for the press before it goes into wide-ranging release. That many movies suck is no surprise, but if a studio itself recognizes so much ahead of time, the process of film becomes a passion game of all kinds. Considering an early Christmas gift from Hollywood, the "Aeon Flux" isn't nearly the appearance of taste and decency one can expect, given the above. Although ultimately overwhelmed by his mistakes, it has at least (kind of) an idea to play around. Too bad director Karyn Kusama seems little idea how to do it all. <br /> <br /> This is the future. There is a plague. There is a dictatorship, and there are rebels. The latter is known as the Monicans, and far from being a cult of beret or tennis racket worshipers, they are trying to overthrow the former, called the Goodchild regime. The regime is sometimes meant for citizenship, which is more than Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) and can stand her pals. Through a kind of biochemical virtual reality technology, the Monicans receive commands from their beloved leader (Frances McDormand), a mystical priestly type who has been rooted. It falls to Aeon to tie on some formful, futuristic spandex actions to execute the high-root orders, which of course are a version of "destroying the regime." She used to look at her sister's liquidation of the Goodchilds years ago, but she didn't need much convincing. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly things get complicated. The Goodchilds may not be quite what they look like, and Aeon has an unexpected history with them. Although sometimes obscured, the film's central appearance (which I will no longer reveal) contains some fine ideas about the nature of human existence and survival. There is room for much more exploration of which the film does not benefit, but the ideas are there at least. The big problem with "Aeon Flux" is technical. Kusama made the shocking decision to shoot almost all the action so close we can rarely follow what is going on. To make matters worse, it is edited in a flurry of jumping cuts that are completely lost. The result is some serious spatial disorientation that takes over the film. Aeon Flux's aesthetic is one of attractive costumes, odd-spotted architecture and characters. Much of the action takes place in minimalist open spaces pleading for some unbroken long shots that may imply the grace and athletics of the above. Instead, we get split seconds of flying limbs, glass breaks, and accompanying sound effects. <br /> <br /> There's a pretty good movie trying to get out of the majority of 'Aeon Flux'. Put these things in the hands of the Wachowski brothers, say, and the results can be quite different. However, as it is, I felt "Aeon Flux" deliberately chased me away from a movie I wanted to enjoy. This film is unpaid at its own strengths. As a beginner, the poker player has given a royal reel, but in a way it finds a way to lose despite its potential.
