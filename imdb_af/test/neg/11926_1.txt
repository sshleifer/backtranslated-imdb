Straight (or down) there with Toys and Jurassic Park 2 and The Phantom Menace. <br /> <br /> The premise sounded, some of the ads looked semi-promising, but unfortunately, the whole movie had about 30 seconds. of neat shot ness, and it is shown on the small screen's 30 second lock. <br /> <br /> If you want amateur writing, second-effect effects, ridiculous costumes and an all-encompassing snooze show in all respects. The plot is recycled sci-fi feed. Too bad too, because I came in, I thought it would be bad, but expressed hope. It could be the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - Don't see it. <br /> <br /> Unless of course you had any of the above 3 movies.
