It's too friendly to call it a "fictitious" account of the Barker gang. They have the names right, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> Russell is still hot, I'll give it to you, but it's not the real Ma Barker, who basically cared for the boys by cooking and helping them move across the country. by planning or participating in the crimes. I think it would have been much more interesting to present the real story of a middle-aged woman caught in the criminal activities of her children and their cronies. <br /> <br /> I also have to agree with the reviewers who found the shooting scenes to be absolutely incredible. The victims of Barker / Karpis were a combination of the innocent and the law enforcement agencies they pursued, but they certainly did not cut half a dozen FBI agents every time they were opposed. (On the other hand, as several recent books relate, the FBI of that era emphasized the idea of ​​agents coming only from legal or accounting backgrounds, to the extent that many agents had very little law enforcement or firearm experience. They were not the well-off-guided agents depicting us today.) <br /> <br /> But the worst sin of all is that the movie is actually a drill. Nobody changes, no one grows. We know the end of the road is ahead, we just don't know what shooting it will be. <br /> <br /> Only for the hard Russell fans.
