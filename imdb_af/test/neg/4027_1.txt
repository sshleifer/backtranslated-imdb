This is what my friends and I continue to ask throughout the movie. We couldn't believe how stupid it was! I think someone shot it on their camcorder at home and put it in the movie shop and put it on the shelf as a joke to see if anyone would ever pick it up. Well, I think the joke is on us. <br /> <br /> I think I had to come to this site first and read all the reviews they got, each saying this movie is HORRIBLE, STUPID, and on and on. And boy are they right! Although it did give a little good laugh (me and my friends were pretty drunk) because it's so stupid. We just can't believe anyone is stupid enough to make such a crappy movie! I swear it had to be made in the 70's before they had good technology for movies and stuff, because every scene looked really crappy, but when I looked here, it said it was made in 2001? What? It certainly doesn't look like a movie that will be made today, but I think that's what you get when you use a video camera and shoot home movies using strobe-light and really fake search lasers, and use real people from your hometown . from actors or even aspiring actors. BTW-some of those chicks (or were they drag queens, we couldn't tell!) Were so quick, even my drunk horny colleagues couldn't touch them with a 50-foot pole. <br /> <br /> So there is absolutely no appeal to this movie, bad acting, bad writing, bad directing, bad special effects, bad, bad, bad. Don't waste your time or money on this one, you'll be totally disappointed!
