Sometimes you get exactly what you expect. A movie produced and by and as a rock group vehicle in the middle of a return is not expected to be high in artistic merit - and in this case it is definitely not. In fact, as expected, the soundtrack is a much better investment than the movie itself. Like the 70-year-old rock and lifestyle that tries to portray it, it is characterized by excess, drugs and over-the-top antics, but unfortunately it's not nearly as much fun. Using a script by Carl Dupre, which is terrible enough to make a co-author, and to devour Edward Furlong's talents, is the only highlight of this rock-and-roll piece that went wrong. The music is especially the refurbishment of a 1978 KISS concert.
