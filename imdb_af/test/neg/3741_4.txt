Many praise was on Farscape, but I don't think it's so good. It certainly has a distinctive appearance, but it has just about everything else: story, purpose, direction, excitement; You call it. I'm a big sci-fi fan, and I make it a point to see all the sci-fi programs I can. I almost finished the four seasons of Farscape, and at this point I'm not very happy. The show does have some good things - especially Claudia Black (who unfortunately misses the first episodes of season four) - but they are very few and very far between. As a whole, the show is spoiled by many stupid things (like Fantasy elements rather than SF ditto), and many episodes, especially. in season four, is indescribably messy and very poorly structured. And one just feels it's not going anywhere. It is mostly just non-directional adventures with thin, long-running plot lines that develop slowly. Well, sometimes it's a bit harder, but it only takes a few episodes at a time. <br /> <br /> Efficiency, there are a few impressive things here and there (especially in space, occasionally), but the performance looks in the same style of effects, which grows fairly quickly. Foreign and unconvincing puppet strangers congratulated the show and I chose to prefer the episodes where regular human characters focus. <br /> <br /> I think the Peacekeepers are by far the most attractive and intriguing and interesting figures on the show; they succeed in being a convincing alien culture, despite their all-human appearance. There are some very cool episodes with them, especially. in the first season (IIRC), where Crichton is captured as a peace chief captain, and enters and eventually destroys one of their secret bases. Such episodes can reach a score of 8 out of 10, but I can't award the overall view as a "4" rating. <br /> <br /> Apart from the peacekeepers (who are somewhat too one-sided totalitarian and militaristic to truly be refined), the show simply offers nothing important or meaningful to know or see. OTOH, it contains some good ideas and is not a total loss. <br /> <br /> This is my opinion, of course, but as a seasoned scientist, I think it counts for something and Kan helps others. There aren't many good sci-fi exhibits out there; but Star Trek (any series) and especially the new Battlestar Galactica is definitely better than Farscape. But if you're a big fan of mediocre sci-fi shows, you can also love Farscape. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4 out of 10.
