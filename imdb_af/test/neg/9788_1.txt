Being a former MST3k watcher, I even found this movie unprecedented. The terrible efforts to make humor are the terrible efforts to act. No one needs to read a harangue on this piece of junk. <br /> <br /> I just love how all the positive reviews are clearly written by former members or family friends. Just click on their other reviews and wow - they're all reviewing Modern Vampires. Give me a few bucks and I can make a movie better than that. One of the most incompetent movies I've ever seen and what says something. Look at your own risk. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0/10
