Unlike John Krasinski, this movie was absolutely horrible. The Lacey Chabert and Andrew Keegan love story was as clever as possible, full of incredible bad lines about how her parents would never let them meet and demand a super-hammam. None of the "emotions" had any depth or reality. The two accent characters (Dean Edwards as Rupert and whoever was the gun expert) ... Once they saw how bad the accents were, they couldn't decide to just drop them and rewrite a few lines to to avoid giving the audience headaches? Apparently not. I don't even know where to start editing, especially the audio editing. If you hate the clear over-dubbing, as much as I do, don't look. It is said, Krasinski was wonderful. From the bat I will admit that I am a great office fan and so I rented it. But he is quite entertaining as the "out-of-the-wall friend with crazy ideas". He has a clichéd role, but he still manages it as entertaining as possible. The end was terrible. Just flat awful. The idea of ​​the wrong robbery has potential, but Keegan jumped around after being shot, up to his studio to uncover a Chabert painting (which doesn't look like her) the most urgent scene.
