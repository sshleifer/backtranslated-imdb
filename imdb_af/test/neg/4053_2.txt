In the only act they ever made, the NSW Film & Television Office refused to fund this film. The producers kicked a big stink and in a movie of publicity they took production to Victoria. Apart from the lost work for technicians, NSW was lucky not to be involved. <br /> <br /> The movie fails at every level. The postmodernism fails, the casting fails (what is the character of Rose Byrne? What 1-dimensional trinket did Hugo Weaving channel? What is the hell of Pia Miranda's character?) And the story is a stone of the contradictions. In fact, the story runs like a spread prediction rather than a complete plot line. <br /> <br /> It might have been a chance to meet the "pop culture depression", the style is better thought out and executed. If the casting was strange, if the style was less serious ... if about everything was different. <br /> <br /> Apart from the usual excellence in costumes, design and filmmaking (like most Australian films), the film is just a total failure. <br /> <br /> At a reported budget of over $ 7m, the Tender is a symptom of the malaise of the Australian film industry - the wrong people and the wrong projects are being funded. Compare this mess with "Noise" (under $ 2m), or "Cedar Boys" (under $ 1m) and get the idea. The tricky, interesting movies are struggling to get funding, and the foolish, remaining name-tagged projects get the money. <br /> <br /> The funding bodies that invested in this earnings have the same way as Hugo Weaving's character at the end of the film.
