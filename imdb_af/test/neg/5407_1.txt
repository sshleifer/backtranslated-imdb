These are the worst movies of all time. No research or thought took place in this movie. Action scenes were thrown at random which did not make sense in the context of the movie. Items appear and randomly disappear. Obviously it is directed by a "stunt coordinator", who has to go back to his old job. The Skeleton drove a horse through the movie, which changed incredibly color. Either this, or someone thought the audience would all be color blind and not notice. Blood will be on the actors in one scene and the following, miraculously disappear and then reappear. Seems that everyone associated with this movie has forgotten to investigate inconsistencies.
