As someone who also knows the filmed ship and other ships, I can't see the movie as a movie. As a movie, you have some wonderful shots of the ship, most of them are done on an existing vessel - apart from those in the rampton, of course, and a certain room under the deck. But with regard to the story and the dialogues, I can only call it great shit. None of this will happen on a real sailing boat. No wonder, the movie had a bad impact on the existing ship. If I didn't know better, I was not tempted to do a sailing trip. Definitely, for Europeans, I recommend switching off as soon as the ship was in operation. Then the over-emotional, very American part I couldn't bear. The photos are really fantastic, no wonder in a Ridley Scott movie, but if you can't listen to the text, it gets much better.
