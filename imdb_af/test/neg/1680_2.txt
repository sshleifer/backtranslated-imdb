An elite American military team that obviously includes two beautiful women and a man who can't understand teamwork, many bats, some terrorists and a Spetznaz team acting like the gang that can't shoot straight - all thrown together in a submerged plot with mediocre acting. This one has nothing much to do with it. The characters are not compelling. Even the area, with great potential, looks like something from the middle of Pennsylvania's countryside, not an exotic Boreal forest in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> Bats are definitely terrible. They can even pick up a man and fly with him with a few feet (harps) or an arm. You see Delta power surrounded by hundreds of bats with a guy shooting shotguns and pistols on them and bats on the ground. It will be as if you shoot skeet with a 3 foot distance gun. Totally clueless. The dialogue is unrealistic, with boys and girls joking and flirting in the midst of tense parts of the mission. One of the teams is blown up by a mine and the first one at the scene just stares at his body sadly, and doesn't even cover the area. Actually, after the rest of the group appears, he talks about how the area is laid out like a minefield - thanks for the head on the bub. <br /> <br /> If you want a contrast in how a horror movie is involved A small military group can be well done on a low budget. Harvesting is not the movie you want to see. In fact, I think I'm going to give it a two instead of a three if I can make it in the second half. It seems unlikely at this point.
