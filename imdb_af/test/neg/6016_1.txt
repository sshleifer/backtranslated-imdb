I wish all the mockings and horror poofs would go away. If you are going to investigate Loch Ness, you really have to do it. Enough of the bull ****. Same with horror and sci-fi. If you're going to make a movie and it's scary, make it scary..not funny. I hate watching a horror movie and fighting the character for their lives (or running or whatever. Their lives are at stake) and they are joking. It never happens .. where are all the good directors gone? I think horror and sci-fi have really gone down in the tube since the 70's. I long for the days that a horror movie was scary. This scary movie is for the birds. This movie is also for the birds. If you really want to see a good investigation or talk seriously about this, don't expect it in this video.
