I'm a big fan of Deepa Mehta's work, especially Fire and Earth 1947. Unfortunately, this movie is missing from her _all_ needed for a good movie. <br /> <br /> The movie attempts to show the fate of the widows. in India in the early 20th century and the new wave of ideas of their rehabilitation around the same time. Pictured with a childhood widow as a central character, although the plot is banal from an Indian point of view, it could still be a very powerful movie. Sorry The film missed both the sensitivity of Fire and the intensity of emotion in Earth in 1947. <br /> <br /> Even if one assumes the story is a given, though there are hundreds of things I would otherwise have wanted to do than Well, the movie is especially sorry. Everything is said. Everything is displayed straight. Absence of sensitive implied sentences. Absence of untreated things. I just couldn't believe it was a Deepa Mehta movie. <br /> <br /> There were some very standard Hindi movie characters - such as an old widow with her own established interests, or a father who had dual standards of the highest quality. Can't write a script without having these old Indian movie characters? <br /> <br /> Many have praised Deepa for making a movie and pointing out Hindu fundamentalists. Well, I agree she took a brave step, but shouldn't you worry about the quality of the movie, or is it a controversial one an end in itself? It is obvious that if you start with a story like in Water, you will consider the pain of the widows. --- It doesn't take a completed director to reach it. And the movie had nothing more than that! So where is Deepa's contribution to the movie? <br /> <br /> And talk about acting etc. - pathetic !!! Lisa Ray has a pretty face, a very beautiful face - but that's where it ends. She can't speak Hindi; she can't emulate. John Abraham is no better. Most widows seem unnatural. The saving grace is Seema Biswas and the young girl. They are fantastic. <br /> <br /> And it was a period movie - but the Hindi dialogues suck much time. Even there is judgment as unnatural as it gets. No rustic accent !!! No local snakes. No nothing. The only thing right was probably the shooting room. I thought the set of the vidhwa ashram was pretty real. The overall blue point throughout the movie is also suitable. <br /> <br /> But everyone and everyone, don't see this movie. You won't get anything. There is nothing in the story or direction. If you have to look at it, watch it for the little girl's play.
