With Pep Squad receiving an average of 4.7 on IMDb.com, no wonder Steve Balderson confused this site so. But the fact is that Pep Squad is a poorly crafted "black" "comedy" (both words in quotation marks for a reason). It's a movie full of overtime (Cherry, Beth's Mother), along with some dull performances (Beth and Julie's boyfriend). A movie where you can follow cars of twenty feet in a hazy red jeep and never be noticed. A movie beats full of non-tasty cleavage and nudity shots that make you wonder: "Does the director think it's funny? Or clever?" Usually, the characters are so paper-thin and poorly developed that the film becomes quite unpredictable, but probably not deliberate. Pep Squad can't decide whether a comedy, a drama or a satire (patriotic music, I get it ...). The film fails to be serious, because the idea of ​​killing any school position (that is, Prom Queen) crosses the line in madness (not to mention shots of flag fire and shootings, a poor attempt at contentious and edgy ), and fails to be a comedy for all the forced and uncomfortable jokes (big mommy, "funky" black school principal, and excessive cussing made poor by the principal). To watch the documentary, "Wamego: Making Movies Anywhere" made this film more worthy of praise, praised by it ... the director and the director's father ... hmmmmmm. Not a black comedy or something for that matter. I think Kansas will have to wait.
