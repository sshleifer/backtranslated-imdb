Could have been better. In fact, maybe, if the filmmaker didn't try as hard as he did, it might be better. <br /> <br /> On a good note. The lighting was pretty good. But almost everything was missing. Wobbly camera work. (Yes, yes, it is the intention to be the style now.) Poor recording sound. And editing that looks like someone has watched too many Ulli Lommel movies (which is the worst edited movie.) To sum it up, the film was a rationalization for the director / writer / main character to naked a few young women to get. , put them in false slavery and catch them while they say "threatening" things.
