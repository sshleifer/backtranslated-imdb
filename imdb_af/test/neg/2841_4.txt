(Some Spoilers) Deaf as a dish-maker who murdered this uprooted homeless man, Darwyn Swalve, to murder L.A's entire city estate because of the high prices they charge for their properties. Like an extra from a Clint Eastwood "Spaghetti Western". Harry, who lives in abandoned homes, eats dog food, is very upset when his quiet lifestyle as a sticker is interrupted. This happens when a number of brokers have invaded his space in an attempt to sell the homes, staying with their potential customers. <br /> <br /> Joseph Bottome stars in this bottom of the rig horror movie as radio talk show host Dr David Kelly the attractive and popular host psychologist of the KDRX survival line. DR. Kelly is sued by the family of one of his callers, Tracy, who eventually blows her brain out while she was on the air with the doctor who could do nothing to help her test her to survive. <br /> <br /> The real estate agent touches dr. Kelly on the air about his adventures and the police are trying to get the doctor to get his phone number and address by keeping him on the line, but he refuses to order to not hurt his rating, as potential callers do not the fear of monitoring ended up by the LADP. <br /> <br /> Kelly also has a hot and heavy relationship with a property manager and busty agent Lisa Grant, Adrienne Barbeau, whose sales office is Harry's main victims in his movie. Harry also gets to kill Lisa's main housing business competition, the chubby and outrageous Barney Resnick, Barry Hope, who threatened to make Lisa any way possible, even if he had to kill her. <br /> <br /> To get Berney alone, and with his pants off, Harry chops off his head while being entertained by one of his clients, a hooker, which he kills and hangs with the headless Barney . The movie ends with the stray Harry taking Lisa hostage and dr. Kelly tries to save her just to have Det. Shapiro (Robert Miano), seems like I haven't slept in a week, comes out of nowhere and blows out Harry's brain. Harry comes back to life quickly, minus the gay issue between his ears, and gets himself killed for the second time by being thrown off a balcony and landing on the ground as a dozen members of the LAPD, M16 pulled up and ready, come on the scene. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the movie "Opean House" laughed with almost no tension. Even the hot sex scenes between dr. Kelly and Lisa did not save the movie, because there were too few, only two of them and and sexy Adrienne Barbeau was a little under-exposed, with not enough light and too many clothes on, in all of them. <br /> <br /> Harry the killer in the movie was also a bit comical to take seriously to make a point, dr. Kelly on the phone and in person about the high rent and house prices in the country and how people like themselves find it almost impossible to find a decent place to live. You can sympathize with Harry's concern about the high cost of living, but be very critical of him in how he went mad. to fix it.
