The emperor's new groove was a big turn for Disney. It wasn't a musical! It had clean, fresh jokes and no political twists. It was just a funny movie. <br /> <br /> Kronk's New Groove, on the other hand, is tired and weak. My 3-year-old still loves Keizer's New Groove, but fell asleep during Kronk's. There really is no real conflict (which in the first movie leads to all the wacky adventures). Due to the lack of conflict, the animators seem to have thrown out the authors and just picked up the storyline while they were going. <br /> <br /> I was waiting for something to happen that would make the movie fun. . . and is still.
