I know Terry Gilliam is considered a good director, but claiming that this movie is good is not foolish. What is the movie about? What is this spoof? Fantasy? Comedy? Satire? No reply from Gilliam's script. Completely confused and useless, weakening from one historical era to another. I find it amusing that some people actually call this movie magic. Is it because they are any movie that is vague and undecided about what it's about? 3 stars for special effects as it is 1981. Roger Ebert is right in his review. The film is ambiguous and looks like Gilliam's skirt with money just to make a vague children's movement that is a historical revue. The film also tries to confuse the heater by giving John Cleese and Sean Connery the best bill.
