There is nothing special or interesting about this race of the mill-low-budget sci-fi movie. Regardless of its pedigree origin (the film is loosely based on a novel by Leo Tolstoy), the plot and overall themes of this movie are by no means remarkable or original, science is at its best, and unfortunately, the movie to even include compelling action sequences. <br /> <br /> The plot begins with a manned spacecraft to Mars, and although the main plot does not really roll until the ship lands, most of the most interesting scenes take place on the route. Unfortunately, as soon as we touch interplanetary travelers, they have previously found interesting interpersonal relationships, speculation on cosmology and the meaning of life, and all that is interesting about the movie, all culminated in an only distance-coherent plot on the Mars revolutionary, environmental problems and not many convincing fraud sites. <br /> <br /> There's also nothing remarkable about the production quality of the movie. This is acceptable. And most of the acting, though slow, is OK. Cameron Mitchell is actually pretty good and plays a nice character. I think the best quality of this movie, from my perspective is its fashion sense. The martians have very nice outfits! If this movie had a point, it might have been much more interesting. Oh good.
