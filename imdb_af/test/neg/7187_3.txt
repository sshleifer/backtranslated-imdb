There is not much to say in the end. One would have expected much more from a director who made better films in the past. He seems to have done this without really taking care of it. The actors do their job (although Belmondo is far from incredible), but you just don't get addicted. In a word it is boring. This is even more disappointing, as I have heard several times that this movie can be seen as a response to all the major US blockbusters who are considered a threat to the French exception by those who just cannot admit that to another must not work. I tell you, if it's the best response we're supposed to get, son, I'm going to be really depressed soon ...
