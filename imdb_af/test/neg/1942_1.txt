This is by far the worst and most stupid show I've ever seen on TV. It is almost physically painful to watch an adult (well in his twenties) do nothing but torture and mock his parents. They always seem to never know what they are about from the stunts they have been forced to endure by their disrupted son and his equally stupid friends. Of course I know his parents are on it, but I really hate how they always act as they are completely surprised. It looks fake through and through. And I really hate the intro of the show, in which a voice asks, "Bam Margera, what will he think next?!" (I think that is anyway, anyway), and Bam himself replies, "What the f * * I want!" - SEE! Bam is really brighter - live at home with mom and dad! of course the word "f ^ * k" is replaced with a tasteful beep, but we get the message. Bam is the true rebellion - at least in his own eyes. Of course, Bam and his mansions of deadly skulls are aimed at teenage audiences, and of course this is an MTV show, but please, raise the bar a bit. It is painfully predictable and stupid, and therefore nothing but boring.
