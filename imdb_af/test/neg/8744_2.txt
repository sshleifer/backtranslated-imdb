It connects with the endless line of Corny, predictable 50's sci-fi screen out there. As usual, it's pretty bad. There isn't much of a plot that I could find and the exaggerated exaggeration of the lead only leads to the unintentional laugh. The title is also misleading. Capturing it on MST3K is probably the only way to view it, and it's better off the road.
