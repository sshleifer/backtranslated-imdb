This homemade horror movie tells the story of a man who kills people by using the motive of stories by Edgar Allan Poe. The local police bombed the case for a few years, so now the FBI has taken over. They know exactly who the man is, but nobody thought to be swinging at his house, because it is where he hangs, runs around in his cute clothes and tortures the random residents. So kidnapped FBI chick, involving her father, former chief investigator of the local police. To take it all away, a pack of awake college kids decided to camp out at home and smoke a lot of weeds. <br /> <br /> Mostly, the FBI agent wind up and run like a girl, and none of the brave college boys just think to stop and make a swing at the wimpy Poe boy . Mostly over-treated and sometimes undermined Dead End Road series of a low-budget, throw-to-friends production that has stupid points too much to cover.
