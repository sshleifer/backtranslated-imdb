This show is absolutely ridiculous. Yes, of course it is counterfeit. But it is painful to watch. I personally know more creative film influencing thoughts that can "make it" really look. The young captain can no longer be convincing. He reads everything he says. Do we really believe he knows what he's talking about? There is an abundance of ways to show Blair-Witch. Fear does not break out as if it is "cool" and computer-generated. It also does not generate such proverbial lines as "What was it? Did you hear it?" In addition, there is real convincing psychology out there that doesn't just want to be on the screen. Another DUH factor is ... how do these producers actually think we're going to buy that paranormal activity will only play magic within the 2 possible 3 days (if we're lucky). I do not think so. A 2+ week in one place will be more convincing. It's also disarmed that they think Nasa radar tests and computers that show fancy bs really scare us. AND IE: Beliefs should not be staged like the movie "The Exorcist". When will they get it right? Owning the devil or other evil spirits influences people differently. Not only do they grasp and drop their voices like Linda Blair or fall like Courtney Love on a drug difference. As stated, better concentrations on "psychic ability" will greatly help this performance. We want to see and hear everything flashing before them. Not cut off to other story bs. On a final note, shooting stars don't deserve interest when you show fake photos of UFOs beforehand. May I emphasize again that the young, dark-haired man who hosts this shoulder is absolutely right. Avoid this view. For the fright: look at old Unresolved Mystery episodes ... not the new ones (the relaxation has it oh-so wrong). But it's for another blog.
