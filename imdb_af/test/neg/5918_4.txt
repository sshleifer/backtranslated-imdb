Steve Tesich's pen from Peter Yates is a relatively low key "thriller" that doesn't really come off the ground. Story pertains to the mysterious murder of an influential Asian businessman and the subsequent implication of a pathetic Vietnam veteran (James Woods) that police apparently have revenge on his ex-employer. As the "Witness", William never thinks his friend is capable of doing such an act. <br /> <br /> Bad is much less than its usual power, and one finds it difficult to sympathize with him or an uninspired Sigourney Weaver. James Woods and Christopher Plummer do a bit better in their support roles. Noteworthy is the appearance of Morgan Freeman as a detective. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, Steve Tesich's story is just an unlikely romance picked up as a mystery. The plot is confronted too much. <br /> <br /> Friday, October 17, 1997 - Video
