I initially thought it was bad because I had great expectations for this movie, but after I thought it was so bad. I was almost caught up in HK's promotion of bad stars in bad movies. HK's new generation of actors and actresses to name bad writing writers brings the industry down. Right now I'm trying to figure out how high it is. normally you can't lose in a movie with donnie yen and not (forget Jackie, he's over his peak). but then I have to find out when twins were on the cover. It is cheesy, camps, very calming, I try to laugh at some jokes, but not only is the effect very small, but the jokes are very recycled and not funny. I'm sorry, I bought the movie. The only reason some people think it is so good is because they are broken in the hype that the twins are cute, and everyone loves them, and everything they do is good and funny. and if you like twins, you are up to date ... <br /> <br /> Sigh ... I miss the good hk movie days when jet li and stephen chow movies dominate the box office ... <br / > <br /> Films from mainland China are much better than that, and they are being shot at lower budgets.
