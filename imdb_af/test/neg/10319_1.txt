I watched 5% of this movie tonight and you can tell me to see the whole movie to understand it, but honestly I don't think so. <br /> <br /> What is the story of hell? Movie? I ran a lot of people in a factory and shot around everything. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Okay. <br /> <br /> 1) They shoot around as if it were the Terminator or something they were trying to kill. The whole place was made of metal, but not a single bullet made on the metal surfaces. <br /> <br /> 2) No ricochet. Metal to metal is bound to cause ricochets, but no one apparently hit a stray bullet. <br /> <br /> 3) Magic bullets? In one scene, a bad man is standing in front of a good guy when another good man appears behind the bad guy and pumps him with metal. You see that the dots leave his chest when it explodes in a bloody dung, but the good man right in front of him doesn't get hurt at all! 4) After man jumped over the wall, the two good guys tell a few jokes and they laugh and look like teenagers playing with soft guns. <br /> <br /> 5) Sounds? At one point, the governor cuts a wire and an alarm goes off (who just cuts a wire to set an alarm?). The lady shouts "Alarm in the blah blah sector" and the bad old boss says, "Okay .. this .. is .. not .. a .. drill .. blah blah" in a very, very amateur kinda way. Ooh, we're being caught by terrorists, it's not a drill, but I'm going to sound like I'm not crap. <br /> <br /> 6) Focus !! First, you see the bad guys loading up on weapons. For some reason the same man gets the same Uzi twice. Deja vu or loop of screens? You literally see that every bad guy gets the same weapon and they lock and load the same way. The gun dealer appears in the clip and the bad old extra number. XX locks and loads. When they started burning, you had to see the barrel flicker. Boooring !! 7) Actors or dummies? One of the allegedly good people throws a smoke grenade for some reason and of course the bad guys are suddenly in the smoke because they are smoke-blind or something they don't see. They cough and groan as if it were anthrax in the grenade. Then a half-boss bad man comes up and he doesn't even have to cough when he enters the smoke, he just pushes the other bad guys away and they suddenly realize that the smoke is not in the case of an anthrax. <br /> <br /> 8) B flick? I think yes! A man with a metal pipe moving a Uzi in his right hand suddenly shoots at someone in his eye level. I want to see a man burning a Uzi with one hand and I want to see him get his hand on it. Extra bloody mess in a B-movie. Small * pops * and a red hole with a torn shirt indicate that this man is dead. Although the first bullet hit his heart, the good man who is a super trained green beard is still the urge to put his clip in the dead guy. 9) One of these listed trained soldiers jumps out of her hidden with an empty clip! How stupid can you be? Always check your clip before you face an unknown amount of enemies! 10) Drilling scenes. Like the glittering scenes and the lock and drawer, the movie is filled with time-consuming scenes of people running around in a seemingly empty building. Cut the action if you're going for a B movie movie, please. <br /> <br /> My two cents on this movie.
