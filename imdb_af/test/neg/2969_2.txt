Looks like some of the previous reviewers have seen another movie I saw earlier tonight. Actually, this movie is why I registered with IMDb. Sure, Bobbie Phillips can "fight" and therefore I give this movie a 2, but the rest of the movie is just pure crap ... The play is bad, the plot is bad, the camera angles are bad and the effects are bad no. Probably the actors are in good shape, but they can't act! Sometimes I enjoy bad movies, but this movie has no charm and after watching this movie, I was sorry to see it. Certainly, if you want to see mediocre battles without anything else, then this movie is for you. If not, stay away from this movie! PS: Sorry for any spelling mistakes ... I'm just tired of causing this movie!
