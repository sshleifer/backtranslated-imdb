Bad shot, poorly edited, clumsy dialogue, flat characters, unsuccessful novel adaptation. It doesn't really get much worse. Good action and good popcorn saved me for this hour and a half - more than three hours of boredom. Sometimes good one-liners. <br /> <br /> David is a dull young man who has never recovered from his brother at an early age. He puts his trust in a Chinese philosophy of mumbo jumbo video, but it doesn't seem to help him much in real life. David is a member of a debt collection gang, where each member has an IQ under sea level. Lack of writing, along with tremendous blasting and worse editing, make what rather funny incidents of failed debt collection look like an amateur homemade reality show. <br /> <br /> David hires an apartment from a primary school teacher, Haraldur, who, through a few sentences of his own interest, convinces David that he is dealing with the biggest dangerous criminals in Iceland. A weak shortage offers David nothing to base his opinion. A few scenes show that Haraldur did something that David had misinterpreted would have done. The potential of film as a media, unlike the text of the book on which this film is based, is not exploited. <br /> <br /> First, David's commitment to Haraldur increases his status within the debt collection gang, but the prevailing paranoia in the criminal world forces David to show where his loyalty lies. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is good, but then it's based on the book. It could have been a much better movie. A good script writer could have made this material. Unfortunately, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> The acting is generally good. Peter Jóhann is excellent and credible as David. Eggert Þorleifsson does not get much to work with, but does his best with what little material he has. Ingvar Sigurðsson and Michael Imperioli (in a small role) are right. <br /> <br /> Overall Opinion: What could have been quite a funny and entertaining film about a dull anti-hero in a debt-gathering gang, is a boring, weak-film made after a poor manuscript. Looking at your toes for an hour and a half will be more enjoyable.
