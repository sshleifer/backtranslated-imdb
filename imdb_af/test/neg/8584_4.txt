Predictable, clich√©, incredible, boring ... what else can I say? It is only the caliber of the cupboards that saves redeeming features of this inflated mess. Oh yes and the entertaining end zone antique. <br /> <br /> But wait for the eleven highlights, as the result is as predictable as the Globetrotters / Washington Generals matchup will win. <Br /> <br /> I was good at the second act before figuring out. It was supposed to be PRO teams we watched (all dressed in vintage Padres brown). And Cameron Diaz's character's imitation of a youthful Georgia Frontiere was poor on the page. (Not your fault, Cameron. Do you want to eat?) <br /> <br /> Enough of this - I'm just on a ration because I'm looking forward to this movie. Rent the longest place instead. <br /> <br />
