Admittedly, I agreed to see steak trays in the hope of James Brolin. Unfortunately, there was only one early, and the rest of the movie was very tame and eventually made little sense. <br /> <br /> The story, which is about it, focuses on Nick and Julie Atkins, a couple whose age-old marriage begins. Nick, a successful businessman, is focused on work to the point of neglecting July, trying to fill the gap by going back to school. Julie's longing for the passion she and Nick had had earlier in their marriage is beginning to take the form of powerful sexual fantasies that divide reality for minutes and cause them to do things like burning breakfast and her husband's newspapers. misplaced. Initially she fantasizes about her husband, but as the film progresses, she begins to fantasize with other men and encounters with random strangers she meets. This results in the effects of her fantasies with disastrous consequences for her marriage. Can she and her husband rebuild their relationship? Is it worth saving? <br /> <br /> It could have been an interesting prospect, but the performance is so thin that you wonder why they even bother. Characters are not developed. Motives are not explained. Background information is not given. No exploration is made of how Julie came to the point where she could not control herself, and it is not explained how she will do it in the future. The end product is a tangled debris that is just as confusing as July's fantasies, which are surprisingly underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> The play is a mixed bag. Donna Mills like Julie does well with the material she's given, although her constant self-pity becomes a punishment for a while. James Brolin acts as if he is reading his lines of cue cards, and even his anger over his wife's infidelity is hard to buy. He shows so little passion about the whole thing. The supporting roles are usually forgotten. <br /> <br /> Disappointing treatment of what might have been an interesting story. More is a pity, because it doesn't even offer the eyecup that promised.
