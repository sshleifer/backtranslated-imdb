I just rented Blackwater Valley Exorcism because the front and pictures look scary and I don't normally watch movies that are automatically released on DVD, but it looks so interesting and scary! I was very much in the mood for a good scary movie and for me it is one of the most scary subjects to watch or learn. Just look at The Exorcist or The Exorcism or Emily Rose, both awesome movies that made breakthroughs, not just horror, but also story. <br /> <br /> Blackwater Valley Exorcism is about a girl, Isabelle, who's got the go is automatically owned so we can't even tell what kind of person she was to start. But a former woman clatter who turned up, priest is on the case with a gardener ...? I know I know. Then they go with several other stories with the priest and Isabella's sister, and the priest hits the sister and knocks off Isabelle? I'm not sure, then we come into a story with Isabelle's father and she questioned his wife's faithfulness to him. <br /> <br /> I mean, the story just goes too many directions and wasn't well developed at all. Not to mention that the exorcism was not authentic at all, and more of a scare just put off your pants from a movie that I didn't like at all, because I couldn't take it seriously. Whoever made it clear and written, has no idea where to go or how to guide the story well, so I wouldn't really recommend it. <br /> <br /> 2/10
