The year still has three weeks to go, but if there isn't a really terrible turkey, Passion Of the Mind can be the winner of my funniest film of the year competition. An interesting idea that is poorly executed. And, for the case, it was hard to do. Demi Moore is very good at curling her lip and smoking cigarettes, but is it all she does? And why so many cigarettes. Ligitt and Myers or one of the other bad boys of nicotine have invested some of their illegal profits in this production. It is confusing, stupid and moving in the transient past of arthritic earthworm. I gave it a 3. Must be a 2! <br /> <br />
