A group of four young men attending a prestigious private school belong to an old covenant formed by their ancestors during the witches' hunting of the late 1600s. They each have a force that matures when they use it and they suspect that a new child can be at the academy of a family who is thought to have died long ago. This new man wants everyone's power for himself. <br /> <br /> It's not a horror movie because it tries to imagine it. Yes, there is magic and all those supernatural things, but it's really just an action movie. A very mediocre action movie. Focus only on cool and smooth and pay only minimal attention to the plot, which has abundant sad unused space for interesting twists. But no one has been submitted and even before the movie is half you will know what is being played and by whom. <br /> <br /> There are a few good scenes here and there, especially an explosive car that magically reconstructs after a heavy vehicle crash, but it's about it. What is worse is that director Renny Harlin, who is a bit entertaining when not talking about clever films, relies heavily on the blast of metal music and too sexy leaders to carry that role and that probably makes it the silliest " horror "movie since the disastrous" Only in the dark. " It's not as bad as 'Alone in the Dark', as the few shiny screens are actually smooth and not ridiculously incompetent, but ultimately the highest thing this movie can hope for is a nice and cozy home on the nightmare. 3/10 <br /> <br /> Valued PG-13: Violent Action
