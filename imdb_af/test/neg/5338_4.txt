Oh yes, I'm really brave with all these generic Japanese horror films about long-haired female ghosts and ghostly kids. "Ghost Train" is no exception. This is clearly influenced by "Ringu", "Ju-On", "Shutter" and "Pulse". Two years ago I was in such modern ghost stories because they usually gave me a few buttons. Unfortunately there is nothing fresh or interesting in 'Ghost Train'. In fact, the movie is really boring. Nana has to investigate a mystery of multiple disappearances, with the help of a youthful conductor and another "lost" child's mother. The movie offers a few slim moments, but the CGI effects are laughable and the climax is illogical. Save it.
