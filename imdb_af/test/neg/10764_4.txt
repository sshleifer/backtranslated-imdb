Back in college I studied marketing and although I missed a lot of lessons and never really paid attention, I will always remember the main and most important principle of marketing, namely: it is not what you sell; this is how you sell it! This principle is fully applicable to "The Devil's Triangle" because it is basically a beautifully dedicated and seductive but empty package. Author / director Richard Winer knew exactly that he should deviate the attention of the viewer from the great inaccuracies. That's why he threw some elements that never fail when it comes to providing a creepy atmosphere like the sinister voice of narrator Vincent Price and the oddball music of King Crimson. And I think Richard Winer's dirty little tricks worked very efficiently, as there was a great Bermuda Triangle hype in the mid-70's and literally every movie production? whether it was an inaccurate documentary or a cunning exploitation step? The subject earned big money at the box office. "The Devil's Triangle" overwhelms you with data that is unstructured and often irrelevant, but the serious dramatization of the facts and of course the intimidating strong voice of almighty Vincent Price generates an atmosphere of anxiety and creepiness. The narrative is constantly bouncing back and forth over time, covering a massive amount of "strange incidents" and "mysterious finishing" of ships and aircraft in the Bermuda triangle over nearly a century, but the reports are all over times extremely vague. and the eloquent Mr. price always ends every chapter with the sinister words "just another unresolved mystery of the devil's triangle ??". After a few cases, the whole formula just laughed and almost pathetic, but I suspect it caused massive mass hysteria in 1974. The documentaries extend a bit more to the most notorious Bermuda triangular mysteries, such as the five military Flight 19 aircraft that inexplicably disappear all at once and the peculiar case of the USS Cyclops vessel, but still remain in these chapters. given a minimum of useful information. The cameras never go underwater to investigate the depths of the Bermuda area, and the testimonies of so-called real-life witnesses seem suspicious like plays. If you are looking for an informative and objective documentary on the Bermuda Triangle, I will definitely not recommend this movie, but if you want to sit and listen to Vincent Price's hypnotic voice for almost a full hour, it's yours chance!
