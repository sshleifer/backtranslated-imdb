I'm not quite sure what to say / think about this movie. It's certainly not the worst in the series (there is still "Halloween 3"). The style is very different and focuses on elements other than its predecessor. It tries to explain why Michael Myers comes out on Halloween and begs. Well, all those things about Michael Myers who were cursed and the evil cult was quite a try, but I didn't buy it. None of the other installments in the series attempted to make any fancy statements. <br /> <br /> The movie contains many gore. Actually, it is plain carnage. If you haven't seen the other Halloween movies, you'll probably have this one for his blood. But for a real Halloween freak, this sequel might just be too different to consider as a good one. Suspension was in terror and massacre (explosive heads ..., you get the point). <br /> <br /> The end (theatrical cut) is simply awful. Michael is stabbed with a needle, then hit with a pipe, then stabbed again, this time with more needles, then defeats a little more until mucus goes out of his head (where did these green things come from?). Actually, it's nothing more than trash 5 million dollars. <br /> <br /> But there was one good thing: Michael's mask! <br /> <br /> Dedicated to Donald Pleasance, quite a shame. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10
