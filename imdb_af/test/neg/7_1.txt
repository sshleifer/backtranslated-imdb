Blake Edwards's legendary fiasco, after a mere 10 minutes, seems senseless. A combination of the eagle has landed, star! What a beautiful war! And Edwards's Pink Panther films, Darling Lili never enter the viewer; the air ranges, the musical numbers, the romance, the comedy and the spy are all high. At what point is the viewer supposed to give a damn? This disaster wavers in tone, never decides what it wants, and apparently it is a spoof, but it is pathetic and sharply square. Old-fashioned in the worst sense, the audiences understandably stay away in herds. It's terrible. James Garner would be a big improvement over Hudson who is just cardboard, and he doesn't contact Andrews and vice versa. And both Andrews and Hudson don't seem to be in the joke and make up the wrong. Blake Edwards's SOB isn't much more than OK, but it's the only good thing ever to come from Darling Lili. The expensive and professional appearance of many of Darling Lili, just make it all lower, even harder to wear. Paramount chief, Robert Evans, quoted "$ 24 million worth of film and no picture".
