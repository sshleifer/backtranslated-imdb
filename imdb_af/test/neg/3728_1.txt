It was without a doubt the worst movie I've ever put. And it says a lot, because I saw my share of terrible movies. <br /> <br /> But I have never seen a movie in which every character depicted was a foolish loser. Seriously there was not one respectful character in the whole writing. How appropriate that the plot was equally paralyzed, with no intelligence whatsoever. <br /> <br /> I can't believe that Keanu Reeves and Cameron Diaz will even give permission to participate in such stupidity. And while I haven't seen their other movies yet, I've enjoyed all their benefits so far. It's not that the act was bad, but the whole story line was moron.
