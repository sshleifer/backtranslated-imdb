It is tempting to see this film as a daring avant-garde experiment. I think the director tried to see if it was possible to take all the conventions of comedy film and produce something that was totally totally indecent. <br /> <br /> The answer to judging by "Van Venus" is a sounding "Yes". It may not be the worst movie I've ever seen, but my brain has suppressed the memory of the other. This horrible movie just hangs on the border: bad enough that the thought still causes pain, but not so bad that my internal sensors have wiped it out of my mind. <br /> <br /> It's hard for me to think what the director and governor thought they did when they made it, or why they went ahead and released it after they made it. I doubt that anyone involved in it has earned much, but surely between them they could have bought enough money to buy all the prints and burn them. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that doesn't recommend anything at all. This. It's not even bad. It's just a non-movie in which nothing interesting happens. I seriously thought about taking it back and claiming my money back. It's not something I've ever done. <br /> <br /> Don't even think about renting (much less buying!) this horrible non-movie!
