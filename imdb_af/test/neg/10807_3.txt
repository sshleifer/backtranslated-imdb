Now I watched it when it first came out on VHS, and all my friends and I thought it was a good movie, but then we were teenagers again. But frankly, not so good from a movie in retrospect. Kind of a hair metal, Dokken version of the Carnival of Souls. But a bad movie doesn't mean it's unshakable; However, this one does not seem to have the charm. Many of the regular Mst3k feeds usually contain. But if it was on cable, and I was bored and drinking beer - sure, I'll see it again. But then again, I watched Howling VII about five times, so maybe you shouldn't really listen to me. <br /> <br /> Someone else thinks it's so sad that the director allegedly made his own comment. Movie? And why did he feel the urge to use so many cap locks?
