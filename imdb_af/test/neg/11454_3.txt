Like many movies from the early days of the sound, Cimarron should be considered more of historical interest than compelling entertainment. The hammie acting leader Richard Dix, nominated for best actor, can be excused as a remnant of the silv movie school of acting. But even the benefits of the doubt, Cimarron is a bad form of drama - an inflated film that moves from unrelated order to unrelated sequence with little dramatic impact. Public, the movie is two hours and four minutes; It feels like four o'clock when you watch it. There is no need to waste your time on it, unless you want to see every Best Picture winner or have a lot of interest in early days. According to me, Cimarron is the worst choice for the best picture in academy history and the award has to go to City Lights or Little Ceasar. Cimarron is barely remembered today, and would be remembered if not for his Oscar victory.
