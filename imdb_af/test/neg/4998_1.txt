So, you saw the Romero movies, yes? And you saw Jacob's Ladder right? And the later Hellraiser movies? Okay, let's make a movie from all three, let's just make everything jam and make a huge mess. It looks like it's a good idea. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. Absolutely god-fearing. Yes, it's an indie flick, who gives a crap? Is it a success to make cinematic feces? The film seeks to establish credibility by focusing on character interaction, so much is clear. Unfortunately, it's not for the authors, it's not good for character interaction. It is not the night of the living dead; The characters are nonentitious shouting their rigid lines on one another, in a vain attempt to get trapped by the microphones on the set. The dialogue is never interesting. For a movie that focuses so much on character interaction, you would think the characters would have something more to say than "WHAT WILL WE DO?" "I don't know." "Well, we did something." Well, what are we going to do? "I don't know." "We must leave." "WE accept us fit." "No, we must leave." "LET ONLY LET." "No, maybe we should stay." <br /> <br / > It's not exaggeration, there are exchanges in this movie that reach that level of redundancy and mischief. <br /> <br /> Half of this is a dream, and it really has zero Nothing in the dream relates to anything in the rest of the movie, the authors couldn't decide whether to make a zombie movie or a monster movie and so they just made both, which is remarkably ridiculous, the cheapest trick in the book and it is maliciously abusive, especially since I am pretty sure they have torn off the idea of ​​Jacob's doctrine. > <br /> And then there is the editing, years of MTV and playing horror-themed games have to inspire the filmmakers, but it is definitely a sad something they didn't realize that made the sounding editing and eclipse in the media first. In this movie you will often be confused and not in the good, David Lynch way, but in the bad "Wait I thought she was just killed, no? And who was hell?" Wait, who is that man? did he come from? how did they come here? kind of way. It is constant and consistently bad. <br /> <br /> This movie is a nice piece of garbage and should only be searched if you want to touch and laugh with some friends. <br /> <br /> And as a final note: as for the "comedy" that people talk about in other reviews, it's all unintentional. There isn't a single deliberate piece of comedy in this movie. It's all supposed to be a big serious character study, because the filmmakers want credibility in their horror concept. Unfortunately, their predictions do not match their ability.
