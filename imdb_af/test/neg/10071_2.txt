Did people expect "Jurassic Park 3" to be full of surprises? Not one moment is worth it. Many elements can easily frighten people out of the movie ... and it's not the dinos! Tee Leoni ... I think she's a great actress, but it's a pity to say she's reached the bottom line this time. I wonder if she had a vocal cord while shooting the movie. Laura Dern ... she's ok, but why not be more noticeable in the movie, maybe smart dialogue with Sam Neil. Alessandro Nivola - "Have you ever heard of something called facial expression? Fells, emotions ...". He must work harder on it! Sam Neil, no big problem. The soundtrack ... needs to change that record, or you get tired of it. My applause goes to William H. Macy, a talented actor I've never seen before, playing a bad role. Unfortunately, he can't save the movie, nor the good computer-based dinosaurs.
