Apparently, episodes of the Gangbusters television show on the big screen are repeated. While it was frequently done in the 50's and 60's because people didn't have a TV or a color television and producers wanted a bigger return on their investment (big-screen sales or if resold to the small screen of a series that not in syndication), the results were usually less than the sum of their parts. The only time I ever saw it was where multi-parties were composed (Ala Rocky Jones or Man From Uncle) or in the case of horror anthology (The Veil and 13 Demon Street). Here's the effect of cutting stories from American criminals in the 20's and 30's (Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, Bonnie and Clyde, etc.) as a narrator talking about how the FBI was looking for them. This is a strange fusion that doesn't really work because it's clear there are things here that don't belong together. More than once I looked at the TV strangely because things didn't look right. In fairness I will not describe the cheapness of production as it was what early TV (and the series) was. It's not bad, but it's not very good either. To be honest, the episodes of the series I saw are better than one episode we didn't expect so much. Given the choice, I rent DVDs from the show instead of this movie.
