New Year 2006, and I look at Glimmer Man again. Say what you want, I find Steven Seagal's movies amusing. Like many comments, good fighting order. I especially liked his answer on the phone at the restaurant and said how long it would be for recovery. A bit like Schwarzenegger's humor in previous action films - although it tended to be self-defeating. <br /> <br /> But the one I like here is Brian Cox. One of the most versatile actors around. Sorry for his hand and foot, but so much to prevent him from having an extensive interrogation - had to flee that class to the "farm". <br /> <br /> While the movies were going on, I was just wondering how the ever thicket of Seagal affected his movement? Never mind, it's fun!
