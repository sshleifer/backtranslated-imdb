It's going to be my first review on IMDb and I'm glad the default rating is 1 out of 10, because then I don't have to change anything. <br /> <br /> First, there are terrible movies. Movies you can laugh out of, such as Island City, Battlefield Earth or Conan The Destroyer. It is quite acceptable. They make a big party increase. Then there's the worst movie ever. I can't believe how crappy this doggy dog ​​was. <br /> <br /> I found it on a second-hand VHS store and bought it quickly because I like sci-fi, Terminator, post-apocalypse and stuff like that. Everything on the boxing art was very promising. Then I quickly loaded the tape when I got home and the first thing I noticed was ... WHAT? There might have been 10 minutes (or more) to switch between the current cuts and flashbacks in a very annoying blue effect, with sounds dropping you. And it just goes over and over. Then some "acting" kicks in and you wonder why you've ever been born in a world where this horror of man actually exists ... And then I realized there were actually two incidents. I didn't even think about it, but the title says "3" in it ... And I was shocked. But as I actually see it in great pain and anxiety it to the end, I thought nothing could ever make me worse about myself and this universe. But then a small text ... ... NEMESIS 4?!?!?! NO NO NO NOW !!!!!!!!
