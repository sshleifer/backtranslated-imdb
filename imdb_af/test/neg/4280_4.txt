As an avid Disney fan, I was not quite impressed with this movie, probably not enough motivated to catch it in the theaters. However, I am so glad I caught it on DVD and watched the special features. <br /> <br /> You MUST watch the "Moose Comment": the whole movie can be seen with comments from Rutt and Tuke, the comic relief moose of the story, spoken by Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas. Two veterans of the famous Second City comedy ad-lib character - for an hour and a half about a movie they are clearly showing. I laughed all the time. The pleasure I got from these comments made up for the low response I had on the film itself. Do yourself a favor and listen to it!
