Emraan Hashmi post MURDER played a good role in Bhatt's films, but another director only used his kiss and naughty image. <br /> <br /> AKSAR is one of them and it came to AAA, JAWANI DIWANI in a row and I was He had been so excited and so roles. <br /> <br /> The movie has a good turn at the beginning. I felt like an Abbas Mustan movie, but then it becomes a routine movie with sudden love, sudden jealousy and a bad climax <br /> <br /> Anant Mahadevan makes a horrible movie. Music is saving. Camera work is fantastic. Emran Hashmi just repeats his act of his previous films and has 2 expressions throughout Dino looking stiff, speaking as if practicing Hindi and doing good in some scenes, Udita is expressionless and annoyed
