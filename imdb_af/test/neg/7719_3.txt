I can't tell how lazy the director is with this movie. Instead of creatively acting, he relies on boring zombie clich√©s. <br /> <br /> Where the two unarmed leaders have to take the college steps in the bus, he surrounds them with zombies, but none of the clues. is bitten. He can't be bothered to manage a decent battle scene, so we see the leaders getting off the road. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the zombies hang around and at others they run like the wind. It is really convenient for the director because he can create something he wants without saving the continuity of the zombies. <br /> <br /> With prudent planning and more inspiration, this movie could have been so much better. .
