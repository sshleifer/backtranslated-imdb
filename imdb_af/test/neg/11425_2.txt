A spectacular venture proposes Welsh to be a baby, drawn helplessly to the violent environment he knows best, but is unable to withstand turbulent effects rooted in banal fantasy. The first story is a ham-fisted, meaningless trudge with a B-movie sci-fi premise. The second achieved a little poignancy, but only through the indignant remnant of humiliation visited on its central character. The third and most striking one seems to be an elusive successor to Child's Play. The direction is consistently clueless - all the sound and anger, a slave to the extreme discomfort of the environment; suffocated in a poorly chosen music score and in indifferent flashing acting. It is pure folly as a guerilla sensibility - as arbitrary and hollow as the abstract images that connect the three divisions.
