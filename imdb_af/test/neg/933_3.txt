I watched this early on a Friday, midnight while working at the home computer, relaxing a bit after a busy week and cleaning some files and answering some communication. I interrupted a few times, so I have trouble getting all the details straight (although it's almost a work of Hitchcock relationships, where a detail can be missing throughout the story), and besides, it wasn't Exactly a "surprising" piece of work. <br /> <br /> So during a commercial read the only previous comment here (by "mgconlan-1"), and pretty much can agree with its details. <br /> <br /> Not quite in the category of a movie so horrible it is fascinating "good" but I would like to take a tape when I run again (rather than see it), so I can move forward and see the parts I missed this first time. <br /> <br /> Give it a "3 *" due to the attractiveness of the four primary characters.
