A quick summary: Almost non-existent, poorly chosen musical soundtrack, constant camera filming without the steady, but with plenty of coffee and a hyperactive cameraman, NO plot, and nothing really happens. The film goes from one dialogue to another, sounds hollow and never reaches depth, and never creates the illusion that you're really into a cobweb of conspiracy. The all-in-one affair with everyone is just a boring excuse to show the main actress in pretty underwear. (which in combination with her rusty voice is definitely nice, but nothing to make a movie). The high point for me is the opening scene and the movie just broke down to a point where I just wanted to stop the movie for minutes in the story. I'm sorry to put it out.
