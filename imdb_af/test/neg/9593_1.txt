Download my ass, but probably because I'm stoned. It is aside. It is by no means a horror movie. There is no horror whatsoever in this whole movie and the plot holes are so big that even a below average IQ person would think it was stupid. In addition, I live in Denmark and have been for my entire life and can ensure that Denmark is too small a country where you need GPS and maps to find your way back if you get lost. I would estimate that unless you really made an effort, you could never be out of town or other people for a maximum of 3 hours on foot. Secondly, I don't think any part of the movie, except two shots from Copenhagen where none of the actors were in, was actually packed in Denmark. The wet woman does not speak Swedish to Danish. The helmet on the first swamp is brand new. The girl who gets them in the woods goes under a kind of rock that doesn't exist in Denmark. This is not stupid.
