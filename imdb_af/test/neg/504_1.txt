The director spent a lot of time making the screens really right up to the historical pictures and all the sounds of the old western crowds. Manufacturers and writer / director, Michael Cimino, have gone bad about any of the historical facts about which the Johnson County War really went. Much of the war was over how public land had to be used for grazing. The kittens did not want the poor shepherds on the land to compete in the cold, wind-blown plateau for animal feed. The whole epic does not mention grazing sheep which were one of the main reasons for the war. <br /> <br /> The worst scene is the battle between the farmers and the hired killers. The farmers are shown to circle the armed men as many Indians would do in many Hollywood movies. The real fact is that Johnson County Sheriff William (Red) Angus, with a 200 to 300 men's post, intercepted the armed men and caught them in a barn at the TA estate. I doubt if any women participated in the siege. <br /> <br /> Ellen (Ella also known as Bees Kate) Watson and her second husband, James Averell, were hanged by a lynch gang over three years before the Johnson County invasion. Ella was never a prostitute. It was a canard distributed by the Wyoming Stock Growers Association (WSGA) to discredit her. The fact that the plot constitutes her to be a brothel is crazy, and only serves the interests of the WSGA. <br /> <br /> I object to the use of names of real people in a plot that is so clearly fiction. There is no fact in the events, timelines or backgrounds of the characters. Why Michael Cimino would use real names of people who fly flyhalf with the Johnson County War (and events arising from it) outside of me. <br /> <br /> The movie could have been much more interesting if it was resident Over the political consequences of the federal government's intervention in a state government's affairs and what happened to the WSGA armed warriors, saved. There have been some attempts to prosecute the Cattlemen who were responsible for the Johnson County lawyer. But as Johnson County could not afford the court fees and Wyoming governor, Amos W. Barber, supported the WSGA, the charges were eventually dropped. <br /> Overall, I think the movie was just an excuse to show. Isabelle Huppert is naked for many of the three and three / four hour running time on the DVD version.
