To even say that this movie Sebastien's work is at its best, just tell you everything you need to know about the man. Sebastien is a pathetic, foolish, at best, but quite popular host on French television. Looking at any of his performances, it's just a torture for a man who is usually composed, and his first (hopefully hopeful) movie is even the worst. Sebastien's excuse for rape (the victim falls in love with her aggressor) is not just wrong, but clearly unacceptable. I strongly urge you not to look at this picture (or any of Sebastien's future features), you will just lose your time ... There is something about French television that does not smell right ... and it is Patrick Sebastien !!!
