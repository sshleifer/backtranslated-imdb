The Concorde ... Airport '79 starts in Washington where a man named Carl Parker (Macon (McCalman) contacts high-profile TV news reporter Maggie Whelan (Susan Blakely) to surrender secret documents proving his boss Kevin Harriosn (Robert Wagner) owner and president of Harrison Industries who developed weapons for the army, illegally sold the weapons overseas, Maggie saw Carl murder and escaped scarcely with her life, Maggie was caught the Concorde to Moscow from Paris the next morning "The intention is to blow the whistle on Harrison, which is also her boyfriend who will destroy him. It is set to save himself. He reprograms his hi-tech" Buzzard "homing missile to intercept the Concorde during a test drive and and destroy the documented evidence ... <br /> <br /> Renamed Airport '80 - The Concorde for its cinema and initial home releases, as it was released here in 1980, rather than 1979 this latest entry ng in the airport franchise was directed by David Lowell Rich and is a notorious bad movie that apparently laughed at the test and test shows that Universal asked to promote the film as an action comedy. The first thing to say is that The Concorde ... Airport 79 is a very dim and straight film, but on a pure entertainment ground I can think of many worse movies watching 108 minutes to watch, I really can. I really like the absurd plot about a rich industrialist who wants to kill his girlfriend TV reporter before she can uncover him as an illegal dealer, but this man doesn't do subtly and decides the best way to do this is to concorde blow up with its own guided missile and then get a Fuch fighter pilot to try to shoot it before it finally sabotages. So there are three mini-crash planes in the one as every time super pilot Joe Patroni can save the day. You know Joe Patroni played by George Kennedy appears in all four airport movies and goes from the mechanic in the first to Concorde pilot extrodine here, and I think he's a little jinx, as he was involved in four major aviation disasters in nine years . I think the real reason why the Airport series stopped here was because Patroni retires and the jinx has been lifted. Some of the things that are happening here are just stupid, Patroni does rolls, flies upside down and out of the maneuver is a guided missile in a big Concorde not to mention that he is landing the accident and burning firearms from his destroy missile. while keeping a calm head. This man is good, very good. Then there is the character, there is a saxophone playing a black man smoking in the toilets, an old woman with a bladder problem and a team of Russian gymnasts with poor accent. Also, despite being almost shot off with a missile and then being attacked by a Jet fighter, Concorde's passengers did not seem to have bothered to come back and return the next day. I don't know about you, but after that I'll probably find a safer way to travel and why don't the police or authorities ask anyone? Why did the Concorde captain, Patroni, allow only a French prostitute to go and sleep? The Concorde ... Airport '79 is definitely not boring and is full of unforgettable moments and I am entertained in a way, even though it is far from a good movie and modern audiences, it should not have patience, hell I liked it It was in a dull way, but it is not kind of classic. <br /> <br /> Although Concorde is no longer flying, it is quite a cool search airplane. There are lots of footage here, one in The Concorde ... Airport 79 was the seventh one building. These Concorde were also the same aircraft that crashed after a tire bust caused a fuel tank to break and the leaking fuel set on fire on July 25, 2000, while taking it down in Paris. This resulted in 109 passengers and crew on board and 4 people killed. on the ground. When it was broadcast on TV in the United States in 1982, nearly twenty minutes were included in most footage, even though it was no more than two years after the original production was finalized. I know the effects come from most, but I don't think they are too bad. If you think it was made in the late 70's, I think they are very good. The camera moves during effect shots. Real-world imagery of real aircraft is rather used as toy models that, in my opinion, looked much worse and I could definitely see what the manufacturers were trying for with limited funds and limited technology. In a strange way, they are very impressive, actually without ever watching as well as you know what I mean. Probably the most action of all the airport movies are missiles, explosive planes, daring crash landings, murder and a man named Robert Palmer (no, not the singer) who gives a woman a jacuzzi. <br /> <br /> The IMDb says it has a budget of about $ 14 million which is actually more than I thought. Perhaps the special effects aren't that impressive. Shot in Utah, Washington, Los Angeles and France. The acting is not good here, people do not seem worried enough that they will die. George Kennedy gets bad one-liners while Robert Wagner plays the bad man. <br /> <br /> The Concorde ... Airport79 is everywhere for the bad movie enthusiasts, and to be honest, I rather look at this entertaining mess of a movie than a few hours Oscar-nominated drill.
