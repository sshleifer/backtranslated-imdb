This movie was a strange viewing experience. The movie is, of course, based on a play. Now I'm sure everything in this movie works just fine in a play, but for a movie it doesn't really look interesting enough to watch. The movie is too stagey and they have not even bothered to change some of the dialogue to make it more suitable for a movie. Instead, what is now being offered is a virtually literal replay of a stage play, with over-the-top characters and advanced dialogue. For this reason, the storyline doesn't really matter and the movie becomes an almost complete drill and outdated viewing experience. <br /> <br /> It takes a while before you find out that it's a comedy you're watching. Initially you think it's a drama you see, with impressive characters in it, but as the movie progresses, you'll see that the movie is more of a tragicomedy, which lends itself more to the comedy genre, rather than the drama genre. br /> <br /> The characters and dialogue are really the things that make this movie a peculiar and over-the-point that sometimes becomes unwavering. Sure, the actors are wonderful; Peter O'Toole and Susannah York, among others, but don't really raise the film to a level of 'watchable enough'. <br /> <br /> The story feels totally disoriented. Basicaly's story is about nothing and focuses mainly on the brother / sister characters played by Peter O'Toole and Susannah York. But what about the story? The movie feels like a useless and outdated one that offers very little. As I said before; I'm sure the story is good and interesting to watch on stage, but as a movie it's really not appropriate and simply doesn't work out. <br /> <br /> Editing is simply awful and times and it even laughs badly in certain sequences. <br /> <br /> More was to be expected from director J. Lee Thompson, who apparently did much better movies than it had previously failed, to step up screen-to-project, project. <br /> <br /> Not really worth your time. <br /> <br /> 4/10
