If you decide to watch Wild Rebels, don't expect anything deep and meaningful. Looking for a movie exploring the relationships and structure of a motorcycle gang, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. If you are looking for an exposure to the exposition of the American education system and the problem of juvenile delinquency, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. If you're looking for a movie exploring how subordinate rural police departments are a well-funded, well-organized gang, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. But if you are looking for an absurd movie filled with scene after the scene of unintentional humor, horrible plays, a paper-thin plot and production theater style, Wild Rebels is the real movie. <br /> <br /> Wild Rebels is the story of a lower-on-luck driver, Rod Tillman (Steve Alaimo). After a fierce accident (which Rod has been completely uncircumcised, despite having only cotton pants and a London Fog style jacket to protect), Rod decides to give it up. With no plan for his future, except for wandering unnecessarily through the back roads of the South, he stumbles upon Satan's Angels motorcycle gang (a gang that is three of the stupid guys ever to wear a leather jacket and a woman pack what they look like). This group of hoodlums spend their time terrorizing a rural town in Florida by committing such atrocities as stealing a newspaper from a neighbor's mailbox. These bumbling idiots need someone to act as a manager during some major crimes they have planned. Apparently, these three Einsteins can only drive vehicles with two tires, not four. So they recruit Rod to venture out that only an experienced stunt driver will be able to keep the car in the middle of a gravel road at a low speed chase. Eventually they keep a bank, chase the aforementioned low speed, and have the lamest rifle with the police ever on the film. I can last forever, but you get the idea. <br /> <br /> I hate the term "so bad it is good", but it seems as if Wild Rebels are appropriately described.
