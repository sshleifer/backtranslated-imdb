Wretched. Talk about botched. OUTSIDE THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE is bad in all respects. Rescuers Michael Caine and Karl Malden decide to drag the wreck of the eponymous ocean liner with a very creaking tug. They are challenged by ruthless Telly Savalas and his gang of machine gun. This part continues, part remake has Caine, Malden and another group of Poseidon survivors who are a similarly dangerous draw from the sinking ship. Under this group are Shirley Jones, Slim Pickens, Peter Boyle, Shirley Knight and Slim Pickens. Jack Warden plays a blind man. Certainly, you would wish you were blind after seeing this mess. Sally Field is particularly annoying as a place to stay on board Caine's tug. <br /> <br /> Disaster Master Irwin Allen not only produced this one, but he also decided to manage it.
