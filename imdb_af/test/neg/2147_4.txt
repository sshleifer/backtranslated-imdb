I don't know which one was released for the first time in 1970. Cannon for Cordoba is a "Europen Western" It's made in Spain. That means it's pretty inferior to Sergio Leone's so-called #Western Spaghetti and the Real American Masterpieces of John Ford, Sam Peckinpah, Howard Hugues, John Sturges and Anthony Mann, in my order of merit. This command should not be interpreted as all John Ford westerns are better than Sam Peckipahn's all. I think IMDb's 100 Sort them all well. <br /> <br /> The worse thing about this firm is the Casting. George Peppard is fit for a sergeant's role, Raff Valone for a "Maffia Capo" and Giovanna Ralli for a "puttana" in "Piazza Vennezia" in Rome in the sixties.
