I saw "professional" reviews and claimed Julia Roberts was playing herself "smart and very funny". I do not think so. An actress plays herself? And does it do with her the same ordinary dizziness when she tries comedy? Talk about Hollyweird narcissism at its extreme. Why is she not just going there and going, "I, I, I. Look at me!". The director and writer should be shot not to think of anything better, then it is in what a beautiful sequel could have been. And incidentally, Steven, when the audience starts paying more attention to the strange camera angles, then the story has a problem. Capra, Hitchcock, all used some creative cameras, but they were talented enough not to lose the audience in them or just to show the camera. You seem to have forgotten a cardinal rule of movie processing in the name of 'style'. However, the Pitt and Zeta Jones chemistry is pretty good, maybe if they made the movie more focused and rejected narcissism, it could have worked. Zeta Jones shows how she has more talent and beauty than Roberts can dream. Unfortunately, this movie wastes talent and fails on many accounts. I want my money back.
