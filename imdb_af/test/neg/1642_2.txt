I mean, you just have to keep the Italian movie industry. Someone was performing with a Road Warrior and the Italians were doing one rip-off for many years. Then another acted with a successful barbaric film ("Conan") and the Italians were seeing ... see above. <br /> <br /> In addition to many other variations of the theme (one of my favorites is Umberto Lenzi's "The Barbarians" with Paul's twins), the Ator series created. And this, the second one, is probably the worst (or best, depending on your point of view). <br /> <br /> Ator is recalled by his old teacher, who discovered a kind of nuclear power. It must of course be protected so that it will not come into the wrong hands. The old man sent his daughter to Ator, and after a few complications, Ator, his sidekick Tong and the girl returned to the castle, which in the meantime had fallen to some criminal (of course, an old Ator classmate). Somewhere along the way, forgetting the heroic trio of the plot and wiping out a giant snake-worshiping cult for its pleasure (not before some virgins are sacrificed). Just in time before the madman eventually loses his temper and kills the wise teacher, our heroes remember their duties, they think of hang gliding and grenades and save the day. <br /> <br /> Included: terribly perceptive by all participants (especially O'Keeffe), incredibly hilarious "special effects" (just adoring the snake battle scene, which must be a "bride of the monster") , bad stage battle scenes, many continuity errors (Ator flies two different hang gliders during the climate fight, watch it, just an example) and an overall non-understanding of the concept of history (cavemen, "civilized" barbarians, castle builders, all in one thrown movie). <br /> <br /> If you, like me, are devoted to bad movies, this is one of the series to watch, you will probably end up with ROTFL. For the records: the Malta-filmed third part is actually quite viewable. <br /> <br /> Considering Joe D'Amato's other efforts, it's probably his most entertaining movie, as he certainly couldn't deliver watchable horror or erotic movies. . But I think it was completely accidental. <br /> <br />
