The original story had all the ingredients to make a thorough film. But failed in this version because even Cherie Lunghi was a pale imitation of what she needed to be - so much so that I suspect she should be an accomplice until the end of the case. Sherlock Holmes turned into a fighter who was completely different from anything proposed by Sir Arthur Conn Doyle? In fact, it was Doctor Watson who showed what was common sense. The shoe cap of the Andoman Islands looks as if he couldn't fight out of a paper bag and what the villain was doing tea in Baker Street for a denouement was beyond anything the old Scottish garden could ever have had. Please send this TV Movie to their Black Museum please.
