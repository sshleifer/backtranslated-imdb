This movie is just as bad as it gets. If you also want logic (or lack thereof) of the National Treasure and bad acting, then it can be a movie for you. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, spend your time in the sun and your money on a beer. <br /> <br /> In fact, it looks like a badly promoted promo or demo picture to promote the people involved (e.g., actors, special effects, etc.). Unfortunately, they produce very bad exposure to their lack of talent. <br /> <br /> In such a case, the film company must be ordered to repay money to customers who are not satisfied with the product. <br /> <br /> It's really common.
