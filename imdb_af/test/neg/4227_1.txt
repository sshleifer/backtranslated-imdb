Although this movie has a slow, dream-like, almost astounding fit, and an interesting, but not entirely accurate, description of a rural French constable's criminal investigation practices and staff, I find it impossible to recommend. I think this movie is just an essay to promote one person - the director's, one supposed - aversion to heterosexuality. Surely human sexuality in all its forms can have their rebellious moments, without denying it! But choosing the bad one at the expense of good, which shows this movie every turn, is a twisted sensibility at work. In short, if you like to see gay eroticism, compassion, and the depiction of heterosexual love and the feminine form in a horrible and humiliating light - then this movie is for you. I don't, and it wasn't.
