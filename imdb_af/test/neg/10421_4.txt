What about the French? First, they (like) like Jerry Lewis much more than the US. Second, they look as if Edgar Allan Poe's work is more than just someone else. It must be the "Beaudelaire effect". <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong ... I'm a Poe fan myself. But this trilogy manages to make three of Poe's below average stories. Well, I don't know what they're done about. <br /> <br /> "Toby Dammit" is a fine Fellini movie, but it has nothing to do with Poe's story, at least in terms of theme. This is enjoyable during the first viewing. Terence Stamp does a good job with an interesting role. However, it has nothing to do with Poe or the spirits of the dead. <br /> <br /> "Metzergenstein" is a big mess. How did Vadim's films produce? It's just awful ... not even amateur movie school standards. Depending on the DVD menu you have, try to skip it and save your time. <br /> <br /> "William Wilson" is actually the segment most faithful to Poe's work. However, it doesn't have much style, though it includes the strangest snowball fight, I think I've ever seen on film. (It looks like the boys are throwing tissues, or maybe hand-rolled up balls.) <br /> <br /> My advice is to skip "Metzergenstein", "William Wilson" and then if you are A Fellini fan (I am not) likes "Toby Dammit" while cooking dinner or making a snack.
