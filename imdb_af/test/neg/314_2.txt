Jack-O (1995) was a very bad movie, we talk snoozefest x 100, no entertainment value whatsoever, no budget, no gore, Z-grade actors and so on. This movie was a terrible addition to the horror- It's not made !!! The only reason I bought this movie was because I knew Linnea Quigley was in it, and sure enough, she did her compulsory nude act, which is lovely yes. <br /> <br /> But as for the movie itself ... ...... I fell asleep in the 40-minute stage and had nothing to do with it, it's just bigtime. OK, I love horror movies, I'm a keen fan, a MASSIVE fan, I love low budget horrors, I love everything, but I hated this rubbish. I think it'll tell you everything you need to know about JACK-O. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 2/10, the "2" is for the 2 minutes Linnea shower scene, the movie itself is a totally NEW !!!!
