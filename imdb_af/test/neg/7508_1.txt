Now, I'm a big fan of Zombie movies. I admit that zombie movies are usually not so good, but I really like them. Despite the crappy-acting and worthless dialogues that appear in almost all Zombie movies, this one is by far the worst. Look, there are some ground rules with zombie movies. 1. Zombies are suicide. Tactics are rarely used, and they never do like a boxer. They do not dodge the head, they take it with an ugly smile. They don't try to hit you, they grab your arm and bite it! 2. Zombies can't talk. Just dead in evil. Otherwise they do not speak. 3. You don't fight zombies with melee-armed weapons. You lose in a melee battle against the zombies. Firearms are used. In this movie, however, melee is the way to go, which is wrong. Very wrong. <br /> <br /> It had NO redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a Zombie movie, see one with an average score higher than 3 on IMDb.com
