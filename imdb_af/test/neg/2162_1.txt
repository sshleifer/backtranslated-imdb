I gave this movie by my uncle who got it for free with a DVD magazine. It's easy to see why he wanted to get rid of it. Now I understand that it's a B-movie and that it doesn't have the same size budget as bigger movies, but surely they could have spent their money in a better way than making this garbage. There are some pretty good performances, namely Jack, Beth and Hawks, but others are ridiculously bad (such as droid). This movie also features the worst battle scene I've ever seen. The amount of nudity in the movie sometimes made it look more like a porn movie than a Sci-Fi movie. <br /> <br /> In conclusion - Awful movie
