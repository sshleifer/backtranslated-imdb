We watched this movie almost impossible to watch. With such a superdish, it is a pity that the writing and direction were so terrible. The terrible rate at which the story was told was crazy. The flashback was awkward. The characters were one-dimensional. The heavy-handed metaphors - the river, the cat - are repeated too often. <br /> <br /> The movie Nobody's Fool, based on another novel by Russo, was infinitely better, probably because it was written and directed. <br /> <br /> Photography in Empire Falls was great. Bad it wasn't a travel book. <br /> <br /> I read the novel and enjoyed the writing style, but I have some doubts about the novel itself. I would give the novel 4 out of 5 stars. Perhaps the screenwriters and directors were so upset about the novel's reputation that they felt they had to include every thing in their movie. It was supposed to be a television movie, guys, not Books on Tape.
