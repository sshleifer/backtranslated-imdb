I had high hopes for this one until they changed their name to 'The Shepherd: Border Patrol, the fun movie name ever, which was wrong with just' The Shepherd '. It is an on-the-action movie that shows its hat to many classic Van Damme movies. There is a nice bit of action in a bar that reminds me of hard target and universal soldier, but aimed at no intensity or flair that is unfortunate. There is one big rule about being drunk and wearing a rabbit, and dropping some OK action scenes through the cheapest of all. Many of the times do not match the dialogue with the characters' mouths, and the stuntmen die a split second before even being shot. The final is one of the better Van Damme battles, except that the director tries to go a little with John Woo and also fails to flash back what nobody really cares about, just in the way of the whole point of action. n van Damme is film. <br /> <br /> Not good, not bad, just average generic action.
