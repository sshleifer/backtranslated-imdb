This film is one of the worst adaptations of Pride and Prejudice ever filmed and if Jane Austen was alive, she would demand that her name be removed from the movie. Austen's novel is only superficially a story of the development of true love between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. It is also a commentary on the class structure of Regency Britain. This film focuses only on the love story, through which viewers are disappointing who hope it will justify the novel. <br /> <br /> There are many problems with the historical accuracy of the movie. In the film, the dance against which Darcy is snubs Elizabeth is not the refined dance performed by the genre, to which the Bennet, Lucas, Bingley and Darcy families belong, but rather the dance of the lower classes. The gentry would not have danced as if they were dancing at a peasant school. There are also costume and hair problems. The use of the period required married women to wear white cloth hats to cover their hair and for women to wear bonnets when outside. Regency women were not liberated to leave the subscription fees publicly. The worst historical inaccuracy is the early morning meeting of Elizabeth (in her nightdress and dress) and Mr. Darcy (sans cravat and vest) recognizing their love for each other. This is an unforgiving freedom with the novel. No respectable young woman or gentleman would venture into such a condition in such an early hour to meet or meet someone of the opposite sex. <br /> <br /> But the worst of all with this movie is the lack of Austen's dialogue and the horrific modern dialogue. Austen's dialogue needs no help from a writer who thinks he / she can write like Austen. The writer of the non-Austen dialogue has not only Austen's talent, but also no sense of Austen's style. The compilation of the two styles stamp. <br /> <br /> As far as acting is concerned, it is best done by Judi Dench, who clearly understands the aristocracy's imperfection. Brenda Blethyn takes some freedoms around Mrs. Bennet is less terrible than Austen's portrayal. Her portrayal is interesting and seems to work. Donald Sutherland is unsuccessful. His affected British accent is terrible and he describes Mr. Bennet too much as a father of the 20th century and not a father of the late 18th century. Matthew MacFadeyn's depiction of Darcy is flat. I can't imagine anyone falling in love with his mr. Darcy not. Keira Knightly is a beautiful Elizabeth, but her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet is far too modern. Knight focuses on Elizabeth's sincerity, but her depiction is not completely lacking in the social mores and conventions of the time. She would have done well to really read the novel before trying to portray Elizabeth and doing research on the behavior of women of the period. <br /> <br /> If one makes a movie, one must be faithful to the period. This movie needs a historical advisor who actually knows something about the Regency period. It also needs a writer who has a better appreciation and understanding of Austen's text. I can only hope Emma Thompson decides to make a film of pride and prejudice in the near future to erase this horror from our minds. <br /> <br /> The best thing to say about this movie is that it contains many scenes from the English countryside. Chatsworth is well used as Pemberly (as it was in the 1995 BBC update). But beautiful scenery and beautiful actors can't save this movie. True fans of Austen will rush their home to watch their DVDs of the far superior 1995 production with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth or read Austen's text to clear this version of their minds.
