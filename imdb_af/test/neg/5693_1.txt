Today I had a real craving for a sci-fi movie and so I decided to check out Battlespace. Unfortunately, this was one of my biggest mistakes this year. <br /> <br /> I see that director, Neil Johnson, managed over 500 music videos, and I suggest he goes back. Music videos are a perfect form of entertainment, and not everyone can make it movie. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie is probably the voice over. And it says a lot, because the special effects are sometimes frightening. Voice over didn't work in Blade Runner, and it doesn't work here. The first hour or so is spent walking the main character through the desert, while her daughter tells the story. I think the story could have made a good movie, but not so. <br /> <br /> The second worst part is the effects. They are simply bad and they do not mix in the rest of the picture, so you simply do not believe in them. And absolutely all the frames in the movie are filtered, and not in a good way. Filtering as an effect is good. 90 minutes of it, bad. <br /> <br /> And what about all the gadgets that talk all the time, and don't stop!?!? If I used technology like that, I'd be angry. I just waited for the guns to blow out, "I'm terribly sorry, but I seem to have ammunition." No, stay away. This movie is just not worth the time.
