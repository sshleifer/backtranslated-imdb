I remember this movie with feelings of pure. . . anxiety. More than half of the film is advertising (no, really!). The slight excuse for a story can easily be told in 25 minutes (and almost!) The end result is a pre-fabricated love story of predictable schlock, which is all apparently thrown into an awkward commercial effort for some more money from the hit contemporary Debbie Boone. Yes, this is how fast it is produced. The song "inspired" was still big on the cards when the movie was released. <br /> <br /> Despite decades of bad movies, I'm still impressed for his exorbitant, non-disturbed, head-length jumping in the most boring, absurd and indelible cinematic bad. It really deserves to be on the IMDb list of the 100 worst of all time, and never left the top 3 on my personal "worst" list. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the mere masochistic excitement!
