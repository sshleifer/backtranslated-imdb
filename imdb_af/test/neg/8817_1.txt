(This review does not necessarily reflect the plot of the movie, but it can change your movie expectations and therefore a less enjoyable experience.) <br /> <br /> Have ever rented a scary movie that expecting to be up The edge of your seat in fear, and instead crying in the laughter at every blunt turn of the plot? This movie has so many possibilities to impress and scare the viewer. It was badly cut and jumped too much; References to the past seem more than excuses as to why the plot was heading in its specific direction. The writers should not have thought about how to perform the potentially excellent plot, because the poor construction of time throughout the plot is daunting to the viewer and makes the movie increasingly tired of watching. <br /> <br /> Almost worse than the writers abused, which could have been an excellent and classic thriller, was the fact that it relied on cheap tactics for a fright. The play didn't make it terrifying, and the situations barely made it, and so it needed some dark scenes with things coming out to make it worthwhile. Even those who were predictable. <br /> <br /> Not even the gore could have saved the plot, but on the other hand, the success of the successful thriller Se7en. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Se7en, I feel like Saw has tried to follow Se7en's incredibly fascinating psychological theme, but failed to do so. I was terribly disappointed in the lack of analysis and plot structure around the killer's psychologist. The beginners plague the viewer to think it is a psychological thriller; Believe me, this is far from that. <br /> <br /> Did I mention poor acting? First, Cary Elwes looks a convincing performance; However, it is totally weakening on the main parts of the plot. I laughed at this show, which is worth a Razzie. The performances of Leigh Whannell are also terrible and playable, though not as bad as the performances by Elwes, and the big red flag is that Whannell is also a writer for the movie. <br /> <br /> The end of Saw can never make him lose all of it, and that makes it a great failure. It was an event wasted, and I have no idea why Monica Potter and Danny Glover prefer to take roles in this movie. <br /> <br /> I am angry with myself for wasting money just for renting it. It was definitely not worth the $ 4, and in the future I would definitely avoid seeing anything with Elwes, Whannell or James Wan. The big tragedy in this is not that it lacks the foundation, that is, the big potential storyline has been discarded and that poor acting has caused the insult to injury. I will avoid and only deduce the poor words that relate to the title: do not see this movie.
