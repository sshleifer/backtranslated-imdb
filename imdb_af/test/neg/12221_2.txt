It doesn't matter much to me, it also seems to be confronted with a documentary. The filmmakers also looked at me in certain characters, yet I was totally unsympathetic to the main character because they chose to show me about him. <br /> <br /> This movie disappointed me because the story and the people were interesting, but the movie became flat because of funny editing that the viewer didn't have enough time to understand each scene. The developments in the story were pointed out instead of showing the men in boxers or other things related to the story they were telling. <br /> <br /> I recommend hitting this one and just reading this story.
