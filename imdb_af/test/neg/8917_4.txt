Today you were the 4th Seagal movie in a mini marathon I just kept. Wow, I don't know where to start. He looks as though his lines are getting more and more bumpy as time goes on, and the scenes between Seagal and Treach where it seems to improve are embarrassing. And what does his girlfriend's dreams have to do with anything else in the plot? I can't recommend it, but the strongest Seagal fan, and even better off with his previous work. Of the 4 movies in my marathon (Submerged, Into the Sun, Foreigner and Today You Die) today were the worst. A previous reviewer mentioned it, but the use of stock was pretty obvious.
