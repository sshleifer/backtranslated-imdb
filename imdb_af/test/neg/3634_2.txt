I saw about five or six episodes of this stupid show, and most of them I was forced to watch. And I didn't like the episodes I saw. What happened to Dan Schneider? After giving such wonderful programs like Drake and Josh, why did he decide to create a stupid show like this? My problem is not just with Dan, it's also with the guys who nominated this show for an Emmy, were they drunk that day, or what's the problem? Drake and Josh are not nominated for an Emmy, but it's better than Zoey 101. The creators of this show should be ashamed of the existence of this show. Let's just hope the pregnancy you will know will affect the show, or better, but it will be canceled.
