I saw this movie when it first came to the theaters in 1988 and although I knew it was not of award-winning caliber. I loved it very much. It speaks of the story of 5 former cubs, repeating themselves to accept the one task they never completed as children - which Mt is to climb. Whitehead. Of course, the cubs are already big and they have developed their personalities in different ways, but not too differently from what they were. Richard Lewis is still neurotic, Richard Belzer is still a playboy, Franklyn Ajaye is still sort of the group's Dear Abby, and Tim Thomerson is still the group's surfer. Of course, top-billed star Louie Anderson, a "true believer" in everything Cub Scout relates. He still lives in the same house with his mother, still goes daily on the Cub Scout manual, is brave, reverent and clean, and is the one reuniting the other for some great adventure in Scouting. To put their task together, the Grunski brothers, but two bulls threatened the Cub Scouts by the above. By chance they run into their old pine and decide to harm them a little, even if they are innocent. Not so innocent, are three escaped prisoners, who think Pack 7 is from the FBI and are planning to wipe them out. All in all, the movie is still charming. Note that Richard Lewis is trying to get comfortable on a fold, and you have a very funny bit for you. On further review, the entire film needed more of that kind of observation humor. It doesn't stay well after all these years, but still remains a guilty pleasure.
