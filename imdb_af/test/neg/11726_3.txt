Terrible in a whole new way, something other than a love is probably seen through movie buffs - even though it is just a cautionary measure that shows everything that can be wrong with a "vanity" production. I recommend a vanity production, as there is no other reason on God's green earth to be the most prominent and not-so-attractive non-singer / actress than Isabel Gold in the forefront of roles in viewers such as Cameron Bancroft and Andrew McCarthy - except that she also helped this bizarre little movie. Her song leaves much to be desired, and unbelievable as it is, all the other characters in the film think she's fantastic. There are a few moments of real charm or humor, but very few. Otherwise, it's a foolish, sad fiasco that leads from paint-by-numbers to paint-for-wrong numbers. You know what it's like when people look at a modern art and someone says, "My child can do better than that!" Well, it's a movie, like you or someone's child can do better.
