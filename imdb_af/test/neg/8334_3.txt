When the movie started, I felt it was going to be something special. The acting and camera work was undoubtedly good. I also loved the characters and could have taken them with them. The movie had a good atmosphere and there was a hint of fantasy. <br /> <br /> But when the movie was underway, the plot never appeared and just threw it on stage at the scene. I couldn't understand the connection between the stories. All I could see was the characters who sometimes bump into each other and refer to ships in bottles. Without that connection, I was left with just a few unbeatable short stories. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, it did so well in Cannes
