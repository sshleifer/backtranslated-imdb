Take a clich√© story and add Steve Guttenberg. Now that I'm saying more? It's really as bad as you'd expect. Sheriff Tom Palmer (Guttenberg) and Anna Montgormery are trying to transform a group of useless, indifferent children into a victorious soccer team. The originality and direction of the set-off is quite a struggle to maintain any form of interest in this film. Despite my concerns about Guttenberg's acting ability, I can safely say that the acting teams' coaches are actually worse than Guttenberg. Formerly unthinkable I thought. This kind of story of bitches who struggled all the way to the top is done better and better each time than this so-called "movie"
