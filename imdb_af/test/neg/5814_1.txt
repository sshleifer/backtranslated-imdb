I found this jewel in a rack. The local video rental store exchanged ties exchanged between different rental opportunities. The man who shot Everest. Hmm ... never heard of it. The box reads some Japanese fellows who always wanted to get off Everest and actually did it. Sounds interesting. I rented it. As expected, it was documentary style. The first part can be summarized as follows: "I always wanted to get off Mount Everest." This is followed by some footage of preparation for the event. Many preparation pictures. OK, I suppose it takes a lot of preparation. Then we are treated to a lengthy piece on the skier, Yuichiro Miura's life philosophy, etc. More filler follows and I start to wonder where the ski suits this show. More preparation is shown and they begin the journey to the mountain. More philosophy is shown. Eventually they arrive at the mountain and maybe he will go skiing on the friggin thing. Many climbing materials later there is a description of the parachute device aimed at accelerating Miuras' speed on the steep slope. Eventually he tied up the skis and made him ready. <br /> <br /> He's gone. He skis about twenty feet and his skis shoot under him, he deploys the parachute and tumbles in a complicated bundle for a little distance from the mountain and that's it. End of the story. What was it? <br /> <br /> OK, I can buy that he wanted to get off Everest, made extensive preparations and actually searched for the camera crew. It didn't work and he finally came down and almost killed himself. So, what a tremendous hubris would inspire the man to release a film of it and call it Everest? Perhaps the title, "The Man Who's Feet Shot Out Under Under Him, And He Embedded On His Emmag Everest" was just too long for the box.
