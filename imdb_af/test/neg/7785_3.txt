I hate a movie that has no end. I don't care how good or bad the rest can be, I don't like to be without conclusion. Such performances should insist on indemnity ... something like: The movie you are going to watch has no end or is so ambiguous that it is not conclusive. <br /> <br /> In the movie, the last scene we are in. By the way, Dee and Dominic have a bit of a ride and he says, almost sorry, I thought, it can't be him, because the fingers were those of a girl or a child. Then it ends! Well, the smoke gun is so in the hands of the Dee's son, but how about Dominic's daughter? I actually thought we could discover it was her! Anyway, unless you like incessant movies, I will avoid this one. Otherwise, I thought the movie was generally good.
