Minnesota's feeling is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is also one of the most disgusting films ever made. It has to do with a woman who is forced to marry a disgusting gang of men. At the wedding, his brother Jjaks meets. They have sex in the house after they eat the cake, but decide to run away together. The other brother of course comes after him, and he kills his wife. Jjaks wakes up to find her body in the bath and bury her. He seems to be friends with Jjaks and they try to get money together because someone chants them because he has seen them and the body. These tabs over and several characters die or come back to life, but it never comes with anything that can be called a good plot. The performances are very nearly everyone. Cameron Diaz, Keanu Reeves, and Dan Akroyed. The direction, dialogue and visual effects are just terrible. A disgusting and horrible movie.
