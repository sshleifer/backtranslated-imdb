... Brian? What was hell when you signed it? <br /> <br /> I recently saw it at a festival, and it was greeted by crying all over. By the time the credits rolled, tears flowed into the faces of many of the audience. <br /> <br /> The plot is a lot of mention of "E.R." and 'The X-Files'; so cynical aimed at the TV audience as possible without being sued. The sequel to the kidnapping is hilarious - both Yuzna's "swinging from bed" and "Mad Maddor's pathetic plastic strangers" have drawn believers from unbelieving, cunning laughter. <br /> <br /> Limp, fight and judgment. My only hope is that it was an aberration. As terrible as "Return of the Living Dead 3" it was all right. <br /> <br /> Steev
