My first question is not about the terrible act, NOT about the terrible writing, it's the direct. The choices made about cinematography are some of the worst decisions I've ever seen. Why should every bad guy die slowly? I was about to beat myself with a rubber hose. The camera shots make it so that you can't see what's going on. I was just going to switch off the movie because of Jalal Merhi's accent, when it made it to the sex scene, so I thought it could get better, but it didn't. If you evaluate special effects on an A, B, C rating scale, should I place it around a W or so, and did I mention the acting? Wow, it was bad !!! And the WORSTst part of the whole "Expectation to" experience is the blatant abuse of the phrase on the cover, which is: "THE MATRIX JUST GOT DEADLIER". Comparing this movie to the Matrix is ​​easily the WORST comparison I have ever seen. If you haven't seen this movie, don't, unless you're looking for a good reason to beat your head against the wall.
