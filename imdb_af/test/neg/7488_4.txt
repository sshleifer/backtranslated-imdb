Clearly, Andreas Bethmann would like to wear Jess Franco's crown while at least kin (Lina Romay's wife). Romay plays a corrupt, juicy, masturbating prison in this modern, ambitious W.I.P. film. With a few exceptions, many of Franco's films are constantly being produced and aimed at a slider, in a hurry. Shots do not always cut together and the sound mixes can be terrible. While watching 'Angel of Death 2', I asked myself if Bethmann was deliberately trying to repeat Franco's patent awareness, or was he just scary like his mentor? Is this movie deliberately bad, which would be self-defeating, or is it just bad by neglect? After a hitchhiker was forced to lose a firearm, her rapist filled her mouth and filled her vagina with drugs. Minutes later she was hanged in a bell prison for reasons that were not explained and subject to the teachings and the rough handling of staff and other prisoners. Being a WIP movie, there are lesbian scenes of great and violent behavior. The gore is also bloody and sadistic, with delights such as teeth pulling and scalping (thanks to Olaf Ittenbach). The acting is pretty terrible and the fighting scenes are lame, but there is a love for sleaze in every frame and an understanding of what rubbish fans enjoy. Unfortunately, the flat script makes a flat film. So, despite numerous atrocities, hardcore sex, and a guest appearance by Jess Franco, the experience is an empty one. But isn't that what most Jess Franco movies are?
