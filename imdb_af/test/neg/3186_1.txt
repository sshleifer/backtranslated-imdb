This is one of the death-filled top comedies that a) can be hysterical, or b) wish you went to the dentist to rather pull all your teeth. Unfortunately One Night at McCool's is a classic "b." Goldie Hawn recently told "Town and Country" that it is a major problem in Hollywood that they start hiring the actors and agreeing a deal. before a script is completed. You have to find out that they have not just put in a complete script in this picture, but also wasted it daily. Maybe we should send cards and letters to the heads of the studio, saying, "It's the writing, stupid." <br /> <br /> It's also one of those movies where you feel sorry for the actors most of the way through. They work their asses to try and make everything look hysterical, but they know that most of them are not accompanied, but through the sounds of the cricket you can hear in the silent theater. <br /> <br /> Is this an unprecedented disaster? Not quite. There are a few smiles on the go, mostly due to the actors' efforts. I would probably have gone out of the theater, "Eh. It was good." So why the unmistakably hostile tone in my review? The end. If the rest of the movie, as noted, is just an end to end, miss out on it. I really wish I could talk specifically about it, but I hate people who give away too much (even in warning). It's enough to say this once you see John Goodman behind a remaining Paul Reiser (give nothing away here. It's in the trailer), get the hell out of the theater and think, "Ah, that was fine." The movie was created and bankrupt creatively. And you will be terrified that there will actually be people laughing at this mess. <br /> <br /> If you loved "There is something about Maria" or "Meet the parents" (both BIG movies), don't worry about seeing this movie. Go and care for those teeth in its place.
