The opening of MORTE A VENEZIA looks like a Duran Duran music video with classical music and that is the highlight of the movie <br /> <br /> In terms of what Theo? <br /> <br /> In terms of everything, but especially excitement. I doubt there is ever a slower, slower moving movie than this one. Yes, it's a European art house movie, so I didn't expect Charles Bronson to kill whores of bad guys, but even so I expected a fabric if it wasn't a real plot. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around Professor Gustav von Aschenbach visiting Venice. Gustav visits Venice and goes on a gondola, Gustav eats in an expensive restaurant, Gustav looks out of his hotel window and if it is excited, you want Gustav to have a setback. <br /> <br /> Bad enough if it was the whole movie, but it gets worse because Gustav sees a nice boy's teen. So you have a middle-aged academic outfit to a teenager he has seen, an old queen is becoming a stranger. Great idea for a movie? Nor do I think so and thank you that it has been an ongoing festival instead of a cunning forerunner of gay porn. <br /> <br /> I see many people praising this movie, trying to intellectualize it. I can only be monosillabic and unpretentious in my view and say that the only subtext I can talk about is the physical and emotional disintegration of Gustav, but it is not caused by the slight beauty of the teenage boy. This is caused by such a boring and exaggerated film
