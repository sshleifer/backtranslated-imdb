I agree with most of the critics above. Even more, I was shocked at the presentation of the love stories with the gay couple. Why? Because while they - the director, the producers? - had no compulsion in presenting the various heterosexual couples in the most passionate embrace, including nudity and super close-ups of French kisses and all sorts of nudity in bed, totally unnecessary in their length and in the story, when the same Experienced with the gay couple, they dared as far as an unpleasant painful hug, almost under scientific giggles, with two very nervous actors. So, in fact, the makers of this movie have found homosexuality to be UNNATURAL, as one of the characters in one or other scene says. What a difference with the Spanish theater! I remember being on the project of an Almodovar film in an Italian theater in Rome and totally amazed at the total lack of response from the Italian audience. They were scared to get a response! When in Spain people fall off their seats and laugh at all the risk situations and fabulous Almodovar white and flair. Of course in Italy there are dark powers in its history that impede the free manifestation of some very normal and natural emotions. Sorry. I must add that I was rather surprised to find that the same comment was criticized by another correspondent. It is very bad and dangerous when we are not allowed by the refuge of others to express our opinions on certain matters. Where is freedom of speech? I don't know if the adjudicator approves the changes I should make in these comments, and I hope he won't receive the same treatment from another meticulous judge. Sorry again.
