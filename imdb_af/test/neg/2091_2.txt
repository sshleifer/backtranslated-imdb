This train line starts with Brujo and Alma crossing the Mexican border. Alma suffers from a little curse which causes her to vomit garden tubing and Nickelodeon Gac every few minutes, as well as pinching her teeth and mumbling. So apparently Alma has this uncle in Los Angeles, who knows about a cure for her. They jump aboard a train to get there and luckily a friend pays them their way. Alma and Brujo stay in the luggage cart the whole movie because they cannot afford high-class seats. Meanwhile, in the higher class, we see a lot of nobodies on their way to LA for whatever reasons. A Baalman on a business trip, two girls, one of whom wears $ 5 big and a little cocaine, three stoners and some Mexicans. The Mexicans stir it up with Brujo and try to take his "weeds" which are apparently a tranquility for Alma's snakes in her. They realize that the snakes are not attacking, they enter your body through your veins! Very twisted and B-Movie. Brujo saves the man by ripping his heart (Temple Of Doom style) and getting the snake. For some reason he cannot damage the snakes or Alma will hurt it. While on a drug, an expert tries to brush one of the girls and gets some topless in return for not telling her about her drug transportation. A mysterious man appears and has a firearm with him. As a great final, Alma becomes a vampire, bites her husband and then becomes a huge pathetic excuse for a CG snake, the size of the train, eats the train and is storming and disappearing into a nuclear bomb hurricane . Then everyone went to LA. <br /> <br /> The credits actually say the end. "Any agreement with real people, living or dead, or real events is purely coincidental and very strange. We suggest moving and / or taking a plane". Strange because a line in the movie of the bald man is "Yes, I hate airplanes!" The credits continue to say: "No snakes were injured during the production of this screenplay. Only a small child, but it's cool." There were actually a lot of real snakes used in the movie, and everyone was very soft. There is actually no scene of CG snakes attacking anyone unless you count the big one, but then it only eats the train and the other fake snake is just the head and it looks like a muppet. The snakes don't really fall, they're just there. One actually crawls out of toilet paper! <br /> <br /> The movie is not funny, is not scary (since there is no real snake attack), and is just a "quickie cash-in" when a low-budget movie company hears about a great Hollywood release, they hurry out a similar movie, or even a parodic version, for release just before or simultaneously with the big name movie. The result is that many people will confuse each other, and look rather than the "biggie" or, they will both want to see, for whatever reason, like me. Avoid at all costs.
