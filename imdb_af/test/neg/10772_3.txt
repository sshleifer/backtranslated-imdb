After reading the books and seeing the 1982 Anthony Andrews / Jane <br /> <br /> <br /> Seymour version, I have to say that it is not good at all. <br /> <br /> According to the books, Percy is supposed to be an apparent aristocrat when he is Percy, and smart and clever <br /> <br /> when he is the Pimpernel, but here he just seems bored as <br /> <br /> Percy and meant as the Pimpernel. Marguerite is supposed to <br /> <br /> be the most beautiful woman in Europe, not a tired and frowning matron (she looks middle-aged, probably due to <br /> <br /> bad makeup) . Richard E. Grant has done much better things and <br /> <br /> Elizabeth McGovern's play is uninspired and flat. The white and <br /> <br /> dash of the books and the Andrews / Seymour movie are here <br /> <br /> replaced by brawn and flashy editing that just doesn't make the cut. <br /> <br /> I can add it to a person who hasn't seen any previous version <br /> <br /> or reading the book will probably look good.
