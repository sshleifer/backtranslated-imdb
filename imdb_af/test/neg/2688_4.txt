This movie is really great, over the years I got a taste of Japanese Monster movies and I am aware that early examples of this genre can be poor. But this one reaches a new layer, as it follows the adventures of Johnny Sokko (?), A young boy who controls a giant robot, and his battle against the evil Gargoyle gang that has an endless supply of terrible huge samples at their disposal.
