The title gives you pretty much knowledge of what you get. It's a grade C yellow but not as blatantly funny as I hope. Directed by the exploitation film specialist Eddie Romero from a story that originally came from Jonathan Demme (long before directing "Silence of the Lambs" and "Philadelphia"), this low-budget 1972 stock film was of course filmed in the Philippines, but in some anonymous third world country. Playmaker and retailer Lee Daniels, superstar Pam Grier, plays the first half of the title role. Forgotten Margaret Markov is the other half, Karen Brent, an unlikely Patty Hearst-like political revolutionary who, along with her comrades, overthrows the oppressive local government. Of course, antagonistic to each other, they are in a women's prison camp where they wear inexplicably bright yellow mini skirts as uniforms. The prison is run by a dressmaker and lecherous matron. It is just an excuse for a long landfill and a half-hearted cat fight when Lee and Karen explode. Of course, they escape a low "The Defiant Ones" and keep the cat fighting until they attack a few nuns to steal their habits. Meanwhile, several groups of indifferent men have been followed - the purely drug-seeking Lee who stole $ 40K from him, the rather passive revolutionary that Karen is looking for, and the incompetent police (who experience the humiliation of exposing their priests to the drug) . Needless to say, everything eventually comes to a head but not by a number of Filipino women, but a dog wears Karen's underpants and some of the worst of the men's fashion fashion (a beer gun revolutionary wear a leather top with a straight face). There is a rather sad end, but what is really sad is how much of the potential black comedy is completely missed in this hilariously preposterous exercise. Unfortunately, Grier is disappointing in this outing because her character doesn't have much to do with all the "jive", while Markov is an Amazon blonde I have convinced is desperate to be credible. Since no one shows a talent for acting, the rest of the cast is not worth remembering, except balding, bug-eyed Sid Haig, who uses his standard psycho-persona as a drug master. The 2003 DVD contains only the original trailer as an extra.
