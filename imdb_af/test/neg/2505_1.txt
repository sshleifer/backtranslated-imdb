Firstly, I refuse to even consider this piece of work even a Music Video ... I consider it a short movie that uses excerpts from the song "Thriller" in its soundtrack. For me, a music video should not be more than the song itself, and the song should play the entire length of the video. To call it a music video is to call the Great Gatsby a poem. In addition, let's face it ... "Vibrant" is a boring 14 minutes, including the highly dated werewolf transformation, the incomprehensible Vincent Price poem (just because VP calls it doesn't mean it's not lame) the least threatening zombies I've ever seen. Certainly, it certainly was a cultural phenomenon, but don't forget. It also happened at the same time. The A team was the # 1 show on TV, so we can't give that culture too much credit on that one. One last point about the film's impact on the media on music videos ... what added it exactly to the equation that "Billie Jean" and "Beat It" haven't added yet? From what I can tell, it just added practice to stop the song for some dialogue or an abundant dance scene ... so you can tell that all this video really did, Puffy gives the inspiration for more annoying music videos to make. Not really my big definition
