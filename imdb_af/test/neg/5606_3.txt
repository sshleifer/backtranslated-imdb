This movie was really bad. I mean really bad. The screens were like a parody and special effect sucked. And this was filmed in 2003! I think it was a huge waste of time and money and Michael Shanks with his 'Scooby Doo' Shaggy image just made me laugh. Never waste your time on this photo ... I really don't know what the director thinks of after seeing the final cut of this movie, but the battles were so unrealistic that it hurt my eyes to look at them. The "latex catwoman" fighters were like sheep that just roll around the scenes and look around, as they had no idea what to do on the scene ... I think this is a beautiful example of Bottom 100 photo.
