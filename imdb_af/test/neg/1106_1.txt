I usually like this type of movie. But this time I found myself kicking the screen. Since I can't do it, I'll just complain about it. It was absolutely idiotic. The things that happen to the dead children are very cool, but the living people are absolute idiots. I'm a mature man, pretty big, and I can defend myself well. However, I won't do half of the things the girl does in this movie. Also, the mother in this movie is reckless with her children, to the point of neglect. I wish I was not so angry with her and her actions, because otherwise I would have enjoyed the movie. What a number she was, taking my advice and forward through everything she saw to the end. Also, anyone else gets sick of watching movies that have been filmed so dark. Older, one can hardly see what is being filmed. As an audience, we are impossible to engage in on-screen action. So why, hell can't we have night vision?
