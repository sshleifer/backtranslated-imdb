Lance Henriksen paid something to appear here. I hope it was a lot. <br /> <br /> Former US national gymnast Kristie Phillips starts as Charlie Case, a gymnastics spin-secret agent (because it is very common for munchkin gymnasts to become government spies ...) <br /> <br /> There is a truly hysterical opening scene where Charlie's unequal burst routine is sabotaged by an eastern blockbuster. What follows is one of the most ridiculous stunt scenes I've ever seen .... and they want you to take it seriously! Don't worry ... she knocks her knocked out. <br /> <br /> Afterwards, just a messy, drunk of a spy roller. Check out the first fifteen minutes for campy gymnastics, then run for cover.
