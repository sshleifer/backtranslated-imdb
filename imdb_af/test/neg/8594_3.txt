The basic plot is good and can be engaging. The music is so great that it has become the theme music for the TV show IRON CHEF (although it is over-exploited and too intrusive in the movie). So how did this movie become so poor?!? Well, the plot was about 95% predictable and the characters were as one-dimensional as possible. And the dialogue?! Which person will actually allow themselves to receive credit for the rise of the STUPID macho bull-crap pretending to be a dialogue? You get much more realism from most cartoons! The bottom line is that this movie has some good points, but it is so devastated by clipped cliches and rotten dialogue that it becomes tiring quickly. And it's a pity, because firemen deserve a better tribute than this mess! If you don't believe me, look at the number of goofs listed on IMDb for this movie - which is more than you'd expect. They just didn't mind working out all the kinks and problems. So, as a result, the movie looks rushed and needs a rewrite and re-edit.
