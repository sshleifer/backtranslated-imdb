Last fall (2001) I took a film class taught by the director of this movie (Mark Hoeger). His great film-film knowledge, his ability to uncover any scene of a movie, and win an Oscar award in a dark category, gave him more credibility than your average independent film director. When he mentioned one of his lessons that he had just finished a movie called "Full Ride" and was in the post-production phase, my interest was encouraged. However, this will be the last thing I will ever hear from that movie project. Until last week ... <br /> <br /> Last week I saw in a TV list that "Full Ride" will be shown on the World Cup network. It immediately raised a red flag, because I can't help associate WB with teenage pursuits like Dawson's Creek, Charmed, and so on. PLUS, the fact that Full Ride would be released straight to TV, was not too flattering in itself. . Yet I set aside that time and sat down to view my former film teacher's creation. <br /> <br /> Having passed two hours and rolling the final credits, I thought long and hard about what I had just seen. What I have just seen was a typical two-hour World Cup show. In fact, it almost seemed like this movie was made with the sole intention of just showing on the WB network. Criticism of this movie will be basically like criticizing a typical WB show. <br /> <br /> Where to start? The characters are level, the story is in every sense of the word cliche, the scenes are completely confronted, and character development is forced and incredible. The main character, Matt Sabo, is a little hot shot from the wrong side of the songs (literally) playing solid high school football as a fullback, but then fizzles off in a life of crime. He is then offered a chance on a full ride, instead of going to jail. Of course, without much of his choice, he agrees to play football with an all-star soccer team, but is not excluded from his peers because of his poor team spirit and bad attitude. <br /> <br /> Then comes the love interest. Of course! Where will this predictable fanfare be without love? She comes in the form of Amy Lear (played by the beautiful Meredith Monroe). She is actually a pleasant character, unlike the equally grinding Matt Sabo, so we almost applaud her if she initially rejects him. But of course, the inevitable occur. She falls for him, changes his attitude to everything, and everything looks good and happy. But now it's time for conflict! <br /> <br /> Earlier in the movie, Amy made it clear to Matt that she didn't want to share with him, because it would be "shameful" for her and her mother. It is very much for Matt's dismay, and his soccer partners (yes, they are finally warmed up) who claim he would not. But, of course, Matt eventually comes to accept these terms and decides he is not just about the nookie. Here is where the exciting plot thickens. If you don't want me to ruin this surprise, go ahead. <br /> <br /> [START SPOILER] <br /> <br /> Matt finds out some local guys who apparently Amy Lear always try to score with a man every year from the All-Star team, so she can try to use him to escape her little town to work in a cafeteria that first baffles and makes it to the big city. Suddenly he realized he was used and that his love was a shame, Matt requested to return to a crime and leave the football camp before the big game. Amy tries to reassure him that she really was in love this time, but he's too cold to buy it. So what is Matt doing? Will he take her back? Or will he go back to rob gas stations and be quite a while? I won't ruin the super-ultra-surprising end for you. <br /> <br /> [END SPOILER] <br /> <br /> So, if I somehow pumped you to this movie, please realize it was my sarcasm and not real enthusiasm. This movie is an uninspired version of `Varsity Blues 'or` Summer Catch'. And it doesn't say much. There is hardly any comedy to save and the characters are too shallow to care. So what have you been left with? Not much. <br /> <br /> What I didn't like most of the movie was how much of an unobstructed picture was Hoeger painted by Nebraska. He seems to be trying to determine the essence of rural Nebraska and teenage life in the small towns, but his approach is too stereotypical and level. The high expectations of the characters to make in the big city and the actions they take to do so are extremely exaggerated. And it goes without saying that the stereotype of Nebraska is a bunch of hicks living in farming communities. I'm not sure Hoeger's intention was to try and put his home state in the spotlight, but I think he ended up with a very shameful product. If Hoeger Nebraska wanted to portray in a favorable light, he had to take a note or two from Alexander Payne. While Payne simply chooses to use Nebraska as a backdrop to his films, Hoeger integrates it into the plot of Full Ride and becomes so entangled in his consciousness of where he shoots, that he eventually becomes superficial garbage from an outsider. If Hoeger actually lived here, you'd think he'd know better than that. <br /> <br /> All in all, I'm totally disappointed in Hoeger's first big movie, and I hope he'll be able to combine his combination next time. knowledge with some originality to create something different and thoughts.
