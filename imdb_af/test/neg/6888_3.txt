I reviewed this video and expected to keep it. Would love to like it. I like foreign films, I like beautiful cinematography, I know the critics enjoy this movie (including my favorite, Roger Ebert), and I don't mind "slow" movies. <br /> <br /> Well, it's beautiful. It's about the best I can say for that. The plot is very thin, the shots are very long, the look is very significant, the actors are very sincere, and it looks like a very long movie. I fell asleep halfway, but woke up, hit the tape, tried again. It was a trial, but I made it to the end. I didn't like it any better.
