While the time was killed on a Saturday morning, "Looking For Lola" came on HBO. I decided to give it a shot though the description of the movie looks pretty bad. It was even worse than I could imagine. The movie was incredibly incredible and there was absolutely no screen chemistry between the lead players I shook my head almost every 10 minutes. Between Mike Greenbaum (lead actor) in plays in which he moved the bill at a fancy restaurant and where Lola (main actor) allowed him to use her boss's house to trick his parents into thinking he was rich, it was almost as bad as he "daydream" about people around him doing the macarena (it was HORRIBEL!) and the two actors who eventually fell in love. I wanted to change the channel, but I tried to give it every chance to become a cute love story with a few chuckles. It never did. In fact, it has become so bad that I decided to just finish it, so I can claim to have looked at one of the worst films ever made in its entirety, rather than being criticized for not given a fair chance. The last scene Lola tried to perform was a highlight of the movie. She comes late after she gets married (even that scene where Mike tells the priest to show up soon and then just throws away the papers and claims it's finished with the credibility of this movie) and then somehow convinces the judges give her a look. The two male judges have already ended with what time she is. But after watching her waif around the stage (ok, it looks good, but not too impressive), everyone joins Lola and Mike's families, other dancers there and * even the judges * cough. Bad, terrible, terrible. It was so bad I had to write a review. Look at your own risk.
