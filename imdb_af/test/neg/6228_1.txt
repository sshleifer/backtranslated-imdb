I have to say there is a redeeming speck regarding this "movie". It firmly attaches to the bottom of the barrel. Now filmmakers know what to aim for when making a movie. Other than that, I regret this debacle. Leaving the scandal of making this "movie" was. What a waste of $ 100,000 (that's right people, one hundred thousand dollars). This "movie" reminds me of the "Adult Video Awards" show in which groups of "industrial prostitutes" praise themselves and believe they are true actors, actresses and filmmakers. Excited how I watched blue movies with better acting, directing and writing. I also found it funny that executive producer Justin Ament just had to be in the "movie". He plays Deputy Jake Barker. I'm sure his theater has retired. The author, Ted Pfiffer, has a role. He undoubtedly turned in the clich√© dream he had created. It should be noted that Carrie Finklea has a leading role in the movie. You might remember her from Gus Van Sant's 'Elephant'. Although I'm not sure she wants to write this movie on her CV. And I'm not sure what a more depressing point is; money is spent making this movie or people are going to watch it. Together with 'Torque', 'Godsend' and 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow', one of the worst films, IF NOT THE WORST FILM, of 2004.
