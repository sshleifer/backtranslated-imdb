Zeoy101 ?? Really, this should be one of the most beautiful attempts to get people in my age group's attention. It's about a preppy girl named Zeoy and her friends going to school. BORING !!! All she ever does is sound and complain and act like a spoiled idiot. I remember that this exhibition came out in 2005, I was 13 at 14, and even then I thought it was pointless. The only episode I ever liked was when the boys hid a camera in the girls dorm. IT'S THIS. Anyway, I just understand why Nickel-Oh my bad-Nick felt the need to syndicate this sorry poor excuse for "entertainment". seriously this decade is joking annually and it gets the worst and worst. What is this generation ?? <br /> <br /> In each case, R.I.P. Nickelodeon 1979-1998? / 2005?
