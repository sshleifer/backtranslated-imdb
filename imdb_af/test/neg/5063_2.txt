Clossius says "Baltic Storm" was banned in Sweden. This is not correct! Instead, you can buy the movie almost anywhere, such as in petrol stations, shopping malls, internet (of course) and so on. Often to a very low price, because this movie is so BAD and no one wants to see it, despite all the tricks to keep the interest. The movie only appeals to conspiracy theorists, psychos and other people living in the country and those who know the truth. <br /> <br /> Working on a Estonia-themed disaster theme, I met them all! I heard of every theory that consists of cocaine smuggling, weapons smuggling, biological warfare, nuclear smuggling, red mercury, aliens, Russian-American-Estonian, Swedish and Finnish intelligence, often in different combinations. <br /> <br /> Some ordinary people asked why we didn't show the movie? A question only asked of them that this horrible nonsense movie didn't see. <br /> <br /> Again, "Baltic Storm" is not banned in Sweden. It has some entertaining features, but what is Donald Sutherland in this movie?
