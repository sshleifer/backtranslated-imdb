Reba sucks. It sucks hard. It's about this horrible country singer who tries comedy. They can just call this show "Generic" because that's what it is. It's stupid and generic. Reba, you're not funny, and I'm glad your delayed performance was canceled because you suck. And also Brock, Barbra Jean, the redhead teen, the jockey and the 12 year old who beat. You all suck, and none of you is funny. Oh, and I heard a rumor that Reba is actually a gay devil worshiper who idolizes Hitler and interferes with animals. And she puts subliminal messages on her show and in her "music" hoping to make children kill their parents and kill themselves! But it was just a rumor. Anyway, this is the worst show ever, Reba is gay, I don't like her, I think the office is better than this show, and this show sucks.
