Apart from the fact that this man is a liar, he is also a total idiot and a thief in the comedy community. Once I tried to watch this apology for a television program, I believe I was throwing a little in my mouth. I can't help feeling a little stupid every time I see one of his terrible ads, while enjoying great comedy central programs like Reno 911 and American Body Shop. It shows that I worry about the constant existence of mankind. It's hard to believe that even Joe Rogan can make someone look like a moron. Please start praying now that the comedy center will realize their error and end as soon as possible. Didn't we suffer enough?
