Compared to the recent Gore Flick HOSTEL, which reminded me of this movie - I would say that Sea No Evil is slightly better, but not much. The very complex plot involves a handful of criminals sent to clear a short hotel for a shorter prison sentence. The children eventually end up by a clumsy religious psychopath who cleanses them (I think) from their sins. The one thing I feared most about before I saw it was the fact that it stared a WWE wrestler, Kane. He finally did a decent job, as he had only 2-word lines in the movie. There are some pretty greedy moments, which are mainly eye wash and a very memorable scene in which a girl drops a cell phone in her throat - probably the most effective downfall in the movie. <br /> <br /> I can't say this movie really shows us something new and definitely far from big. Can't recommend it.
