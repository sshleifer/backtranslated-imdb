I don't know what some of these filmmakers think, by making the same kind of click over and over, where the bad guys (bad girls in this case) win. Poorly acting and very predictable. Nothing original about it. This same film has been made over and over - unlike GOODBYE LOVER (1989), SLOW BURN (2005), or at least ten other movies with exactly the same story and ending. There are also many holes in the film. It's as if they were running out of money and just stopped filming. Or maybe they ran out of ideas. But don't waste your time with this one. It will only get upset by wasting your time.
