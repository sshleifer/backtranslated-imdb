By reading most of the other reviews, I tend to vote with most of the comments. The one thing I want to add is the diverse way in which the film is directed and manufactured. I think some of these new wave filmmakers think they're clever using unusual (sometimes jerky) camera angles and flashing from one scene to another. These movie festivals are doing well, and with some of these India-type critics, but it wastes the movie for me. I noticed in the reviews, one comment that says none of these filmmakers have become movies. It might be my point, because the movie has that "haste end" that makes you wonder why such a beautiful movie doesn't seem to flow at all. Whatever the comment about Kiefer Sutherland as a big name to put the poster on, I will tear it when he looks at the final cut. It is a story with real potential, spoiled by trying to be different in production. Worth to look at, but not many will return for a second view.
