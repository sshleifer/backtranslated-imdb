The 3 stars are for Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Nothing else and no one else in this movie deserves even a good smithy of a star. Well, okay, Amy Adams deserves a good smithy, but the blacksmith's does not seem to work, so I like 3. Tom Hanks ... nothing. Julia Roberts ... nothing. Mike Nichols ... do you see another trend? Aaron Sorkin ... OMG, not a chance. <br /> <br /> For several paragraphs on the way Charlie Wilson's War on History, Morality, Legitimacy, and so on, I could say, but I don't think such a rant would be the Aussies Sorkin fans cannot overpower. The rest of you, beware. Save your movie money elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Still, if you're looking for a spicy note, it's mine. You can put warm fudge sauce on a pile of garbage, but it doesn't change anything. Garbage is garbage and so is Charlie Wilson's War.
