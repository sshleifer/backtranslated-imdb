Nothing but a soccer beating from The Mighty Ducks, this movie seems to be annoying in most respects. It was one of those times when your parents asked you to take your younger brothers and sisters, so they shouldn't go with them for a few hours. To say the least, my younger sisters liked it, but it was too much like the far superior Mighty Ducks. Oh yes, Olivia d'Abo was at least warm and Steve Guttenberg had another job at the time.
