Show movies have come so far, as Mel Brooks said in 'The Producers' (1968): "Don't be stupid, be smart. Come with the Nazi party." It has our great movies, like 'Young Frankenstein', 'Airplane!', And even 'Naked Gun'. But the good dies young. Fortunately, the genre managed to do so until the end of the 90's. And then ... the Wayan's brothers released the apocalypse: "Scary Movie". Suddenly the word poem was an innuendo for rough sex jokes. Most movies that have been spoofed since then, including Scary Movie 2, Date Movie and the movie to kill the epic movie. Certainly, there are some reliefs. There was 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz'. Will Ferell be a vehicle that is spoofing near every sport imaginable. Also, the Wayans Brothers closed the 'Scary Movies' and were made by the reputable Zucker Brothers. While these films have gained value in salvation, the genre is tragically doomed to be films that were only loved by prepubescent men, who only discovered what an erection is. People who did not explore the term spoof and cut and paste movies together for a quick laugh. No heart, no brain, just cheap gum. Unfortunately, The Comebacks has been added to the list. Dave Koechner (who played with Ferrell in 'Anchorman') leads a team of undercover players to win against a coach (Carl Weathers of the 'Happy Gilmore' lady) who returns him in coaching. Koechner promised as a supporting actor, but as a lead in this movie, he just sounds written. He sounds too much as he reads cold, passionately reading. Also the jokes of being an excited coach, who, through the movie, encouraged the team to fail in school and later from the police in his underwear, was previously done. Yes, it's a ghost film. But let's remember that even spoofs can have quality. Give the characters dignity and a sort of sophisticated view of modern society. Also, the trust in stereotypes will no longer make us laugh (who knew one movie with people talking, could lead to stereotypes of gangster (not really, but you see)). While I would admit that I was laughing at least a few times, it wasn't on par. The soccer team in itself had many stereotypes, including a Mexican, a cocky jock, a fat man, the scary nerd and the mentally handicapped help. Even the only female on the team has reduced to stereotypical feminine humor, which is mostly skinny and conceived. In fact, her character, as well as most of the others, never developed. This is a sad situation of this movie. If it wasn't so dependent on stupid sex jokes, it could have made something for itself. In fact, this movie will probably be the bat of jokes next to 'Epic Movie' for the time to come. Koechner really deserved better. The writing was generally poor, even called the championship 'The Toilet Bowl'. So yes. spoofflieks is dead. There is a movie called Meet the Spartans (be ahead of the trend, boycott now!), Which includes a ghost on Britney Spears's outline. So let the kids get on ... but people grow up and lose them. We need food. One day they will learn to stop spoofing and repair them. Hopefully one of the heroes 'Get Smart', made by Master Mel Brooks, will come out next year. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5 (Stars)
