I just came here to look at the Terror Hospital for an alternative title, so I want to know what not to pick up. Not only do I get the original title but I find terrorist hospital is one of seven more aliases. This one is a true clunker. Movies like this can usually be forgiven for any number of reasons, mostly unintended effects of the feature at every level of production that at least result in a soft form of entertainment, mostly fun. It has none of this. Instead, the viewer is witnessing unnecessary and unnecessary and way-to-convenience-for-situation exposition and drawn-out characters of room-moving characters, all of which are half the movie. Forget about finding out where someone is (or what they are) during dark or night scenes; you probably won't mind. There is also a random car chase sequence that seems to be boring compared to some of the old driver's movies I've dragged ... I mean, I sat looking back at high school. Really, we're talking about mysticism, possession, and a killer loose here - not a bad recipe for the trash movie. Unfortunately there is nothing here to make it even "good" trash; When the above comes together, the bad acting and non-special effects are just that - bad acting and non-special effects. This one is just trash, clean and simple. Leave it on the shelf at the pawnshop or in the box at the site sale. There is a reason there ...
