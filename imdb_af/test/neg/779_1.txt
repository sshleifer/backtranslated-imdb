Perhaps if you have smoked enough weeds, it looks funny or you would be nostalgic for how totally unvoiced people allowed themselves in the early 70s. There is a strange innocence for this movie and the sex is much more uncomfortable and playful than the solid benefits it now has for the cameras. <br /> <br /> The real curio here - and really the only reason to watch it - is the appearance of Kristine Debell as Alice. She was a Ford model and showed it. She has classic, WASP-ish good looks - like a very cute Ivy League girl. So what is the hell she does in this cheap, shiny spot? From my vantage point it doesn't seem to be drugs in this movie (it can explain it) and she actually looks incredibly committed to the part. When she sings her first song, she really works as she thinks she is "Julie Andrews" or a flippin. I just get the feeling that this girl really believed it was going to break her or something, instead of the close career killer it was. Anyway, she's cute and you can't believe she'll even get naked on the screen, much less do a masturbation scene, some oral sex scenes (with men and women) and then do the right deal than a highlight of the movie (snark). It is certainly not a double body. It's our little Kristine who takes one for the team, or for the greater glory of showbiz or something. It's great to watch and it is definitely stimulating (ahem), but in a way I wish she didn't. It was a very beautiful, talented young girl who really got bad advice. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my guess is that Kristine Debell, wherever she has been, has long wanted this movie to go away. She was very cute and attractive in "Meatballs." Almost impossible to believe it is the same girl - but it is.
