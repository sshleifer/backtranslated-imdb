It was a first feature for Clinton, I was there while shooting about 98 in Adelaide. <br /> <br /> Although I was not directly involved in the production, I witnessed the typical post-set vigilance behavior that went down: the parties, the drugs, the illusory luster, really an example of What is not to do as a film is made, but also a by-product of young talented people in classical ideologies of fame and worldly position. <br /> <br /> I love Clinton, we had a strange friendship, he still deserves a crack with a more mature writing. There are the problems and I'm probably much better. work will be done, if there is next time around! Because he honestly said, he certainly didn't make any favors on his resume or the role ... but hey, it was a paying job, in a country where actors regularly hunger <br /> <br /> In summary, fascinating to look at 'making' is basically not so much fun to experience (unfortunately!).
