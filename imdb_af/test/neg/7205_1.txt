I couldn't spoil this piece of shit if I wanted to. After watching Dark Harvest, I thought "it must be the worse movie ever made". When I watched Dark Harvest 2, it got a little better. Then I watch Dark Harvest 3 or try too. The only thing I must say is: "When will it end?" Very bad acting and very bad special effects. The only good thing about this movie was the boob shot. Don't waste your time on this piece of shit ... And now I have to write three more lines to get it handed in. I sang a song, but I can't think of it from now on. But the movie finally ended (although it ended that might mean they are going to make one of them)
