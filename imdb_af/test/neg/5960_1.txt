You want the worst horror movie of the 21st century? El Chupacabra is this. "Manos: The Hands of Fate" is the worst movie of all time, but El Chupacabra is definitely the worst movie of this century. It must also have the distinction of having the absolute worst premier actor ever. Actor Eric Alegria has never done another movie than El Chupacabra, give - I wonder why. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the monster is falling, but everyone being attacked is really slow and really stupid. And there are no policemen in this town, just two idiot detectives - Hello! Cops appear on the scene of murders first, then the detectives come! And apparently the monster just falls into one person's backyard, and a few deserted areas at the docks. Or ... these are the only places where filmmakers can access film. <br /> <br /> This "movie" is why IMDb should allow us to give negative stars. It easily earns -10 stars, or at least 0. They must allow a 0 rating.
