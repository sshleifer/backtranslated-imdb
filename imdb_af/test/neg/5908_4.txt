Eddie Murphy played a major role in this movie through directed stars, and produced this story about two nighclub owners in the 30's trying to fight, and corrupt police, to take over their club. A great role in Murphy Redd Foxx, Richard Pryor, Danny Aiello, Della Reese and a beautiful Jasmine Guy who would make it worth seeing on their own. But the story just doesn't interest or give the big cast enough to work together. On a scale of one to ten. 4
