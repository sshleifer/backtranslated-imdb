I test myself to watch 3 bad movies on a row to find out if 3 bad movies can be watched in a row, I can give amnesia. I have a dual version of the English version of this movie. Now let me take the points. Music Score: bad quality, but at least fit it with Story: it's about a man going to a town and he meets his sheriff brother and they fight for farmers of a bulk and he ally with mexicans to drive them and Trinity and his brother are trying to teach them to defend it. The final climate battle scene will confuse anyone about who the good people are. Summary: Better than I thought, but I have to continue with this next look at the Dolph Lungren and Jean-Claudde Vanne Dams film "Universal Soldier" pray for my common sense
