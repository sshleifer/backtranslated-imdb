The worst movie I've ever seen. I still don't understand what Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen are planning to do. Maybe they had accounts to pay. The best and most cultured part happens during a setback that we bring to World War II when a Nazi officer conceals his Jewish wife. This is the beginning of a typical series of killers live! It seems to be targeted at the beginning of the 80's, but then a New Beattle ... appears amazing! This movie was directed in 2001 ... I'm quite sure it took less than two weeks to do that movie. I heard that Dennis Hopper's wife asked for divorce after she saw the photo and Michael Madsen's mother had a heart attack when the actor admitted the man under the yellow baseball hat. Pathetic!
