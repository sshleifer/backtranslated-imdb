And now for another point of view: I didn't like it. I didn't really finish it. I know that "in vain" is considered by some as one of the greatest Westerners ever made. I know it stars and is directed by Clint Eastwood, one of the icons of the American cinema. I know it won a lot of Oscars. Yet I didn't like it. I don't like Western, and it's obviously a matter of taste, but I don't like Eastwood's play either. He is not and has never been a leading man. He's not a Burt Lancaster, no Paul Newman, no John Wayne. In this movie alone, Richard Harris and Gene Hackman disappear; they are both actors. No, Eastwood is a tall man with a reedy voice who usually plays tough guys. Here he plays a retired, difficult man. When I see him on the screen, I see a man acting on his scene. Then there is the anti-Western Western plot. It is also obviously meant to inject contemporary values ​​- a respect for the role of women, blacks, indigenous Americans and single parents; a lack of respect for violence and drinking; the health that comes into marriage, including the interracial marriage and small, adorable children - in a century where these values ​​are not necessarily accepted, at least in these ways. By promoting the values, the film comes across as manicured, if not pastor. Then there are the stereotypes of the hoary film - prostitutes with hearts of gold, the child who can't shoot straight, the city rocks new to the Wild West, the sage pans shine on a summer afternoon with a musical accompaniment in big chords . Lastly, there is the transfer of Eastwood's direction. I got up after an hour. Eastwood was still driving north, talking to Morgan Freeman, and the kid who couldn't shoot straight was sixty minutes after the plot threatened by a prostitute. It was too slow. Someone had to find these elements indescribable. I'm afraid it was me.
