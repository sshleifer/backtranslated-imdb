While the new Pride & Prejudice movie is great to watch, and the soundtrack is great, we don't see Jane Austen's pride and bias. For some reason, the film dates back to the early 1790s, rather than the Regency era where the novel was set, as scholars have long shown. The Bennets' Longbourn estate is ramshackled and looks like Cold Comfort Farm. Yet the Bennets are in the common-class novel; They own a farm, but the pig does not walk through the house, nor does the farmyard of manure and chicken drops next to the house. Sites are being re-recorded in the novel, and we have not forgotten that Jane Austen has posted scenes for some reason. For example, the movie puts the big Darcy performance scene outside in a storm before a Neoclassical temple, unlike the Collins parsonage: Why did Jane Austen put it in the parsonage? Because while Collinses and Lizzy and Darcy talk to totals, as cruel honesty to one another in this scene, they never shared an honest word. Why the rain and the outdoors? It looks like Jane Eyre meets Rochester! And if Elizabeth walks over a windy field to stand on a cliff and see the panorama, one expects her to be called "Heathcliffe" at any moment! Austen is Bronteized! Judy Dench is a great actress, but Lady Catherine is supposed to be tall and eye-catching. The petite Tom Hollander is a brilliant actor: but Mr Collins is described in the novel as long and heavy. This indicates that his terrible dance with poor Lizzy is elephant. Matthew MacFayden is another favorite of mine from MI-5 on A&E; In P&P, however, he is more the young Heathcliffe, never smiles - although Austen observes in the novel that Darcy smiles a bit at Lizzy, and she realizes this when she sees his beautiful smiling portrait at Pemberley - a portrait that in This movie is for some reason replaced by a marble sculpture. And many of Austen's dialogue is changing to modern speech. Mr. Bingley became so foolish that you wonder why Darcy would have him as a friend and why Jane Bennet would love him. The bottom line is that while it is a good movie to watch and hear, it deviates from Jane Austen's novel so much that any student who watched it would think she could read it for reading would fail!
