Only when does this storyline take place? It must take place after the first movie because Kuzco knows that Pacha and Chicha have her third child, but this can't happen after the second movie, because Kronk doesn't get a girl or a woman or something? You never see her in the show. <br /> <br /> Also, why is Kuzco going to school? The whole plot of the show is that Kuzco goes to school so he can be emperor. But wasn't he an emperor before? And whose emperor while learning to be emperor? Shouldn't that be Yzma? Or was Yzma fired in this timeline? And if that's true, why is it waiting for him to fail to become emperors? Plus, you know in the first movie that he was trained to be an emperor of private tutors from birth. Therefore, he must know what he is doing. <br /> <br /> Why is Kronk a student? He's about 25, they said in the first movie. He is an adult who goes to high school. Do everyone think he's a moron? I really like Kronk, but I think because of his age and because everyone knows he works for Yzma, he had to be a teacher. Being a Home-I teacher will be upright in his feet. <br /> <br /> Malina is very unlikely. She is supposed to be Kuzco's love interest / moral compass. But much time, she comes off and knows everything. She usually says I want me to be proud because I am beautiful and smart. <br /> <br /> She has ESP when it comes to Kuzco and knows when he's in trouble, when he cheats, or even when he sings the Hot Hot Hottie song in his head, though she's the leader straight A + in all her classes. <br /> <br /> She looks more interested in using her prettiness to get Kuzco to do the right thing and do well in school and meet him. In fact, she looks more motherly to Kuzco than a love interest. <br /> <br /> Yzma. As I bought before Yzma tried to get Kuzco to fail, she became imperial. Not sure how it is supposed to work with discarded people and everyone. Yzma seems to be reliving the first movie in each episode. In almost every show she appears, she changes Kuzco into an animal in the hope that he will fail a class. (There are only 3 times I can think of that.) The jokes that Yzma is old are not as clever in the show as they were the movie. And classic jokes about Yzma are used in the show (like the "Trek the Level, Krunk!", Rollercoaster and the Laboratory). <br /> <br /> Also a few other points that don't make sense in this series. The fact that when Kuzco is assigned something, everyone acts like this command, let him pass or fail the class, but he seems to succeed in every assignment given to him. So why does one assignment matter so much? <br /> <br /> Seriously, who governs the kingdom as it goes on? Do they have a consul or a flight attendant? You never see anyone ruling the kingdom unless Kuzco has hit his forces back or Yzma is emperor. <br /> <br /> Why is Kuzco going to a regular farmers' school? Shouldn't he learn how to lead a country, what to do in case of war or something that will be useful to him in the future? I could see how to quit ordinary classes like farming (so he would know how to prepare the land for famine or something) but tie it down? How is this helpful? <br /> <br /> Now I know somebody is going to say, "But it's not supposed to make sense, it's supposed to be funny." Then they should have more funny things there. All the funny things about the show are already in the movie. Also, if they see some of these big plot holes, why not make them fun on them like in the movie? (For example, when Yzma and Kronk come to the secret lab before Kuzco and Pacha and Yzma and Kronk can't explain how they got their first.) <br /> <br /> There are some good points, that's nice to see some of the characters from the first movie in the series like bucky and monkey with the bug. Pacha and his family are still very good characters with a good earthly feel. I feel that this series will be fun for younger children. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the series is not as good as the movie on which it is based, but it can be good for younger children.
