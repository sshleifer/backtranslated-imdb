Some guy, called Karl Rhamarevich, learns how to live, even after death through telekinesis. He was destroyed in a mausoleum. That night, July (Meg Tilly) has to go out there in the night to get into a group called "The Sisters". And Charles's "power" is full of bloom. <br /> <br /> Silly movie. I saw it in a theater when I was 21 and was usually bored. The PG rating had to cut me off - it's a horror movie for kids. One real stupid scene at the end has a body that breaks through concrete to hit a young guy! Initially, lights are placed in HEAD, making it impossible for the body to use its arms and there is no way to break someone through concrete. When you notice such errors, the movie does not notice its work. <br /> <br /> It has two good scenes - two of the "Sisters" are crossed by the drug bodies. At one point, one of the sisters pushes a body into the stomach - her hand goes into the body and she can't stretch it! That scene has remained with me ever since. And there is a nice little bit that includes a body and a toothbrush at the end (which sounds to me). But the rest of the movie is a dull, dull memory. Only for children - adults will be bored. I give it a 3.
