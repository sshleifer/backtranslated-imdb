I was very willing to give Rendition the benefit of the doubt when it comes to all the negative press I read about it. Even about three quarters of the way through, I still thought it was a bit incoherent, but otherwise a solid story reached its conclusion. And then the bottom fell out. I do not want to destroy the movie for anyone, but the conclusion flips everything you liked to be fact about what and when things got on its head, for no specific reason whatsoever except to say the world, yes, I'm cool, and I know. I love a good twist, I love a good ah-ha moment, but only when it is relevant to the story at hand. The complete deception of the filmmakers has no purpose on the overall story. Timelines need not be parallel and they do not need to be separated per week. All the revelation that was made was a merit that I was about to give director Gavin Hood and scriptwriter Kelley Sane. This could be a good thing because looking back, it wasn't really as solid a movie as I initially would blindly give credit for. <br /> <br /> It is an admirable thing to try to make the thermal version in the film public's consciousness, but it needs a story that has gone deeper into the relevant connotations and politics, rather than shining the issues for a story of a woman in distress about her husband's disappearance and the fear-filled rebellion of a daughter against her "interrogator" father. I understand that the bottom-line movie participant needs a human quality to understand and therefore I am not mistaken for that route. My only problem is that we don't get enough of what the title says we should get. Instead, many plot lines are shown, all of which are brought confusingly before being returned to the northern regions of our consciousness, never returned. There is so much you forget about what you need to care for, woman? the interrogator? the CIA agent? the victim? the senator? the Middle Eastern daughter and her diligent boyfriend? In the end, I just really gave up and the movie made me take it where it was, which ultimately was someone else who first explained it. <br /> <br /> Everything that happens happens due to a bomb blast. This bomb is in the middle of every story thread and ultimately ends so innocently that you can't believe how big the waves it has spread. The old butterfly wings float is in full effect, because one boy's mission of revenge eventually destroys the lives of so many. Whether through death, destruction, physical and emotional abuse or suicide during the career; nobody really escapes intact. However, at the end of the day, just the story of the man who had been torn to Egypt for torture was very interesting. We are led to believe that from the beginning he is innocently innocent, but he is waterborne, electricity, etc. To extract any information he may have. When those in power have a man without compassion or reason to stop until something is wasted (whether it is true or not) and an observer without the intestines to share or stop, the situation gives him a degree of intrigue on how it can be possible. end. The three actors involved are all the best parts of the film and prove that the movie itself was involved with them as a whole. <br /> <br /> I don't want people like Reese Witherspoon, the victim's wife, or her senate employed by Peter Sarsgaard, as they really do a good job with what they are given. Even Meryl Streep, her cook-like accent, and Alan Arkin do not overdo it. However, it is the trio of Jake Gyllenhaal's CIA agent, Yigal Naor's interrogator, and Omar Metwally's victim who really shines. Naor is brilliant, as the Egyptian sharply remains at work as a razor while he is compassionate and worried about a father trying to find his daughter. This man is brutal, but he is because it is what his profession demands and why he is relied on to find answers. Metwally never gives a false second during the pain and suffering that is being inflicted on him. Whether he is lying or really knows nothing about the terrorist who calls his cellphone, we are completely buying his condition and are desperately waiting to see the situation. As far as Gyllenhaal is concerned, someone who accomplishes a performance in his career with varying degrees of success finds a part that suits him. The demons enter his soul through the ordeal. He is forced to carry a part of his body and mind, which has both ambivalence and a need to intervene. The two feelings struggle with each other until he makes a final decision, and his stoic, boyish demeanor tackles that battle perfectly. <br /> <br /> It's just as bad that one plot line never finds itself as the main focal point, despite the name of the movie. With all the rubbish around the edges we are overturned too much, in a sense of time and order, and then slapped in the face, as it all laughs more at us, then a has not seen it. "I was deceived and unfortunately it was the lasting effect I took out of the movie. If it was more straightforward, I could have enjoyed myself even more, but as it is, one can still get some positive from the weak. take it all.
