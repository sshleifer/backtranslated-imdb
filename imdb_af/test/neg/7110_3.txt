This 1988 movie was recently shown on a cable channel. We wanted to see another movie, which supposedly started, but because a mix, Rent-a-Cop, was shown in that time. Never seen it when it was released commercially, we gave it a chance. Bad decision. <br /> <br /> One wonder what the people behind the picture had to continue with "Rent-a-Cop" or how they sold it to the studio behind the spread. This movie seems to be the wrong time. This movie does not add anything new to its genre. This is completely predictable, as soon as the basic point of departure is shown, we know how it will end. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds plays a wooden church. This actor can do better, but who knows what happened behind the scenes, or perhaps the direction Jerry London gave him, has the opposite effect. Mr. Reynolds has one expression throughout that movie. He does not register any emotion at all. <br /> <br /> Lisa Minnelli, if the hooker who saw the original Chicago hotel hit, doesn't make sense. The romance between her Della and Church seems evil from the beginning. She and Mr. Reynolds plays one-dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this turkey.
