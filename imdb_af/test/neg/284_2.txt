SPOILER !! Terrible camera work, horrible writing, non-existent plot, and numerous plot wholesale. Great acting! Except for Julia Roberts. Who is badly playing someone bad Julia Roberts. Catherine Zeta Jones is rich in this movie. <br /> <br /> During the movie, repeatedly revenue, on each of the twelve (!) characters. Twelve are too much, even for a classic like 12 Angry Men. And the problem is that we get bored with the characters, when everyone is in the same room, doing the same thing. <br /> <br /> Yep Clooney eats. Yep, eat Pitt. Yes, the "Jewish" eats. Yes, the geek eats. Yes, the bodybuilder eats. Yes, sir, is sensitive to eating. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep - Yep. Yep. Wow! It happens at least three times in the movie. Yes, they are all in cars, bored. Yes, they are all arrested, scared. Yes, they are all pushed out of jail. <br /> <br /> But it was only when I was home that I realized how badly they were on this one. It's a hoarse movie, right? That's what I'm going to see, right? But when I moved in and put my car keys in the swivel jug, I first realized: Nothing was really stolen in this movie! That's right. It's a sought-after movie, where nothing is stolen. Oh, they try. They are trying to steal a boring document or something from someone's home (whatever), and it seems that it has already been stolen. 20 minutes of my life wasted. Then they try to steal some eggs from a museum (YAWN!), And they screw it up and are arrested. <br /> <br /> Then we see how a fairy-tale French stole the egg, even before they did it. get all the joy of "Entrapment", except this time the person is in the tight cats that dance around the false lasers ... an ugly, shiny French man. Um. <br /> <br /> But it seems he doesn't steal the egg either. In fact, our heroes completely stole the egg, LOOOONG, in another movie. It would be a BIG movie to watch if they made that movie. <br /> <br /> Instead, we see a 30 second black and white clip on how they robbed some college students of his backpack. You've heard me ... the daring hairdresser, the ultimate lift - building this 2 and a half hours of the bad shit - are stealing a college student's backpack, creatively fighting baseball do teams come and divert him and replace his backpack with an identical backpack? What ?? <br /> <br /> Ugh. I tell you, it was so bad, I didn't even realize how bad it was - just how bad I was - until I got home.
