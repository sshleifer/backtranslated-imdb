In the real works of art, Elizabeth Wurtzel is the sexy drama queen every man wants to do, but no one wants to wake up later. Her screen saver, Christina Ricci, is the ugly artsy-wannabe girl who wants each and every one desperate, but no guy will touch her. Therefore, in the Prozac nation, the unresolved 2001 movie of Wurtzel's 1990s bestseller book of the same name, there are immediate problems. OK, the trouble starts before Ricci's miscarriage, which has the emotional range of a few - is it a wonder that her main acting was in the two Addams family flies? First, she is bizarre, with big eyes and a bulging forehead, which looks like the 2001 fetal star: a Space Odyssey. Second, she always plays brats. But thirdly, the way movies try to make it look, any man will be attracted to her. In one scene in the film, her dad, Ruby (Michelle Williams) and Liz, pass through Harvard, and all the guys' tongues are on Ricci, not the super cute and sexy Williams. Hello ??. Reality check time ??. This material has asked for the Andy Warhol treatment. Here's his version of the movie. A five minute shot of an inner tube needle. A five minute shot from Wurtzel's hairy pudenda. A five minute shot of her sleeping naked and stoned on the bed. She rises, gives the middle finger to the audience. Cue credits. See, less than twenty minutes to distill Wurtzel's entire life. And, oh yes, Warhol's movie wouldn't have cast Ricci. Even Michelle Williams would have been better, and after seeing Ricci's fiery bosom, I'd have to offer anything Williams or any other baby in the right place. Ricci is almost the shit for a movie, and how she keeps working is a mystery. Consider her performances in mediocre, bad movies like Monster, Sleepy Hollow and Woody Allen's Anything Else also with Jason Biggs, and now portray another actress in her role, and instantly the movies may look better, if not big. She is the female counterpart for banal, wood, milquetast actors such as Tom Cruise and Leonardo Dicaprio.
