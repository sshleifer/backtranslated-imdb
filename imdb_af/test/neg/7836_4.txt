The story: Alain, a French policeman, was shocked to discover that he had a twin brother when his body was found in Nice. Investigating the murder, he finds out he is in possession of a list indicating the actions of the Russian Mafia. Through his brother's friend, Alain helps Russian gangsters and corrupt FBI agents try to find the list. <br /> <br /> "Maximum Risk" is another of the long list of action films owned by Jean-Claude Van Damme. . As far as it goes, it is strictly formulable. The script sticks to the cliches and the acting is mediocre. There are some good action sequences, with an ingenious car hunt, a battle in a burning building, an escape by rooftops, a brutal battle in a lift and JCVD ​​raising his enemies over train flight flight. Director Ringo Lam does everything at a reasonable pace.
