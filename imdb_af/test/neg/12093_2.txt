I really like Ryan Reynolds and Hope Davis and I really hope to watch this last night on DVD. Mainly if I try to avoid reviews until I see something myself and form my own opinion. Big mistake! My 2/10 is for the first segment that is fair in fairness and if they made the movie about the characters in section 1 alone, it may have risen above the 5/10 point. When it moved into the TV reality show, territory made it sky high. Ryan Reynolds captured the essence of an actor on the edge, but as a gay TV writer and well-known creator / dedicated family man, he was definitely less effective. From the blurb on the box I expected a flashback on the line of 'Memento' - unfortunately it is nowhere near the standard of the movie.
