This movie was so careless, running and uneven that it was an effort to watch the whole thing. (I actually thought a few interesting plotting elements could be developed.) It was nothing more than a "come-of-age" movie for the thirty-something generation. Total crap and I have no idea what Julianne Moore did, because that was the only reason I chose it from the shelf.
