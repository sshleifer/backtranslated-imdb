This movie makes "Glitter" look like "Schindler's List." Tarantino and the Weinsteins should be considered more carefully before placing their names on a product. Green Lighting of a P.O.S. So, regardless of the friendships involved, it's just bad things. Larry Bishop must be kept at all costs of a movie camera. Author / director / producer / actor Bishop shows that his skills are inadequate for any of those jobs. A negligence project went south, "Hell Ride" usually allows good actors to chew the scenery ... at least when the camera is not centered on Bishop's poor attempts to steal every scene he is in. (What is virtually every sketch!) My last three words about "Hell Ride" are STINK, STANK, STUNK.
