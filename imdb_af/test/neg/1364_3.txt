Being a big fan of horror movies and always succeeding in getting something good about a picture, but this movie didn't keep my interest or attention. This story revolves around a father and his daughter and a girlfriend, as his wife died a few years ago. These people are facing a terrible situation in a village they stop and visit, and all the senior citizens in this town are fighting against these people and are nearly killing them. This film reminds me of a movie called "Children of the Corn", because it really involves children who are presented to Satan and his instruments of terror. There are many chicks, mambo jumble and a playground device that destroys a whole family in their station wagon, as well as dolls that kill a man and woman.
