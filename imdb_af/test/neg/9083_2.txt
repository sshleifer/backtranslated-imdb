Again, Bronson's talent is mostly messed up with this shock-value 1984 thriller that is (uncut) very disturbing than most of what is still out today. The fact that "The Evil That Men Do" is very disturbing (in its verbal and visual portrayals of torture) is not the problem. This is the shameless gratification in which it is presented. Interestingly, this film seems to symbolize the last part of Bronson's career, torturing many of his fans with the same equally predictable and unconscious plots. One hopes this good actor will rise again.
