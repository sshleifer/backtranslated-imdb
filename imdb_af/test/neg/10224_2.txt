This movie seems to be for the sole purpose of irritating me. Everything I hate about movies is present: false sentimentality, extreme crisis, bad child actors and more features abundant. It ignores the fact that it depicts the utmost ignorance of American sports enthusiasts, with many of the governors confessing that a soccer ball is like a lemon. What ?! It's a rugby ball. The story follows a group of no hopers who get a new teacher who wants them (who happen to learn the class in a short dress) and they are interested in football. Of course they are all rubbish (don't forget, they are no hope) except for one child who has left El Paso. Blah Blah, and so on, and the kids are still not good soccer players, but a good heart comes out and no hope is reversed in a lot of benevolent children. Hell, even the adults begin to come around; drunk caring parents, illegal immigrants are left out of the hook ... groaning. <br /> <br /> These movie stars Steve Guttenberg. Before you run your local video store to grab a copy, hold on for a moment. Guttenberg is rubbish. No no; let's come see, how did this man ever become in a movie? I have absolutely no idea, and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea. Olivia d'Abo dies next to Steve and doesn't impress him either. She just seems to go through the movements and look beautiful while doing it. Although I have no problems with the latter; her performance does not make the film credit. The child actors who make up the rest of the movie are just as bad as you would expect from such a movie. Most of them are disgusting and / or irritating and it does not make a fine view. There is a goat in the movie that plays the mascot and he does a good job; but you won't see a movie for a goat, so don't see the movie.
