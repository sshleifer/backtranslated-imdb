I was amazed after watching this piece, if you saw an episode of TOM and JERRY in which Jerry poured a liquid on him and became invisible than you would probably see the same cartoons, with an extra EROTIC topping that a man becomes making invisible S * I * is the conclusion of the movie. too much sex in a movie movie-themed movie does not worth it :( And above all, I was surprised when the same cartoon was used to show the Mr.Invisible and it was really awful, I have to say, flour drops from the rack and our own Mr.Invisible becomes visible "watch ZACK and MIRI make a porn" I bet you won't get bored, <br /> <br /> 1/10 of me
