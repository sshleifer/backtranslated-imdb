It's probably the worst documentary I've ever seen. It looks so amateur. Chris Hegedus was one of the directors of The War Room, which was a good movie (though a little one-sided), but it looks nice. Startup.com looked like it was shot in the old cellar. The quality was so sorry I couldn't stand to see it. I saw about 30 minutes or so and I had to take it back to Blockbuster and get something else. I can't understand how something so amateur of someone like Chris Hegedus is. How did hell win it? The War Room certainly deserved an award, just like another big documentary called Ameragosa (both won). This documentary seemed to have been done by Uncle Joe who also did weddings in the weekends. Shaky, dimly lit, unobstructed lighting, bad sound, a 10-year-old, can make a better movie than the guy did.
