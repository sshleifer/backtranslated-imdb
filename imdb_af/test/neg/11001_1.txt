I had to suffer three times through this movie, while I was a zombie extra in the director's new movie After Sundown. The first time I saw this movie, the director was standing next to me and a clear fake and stuffy hand came out of nowhere and grabbed one of the characters. I couldn't take it anymore. I laughed straight in front of the man. The movie has no direction and the one thing that makes this movie decent (Female Nudity) is nowhere to be found. I'm a fan of low budget horror movies, but it was just too much for me. The worst was that I had to watch it so many times. Also don't expect the new movie to be better.
