Oh, how did I laugh at the first few scenes. This foolish movie about an 11-year-old carrying a gun, stealing cars, robbed stores, burglary houses, making money out of other kids, burning homes, shooting rats, buying drugs, distributing drugs to his mother and friends, and kill a man. What a great comedy! But it wasn't meant to be a comedy. It was meant as a social drama. How can this be? The events in this movie are absurd and ridiculous. The characters are all stereotyped right out of a 4-year-old's strip-induced immature imagination. The dialogue is ridiculous; people talk like morons. It's a very silly movie. <br /> <br /> The first scenes are indeed very funny, for all the wrong reasons. But the unintentional hilarity of the idiotic premise runs out for a short while, and then the laugh comes seldom; By that time, the viewer cannot believe what he sees and is alternately surprised and bored by what follows (if he has at least half a brain). <br /> <br /> A short movie, but feels like an eternity. The movie is actually a seriously intended attempt to show the world of young degenerates, while it mimics, such as "Fun". There is just as much air of phoniness over everything; The children, the adults, all have credibility in their actions and dialogue. The child in the lead emphasized his way through the movie as if he had seen all the Jimmy Cagney movies at least a hundred times. And typically enough, the child is not portrayed as a reservoir of evil, but rather as a wrong artistic talent. But of course. Every young hooligan is misunderstood - society has made him bad. Poor child. <br /> <br /> The film is embarrassing; a collection of old, sometimes hilarious clich√©s compiled to make a movie lacking intelligence and meaning. The intellectual level of the movie is zero.
