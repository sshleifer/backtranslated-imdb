Obviously, the above commentary about the movie was made by someone on the crew. I never remember a movie that is more offensive to the talented actors or the audience to watch. In my 30 years of movies, this is the only one I've ever walked out. Bad humor, bad jokes, bad gags, bad editing, bad plot, etc. <br /> <br /> Note to producer: It's never funny to hunt people based on race. Big that you're trying to be politically correct by including all breeds, but you're still looking for people based on race, and that's sick.
