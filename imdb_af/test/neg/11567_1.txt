What a despair movie. Dress actors in furry rags, place in suburban desert, roll cameras and hope for the best. One can only think and thank the shooter when their characters were killed by sockpuppets, saving them further humiliation in this dullfest. It compares Monster to a go-go as the best cure for insomnia ever made. Oh God - how can I fill 10 lines explaining how overwhelmingly bored, everyone looks in this movie? Whiney crappy plastic bungling robot that annoys everyone on and off, giant spider reduced to a single giant hairy leg pulled by rope, actors desperately trying not to look at the camera while mumbling out of the dialogs.
