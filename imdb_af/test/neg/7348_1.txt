I always hated this delayed performance. I like the performances of Cartoon Network such as "Dexter's Laboratory" or "Megas XLR. But I never thought of this piece. Basically because it has stupid characters (the good or the bad guys seem to be spiritually delayed) they have stupid votes (Bubbles in particular. She is supposed to be the "cute" character of the show, but she is incredibly annoying.) The story lines are very, very silly. Some episodes could have been interesting, but almost always the show. a lovely character, the music was terrible and the animation was the worst I saw, even a five-year-old boy could sign better! I don't see why the whole world doesn't look Like this piece of garbage. "The Powerpuff Girls" One of the worst cartoons ever made, luckily "Foster Home for the imaginary friends" of the same creator was better.
