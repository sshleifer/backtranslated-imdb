It's so bad, I can't move away. I still ask myself, "Why?" "Why?" with every scene. <br /> <br /> There is no continuity, but then again if you want to make a very open-minded gay movie with a fetishist attitude towards all things. Big, Big Boats, Big Boys, Big Planes, then don't worry about things like plot or character. I'm amazed, and very worried that the CAG looks so much like Richard Pryor. It seems wrong to make a Pryor look like a horrible movie. But I can't tear myself. This movie is the first movie I've ever reviewed. This is how phenomenally bad and bizarre it is. It motivated me to join this site. I counted 50 main characters. Perhaps if I were stoned, I could follow it, but as it is, I feel like I'm in a bad dream, where it is always 1988 and we were the biggest party on earth.
