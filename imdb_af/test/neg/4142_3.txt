This movie was a thorough slideshow. There was no development of the story. Viewers were thrown into the story without explanation and forfeited themselves for trying to figure out what's going on. The action sequences were good, but confusing. They weren't the Matrix and they weren't Crouching Tiger. This movie is best for cable television where you don't have to pay to see it or convince a friend to rent it and then watch and watch. As a big Jet Li fan, I expected more. How can anyone who is involved in China at one time set his name on this one ???
