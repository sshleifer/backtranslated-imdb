There is simply no quality about this movie. OK, some of the costumes are OK, but they're nothing you can't see, says the Conan movie. And how about Ator's hair? I can't believe it's part of a series! I will say one thing about this film: it was considered bad enough for a fair lampooning by the early cast of MST3K and I suggest to anyone curious enough to see how bad this movie is to the version of the movie for look moral support as nothing else.
