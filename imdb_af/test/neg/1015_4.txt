Since Paul Kersey was short of real family to avenge, turning the third installment into the "Death Wish" saga back to New York to visit an old warrior. He just comes to find out that Brooklyn has completely changed into a paced gangland and that the juvenile thugs are killing his friend and constantly terrorizing all the other tenants of a ramshackle apartment building. Kersey agrees with the local police commissioner, conquers the heart of his blonde attorney, throws away numerous villains with an impressive Wildey Magnum rifle, and slowly slows down and inspires the petrified New Yorkers to stand up. Okay, there's no longer a point to defend the "Death Wish" series after seeing part three. The original 1974 was a masterpiece on the social drama as much as it did on retribution, and while it was pure exploitation, part two had quite a few redeeming features and events were logically linked to those taking place. in the first. Number three often feels like a completely separate franchise. Kersey is no longer an architect, he is ten times more social and talented than he was and suddenly no one, not even the police, is against vigilante actions? All these changes and several other aspects make it more obvious that Michael Winner and Charles Bronson reduced their "Death Wish" success to be a purely brainless and exploitative action series, with a mortality rate that goes up with each episode. increases, the weapon that grows more and more explosive and criminals who make nastier, strenuous, mean and much harder to kill. However, the men did not realize that the non-stop spitfire of violence actually creates an opposite effect, namely this extremely monotonous and much more boring than the previous two. I once read a brilliant review referring to "Death Wish 3" as the pure definition of movie masturbation. This description can no longer be profound, since the script moves from one deviating execution sequence to the next. Especially in the last twenty minutes, a complete "orgy" of gun fire, explosions and executions has been realized through improvised home-made measures. Yi-HAAA! This entry into the series has quite an interesting supportive role, including Martin Balsam ("Psycho", "12 Angry Men") as the tired man who holds machine guns in his closet, Ed Lauter ("Family Plot", "The Longest Yard" ) as the slightly unorthodox buyer and even Alex Winter (from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure!) in his debut role as one of the thugs.
