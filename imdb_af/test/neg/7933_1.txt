** Maybe spoilers ** ** difficult to spoil this thing if it is, but just in case ** Gee's, I don't see how anyone would like it! It was like a "made for T.V" show and still nice for it. Very fake snow, bad acting by top stars, bad action and the crazy pine forest in Detroit. What is it? I didn't really think it would be a good movie, but I was hoping to be entertained. No, we fell asleep halfway and had to finish the next day. I could have easily restored the rest (but then I would have missed those pink bushes!) I am so glad I missed it at the theater! Bad enough to waste $ 3.50 at the video store. And I'm a lover of cop, action and drama movies. It was a very smelly 1 out of 10 star. Give me the original any day !!
