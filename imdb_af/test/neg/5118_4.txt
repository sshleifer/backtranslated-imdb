Bare Wench is another softcore parody of the Blair Witch project (I think there are about two dozen things out there). It has 5 very attractive women (including Nikki Fritz, Julie Smith and Julie Strain), and one brave man whose only purpose is to provide comic relief. Oh, so I think Cool Very beautiful women, with soft lesbian sex with each other very 10 minutes or so. It should be really good. "<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the producers have blown it. There is nothing in this video that actually qualifies as a sex scene. There are a few false starts, but the majority of the action is just the women sitting in front of the camera I think when the producers spent their money on the women and spent more to remove their clothes, they didn't have the money to get them to do something, and I suspect they too All their dedicated nudity used time prematurely, because at the end of the video there is a huge amount of senseless dialogue that is of course used for no other reason than to run the run time. "You're a liar! No, you are! You're going in the cave! No, you go! I think we should go home! Well, I don't! "It goes on and on forever. <br /> <br /> There are better things than that.
