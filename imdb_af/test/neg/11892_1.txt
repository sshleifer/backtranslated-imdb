Leni Riefenstahl will be ashamed of the disgusting propaganda. Moore tries to call "humor". That this film, and Moore's other changes, actually attract fans, proves that it is unfortunately possible to deceive some of the people. <br /> <br /> Let's see if we can bait foreigners. Let's see if our outdated factories can expand. Let's see if we can add the sum of hate in the world. Let's see if we can pretend we're funny. Let's see if our non-isolation Charles Lindbergh can. The only thing that Moore lacks compared to Lindbergh is a GÃ¶ring medal. <br /> <br /> Although, in the film, Moore had a bit of self-decline. In this movie, Mr. General Motors chief executive Roger Smith as a rounded, rude elite. Moore could do it in 1989, but now that Moore surrendered himself to ceaseless, elusive elitism, this characterization of Roger Smith has been ironic. Who wouldn't really be Roger's friend than Michael Moore's?
