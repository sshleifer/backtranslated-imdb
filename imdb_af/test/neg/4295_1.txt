I just wrote a comment on "ACES HIGH" (1976) and it reminds me of this movie I saw as a kid when released. Since then I only watched it once and it was more than enough. As Kevin says well, "it's a total waste of time". Aside from the nice battles, the rest is a sequence of bad patrols with actors struggling with a lousy script and equally lousy direction. I don't remember the foolish German accent that Kevin mentioned in his comment, but it's another pathetic mistake. if Corman tries to persuade the characterization of the German pilots, why didn't he use German actors or mention the parts? On the other hand, a good example of the terrifying Hollywood style of movies with their "villains" is so clearly identifiable, not only by their brutal actions but also by their grotesque accent. <br /> <br /> Talking about "cruel actions" the ridiculous scene was Lieutenant Hermann Goering murdered English nurses during an airbase attack are an absolutely disgusting piece of propaganda that is being done with a historic decline. If you want to see a factual, moving, very well-educated and focused film about the WWI watch ACES HIGH (1976) or the wonderful classic "THE DAWN PATROL" (1938), you won't be disappointed.
