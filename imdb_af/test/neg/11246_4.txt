... this one is just not worth the cost of a movie ticket. What these filmmakers have done cannot be called proper filmmaking; rather, they chose only sixteen students of certain diversity (though not quite as diverse as the reviews suggested) and detached them. The results are to be brutally open, much more boring, self-sufficient, overwhelmed and indifferent grainy than truly insightful. <br /> <br /> Of course there are moments of recognition and identification of the kind Only possible in documentary film, but overall there is not much more truth here than in "Bully" or, in that respect, a decent TV documentaries of the same kind. Although talking about sex and sexual diversity and racism, the film doesn't bring anything to the table that will be of use to anyone who has seriously thought of any of these issues. And while some segments have no purpose other than to give a little (welcome welcome) comic relief, the five-minute limit is usually no longer emotionally involved with any of the students. An interesting idea, but thumbs down for CHAIN ​​CAMERA.
