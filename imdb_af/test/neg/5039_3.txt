To this day, Malcolm McLaren tells someone enough to believe the Sex Pistols was his idea and that the group members were his dolls to make him money. There is a good reason why he does this, that he is a liar. <br /> <br /> Here are some real facts. <br /> <br /> * McLaren was actually approached by the group as manager, not the other way around. <br /> <br /> * The Pistols were a decent organic band and not created by McLaren or anyone else. Jones and Cook were childhood. Rotten and Vicious also went a long way back. This is something that has led to the unfair criticism of the Pistols over the years, as they are compared to the manufactured boy ties. <br /> <br /> * The band and no one else wrote the songs, recorded them, played live, created the publicity and interviewed. <br /> <br /> * McLaren did not spark the Bill Grundy incident. The Pistols first appeared on the program because Queen pulled out. According to the group, McLaren was in the back of the paper as arrests on the point. <br /> <br /> * Johnny Rotten left the band. He was not dismissed. <br /> <br /> * By far the Sex Pistols John Lydon (Rotten) actually sued him for control and a considerable amount of money. Of the evidence used by Lydon's lawyers, McLaren's boast was 'The Great Rock & Roll Swindle'. It would indicate that McLaren is not too bright, despite his affective. <br /> <br /> * The retrenchments and subsequent repayments of A & M and EMI were not redesigned, but it was simply the way things went out. <br /> <br /> * McLaren boasts the money he made from the group. If he was capable, he could have done much more. It seems he doesn't really correct gigs. <br /> <br /> * McLaren's claim at the start of the movie he invented from the punk rock can be rejected in ten seconds. The Pistols were not the first punk band, but the most high profile. <br /> <br /> It's a horrible movie. The only part worthy of watching is the real footage of the band, which is later used better in 'The Filth And The Fury'.
