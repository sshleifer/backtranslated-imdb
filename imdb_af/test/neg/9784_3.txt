My jaw has looked at this movie so many times, I have bruises. Okay, conceded, I really don't have the quality of, for example, the other or even thirteen ghosts (the new one who was just scary and still head and shoulders above this madness). Someone else noticed the thin characters ... I won't call them "thin". "Thin" implies that there may be something for them. What about almost non-existence? In no particular order have we: The girl who will shout; The American Who will portray it all; The Macho Guy Who will only stumble through everything until he is killed: The wise black man who dies early; The Extra Guy who is there to die first; The Extra Woman Who Is Playing Hard. That's it. It's your character list and that's what they are and what they stay from start to finish. If they were "thin," they might change a little from start to finish. But they don't. Well, okay, the American guy decides he'll stay at the field at the end and the Screaming girl goes back to where she came from. It's the change. Other than that, they all do according to their dedicated roles and do not actually reject any real emotion when they eventually come together with the threat. <br /> <br /> Now, the producers get props for an original threat, I'll say. I understood the story was going to be "trembling", but with ants instead of giant worms. I give the author credit: it's very cool, very scary ants and what they do with legs is excellent. (The first time the "bone nightmare" appears, I admit that I have jumped a few feet.) Unfortunately, the very cool concept is very fast in the desert in the desert. We get a lot of comment on ants that may or may not be true, but we don't get much of the mythology on which the threat is based. And we get every monster film cliché ever made. People go to places where they know they should not and when they do not have compelling reasons. Moronic characters are trying to impede and kill our heroes. One character has a double duty as "scientist who does not want to kill the monster but study it". A very cool gadget is only introduced so that the American can tell everyone about ants what, give, I hope everyone knows anyway. Then the gadget broke. Our heroes run out of one thing that can hold the threat in the bay. And then there is that final, annoying moment when we know the threat is still with us - and wonder exactly how and how the hey came the hero or heroine through it. It makes everything that used to be useless and fake before. <br /> <br /> Three stars for the cool use of ants and legs. Nothing for clichés, clunky dialogue and dim bulb characters.
