MARY, MARY, BLOODY MARY is a good killer. It has a uniformly attractive role, the action is seldom boring. There are many murders. And the production values ​​are not bad. But in the end, it plays like a standard TV episode from the 1970s with a little nudity thrown. The film is the end product of a writer trying to make a pure commercial film. There is very little depth here and the movie spends too much time chasing and action scenes. Apart from the scene on the beach with the old man, MMBM is almost without any fear or suspense or fear. The director has very little understanding of the horror genre. <br /> <br /> It's viewable, though it doesn't leave a lasting impression.
