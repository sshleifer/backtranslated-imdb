Hopper has never been worse than he felt, as this movie is only worth a B performance and he gives a pretty good one. Outside Madsen and Hopper, the play is terrible; you have seen better at your local high school. The sound and sometimes the editing and camera shots are low side of B movies. The canvas scene is one of the best movies I've ever seen (it doesn't even come in the movie). The script was probably a big 10-page sketch, but if it came out on a full-length movie, there were more holes in it, then the bodies left Madsen behind. I must say Hopper dressed in a nice suit that the Hummer has made me laugh out loud, but I don't think it was the intention. Yes, there is a small style, and Hopper can always attract my interest. But the interesting plot concept never pays off and you wonder why you wasted your time, it wasted it.
