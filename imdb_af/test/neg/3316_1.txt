This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Not only is it a comedy that is not funny, but it is also very badly done with an up-to-the-minute full of unnecessary dividers and other effects. <br /> <br /> The two "heroes" with their fantasy language are just annoying and it confuses me a lot that they touch the whole genealogy. But the worst of all the nonsense is the cheapest attempt to appeal the movie, referring to German history and showing sensitive aspects of the "heroes", who find its highlight to show how Erkan and Stefan heals a mentally ill woman with their "joyful" lifestyle (!). But I didn't expect anything better from director Michael "Bully" Herbig, who also made two non-funny TV shows, a not-funny-western movie and an almost non-funny SF comedy movie. But Erkan and Stefan were - just a little better in some of their uprising programs. For me, the only good thing about the movie is Alexandra Neldel, which is very nice to me.
