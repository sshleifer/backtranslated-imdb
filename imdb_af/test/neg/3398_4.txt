The incomparable Paul Naschy, a horror movie icon from Spain, gives his talents to this entertaining, as well as non-distributed film. What starts out as an action movie ends a horror story. All I can say is just to go back and enjoy the ride. <br /> <br /> Paul Naschy plays a cold hired by some shady Japanese diamond hunters (one of whom is a flame carrying his child) wiping a diamond from a Belgian businessman. When the act is done, the attraction of the diamonds is too tempting for Paul to dismiss so that he kills his Japanese cohorts. His girlfriend, whose brother Paul killed, promises revenge and pushes Paul through the forest, shoots him up and lets him die. However, Paul was found by an egg head with two hearing daughters and brought to his estate to recover. <br /> <br /> At the estate, two daughters, Silvia Aguilar and Azucena Hernandez, are fighting for Paul in his frail condition, With the busty Silvia Aguilar determined not to lose to the sweet and primitive Azucena. But things get hairy for Mr. Naschy, who begins to see the spirit of the daughter's long dead mother on the estate. Connect it to the Japanese lass looking for the finishing touches of Paul and he is pulled from two sides. <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (The story goes in a number of ways and doesn't fully cope. Script builds a battle for Paul among the daughters, but Silvia, whose character seems assertive and unstable just let Azucena win in the Paul Naschy games without making a fight, personally I would have preferred the haunting story to seek the revenge of the Japanese woman <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ <br /> WARNING: $$$ (Paul Naschy, as always, is nice to watch, but he spends A bit too much time in the bed to recover from his wounds, with his nice Silvia Aguilar and the beautiful Azucena Hernandez, who played with Mr Naschy in the jewel "The Craving." Both girls do a good job. ) <br /> <br /> NEWS: $ $ (You will find very brief summaries of both Aguilar and Hernandez, but they are strategically placed and keep the cover low.
