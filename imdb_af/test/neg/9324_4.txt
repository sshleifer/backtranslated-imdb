I found Dominion to be a lousy attempt to continue the story's success. The original movie was a story about evil, and how it could infiltrate our lives. <br /> <br /> Schrader's version is lacking in anger. Viewers do not get an overwhelming sense of fear, fear or even prejudice. Harlin's version presents clear evil, shows violations of the church's holiness, and builds a convincing story that is likely given Father Merrin's background. Schrader's story makes one wonder exactly what happened. Dominion does not reveal the emotions of viewers to empathize with Father Merrin, and makes the viewer wonder exactly why he was upset in the first place. <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in seeing a sequel to see the original life Exorcist: The Beginning.
