The original Australian Kath & Kim is brilliant. Why should American producers rebuild and destroy another classic show? Remember the original version of "The Office" with Ricky Gervais. It was an absolute masterpiece, and it was not necessary to repeat it again. The producers said the British humor of "The Office" and the Australian humor of "Kath & Kim" would not translate to an American audience ......... WHAT ??? So actually they say Americans are too stupid and stupid to understand the jokes, so they have to redesign the shows with the top childish gags so that Americans can understand the humor. The original Australian version of Kath & Kim is fantastic and very funny. Avoid the American version like the plague !!
