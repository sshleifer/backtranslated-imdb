I just saw this movie and all I can say is where is the ride in these days. It seems to be an excellent 2nd feature in a ride in 1977 (perhaps with one of those Joan Collins movies), but it's just worth checking out if you're feeling nostalgic for the 70's. Dumb plot full of holes, but it reminds one of the era in which it was made. Interesting to see that Melanie Griffith is so young and Anne Lockhart is very attractive, though not much of an actress. In fact, there is not much action in this movie. It's kind of a Dukes or Hazzard adventure without a twang or a 1969 Dodge charger jumping over things in the Woods. But there is a Mecrury Comet that jumps into this one over a rubbish dump!
