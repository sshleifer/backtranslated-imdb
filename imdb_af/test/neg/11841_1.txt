So I was sick with the flu on Saturday and the silver lining was that the sci-fi channel had a dinosaur movie marathon that day - the "Carnosaur" trilogy, Pterodactyl, "Raptor Island". Then I switched on my cable to see what movie SciFi was in its glamorous Saturday former time slot. Some movie I've never heard of was called 'Raptor'. I was very excited. The movie starts with a couple of teens driving around in a jeep when knocked and killed by a Velociraptor. I was like, "Hmmm, it's strange, it looks almost exactly like a scene in" Carnosaur, "except in the middle of that movie." Then I sat through a very bad play and then a man struggled to walk into an underground research lab where he was eaten by a fiery T-Rex. Now I'm like, 'Wait a second, it was also a scene in' Carnosaur '. When I saw some scenes ripped off Carnosaur 2, I figured out just what the hell was going on. Roger Corman & Co cut off scenes from the "Carnosaur" trilogy to use as action scenes, weaving into a basic "dinosaur running amok" graphic, and trying to make it an original movie. give. I don't know who I am more angry at Roger Corman or SciFi Channel to try and deliver it than the first time slot. The only reason it was worth looking at his conclusion was to take out the actors / actresses. what looked like their counterparts in the Carnosaur trilogy and guess what scenes will be lifted afterwards. As much as it is painful for me to be a dinosaur lover, I have no choice but to give the lowest possible score, because I feel totally ripped off.
