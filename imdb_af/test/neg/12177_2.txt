If this movie were in English, all the critics would have deleted it. The language is very bad, the screens are terribly targeted and it is not funny at all. After the movie I thought this movie could be written by an 8th grade, at least if you consider the lack of credible characters and the fixation on certain male body parts. (oh also on dogs ...) The story is just nonsense compared to the more mature Vingar av glass that has almost at the same time lead. Of course the public chose Jalla! Jalla! while Vingar av glas received little attention. <br /> <br /> What really troubled me was the fact that the movie really looks bad. It was probably due to the fact that first time director Josef Fares used really cheap camera equipment and then decided to just play with it, I guess. The result, however, is a movie that can easily be divided into 12 short films, with a new registration style in each of them. It was very frustrating. Perhaps Joseph Fares should stay with his short films, as it seems to be the only art form he can master. <br /> <br /> Another disturbing fact is that the story doesn't coincide. A few times in the middle of the film, the story has to move very fast and the characters then run in a way that is just too incredible. <br /> <br /> And then I didn't mention the 2-dimensional characters, especially those in the supporting roles. <br /> <br /> Although I consider this one of the worst Swedish films of the 90s and one of the most overestimated, it is so understandable that the public likes it. I mean, bad taste has always been the brand of the masses ... <br /> <br /> I am more surprised that the critics enjoyed it. They needed to know better ... <br /> <br /> Grade 2 of 10 <br /> <br />
