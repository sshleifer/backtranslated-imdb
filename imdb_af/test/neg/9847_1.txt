This movie has tried to capture the naive idealism that many young teenage girls enjoy, friendship, escape, danger, sex, adulthood, and so on. Had it. The problem was that it didn't set up at every level. That's why it couldn't build a decent story around them. I couldn't follow the point of any part of this story, nor any reason I should care. <br /> <br /> This movie is not an exploration of pedophilia at all. It's basically a girl in love with her sister, and her sister is in love with the idea of ​​'men'. While the latter is trying to try her love from men, the former is trying to win back her sister by "even" getting it. <br /> <br /> The plot is weak, the characters are weak and its reality is similar. to an amateur porn movie maker (without the sexual substance).
