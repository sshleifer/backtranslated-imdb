20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only a dull noir, but is an indisputable tireless drill of a movie. Full of unconvincing cardboard characters, it is suddenly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco, one of whom can expect much more. Miscast is starring Ida Lupino! Lupino, a lady who was able to appeal as much sex appeal as a blood orange, is under the illusion that she is Rita Hayworth as part of a sexy bar-room torch singer. Handsome Cornel Wilde as her lover is as woody as usual and totally wasted is the talented Celeste Holm, whose role is a little more than a bit shared. Then we have Richard Widmark who has the most ridiculously written part in the picture! When we first see him, he is a cute O.K. man who runs a thriving road house. Then he suddenly becomes - and for reasons that are not sufficiently clear - he becomes madly jealous of his manager (Wilde) when the latter tells him that he is going to marry Lupino. You see that Widmark wanted to marry herself, but - 1) He never suggested to her. 2) They never had a relationship (they don't even have something like a love toy) and - 3) without telling anyone (including Lupino) he obtained a marriage license. Wow! So how Widmark would like Lupino to succeed after such a "court case" is someone's concern. Huh? Well, if Widmark goes over the whole thing, it's the movie I'm sorry for. From here, the Widmark character is inadvertently comic! His loss of his marbles so early in the proceedings is completely unquestionable and unconvincing. He eventually goes over the edge, is completely disappeared and with a few Tommy Udo sniffers he laughs at poor Cornel Wilde, before biting himself the dust. <br /> <br /> And if it's not enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also ruined with a constant use of studio set and interior exteriors. There is not a single outdoor boot in the whole movie! In addition, 95% of the film is presented at night. <br /> <br /> In addition to an interactive press book and a photo gallery, the extras include a featurette "Widmark & ​​Lupino At Fox". Whatever such a documentary is asked is beyond me! As far as I know, they were never in a movie with Fox or elsewhere! But this featuret is hosted by such heavy-hearted fellows as Robert Osborne, Eddie Muller, Rudy Belhmer and a few others who make incredible hope of this tiring and urgent matter. All I can say, I guess. But "Road House" has so far been a forgotten and buried Noir and, as far as I was concerned, it must have remained so. <br /> <br /> Fox will do better if they have released DVDs of superior and so far-reaching Widmark. films such as "Down To The Sea In Ships" (1949) and the colorful "Red Skies Of Montana" (1952).
