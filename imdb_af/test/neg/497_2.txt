The idea of ​​nine stupid prisoners escaping and traveling is good for a movie. Especially because it is meant to be funny and I guess heartwarming in a strange way. The problem is, the movie was very seldom funny and often just seemed meaningless and unnecessary. It was as if jokes or interesting scenes were being erected again and again, but nobody bothered to complete any of them - there was no payout. The movie was just brainless and loaded the crooks over Japan, although they left so many victims of crime, it is impossible to believe they would not have been caught immediately - especially because they were still using the same stolen camper. for days at the end. And as far as gross, I just didn't see the scene to the scene after the scene of guys sat down the road. Plus, believe it or not, there's a scene where four of the guys get sheep! <br /> <br /> All in all, I hated this movie. And it's a shame because I almost always like Japanese movies - just not bad and uninteresting like that.
