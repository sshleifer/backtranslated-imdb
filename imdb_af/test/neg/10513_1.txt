A dark, yet humorous story that a policeman who has a first-hand experience with vampires decides should stop his job following these evil creatures. Most of the film contains dubious acting, plot, props and filming. The battle scenes were like a hoop as a middle school version of World War II. The rendered lines were spoken as if the actors had no motivation to be there. The props were bad because they didn't even seem to work in the least amount. The majority of the movie shot in some cottages (in some scenes you could see the beams overhead in a scene that didn't look like a cellar). The plot has no motivation to move forward or backward, but it sometimes just seems to stand still with no reason for characters. I sometimes felt that the sound effects were not for this horror-type genre and more of a cartoon. It's similar to the movie Blade, being an African American vampire hunter. But that's where all agreements end, and the movie looks closer to a Saturday Night Live spoof.
