We really don't know where to start when we talk about this movie. But we will start with the plot. We suspect that anyone who wrote / produced / made this movie never read the book. Because they missed the whole point. SATIRIES, not horror. Just a hint. Secondly, the bathing scene. Enough said. Third, the additional characters. The sketchy, Gothic French lady and her black page that love hands and cartwheeling. We don't understand where it came from. And then there was the casting. Everyone was really disagreeable. We were very upset that Catherine and Mr. Tilney came together because they were so unlikely that no one ever wanted to see them happy. And ... the music. We think the BBC producers ran out of money, hitting their grandmother's attic. And they found old records. Saxophone, happy female voices, and an occasional electric guitar. * Shudder * <br /> <br /> Plus, the best line ever: "Since you are gone, the rose bush is dead to grief." If anyone has any explanation, we would love to hear it. Because it makes absolutely no sense. <br /> <br /> We're still wondering what on earth everyone thought was thinking when they released this pathetic excuse for a movie on the public. We think it should be considered a federal offense. Torture is illegal. <br /> <br /> This movie is by far the worst we have seen so far. And I saw a lot of movies. <br /> <br /> Our recommendation: Give this movie to anyone you hate. They will see it and want to kill themselves. And we agree with a previous post, we will give these 0 stars, if at all possible. DO NOT KNOW! And we strongly suspect that anyone who has responded so far in favor of this movie was involved in the production. Or was mentally insane. These are the only reasons we could achieve that would give a favorable overview.
