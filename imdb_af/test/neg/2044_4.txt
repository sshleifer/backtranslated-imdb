The movie is somewhat entertaining, but the biggest feature is Shalom Harlow's ridiculous performance. It's been 4 years since this movie was released and hopefully Harlow got more training. Perhaps she should adhere to the more worldly, somewhat corrupt characters she has generated in other performances.
