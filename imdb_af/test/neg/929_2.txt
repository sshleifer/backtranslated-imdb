Is it a game FMV or a movie? In all honesty, I watched this one from "choice-less-ness". It's a huge waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> It looks like HK movies are in the opposite direction of the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Try to make more effort and money in a production and make us want to look rather than something we want us to look at. <br /> <br /> The graphics are as horrible as they look like something from early to mid 90's low resolution games (compared to today's). <br /> <br /> The way they made this movie is almost exactly what they did in the 90s Wing Commander game, the third installment of the series. Stop regressing and make our Asian look so bad about big guns in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Sure! They have big budgets and better actors. But we have some of the oldest history, myths and legends, the best technologists and possibly the largest computer graphic talent base in the world! So what went so much wrong? Did you use the same old companies that worked for you with so many movies? Please stop wasting our time and money. This is why HK movies are heading down the road so fast. Didn't you claim it's the Hollywood of the East? Don't guess.
