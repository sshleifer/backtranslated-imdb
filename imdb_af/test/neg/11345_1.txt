Dude ... I enjoyed Buffy and Angel as much as the next sci-fi freak ... but this is too much. The worst head actress EVER !! Not even David "Hot Pants" Boreanaz is able to save this crap. No wonder I never look Fox? it blows !! We gave it a whole chance, and it continued to suck. We watched four or five painful, tormenting episodes. I want to kill the execs on the network so much! Why is money spent on this business?!?! I don't get it and I don't support it and you should never waste your time looking at this show ... unless you keep it when your eyes are out of their socks! <br /> <br /> Crap. Kak. Kak.
