Great disappointment. CLASH AT NIGHT is far too talky and stagy and the dialogue doesn't resonate as true from these characters. It is melodrama at its peak. The acting is really above and very unreal. Only MARILYN MONROE and KEITH ANDES as supporting players give this movie a zipper. Wish they had more to do. I'm someone watching movies. Two big questions ... 1 Who watches the baby all day when Stanwyck and Ryan are together and Douglas works and then breaks into a bar with father? 2. When Stanwyck packs to leave town, why does she see her pack at her place where she hasn't lived for at least two years? Also, when everyone goes to the projection room at the theater, who cares for the baby again? Such details really irritate me and let my movies get much lower ratings. What were the authors, directors and anyone related to the film thinking? Nuf said.
