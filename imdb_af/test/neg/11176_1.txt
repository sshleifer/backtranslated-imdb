I admit that I was included in this film by the provocative stills of Charlotte Lewis, as well as a comment on the IMDb notice board dedicated to her, and call this photo a "great understated movie". And so I struggled with my own copy of "Dial Help". <br /> <br /> What a waste. <br /> <br /> Nothing but a cheaply made blood and gore movie with a ridiculous point of departure that I will not even repeat, with several telegraph ranges (for example, when we see Lewis feeding nicely her fish, know right away what happens to them later). Not even Lewis, with her beautiful raiser, big and light brown eyes, full and pouty lips, and beautiful figure, can save this movie. Lewis fans will be better off with 'Bare Essentials', 'Sketch Artist' or even 'Golden Child'.
