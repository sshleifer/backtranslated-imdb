It must be the most horrible abuse of the word comedy ever seen. It's simply not funny and the authors obviously just tried to use the name of the TV series to make a few on the box. This movie seems to be subtle as far as sexual innuendo is going (no common performance) and has all the charisma of a corpse with rigamortis. A full laundry I'm scared !!
