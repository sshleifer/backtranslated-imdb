The movie had moments, but in any case it was disappointing in my eyes. It was a rework of Trespass (Walter Hill) and so the treasure of the Sierra Madre, with less tension, bite and human emotion. There were some nice plays, but the story was limp and had no real depth. I have the movie for Mr. Reno and Mr. Fishburn looked, not inspired, and both had little to say or act out of their skin. This movie has been killed in the past and does not have to be made, appreciate money that can be used on better movies. For an action movie it was scarce in action and as a thrill it didn't have any tension. Better than snow, but not for me.
