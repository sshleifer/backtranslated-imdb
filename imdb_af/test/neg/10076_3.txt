In summary, my group of friends and I spent about 45 minutes outside the theater sharing our favorite gaffes, inconsistencies, unmanned loose points and other ridiculous aspects of this movie. I found the story to the point of insignificance and the plot lines were underdeveloped as the dino-embryos still locked in the Jurassic Park 1 shaving room holder. The editing was poor and no characters had any kind of sympathy or feeling. In short, this movie had no tension and excitement that gave the first movie from a story stand <br /> <br /> Even the new dinosaurs were few and far between (although I enjoyed the pterodactyls a lot.) We did several short shots of the new species and only 2 were really involved in the action. <br /> <br /> As a scientist and former paleontologist for childhood, the lack of real scientific content (not that it was realistic, but logically formed, ie how they built the dinos in # 1 and malcom's chaos ramblings) was also disappointing. <br /> <br /> In short, the movie was nothing but an excuse to make dinos back on the scene a bit of money. I hope the moviegoers do not fall again for this fall (although I believe)
