Kevin Spacey is without a doubt one of the best actors of the 90's. After his performances in The Usual Suspect, Se7en and American Beauty, you expect more and more of him. That's why Ordinary Real Criminals are a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> Michael Lynch is the most artificial criminal in Dublin who is never in a bad mood. His next trial becomes an obsession when his friends begin to plan Michael's ability to plan everything perfectly, though that's the only thing he does if he doesn't play good dad at home. <br /> <br /> I think it's partly my fault because I didn't give enough attention to the thousand plot details, which unfortunately seems to be the "essence" of the movie. I gave the movie a chance to call it a parody and .... well, parodies are always funny, no matter what they spoof or how they do it. So, it wasn't a complete parody at all. It's just another movie that desperately tries to be funny and fail. <br /> <br /> Contrary to some of his "colleagues", usually decent criminals depend too much on story development and logical continuity, forgetting the main reason, the viewer chose this kind of movie - to be entertained. It's definitely not fun. It includes one of the most ridiculous scenes ever - the launch of Michael's TWO women. I don't know if it's a sensible metaphor or strange dark humor, but the chicks are sisters. Remember, Spacey's character has children. <br /> <br /> Ordinary, pleasant criminals are complex and confusing. You're not waiting for a funny scene. Instead, you follow the dialogue carefully, as there is a great possibility of losing yourself in the boring, pale universe. The movie is occupied. <br /> <br /> Let's go back to Spacey. I wonder in what condition he was, signed for that movie. It's not miscasting, but something worse. An insult to his work in American Beauty released a year before Ordinary Decent Criminal. The character Michael is eccentric and talkative. Spacey is sometimes pathetic. The only cure for this, think of Lester Burnham and Roger Kint. <br /> <br /> Author, Gerrard Stembridge should definitely consider his screen writing skills again and be more objective this time. Because the dialogue is very poor and the scenes are often pointless. And we're still talking about a comedy. <br /> <br /> Ordinary Real Criminals are a very bad crime comedy that doesn't deserve your attention.
