Where do I start? The story was so bad, it had to be written in a high school movie club! The acting was so timid, I was sorry for the actors! One actor even reminded me how a deer should look when staring at the car's headlights! Another actor has this constant look of constipation! But it was the dialogue that took the cake! <br /> <br /> Our hero tells his prisoners - all who hold the weapons of the submachine - if you put a finger on a female prisoner, you'll be dead. Moments later, the strongest wait, built like a truck, and the only female prisoner went there. When our intrepid leader, who has this very annoying, grisly gangster, finds the wind of this offense, he walks quietly to the guard while machine guns are being trained on him and in a second second, the giant man's neck cuts as he breaks. choose a tooth! He then gets in line again while all the villains with their machine guns do absolutely nothing but scream in essence! <br /> <br /> I can keep on and on! This movie is camp hole; and if you have any sense of humor, it is guaranteed to laugh so hard, tear your eyes!
