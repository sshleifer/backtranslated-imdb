In a quiet village, a few girls see the murder of one of their friends by a strange young boy named Milo, who lives on the other side of the village. After the murder, his body was found in a river and she pronounced dead. Sixteen years later, a wedding the girls go back to their youth village and Claire, a school teacher, becomes obsessed with the fact that Milo has not died because she has recurring visions of him and her friends die one by one and nobody believes her when she Milo's claims are apart. So now she goes out to find out the terrible truth. <br /> <br /> When I came across this movie, I was pretty skeptical about it, especially when it was from Anaconda's creators on the cover, but I read the strange little plot sketch on the back of the video box , it sounds good and refreshing for a change. Well, guess what? I thought it was a good idea at the time, but it was a completely different story when it came to the movie. It seems difficult to be clever and very psychological, but the latter element did not come as well to me and it was basically an extended and mostly unconvincing thriller. Hey, I will admit it had its moments, but scarcely enough to cool it down, or memorable. But, a bravo for the filmmakers, at least the story is not a rehash of the painters' imitators who followed "Scream" and shock rapture, there is no self-referencing humor clear? actually there is not even a hint of humor. Although, maybe it was too serious? Especially because the plot is rather absurd, but it's not the main problem. What a diverse plot we get, I didn't know too much about was going on, as it seems to be very good for some so-called shocking and disturbing sequences. No! More like irrelevant scenes and yawn inducing cliches we see from time to time. Also you can see some influences from some "good" 70's horror movies, one is "Do not Look Now". This is when our main character sees the figure of her past in a slicker. The other would be one of my favorites, Alice, Sweet Alice, with the person who made the effort to wear a yellow tail and commit funny deaths. Interesting idea, but it comes across fairly level and too many errors appear. I enjoyed it more when the scenes dealt with the character's childhood, as the performances and circumstances were horrible. But if it leans in their maturity, it was tired and inconsiderate, and the performances were not terrible, but incredibly commonplace, and it is hardly a good way to put it. Most of the dialogue sounded to me in disbelief about how confronted and uncomfortable it was. You will shout "no duh!" on the screen, because you just can't believe what you hear. The police detective gets the brown of it! <br /> <br /> Quality caution - the movie isn't bad, actually it's better than your regular straight to video I'd say. Very smooth things. With some ingenious and prominent camera angles and a fine score that works pretty well. Another factor that stood out and was a key to building on the moody atmosphere was the creeping sound effects and the cycling clock left a little sensation in your ears. The establishment of a quiet primary school was well done and the rest of the action took place in a house. But don't expect any real tension or surprises, as its execution doesn't exist. The deaths are not pleasant and they are gently bloody and it is more the aftermath of what happens to these bodies, trying to save you. The villain in this piece, the friendly child, Milo Jeeder, was generously unpleasant. Well, the voice and yellow slide first make a print, but it seems the effect is lost if we come to the movie's conclusion. The cheesy taglines on the video compare him (Jason), (beware) Freddy and (it's not kid's game) Chucky, but you gotta treasure me! Right? He is labeled "The new face of evil", yes sure. All he needs is to solve a few ways and problems. Overall, the film just left me with a sour taste, as I could have gone without seeing it. I probably wished I had done so. <br /> <br /> Don't expect too much in this blur of a movie. Or, even better, just skip it as you won't really miss it.
