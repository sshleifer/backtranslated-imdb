This movie is TRASH of the word go. First, it gives an account of a season that took place 16 years ago! Who cares? This movie had about as much depth as a bottle cap. It makes a complex person like Bob Knight in a cartoon character. <br /> <br /> Swinging doesn't save me, but I'm still amazed that ESPN is showing a movie with more curse than a Kevin Smith movie on a basic cable channel. The F word has been dropped at least 20 times before the first commercial break. <br /> <br /> This movie was horrible and anyone involved must be ashamed. I rate it on the same level as Jaws IV - The Revenge and Everybody Profit ... 2 movies in the Crapfest Hall of Fame.
