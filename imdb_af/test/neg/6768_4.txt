I was quite impressed with this movie as a child of eight or nine. The gangsters threatened and threatened me very much, and I could see why people would have been afraid of someone like Dillinger. To view it as an adult, it was almost comical, due to the exaggerated narration and horror details such as thirty gangs driving cars that seemed to be out of the fifties. There is a particular, ominous reality towards the way the criminals are portrayed, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap. The most memorable and most unconscious funny thing that stands at me is the scene where Ma Barker and her sons shoot it with the FBI and the boys are killed. The narrator says something like, "Perhaps Ma Barker was a true mother for the only time in her life." It is meant to be a moment of great tragedy and pathos, as Ma finally realizes how she has destroyed her family from her own greed, but rather causes it to laugh. A very strange movie seldom shown anywhere. Gangster movie buffs can enjoy it, but more than a curiosity as a real movie.
