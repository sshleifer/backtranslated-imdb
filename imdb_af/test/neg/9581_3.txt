Mount Godwin-Austin (otherwise known as K2) is the world's second highest mountain. If the testimony presented in this movie is believed to be the most difficult mountain to climb successfully without killing yourself. "K2" is basically a girlfriend in the breathtakingly dangerous world of mountaineering. While outdoor photography takes on a wonderful scenery, the characters standing in front of all the glorious landscapes are a collision. This is the fault with the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Choral lawyer Taylor Brooks (Michael Biehn) and his quietly married friend Harold Jamieson (Matt Craven) spend their free time rock climbing. During one of their trips, they meet another climbers funded by rich mountain enthusiast Philip Claibourne (Raymond J. Barry). Claibourne's team is training for an upcoming shot at the infamous K2, a mountain that both Taylor and Harold wanted to tackle, but it could never afford to do so. However, during their practice, two of Claibourne's team are killed in a deluge. Taylor and Harold introduced themselves as potential substitutes. Despite initial reluctance, Claibourne gives them the need for approval and the two find themselves with his team in the Himalayas. Harold's wife, Cindy (Julia Nickson-Soul), is upset that her husband is going to tackle such a dangerous climb, especially since he recently became a father. Tension in the climbing mountain as Taylor repeatedly clashes with another member of the group, the equally bitter and arrogant Dallas Woolf (Luca Bercovici). Meanwhile, Claibourne itself is becoming more and more ill, as altitude sickness drops its toll on its body. Will the guys reach the peak of K2, or are their quest destined to end in disappointment, or even death? <br /> <br /> "K2" spends a very long time introducing its somewhat negligible characters. Biehn as a dirty mouth, intrusive, adventurous type is especially hard to hold, like Barry as the stubborn mountaineer. But on the other side of the coin, Craven is so boring that it will be hard to believe his wife might make a damn climb over him K2 - hey, she'll be better off if he never came back !! The finishing touches of the main characters are Bercovici, whose characterization as Dallas Woolf is as champion and over-the-top as any other role he ever played. The story itself is completely soft and disposable ?? just a simple thread about guys trying to reach the top of a mountain. A bit of male bonding has been thrown in, but the whole subplot about Harold and his wife is zero and the personality clashes between Taylor and Dallas are totally false. "K2" only counts its earnings from the beautiful cinematography by Gabriel Berastain ?? During the Himalayas, the scale and awe of the mountains are properly captured. I'm quite with critic Kim Newman on this one who said hilariously in Empire magazine: "On this testimony, climbing K2 can't be harder than putting it in!" Quite true, Kim, very true!
