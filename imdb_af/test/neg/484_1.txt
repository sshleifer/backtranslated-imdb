I was subject to this terrible apology for a TV movie. I just watched it because I didn't have cable and my only other choice was Golf, College Basketball, or local news. The plot is very generic and has no dust I could see, not to mention, had a big mistake in my eyes. The main character, dr. Sorensen is an excited astronomer who believes that an asteroid called "Nemesis" will hit Earth, causing all life to cease. He bases his faith on his discovery of cave paintings by an Aborigine (I have sure I spelled the one wrong). The paintings show an apparent timeline, which shows important events in history, such as the construction of the Great Wall of China. All the events are shown in perfect chronological order, and the very last photo on the timeline is that the Earth is destroyed. Now for me, if the painting showed things that did happen, why would the big doctor believe he could change somehow what would happen? All that went aside, the movie with extreme formal precision drew. There was nothing in the movie that surprised me. The actors were not very good, and at a few times I just felt that they didn't even take the film seriously to make enough effort to convince me that the characters were worth the trouble. The whole movie was cliche driven and a direct waste of time and money. I will recommend Armageddon about this piece of crap any day. At least Armageddon has some good acting (compared to this), and doesn't mention the eyecatcher that Liv Tyler is. Now that I think about it, Golf is not that bad ......
