I'd like to introduce 0.5, but unfortunately I can't. Who can write such bad scripts (I saw the movie five seconds and knew the "bad boy" would be Sutherland - he had to pay his taxes if you saw how good he was in Redford's movie, People and Others!). <br /> <br /> Although I don't like it, but I have no choice, I saw the movie in French, but I know Sheen's right voices are being heard. Sutherland and Hamilton would not have changed things, except perhaps what made it miserable. <br /> <br /> What makes me sick is that people earn their lives to make these bad things (I forgot to talk to Mr Waterson, far from Woody Allen's films he used to do to play in.) <br /> <br /> We had another movie on another French channel: a stupid James Bond with Brosnan (I'm not talking about the real Bonds with Connery. the holiday, wake up!).
