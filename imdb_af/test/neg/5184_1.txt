I can't really think of one good point in this movie. The story is absolutely terrible. The play is as blunt as a root, and the writing is so bad it wants to kill you. Well, if you love (and you should like to understand it), you can enjoy it better microscopically, as it has moved big mountains and some cool, but it's terrible. It has some absolutely stupid ideas and it is racist with both black and white people insulting each other's races. The only time you will laugh is when you laugh at the stupidity or feel ashamed of the movie. I saw many movies and I have to say that this is the worst movie I've ever seen. If you have this movie, I suggest you take it back to where you bought it and get your money back.
