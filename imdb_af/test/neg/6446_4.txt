My 15 year old daughter asked me to watch this movie with her on Cable TV. As someone who saw revenge from the nerds in a kiosk, I saw this movie as a highly predictable remake of it. The Nerds were simply replaced by Dorks. I fooled her by predicting exactly what would happen in each scene. The movie was cute, especially Amanda Bynes. <br /> <br /> The writer Chad Creasey should be ashamed of writing such an obvious remake from an early 1980's. The title simply had to be "Revenge of The Dorks". Perhaps the continued revenge of the Dorks 2.
