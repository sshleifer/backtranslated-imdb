The TV announcer who introduced the latter one on Saturday night said it had to win Oscars. Quite a statement for a movie I've never heard of. Although I had to take notice of a TV presenter, I do not know. In the case, the announcer spoke chats. <br /> <br /> It's a brave, miserable film that leaves a bad taste in the mouth. I couldn't continue with Hoskins' terrible Burr-ming glue accent. Can't see any benefit as it is in the Midlands anyway. <br /> <br /> Unresolved threads are abundant ... and I won't normally reflect it, but half of them don't make sense. And what about when Hoskins says he'll pick Felicia from outside her B&B, although she never told him where she is staying? Or buy her in the funeral that clearly never happened (and where was she during those days?) Clumbsy and thoughtless thoughts when you ask me. <br /> <br /> It's a thrill-free excitement. . These are full of pretentious things. It's depressed ... <br /> <br /> Didn't like it. Think it's garbage. Wouldn't recommend it. "Nuff said.
