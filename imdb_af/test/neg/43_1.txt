I was completely bored with this movie, melodramatic for no apparent reason. Every thing becomes as serious and people curse with many dumb expressions. Then there is a serial killer who apparently can kill one person to get the title of serial killer. Well, the serial killer likes butterflies and is illustrated by sound effects that you can hear in the dream sequence of most modern movies; Why, why? I have no idea. It really wants to be frightening, but I think in this universe scary is like a lot of chatting and dark environments. Just for the record, it's by no means a horror movie, it's definitely a thrill (scarce). Really filmmakers have to do their homework these days before making horror movies or at least calling a movie a horror movie. it tells me (in words may also be ironic) "cute, you take forever to say nothing."
