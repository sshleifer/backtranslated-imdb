Sometimes Hallmark can do it - like the 10th Kingdom - but much of their fantasy films plod, and it falls into the latter category. The version I saw can be cut (a demon [?] Shown in the trailer, and publicity silences didn't appear), but anything that made the movie shorter could just be a blessing. <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE POSSIBILITIES If you are uncomfortable with the original wedding: <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie adjusts the story at the beginning of the 20th century? Gerda and Kay (here called Kai - a Lexx fan, I expected him to say, "Death shouldn't solve puzzles"] 18-year-old Hans Christian Andersen's basic story is followed: the boy gets some ice in his eye, goes bad, is taken off by the Snow Queen to solve a puzzle in her palace and Gerda will find him with various adventures along the way. <br /> <br /> Since the two main characters are older than in the original, much time is spent getting them together and being "in love." Unfortunately, I was never convinced that they were especially in love and certainly not in love enough to make Gerda's quest. plot kick, slowed down the film's pace to a crawl Unfortunately, when Gerda starts her search for Kai, it just passes the pace on a rest take a walk. <br /> <br /> There are some strange additions to the story that go nowhere. At the beginning of the movie, the Snow Queen killed Gerda's mother, but no explanation was given. A polar bear living in the snow queen's palace is more than he looks (although this is possible because the producers realized that the bear's feelings to the Snow Queen in a fairy tale would be good, but not in a modern film). Again, this is never explained. Also, tips that the Snow Queen has an erotic desire for Kai are being dropped, but never followed. The script is also full of anachronisms that really throw you out of the "fairy tale" mood. <br /> <br /> The production looks good, though there is evidence of penny pinching: the snow queen's palace is the hotel where Gerda and Kai covered in ice. The three main characters are played with varying degrees of success: Kai initially appears as fierce as Gerda, but once she goes out to find Kai warm. Bridget Fonda looks good like the Snow Queen, but apparently in another movie for everyone else. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the film is unsatisfactory. It looks good, but drag and drop magic.
