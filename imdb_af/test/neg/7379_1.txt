As Anthony Bourdain said, "I wanted to put my head in a bucket of lips, stick out my eyeballs and jump off a cliff." It summarizes my feelings about this pathetic waste of human effort. Artless, self-indulgent, mindless, and just bad. Bad understanding. What else can I say? If you are unhappy enough to be in an area where this piece of idiot waste plays, please be merciful to soul and avoid at all costs.
