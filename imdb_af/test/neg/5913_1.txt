It's really one of the worst movies ever made - and I don't mean that bad - it's a good way. Eddie Murphy is a big cartoon, and it is a testament to how bad this movie is that he almost killed his career. The writing and direction is inactive, the sets and play are as imaginative as a Brady Bunch episode, and the play just shows how bad a role can be if they have absolutely nothing to work with. If it wasn't for the costumes - which, apart from Eddie Murphy's ego, looks like the bulk of the budget - you'd swear this thing was slept by a lot of high school students who were wasting peppermint Schnapps. Being able to find this travesty in any way is funny or entertaining. It is probably not coincidental that the deceived souls who price this stinker are almost literate. But if your idea of ​​satisfaction is to shake off Della Reese's "little finger" then you have to set aside your batting cup and rent this movie.
