I did my best to watch this two hour fiasco. It combined the terrible special effects and plot of the original "Blob" with an unbeatable enhancement of the (outstanding in the original) "Runaway Train." The only explanation for this movie is that someone had to take a big tax deduction and thought they would combine it with a shot to offer a decisive bank. What an amazing stinker! Lou Diamond Phillips is anxious to show us why he will take any part, no matter how bad. Barry Corbin continues his career as a typecast creep, a Texas senator and plays it well. He has to play the leading role in the story of Trent Lott or Jesse Helms. The women in this movie look like roles in the Fay Wray Memorial screaming contest. Special effects are incredibly bad. H.S. North Dakota movie class children could have done a better job. The authors must have pulled an elevator at the clich√© bank to collect this lot. I could no longer look without being forced to sit in the Clockwork Orange chair. I have no idea how it ended, except of course 119 minutes late. Ugh! Caveat emptor.
