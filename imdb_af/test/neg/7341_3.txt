This film was shot in Randolph County in Central North Carolina in 1968 when a movie staff in the state was a rare thing. The sites were the municipalities of Liberty and Ramseur and the surrounding rural countryside. It's not a very good movie. It had Merle Haggard and it brought life to the interior for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> The plot is the standard shootemup. The cinematography is those fuzzy things that came from the late sixties and early seventies. The locals were excited to be part of the business. <br /> <br /> If viewers find it difficult to get a copy of this movie, a record copy is available in Asheboro, NC. <br /> <br /> Non-credited actors include Ben Jones, Mimi Pravda, Tommy Hull, Bill Nunnery.
