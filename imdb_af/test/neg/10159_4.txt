Okay, now I know where all the boring policemen come from him. I believe they can be traced back to this movie. "Scene Of The Crime" feels more like a TV episode, or an episode of a series. Complete with stock characters and situations - the hotshot cop who collides with his superiors ... the older cop who doesn't want a desk job, despite the lack of sight ... the reckless newcomer ... the double-crossing woman , etc. <br /> <br /> I love the actors here, and they do a good job, but overall I found this movie dull because I'm not a fan of the genre. I stood still while discussing the matter ... something about booklets and informants. And oh yes, there was a stripper, played by the previously healthy Gloria DeHaven. What I want to know is: Why did she keep in touch with Van Johnson "Uncle Wiggly"? Wasn't Oom Wiggly a rush? A character from a children's book? What does it have to do with something? I think I just get a solid movie Noir-ish kinda jargon. <br /> <br /> In fact, much of the dialogue mumbled me "no one speaks so!" However, I can relate to one scene where the policeman (Arlene Dahl), who worries every time he is going to work, realizes that she might not have made her husband the center of her life. Yes, I know that feeling of loving someone so much to be so dependent on them that there is a constant fear of their safety. So there are moments of truth in this movie, under the stylized dialogue and atmosphere that are so self-consciously trying to be eager and truly that it actually seems unreal to me. <br /> <br /> A small background: this movie was made when Dore Schary took over MGM from Louis B. Mayer. He started to put an end to the sound musical instruments that MGM made so well. Dore Schary was determined to bring more "realism" to movies. I hate Dore Schary. Perhaps we can be guilty of all the pretentious, dark films made today, moving in the ugly "truths" of life, and focusing on (and in my opinion helping to endure) the worst of mankind rather than the best. No longer do we elevate the way classical films are designed to do - which provides an essential distraction during the Great Depression and World War II. <br /> <br /> Well, damn it, we still need the kind of distraction today! There is still a lot of depression and a lot of war. And how are people going today when they want to escape? Trashy, brain-deadening Reality TV. Thank you, Dore!
