I share the same opinion about Underworld as the previous comment. <br /> <br /> I was puzzled by the 1.5 hours of this movie about what this story was and more importantly, why the author and / or director made certain decisions for the plot. In general, I found that the movie was unbalanced, consisting of strange subplots that (IMHO) had nothing to do with the movie. Furthermore, if you write a writer, I want to tell you that your viewers have to wonder about the story and not the way the story is filmed.
