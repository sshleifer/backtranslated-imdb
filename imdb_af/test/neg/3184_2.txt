"It's supposed to have good reviews," says the g / f. If so, I can't find it. She goes to bed and I endure. Michael Douglas as a good old boy - now there's a new one. Matt Dillon is all screwed. John Goodman lost his cool. Paul Reiser walks around in BDSM learning. Oh, it's a riot. <br /> <br /> The hook is that you're likely to lose interest soon. Liv Tyler plays the femme fatale and critics complain that she cannot have the register for her. But this is unimportant: this movie is not about character development. In fact, I'm going so far as to say there's no character at all. What you are supposed to appreciate here is the plot. <br /> <br /> No one is bad in this movie. Some people wonder why all these 'stars' - Reba are here too for the sake of the good name - subscribe to such a junky project. They thought it would be fun. Maybe they had fun. Who knows? Hey - maybe they also paid well. <br /> <br /> But somehow you have to fork out money to see this turkey. And that's probably not a good idea.
