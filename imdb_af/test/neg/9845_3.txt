"Ripe" is one of those terrible Indians who succeed in circulating and giving Indians a bad name. Reporting a stupid, indifferent story of brave sisters who crawl from a burning car accident that kills their parents and then hit the road while making happy shoplifting, making goo-goo eyes at a guy and on an army ending what would be so dilapidated Army. want it (yes, right!). A seemingly attempting life-time "Ripe" is an almost complete loser who wanders aimlessly while the players drift in and out of character. Ultimately, we end up with a lot of credibility found everywhere. Not recommended for anyone.
