I watched this movie based on the comments of some who said it was bad but funny. But you have to be warned that this movie has the worst special effects ever produced. They make 1950s science fiction movies look like artworks. It is sometimes funny but irritating for the most part. And to put together the problem with the severely pathetic special effects is the total lack of logic depicting a majority of the events. One of my favorites is where three of the characters drop hundreds of feet in a tunnel created by the arachnia and arrive in full relief. The arachnia apparently also managed to catch up with the power grid. Very impressive. But this is just one example. And for what is worth it, the music sucks, the acting sucks, the two cute girls are annoying, the petty man is annoying, the so-called handsome chief is a geek and the black girl who falls to him is a fool . Her father is the worst actor I've ever seen. I'm not sure that the short moments of humor may be the experience.
