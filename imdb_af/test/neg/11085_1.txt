My first post at the IMDb must (unfortunately) be to warn others not to waste their time with The Cavern! There is no story, no character development, no frills, and no good lighting. It does not make sense. If you like bad acting, people who run through small caves, offend reflective cameras, and people screaming while the screen is in full darkness, you'll love this movie. I could turn off the lights in my house and scream, and I wouldn't pay for the rent. The only thing that frightened me was that someone made a movie. It's one of the worst movies I've ever rented.
