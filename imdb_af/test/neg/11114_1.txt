I watched this movie knowing it would be terrible but damned if it did not accept new and revolutionary land in the area of ​​faeces that was acceptable to entertainment. The plot is deep-rooted with rough effects and HORRID acting. The lines in this ... well ... wow there really is no way to put this movie down, because I think the words should not yet be created in the English language. The sad part is that the filmmakers thought they were doing something good. You will not believe your eyes if you see how many movies they have torn without even trying to hide them. There are scenes / plot devices straight from Deep Rising, Alien, Jurassic Park, Predator, Jeepers Creepers, and the list can last forever. But, unlike any of those movies, this one just falls of celluloid seat. The most amazing thing about this movie, apart from the way it tries to be competent, but fails, is that Gimli is itself-freakin 'in it. How hell can afford John Rhys-Davies, but not decent effects, writing, actors or sets. Really terrible ... and not the kind of bad that is good.
