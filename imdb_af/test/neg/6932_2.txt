I can only guess that this movie was an experiment that failed. Years earlier it would be accompanied by moving images. Later it would be added healthily. Eventually it would have been Technicolor, Cinemascope or Imax. This movie had been a wrong attempt to introduce a new element to the talk photo. During all the emotional scenes, the character stops in the middle of the dialogue and their inner thoughts are told while looking in the distance or calling on the camera. This interruption is very painful. Imagine these top-performing actors are watching while the story is making drones. Painful. I have no idea who came with this symbol, but it was the only time I ever saw it - and for good reason. In each scene, the actors were forced to roll their eyes, turn their hands, or to persuade them to such an extent, I actually wondered if it was really a comedy. <br /> <br /> The story is a hopeless soap opera that takes place over a few generations. Norma Shearer, disappointed in love, is looking for a reason to live. She has a friend, played by Ralph Morgan, who worships her - but she takes him for granted. She is attracted to a doctor, played by Clark Gable, but is absorbed and is not interested in her. She settles for a weakling who urgently needs her. She just marries him to find that there is family understanding in his family and she can never have a child with him. Along the way, the doctor who pops a bun in her oven one day, only to find out later that he loves her. The child builds confidence in her husband who is a success, but she realizes it is Clark, after all, she loves. Still confused? Forget about the rest, just look at a few episodes of "As the World Turns" and it'll all be clear. <br /> <br /> If you're ever forced to watch this movie, hold onto the final scene. The actors' giroses have made Harold LLyd's shame. It should not be missed.
