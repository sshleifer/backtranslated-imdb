A potentially good idea is completely dropped by a poor script that throws all credibility out of the window so the actors have little to work with. Roth covers it as well as he can by being all mouth; Hurt has about as much threat as a soft dog and Stamp can't seem to play an ex-London rogue or some toff straight from the playing field at Eton. As for poor Laura del Sol, she does what she can, but her character is no more than every Northern European's idea of ​​the stereotypical Latino woman, and it's all the pouts and hot temperament. If you're a fan of any of the major players, don't be disappointed or miss yourself (as I suspect many of the other reviewers have done here). Watch it, but stay critical; You know these guys can do better.
