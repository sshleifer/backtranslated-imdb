Before I start, let me get something out of my chest: I'm a big fan of John Eyres's first film PROJECT: SHADOWCHASER. The film, a B-grade cross from both THE TERMINATOR & THE HARD, may not be the work of a movie genius, but is a very entertaining action movie that has become a cult hit (and has two successors and found a spider). The adjudicator and jury starts with Joseph Meeker, a convicted murderer sent to the death penalty following the "Bloody Shootout" (which looks like a poor name for a murderous? Meeker killed three people while trying to rob a convenience store, which is led to the electric chair. There is an amusing scene where Meeker talks to the priest about sexual delivery, but she encounters one true love (killed during the shooting), expressing his revenge for the person who killed her? Michael Silvano, an excited soccer player who spends his days, watch Alex practicing his soccer with his high school team (and ending his son's coach). But once executed, Meeker returns as a winner (or as Kelly Perine calls "a hamburger without the fries"), whose sole purpose is to get his revenge, which basically means that Silvano's life gets miserable . <br /> <br /> Let me point out that the Judge and the Jury are not a real horror movie. It is a supernatural action movie, featuring Meeker that Silvano chases, and uses his ability to change shape. This means that David Keith, as an Elvis impersonator, a French chef (with an emphasis as bad as his mustache), a drag queen, a clown and a rebellious comedian, is an explosive shotgun laps explode and invulnerability to death (though it doesn't stop Keith Kove from shooting a Desert Eagle), to pay back Silvano to kill Meeker's wife. br /> <br /> Director John Eyres doesn't seem interested in characterization, but focuses only on action scenes, which the movie has a lot. But this is the main thing of the movie, as there is nothing to link the action scenes together. The play is surprisingly good, with Keith giving the best performance, supported by Kove, as well as Paul Koslo, who plays the excited police well. Kelly Perine is annoying as the cabbie is trying to help but makes the situation worse.
