1993 was a time of change in the WWE, but for this Wrestlemania they decided to blow the clock back, as Hulk Hogan returned, with his good friend, Brutus Beefcake, who has been facing a paragliding accident since 1990 . <br /> <br /> It wasn't a great event. Only two games had a real build and the whole thing came down. The ring action was not good and the end of the turn, which I later discussed, was not really the earth, and the WWE hoped it would be. <br /> <br /> This forgetful night started with Shawn Micheals defending his Intercontinental Championship against the unbeaten Tatanka. Tatanka hit Michaels several times in battle. Michaels had a new manager, Luna Vachon, while Tatanka was accompanied by Michael's former manager and future WWE chamber of Famer Sherri Martel. Tatanka won by DQ. Michaels retained his title and returned straight with Marty Janetty, who had just been let down by Wrestlemania. Why I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Next, the Steiner Brothers (Scott and Rick) defeated the Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) with Scott who scored the pen after beating Samu with the Frankensteiner. Good game. <br /> <br /> Think the clown needs help from another clown to win his match against Crush. A second Doink Distracting Crush when in full control and allowing Doink to get the pen and victory. Doink was an entertaining pennant character, which soon became old. <br /> <br /> Razor Ramon easily defeated Bob Backlund in the next game. <br /> <br /> This brings us first in our double-head event. Like the Mega Maniacs team from Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake, with the recent good old Jimmy Hart in their corner, Hart's former friends Money Inc (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R Shyster) have adopted. It was a pretty sketchy finish. Beefcake, as mentioned, was in a paragliding accident requiring complete facial surgery and wrestling with a face mask. Shyster tore off the mask and beat Beefcake to a pulp. The ref went down, Hogan grabbed the face mask and eliminated DiBIase and Shyster and then Hart, who had a referee shirt, counted the three. Another ref came down and reversed the decision, which money Inc winners declared by DQ. <br /> <br /> Next to Lex Luger or the Narcissist as he was also known at the time of Mr. It was perfect. This game arose because Luger is run by Perfect's old driver, Bobby Heenan. Perfectly his feet were on the ropes when he was jammed, but the ref missed it. <br /> <br /> The Undertaker picked up a dim DQ victory in a nice match against the Giant Gonzales. The Undertaker earned the Irishman of Gonzales manager Harvey Wippleman in 1992 and Taker defeated his huge monster Kamala at Survivor Series. Wippleman promises revenge and takes it to the Royal Rumble as Gonzales attacked Taker, cost him the game. Gonzales dominated Undertaker in this game, but was DQ'd to cool Taker with chloroform. Weird finishing to a bad game. <br /> <br /> For the first time, this has seriously challenged us to our main event as WWE champion Bret Hart. He put his title on the line against Mr Fuji's unstoppable monster Yokozuna. Yokozuna first controlled, but Hart resisted and then took control. He had Yokozuna in the sharpshooter, surely, he will give, and Hart will be established as a heroic hero after taking out the big monster. But Fuji had other ideas that threw salt into Hart's face, which made the Canadians helpless, as Yokozuna had the pen. <br /> <br /> What a downer ends. But wait here is Hulk Hogan. He looked at Hart to make sure he was OK. Suddenly, Fuji challenges Hogan to a WWE title. Hogan accepted. Fuji pours salt to Hogan, but instead beats Yokozuna. Hogan hits the leg drop and wins the game and title. What did I just watch? And so, what most fans thought was the night we saw, or Hart settled himself as a giant killer, or Yokozuna set himself up as an unstoppable monster, but Hulk Hogan instead has a meaningless title victory. A title he would not defend for three months. In fact, it was the only game that Hogan struggled for the WWE in front of the King of the Ring PPV in June 1993.
