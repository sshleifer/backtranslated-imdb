Daft potboilers aren't much dafter than this, but it's a Douglas Sirk movie that makes everything good. Except in this case it is not. Based on a sacred novel by Saint Lloyd C Douglas (he wrote The Robe), and filmed with Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor as early as 1935, it was more upbeat than a cantilever bra. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson is the arrogant playboy not only responsible for making Jane Wyman a widow, but is later directly responsible for the accident in which she loses her eyes. To make allowances, he picks up medicines, becomes a great eye surgeon and repairs it. (No, it was a pity, he was planning to become a doctor before he became an arrogant playboy). Over time, they fall in love. <br /> <br /> Like I may not find the satisfying social commentary and criticism of American mores just below the surface of Sirk's films. (this one is not too deep). On the positive side, Rock Hudson is not bad (I think I rediscover him), and it looks good, of course (in Sirk's films people live in cathedrals). Nothing in this movie suits the best of his later work and even in soap opera terms it is definitely day-to-day television.
