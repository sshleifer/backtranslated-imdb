Alice Dodgson, a New York doctor, gets her license suspended when she is treating one of her patients with an uncontrolled drug. This leads to the death of the patient. With a job, Alice is obliged to go to Jamaica, where she is the brother of a wealthy inclined white landowner. The brother thinks he is a zombie and is deeply involved in local people's voodoo practices and rituals. "Ritual" is a mediocre horror movie. The action is pretty boring, the plots are stupid and there is no tension. There is a bit of gore because someone kills whites with a machete, but not too much. The cinematography is decent, but the acting is really angry. Definitely one to avoid.4 out of 10.
