I expected a comedy about NVA, but it's a parody. It shows the national army of East Germany in a light that is not appropriate, and certainly not true. <br /> <br /> One can make a comedy about everything, as long as the underlying facts are not changed. Even a comedy about the German KZ is possible, as Roberto Benigni showed with "LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL". <br /> <br /> The movie NVA will be an "OK" comedy, because the jokes in it are generally OK. Nothing special - not hilarious, but enough to live with it. <br /> <br /> The point is that the movie makes a farce and a parody about the NVA. A dead machine who was prepared to attack WESTERN EUROPE with his friend the RED ARMY. An institution that used everything to get the best of its soldiers. An army that entered the CSPR in 1968 and was ready to march in POLAND to destroy the SOLIDARNOSC. You can't make a movie without hurting the smallest evil, or do you want to make a parody about a KZ, Guantanamo or 9/11? Does Osama bin Laden show like a funny man? 90 minutes about a funny Osama in an Afghan Taliban camp, where he makes jokes and trains his soldiers, it will be comparable to what this movie about the NVA does!
