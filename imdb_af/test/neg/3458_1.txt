CRAP! I accidentally looked at this movie thinking that it was the swim stream released in 2003. I'm seriously sorry to spend an hour of my life. Shame on who gave the junk an award. I grieved this movie thoroughly, and I didn't see it to the end. After an hour I couldn't stand it anymore. I'm disgusting that people are amused by such a random manuscript - which tries to tear a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD plays. PAINFUL. I rate it 1 star out of 10. An Amateur can make a much bigger movie.
