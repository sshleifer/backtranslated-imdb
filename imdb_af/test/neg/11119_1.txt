I considered this movie a great disappointment, especially in the light of the movie. The characters are not credible, just like the ridiculous circumstances in which they find themselves. The only part of the movie I enjoyed was when the most annoying characters were eventually killed. The special effects consist mainly of scenes of gory dead or dying bodies. A typical, spectacular flash. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe, making it impossible to believe that a sleek creature that comes to goat in the middle of the night can be trapped by a group of clumsy, noisy idiots. Just as impossible to believe is how they knew exactly how to find it, despite the fact that the creatures captured or even photographed. <br /> <br /> The one who makes the impossible to keep the Chupacabra alive is our one-dimensional Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito). The only thing Dr Pena is more obsessive to than creature is his arrow gun. An arrow gun that worked was just dots missing. <br /> <br /> The ship captain (John Rhys-Davies) is being launched as a "war veteran". He used his military skill by shooting his men on the creature, whether on the ship. The Navy Seals coming from nowhere repeat the pattern of shooting at everything. <br /> <br /> Dylan Neal plays an insurance investigator taken aboard the ship to catch a thief. He spends most of the movie coding with whom the creature is killed at the moment. <br /> <br /> The creature doesn't even look like a Chupacabra. It also does not like one. Instead of a small, shy, mysterious animal hunting at night, we get a bulletproof Freddy Kruger who kills everything in sight. A simple search on Google would be very useful for the authors and the special effects crew.
