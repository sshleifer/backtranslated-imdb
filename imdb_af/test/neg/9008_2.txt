I had the strange chance of seeing it at Mystery Science Theater 3000, four years ago. I must admit it wasn't as badly done as some other science fiction / horror movies of the time. The plot revolves around an astronaut who returned with his alien embryo inside. Now the plot is pretty funny, or you can even call it a plot. (I see a space program running out of one building and an old bakkie is drop-dead funny!) I admit it was terrible according to today's standards (and 20 years ago) ... but I can get myself 43 years ago see watching and being charmed by this movie. It's not even close to the bad invasion of the Neptune Mans, Manos: Hands of Fate of Future War. <br /> <br />
