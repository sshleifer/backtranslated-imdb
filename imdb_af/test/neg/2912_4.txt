Let's get tough is one of those movies that people probably regret what they made years later. Full-bodied racist Japanese talks and jokes, this East End Kids story, describe how the kids want to join the army to defeat the Japs. As they are too young, they decide to clean the town from that turbulent Japs. They find one, throw fruit in it (without anyone doing anything to stop them) and he pulls out a short sword to threaten them! Police say to stop irritating him! He is only Chinese! He is on our side! When the kids go back to apologize, the Chinese man is dead! It's all part of this great Japanese and German Spy Ring! The children make sure they are stopped at all costs! I'm sure it was all right when it was made (1942), but seen, you obviously realize it's clearly a product of its time. Full of stereotypes, German and Japanese. Funny how the East End Kids have a black child in the group, and he's not spared either. Give me.
