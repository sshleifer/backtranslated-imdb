I'm surprised that the comparison has not yet been made between Mind of Mencia and the television program The Awful Truth, which ran a few years ago. Heard of controversial director Michael Moore, the show would begin, exactly the same manor as this show, with Moore interacting with the audience, and launching segments, namely short documentaries and sketches, which were compiled in an attempt to challenge current issues. The difference? Mencia rarely hits the superficial and reactionary. What he says and does is often pandering and rude, insulting the ability of his audience to make their own decisions. There is a difference between "edgy", which I have no problem, but Mencia is trying too hard to reach it, and eventually comes off as arrogant, and with little support. He does occasionally make points, but often he has to sit down with a beautiful sensible attempt at shock.
