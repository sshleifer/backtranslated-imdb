Dr. Seuss would probably be angry if he was alive. Cat in the hat proves to show how film productions can take a classic story and turn it into an incessant hope goop. We have Mike Myers as the infamous cat in the hat, big mistake! Myers proves that he can't perform in this movie. He acts like a beautiful girl with a thousand tricks on his sleeve. The kids in this movie are right, somewhere between the lines of dull and annoying. The story is just like the original with a few tweaks and like most movies based on other stories, never fits in with the original story! Bringing the evil neighbor, Quin, was a bad idea. He is a stupid villain who will never come alive. This movie is like a rejected cartoon from the newspaper if you think about it. The movie is definitely clever! Certainly, there are funny adult jokes such as the cat's cut from its tail and the censorship goes down before saying a naughty word, slightly funny. At least the Grinch jumped, and the movie was really good! This movie is a cartoon piece of snot with bright colors and bad mediocre acting. Was Mike Myers actually in this movie? And another thing, the fish. What's with that stupid fish! The first time you see him, he's a real fish. The next time you see him, he's all animated and talking. But he looks like an animated piece of rubber dough! This movie is a total of target wreck. Good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! I'm surprised it even had good jokes like the waterpark ride, it was good. So if you have the choice, please look at the Grinch instead of this mess.
