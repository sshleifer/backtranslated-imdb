Normally, I would applaud a movie trying to do something different or original in a genre. Obviously, this movie is a kind of parody on ninja movies. And I really did my best to enjoy the movie. But I just couldn't. The jokes aren't funny enough! (I saw my part of Japanese movies. And most of the times I like the humor used in those movies. "Red Shadow" is just stupid!) The characters portrayed in this movie know it's not " a serious movie and show that everything is about fun. View the characters of parodies such as "Hot Shots" or "Scary Movie". Everything they do on the screen is done with a straight face and never falls out of character! And therefore some scenes become funny and hilaries. In "Red Shadow" the actors never reach it. The Shadow Ninja is supposed to be very skilled and deadly. Unfortunately, the actors don't do their best to convince us of their talents. They do not do things with a straight face. The jokes would have worked better if they did! The bad choreography of the action scenes also damaged the viewing experience for me. I like humor in martial arts movies as long as the action is good. "Red Shadow" just fails in that department. So what do you enjoy? Well, the music (techno) was exciting. It had to be like the action it was never exciting. And there are a few short dramatic scenes that are good but simple. Using humor, lack of story and depth makes me think that this movie is meant for children. But I wonder if children actually want this movie. Waste of time!
