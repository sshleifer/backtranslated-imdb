"Nicodemus" is almost a copy of 'Red' in the strange behavior, but this episode focuses on other people in Clark Kent's unpredictable life. When a poisonous flower finds it, it is in Smallville. Jonathan Kent is the first to do so. The flowers cause people to reverse their behavior and when it affects Jonathan, he is briefly tempered and violent, but Clark manages to prevent him from doing anything until his father finally passes. okay. so far so good. Next is Lana. The episode was good until that time, because the flower causes her to try to seduce Clark. at the last moment he refuses her, but the damage has already been done. this episode causes the wrong impressions and is not suitable for people under the age of twenty, as it is adult content. The first part was good, the last part (focusing on the effect of the flower on Pete) was good, but the remedy all about Lana's alternative personality was the biggest challenge, and it ruined what a could be brilliant episode. I give this episode two.
