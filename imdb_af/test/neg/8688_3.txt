The VHS cover for The Evil Below makes it a cool underwater horror movie. Unfortunately, it is closer to a boring adventure movie and has no real horror elements. It starts with some divers being attacked and we see some blood, but it's the only blood in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The evil here is not the worst, but for a horror movie it is boring boring. The acting is decent and to be honest is the only thing you like to watch, the developing romance between the two leaders. There are a few nightmare series where it seems the director didn't know what to do. I put it (just over), but I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Horror fans might want a copy for the cool VHS cover, but that's best about it.
