Oh, me. Poor Jane must have done the old roll-over-the-grave thing. Even for the poor production values ​​for the time (1971) and the format (a kind of mini-series), it is baaaaaad. Whatever happens to Austen, the dialogue (even in this, perhaps her most serious work) must shine, and the melodrama must get out of the way. Unfortunately, not the case with this production. By the time you come to Anne's Frederick, Frederick, Frederick, you will either laugh or cry. Unless you are just trying to visually collect all of Austen's existing films, you can left this one. However, if you look at it, there is little consolation: The actors playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.
