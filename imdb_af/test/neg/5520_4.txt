Strangely, this is Fred MacMurray who plays the more "screw-like" role in this screw-ball comedy. Carole Lombard shows a fine display that combines lighter moments with and undercurrent of drama and seriousness. <br /> <br /> As usual, Fred MacMurray remains a mystery to me. The camera is not a fan of his, he is not that attractive and he does not have the style and panache to pull off this very Cary Grant-like role. <br /> <br /> Ralph Bellamy is great when the girlfriend comes back to life through his relationship with Lombard's character. One can only wonder why her character does not want his soft, reassuring love instead of the almost certain punishment of MacMurray's inefficiency. But it's Hollywood! <br /> <br /> The photo works almost but misses the point, mainly due to MacMurray's performance. It would be great to see Grant or even Clark Gable in his role. Lombard and Bellamy are largely credible and enjoyable; MacMurray is stiff and lets you keep him at arm's length.
