Seems like a pretty innocent choice at first - the name "employee of the month" can ring bells with "Office Space" and the show "Office Clerk." I do not think so. It's not even a dark comedy. The director of this movie, whoever was the man's name, was a complete jerk and had a sick, perverted thought. There is no pleasure in being embarrassed to feel sorry for a complete loser who is cheating on his wife, stealing from his groundbreaking work and lying 24/7 through his teeth. The second I walked to the room when my family saw it (and believe me, they just watched it because they were praying for at least a relief, maybe even a fable in the end, a hot message send out good justice and when the good guys look good). All the good guys were killed so long ago that they didn't have the time to look good. No memorial was made. <br /> <br /> This movie has frenzied madness. It respects the elderly, the dead and the women - and the director tries to make people feel it. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a two because the soundtrack was good. But it wasn't even so memorable. If you were lucky not to see them in theaters, you definitely shouldn't do my friends at home.
