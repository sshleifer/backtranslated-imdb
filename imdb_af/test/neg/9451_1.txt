It's seriously the worst movie I've ever seen. From the beginning the movie goes straight down the hill with its cheese music score, poor acting, and total lack or real story or plot. Even for a B movie, it is right on the right. After reading some of the good reviews, I thought I'd keep an open mind and watch. But all the bad reviews were so right. I don't quite understand how anyone could enjoy it. I'm a big Sci-Fi fan and it was much more than I could swallow. Definlty does yourself a favor moving to another movie. They are many other better movies dealing with this subject. YOU ARE WARNING.
