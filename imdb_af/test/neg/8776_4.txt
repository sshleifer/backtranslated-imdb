I loved this movie when it first came out (but I was only 12 years old - and I forgot that this movie existed until one day I got a used copy for sale at a petrol station. I bought it and I couldn't wait to watch this movie I loved as a child and when I saw this movie again many years later, it hit me. loved a child and saw it again as an adult I realized that this movie is terrible, the heart of this movie is that they have everything to make the biggest western ever and they have blown it! , good actors, there are 2 music scores that the orchestra is wonderful, and live with the classic spirit of the old timey Lone Ranger alive.The second score is a series of songs by country music such as Merle Haggerd and The Statler Brothers and the songs like The Man in the Mask, bad that they are funny This movie's strongest point is that it had a brilliant storyline and one of the best west There's another plot, and for a while it's fun to watch John Reid return to health after he and his co-runners were left behind. It's fun to see him grow in his new life and identity as the Lone Ranger. his identity, and goes on a revenge career to get the gang responsible for the killing of his brother and all his fellow runners with whom he drove. But unfortunately, just as well as the storyline, it's all ruined by Merle Haggard. Everything you see happens to it. (For the love of God, why did they do that?) Between Merle Haggard's Narration and The Statler Brothers singing stupid songs like 'Ride Little Cowboy' in the background, this movie makes it impossible to be serious. I would like to see a very good producer take the same writing and story and re-create this movie because at the heart of this silly movie is a great western .--- I would dress this movie as a beautiful woman the ugliest clothes. I give it 4 stars out of 10 - if you are 12 years old and don't know better then you might love it.
