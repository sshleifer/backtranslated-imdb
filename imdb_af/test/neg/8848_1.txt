Don't see this movie. In most cases, such as Ju-On and The Grudge, the Japanese film is infinitely better than the American remake. However, this movie was terrible. The ghosts, much like a trick or treat dressed as a cloth ghost stick in an effort to be scary in the absence of good makeup or special effects and the acting is just awful. The story itself is contradictory and confusing, and not everything is explained, and the film goes from bad to worse. Don't waste your time with this movie, it's not worth it and I'm sure there are more entertaining things to do - like to look dry.
