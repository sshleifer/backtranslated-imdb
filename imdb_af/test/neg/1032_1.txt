Although the numbers are higher in relation to other areas of society, I do not object to the extremely high salaries of many of today's entertainers and athletes. <br /> <br /> A-Rod, LeBron or Brady all have good 8 figures, or the low-9 area. Ray Romano and Jerry Seinfeld can actually become billionaires of their performances, huge residuals and fees they currently claim. Even their role players, and all the "Friends" group, have reached close to or more than 7 figures per episode. Letterman's earnings for one show can solve most people's financial problems, and a week or two can do a lot for life. <br /> <br /> But all these are based on sound provision / principles and the financial benefits they have. bring to their employers. And everyone does their craft ably. <br /> <br /> But then someone like Rachel Ray comes along, reaching a level of earnings that is far beyond any apparent level of talent or skill. I find her shrill, annoying, and with a forced "perkiness" that is as false as the proverbial "3-dollar bill". <br /> <br /> A friend of mine is responsible for special events, events and convention plans for her firm and affiliates. One of the top talent sources has hundreds of clients available from the $ 5-10K level, to a handful of $ 200K and higher per look. (This area includes Trump, Seinfeld, Lance Armstrong, Robin Williams, and not a joke, Larry the Cable Guy.) <br /> <br /> There is a larger number in the $ 100.00 - 200,000 range; List includes the likes of Bill Cosby, Steve Martin and even the co-star Larry's benefactor, Jeff Foxworthy. <br /> <br /> This category includes Rachael Ray. I think I have to admit that there is enough demand for her talent and offers to justify her talk show, and there can be someone over $ 100K, + first class air, hotel package, all expenses and limos door-to-door, for a few hours of her spicy prattle at their organization's event. <br /> <br /> I just can't figure out how-in-hell it might be.
