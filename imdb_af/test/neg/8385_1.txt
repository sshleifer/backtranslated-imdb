This movie was so bad. If someone from those who played in the movie read it, including the director, I hate you! LOL, that blonde woman running away, screams through the forest. At least, you need less than a screen, and keep the dodgy sword out! and oh dear God, if it were the director who sorted the cameras on this one, then go back to a normal job. No one wants to watch a scared woman's chin. Dennis, don't even think about renting / buying or even a copy of this within 100 meters radius of your home, as it could be harmful to people who love good movies ... When I got home, I thought id hired a pronale movie by the acting and style of the camera.
