I had high expectations for this one after reading previous reviews, but it was so slow and the plot so basic, I wondered if I had read the wrong reviews. <br /> <br /> Please, a boy meets girl next door at 11 and both strive to love and be basketball legends. Grow apart, but look at each other's progress. Guess what! Both get bursaries at the same university and are again being caught out to his father to play with a younger woman. Our young hero who cannot handle falls into court concentration, but some decide to do and drop studies, and guess what is picked up by the Lakers. Immerse the heroine because she wasn't there during this emotional period. So for 5 years they are going their own way. She comes back from Spain after losing the game and our hero will marry within two weeks. Mom tells her to fight her love so she confesses her running love and challenges him to a basketball shootout. He wins the wedding with his win he loves her. Well, he won, but decided to dump another girl for our girl. The end has her basketball and he has baby duties. Sorry 2 is my high score. My partner recorded her 0 for a soap story for those who read Mills and Boon
