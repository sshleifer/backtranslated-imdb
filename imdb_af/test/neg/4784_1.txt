I watched the first 10 minutes of this show, and I think I'm going to barf now! A worst program on TV. It's not even funny. It's so nice it's disgusting. I gave it a second and the third change couldn't make it even by five minutes. Don't waste time. This is one of the many shows that should go well. Speaking of regular night time shows that it is necessary to go. All the shows on CBS. All the shows on ABC. All those shows at FOX and Joe Buck. All the shows on the new CW network. All those appearances on NBC. (Accept the law and order series). Show all Morning and Afternoon talks. All Court TV shows. And every reality is out there !! Every stupid game show. period end! All Home Improvement Show! And all the media news. Even if it is. It's a 24-hour bad news. Yes, I have favorites Monk, the law and orders it is for me.
