After looking back at the previews for a while, I looked forward to Steve Martin in a comedy I thought might be a custodian. Unfortunately I was wrong. Problem was, the previews were the only funny parts of the movie. The rest of the movie was almost a bunch of junk, scenes killed and characters we've all seen a thousand times. <br /> <br /> This movie was positive if you put enough cash on the table you can talk to anyone in something. Steve Martin is a favorite of mine, but this one was a great clunker. The only actor in the movie that was worth watching was Eugene Levy; He was the best of a mighty cripple.
