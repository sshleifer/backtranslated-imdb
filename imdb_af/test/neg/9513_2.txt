This is by far the worst version of William Shakespeare's tragic masterpiece I've ever seen. The filmmakers don't seem to have read Shakespeare's text. No, they just took what they wanted from the Lawerence Olivier movie. The plot is unsteady and rounded to its bare necessity, but there is time for the non-cannon Olivier, who created a eyewitness between Hamlet and Queen Gertrude. Could we have instead replaced the "Something rotten in the state of Denmark"? Casting is another problem. I understand that the far superior Branagh movie had its weak bits (Robin Williams and Charlton Heston come to mind), but this one has very few good moments. I do like Laertes and Polonius, but the rest of the role is outdated. Mel Gibson's creepy stubble is annoying, and one often wonders if he has any idea what he says. Many of the actors seem to have just memorized the part - they know less about what is said to be sophomores in high school. <br /> <br /> If you want a version of Hamlet, check out Kenneth Branagh or even Lawerence Olivier. To be honest, even Disney's Hamlet is better.
