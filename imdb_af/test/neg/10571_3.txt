This movie is funny if you are the man who has put about three rows behind me (repeating each blow line, laughing when there were no gags on the screen and outreach a horrible "haaaa" on each scene where a computer or mobile device was involved). <br /> <br /> For everyone else, this is a moderate, bathed "comedy." The film follows strictly the formula of the later "Scary Movie" movies, as well as "Epic Movie" and "Meet the Spartans", but without the flood of heartless pop culture references that made the latter two annoying. Yet, the display of intellectual and peace figures all over the world makes it clear that the film has come to its attention: people who are jealous of brain power. "Superhero Movie" is especially and consistently dirty for Stephen Hawking. Known as a sex-reinforced drug, he uses his disability as a slap stick vehicle. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on "Spider-Man" with "Batman Begins" and "X-Men" cast just to deliver physical comedy. Much of the movie is slapstick, but not in a refreshing or interesting way. The longest run is a fiery joke, and early on, the screenwriters seem to believe that the main character thrown into striking heaps of fake animal powder automatically creates an otherwise uninspired Spider-Man spider scene rehash. Perhaps the only redeeming feature of this feature is its energy, especially absent in other recent parodies. The filmmakers play as if they are doing something new, and the audience can feel the way the actors bounce around the screen. An extremely shortened length (about an hour and fifteen minutes) and the appearance of the presentation make "Superhero Movie" tolerant rather than abominable.
