You will be more excited to cut off your testicles than look at it, and it is obviously a trick to let you "Descent" rent instead of "The Descent", which is a much better movie. <br /> <br /> It's a total tear of "The Core" and much, much worse with regard to special effects, I can do better with a box of cornflakes and a roll of tinfoil, I mean come! .... that "mole" thing carries more like a vibrating dildo than an underground vehicle. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it - if you find the room you get in, you have a strange smell for days. in the back of your head you have to kill yourself or something.
