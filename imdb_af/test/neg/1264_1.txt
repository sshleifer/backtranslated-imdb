Czech moviegoers can enjoy and rate this film very much because it was Czech, but I found it to be boring, boring, moron, boring and unkind. Again, I suspect "ramping" to increase the sales of this dog from a movie. Amazon describes this film as a few fellows who refuse to grow up, but I go one further. I think it's about two fellows who have a condition of dementia and perform actions that don't make sense to anyone. I told one of the actors in the film had committed suicide, and I believe it. When he saw his performance, he probably realized what an abominable work he had done and realized that the only way to avoid the end of the embarrassment was to make the "big exit", which I was probably much more dramatic and a much better performance he did in the fall spring. Don't waste your time or money on this pathetic performance. It's nothing but a dog in a crib.
