It's a great movie for the first time ninjas. If you are trying to impress a cute little ninette, I would highly recommend playing this masterpiece. It's one of those special movies that lets you miss big parts without interfering with the plot. <br /> <br /> I also wondered where did a Teal Ninja hide? Is ninjas so colored? Is this normal? If I was attacked by one of these yellow or orange ninjas, I would die of laughter before giving in to his sword. <br /> <br /> And I completed my black star ninja test the other day, that was the majority, it went. quite good. I have found many questions about how to "sneak around" and look evil. It's all about the eyebrows and the attitude. <br /> <br /> Basically, the movie could have been better than: 1. There was no color-coded ninjas (or the color-coded ninja can combine in a superninja). 2. Joe died in the first two minutes and Patricia had to avenge him 3. Various monkeys were scattered by the file 4. Patricia did not speak and Patricia was replaced with another character 6. The French man was also a black star ninja 7 Chris Tucker, Whoopi Golderg and Chris Rock were added as 'comic' relief. 8. Ninja strengths came from miticlorians.
