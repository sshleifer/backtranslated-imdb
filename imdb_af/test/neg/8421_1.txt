One of the worse gay-related movies I've ever seen. Since it's not characters in this story, it's hard to comment on the real movie. Therefore, since Colton Ford (aka Glen) opened his life for everyone to see, he thinks he's fair to criticize. And it's not hard to do. Here we go. 50 something Glen is a great time roster that wants fame and happiness as a great time singer. (I think 11 movies make him a "star"). If he's gay and forty, I've seen porn and I didn't recognize him or her lover. Personally, they all look the same with different hair styles. See, guys, he's not Jeff Stryker, Jim Bently or Casey Donovon. This is good. The purpose of these movies takes place in about 6.5 minutes, so everyone has pretty much the same requirements as you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> So, Glen wants to be a serious (legal) singer after dropping off the porn industry, but he can't get someone to take him seriously. I wonder why? Was he so stupid to think that he could wipe his clothes and record his sex on the film. And according to the movie it's not just a porn movie he comes in, it lives in a house with other stars where people can hook in their bedroom, bathroom and wherever via webcams. It is $ 500 an hour to entertain at a private party. Strip performances at clothing optional "hotels". Doing something called meth is a drug. And then you have the balls to get angry when someone at a clubgig tries to touch you - because he's now "legitimate". Oy! <br /> <br /> The only interesting, non-cardboard character is the Oscar-winning gay screenwriter who wouldn't give his name. And with this in mind, a documentary, well, porn is like porn. You can say he is most amused by the dumb-bunny porn star. <br /> <br /> Glen wants to sell him a hilarious driver (Kyle) who wants to sell him as a porn contestant. klubgigs. He tries to do the Svengalli routine. "Wear it" "Don't smile" "say it" to what extent the issues are controlling. But our anti-hero will not be controlled or tell what to do. The first mistake. I'm not saying Kyle is right, but when an emerging singer begins to question the driver, they're not going far. Similarly, he who is his own lawyer has a fool for a client. /> <br /> All this would not have been bad if it wasn't for a little bit of information. Drum roll, please. He's bad. He sucks. His singing talent is there with Ashlee Simpson. hard to root for someone - while trying to make his dream come true --- at 50! --- Doesn't work like ordinary people. No work. Can you say lazy-ass? And the whine and the "Why don't they accept me?" Song and dance. And a few months to scrape the surface of the music industry, he says, "Why don't I have a record deal now?" What? Actors are waiters. Writers work in newspapers or low levels - whatever. This man is above it. It is true. He now wants his success just because he decided he wanted it. Whine. Whine Whine. His lover leaves him to return to nursing, but I tell you I don't want the moron to give me medical care. Both of them were useless. Airheads. The movie is useless. Unless you really like Whine and Cheeesy people stay away. Don't waste your money on the crazy lives of people who are useless. There are many more interesting things at the bottom of your shoe.
