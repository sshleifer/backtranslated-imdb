usually a movie that starts badly remains bad in a monotonic decreasing pattern. This bad movie started to look better before going into a steep dive. The play, except for the male antagonist, was terrible. The plot was essentially a set-up for the final main zone, which is probably good as performance art, but it was wasted in this movie. Not sure why this movie was made.
