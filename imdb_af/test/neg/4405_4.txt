I wanted to keep this movie for all kinds of reasons. The subject is inherently interesting and is probably the most important problem facing the world today and has fascinating works (eg Linda Grant's When I lived in modern times) usually from the Israeli side of the fence. Also, a block I liked to say, thought it was the best movie he saw all year, so with such a recommendation ... <br /> <br /> But I actually have myself clipped on points! Although I was tired and the movie seats were comfortable, I had too much trouble identifying with the characters. Only when I got my head was the idea that it was a series of vignettes, I went with it, but it made me disappointing as a sketch show rather than a movie. I like the concept of a built-in, almost silent mise and scene that is opposed to these utopian moments - the sexy girl, the red balloon and the ninja-Muslim fighter. But personally, I think the movie is overheated. I'm not saying storytelling and plot is everything (it's definitely not), but even a little more dialogue would have helped.
