I am in awe of the number of people who regard this movie as decent ... much less good! Do most people even have basic standards for a movie they watch? I just don't know anymore. <br /> <br /> This "commercial movie product" doesn't really deserve to be called a movie. Calling Dean Cain talented is a huge injustice for anyone who actually has talent. I had a lot of respect for Lori Petty, but most of them went straight into the tubes. She was at least extremely small. Maybe she had an account that had to pay desperately. <br /> <br /> The ignorance I saw while viewing "Firetrap" was incredible. Let me start by getting it off my chest: if you can't show realistic fire, don't show it at all. Okay? !! It's an embarrassment to everyone involved when you indicate lambing effects that aren't even close to the actual burning building. <br /> <br /> Some interesting dots: 1. An attorney opens the door to a large storage box and finds the whole room engulfed in flames. What does he do? He tries to pour out the fire with his best! 2. The same officer (who knows the building is on fire) later comes across a door labeled "Dangerous Material". His brilliant mind tells him it would be a good idea to open the door. Big mistake! 3. A woman gives a fantastic generous donation of $ 100,000 to a greyhound rescue fund, but ... she wears a fur coat to the charity event they love! (Will not people who care about animals that are so good?) 4. Several people in the movie are forced into a safe of some kind with massive steel walls even an electromagnetic pulse (!!) does not penetrate . Yet, they have a spacious air jet that leads straight into the back of the thing that anyone can crawl. It seems to be a lapse in security. <br /> <br /> I can keep on and on, but I kept thinking about this lame movie. Our "hero" for whom we should be delighted is a career criminal who previously tried to kill some police officers. What a swell guy! If the general public throws away their thoughts on this drift, then they will have more power. I just wish I could delete it from my memory. 10/01
