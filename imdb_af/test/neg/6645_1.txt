I would not recommend this movie. Although it is graded G and it is clear to children, there are quite a lot of curses (including the dreaded 'F' and 'S' words). This kind of language doesn't insult me, but in a children's movie? Come on. <br /> <br /> There was also some implied sexual content between one of the early adolescent male characters and any willing adult woman who came together - including a prostitute! <br /> <br /> The acting was as good as it was in this movie genre, but the story line was very bare and even my four-year-old noticed it was "stupid. <br /> <br /> Despite Elizabeth Shue, this movie is definitely not worth checking out if you haven't seen it.
