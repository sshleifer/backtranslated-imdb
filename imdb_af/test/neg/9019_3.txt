This spectacular late 50's sci-fi horror sklock isn't quite a loser. It's about a manned space rocket that lands the accident in a remote area. A lot of scientists are investigating and discovering that the astronaut is in a coma; He is kept alive by alien embryos that are mysteriously implanted in him. In any case, the title alien monster quickly raises the head causing general destruction, including partial head removal. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the movie is pacing. It takes quite a while for the Blooddeath to appear, and it only comes in its own in the last 20 minutes. He is undoubtedly a completely ridiculous creation, but it's not really a problem, as he offers a fair comic relief. At the end of the movie where we have the final expectation and start talking to this ridiculous creature with the doctor's voice he had killed earlier, you will do well not to have a giggle. So also in the brilliant x-ray scene where we see the alien embryos floating in the astronaut's body - it's just too funny for words. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, however, the fun moments of the beast of the night come too little and far between. However, if you are a 50-year-old sci-fi note, it is worth checking this one. Don't expect too much.
