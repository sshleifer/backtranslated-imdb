If I was still 5, I found it scary. This is a low budget movie. The acting is not good, but can be worse - filming and special effects are terrible. The story line is thin and not worth living on. Too much time is spent on boring screaming scenes. The chase or battle with strangers reminds me of children driving battles with scary masks. Some gore with blood and body parts - a 5-year-old child will frighten what I think. Apparently, some of the people are crazy about the movie. <br /> <br /> It's far from anything like the movie Tremors. <br /> <br /> It seems to be an "incident". and we see alien ships near the earth. It makes you wonder if any will make a successor ...
