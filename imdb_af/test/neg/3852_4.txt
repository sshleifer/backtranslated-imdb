The only reason anyone wants to see this movie is because of John Leguizamo. I remember the previews, and it looks like it's a second-class comedy. But the fact that Mr Leguizamo is dying has tried to solve it. His name, how well known it was then or not, tried to sell it. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with Leguizamo's performance. His days at the "House of Buggin" (a Living Color clone) were his top-notch. There is a fine line between wackiness and idiot, and we will just say that Leguizamo crossed it tenfold. He seemed to be trying to be shameful and crazy about the camera. In fact, I'll say he's been trying too hard. Madcap humor was inundated with stupidity, and the film was spoiled. I can't say I'm guilty of him. If you got the opportunity, would you try so hard if you're right? Your eagerness costs you although Mr. Leguizamo ... <br /> <br /> The plague follows in the tradition of any comedy film, and plays the "race card" and more. No group is left out to be fun. Blacks, Latin, Whites, Jews, Koreans, Germans, Homosexuals, and the Blind are among those who are singled out. Again, things get bored, and too much trying to get too little time. The resolution of the movie has been taking five minutes to clean and return to normality. <br /> <br /> If you have a movie, and you're going to bypass plot and reality because of comedy, make sure it's funny or all you have is 90 minutes of silent movie. What would Leguizamo's "plague" sum up very well ...
