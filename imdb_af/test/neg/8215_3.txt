** May Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> The main character, a nobleman, called Fallon, is stranded on an island with characters that are so looney and deadly that he may have drowned better. Count Lorente de Sade (pronounced "dee-SAYd") speaks with his own hallucinations and sees all invaders on the island as invading pirates. He routinely beats Anne Anne's routine and tortures his unwilling guests in the dungeon. Ceaseless laughter is provided by giant "Nubian" slave mansions who speak with a deep south accent and help the Sade to hunt trespassers in the style of THE MORE DANGEROUS GAME. De Sade's wasted woman, who was devastated by leprosy, offers a few real and scary moments as she covers the dungeon and embraces a helpless prisoner. (This scene was seen on the late-night television by many children who had the memory of adulthood.) The one almost normal person in sight is Cassandra, who has fallen into self science. ("I was a former nurse, now I'm not much.") She and Fallon plan their escape and eventually an enemy becomes more frightening than the Sade and Mantis combined. <br /> <br /> This movie was shot in San Antonio and a man capable of drawing horror comics than making horror movies. (I will say so much to Mr Boyette - he shows his fixation here, as he did in his comics.) Rather, it is like an Andy Milligan melodrama minus the meat nail. The period wardrobe, library music, abuse of the disabled and everyday misanthropy makes one wonder if Andy was not reported as a consultant. Milligan, however, made better costumes and wrote better dialogue. Technical gaffes are too much to list here, but you know this movie is in trouble if you see the breakdown, which seems to have been shot in a fish tank. Also, a movie made in Texas should actually have spiders and snakes, rather than rubbers. Glorious East Mancolor gives this melodrama the mad look it deserves so richly. Fallon's initial encounter with the leper Countess is really scary, just as the film's farewell shot. If the rest were half as hard, THE DUNGEON OR HARROW would have been a scare classic. Instead, it's a funny piece of shock that lovers of garbage will love for all the wrong reasons.
