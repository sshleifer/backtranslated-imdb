Super-scratch scraper, who feels too long in 80 minutes. Years ago, a bunch of "gypsies" living in the caves of a mountain burned in a forest fire. Years later, campers leave the fire. A bunch of horny kids are obviously on their way to this area for an elusive camping trip of their own. Despite an ominous well-being of the ranger (Jackson Bostwick), the children clash in any way to the mountain. Earlier, the children started the monster, which remained unseen until the end of the movie, probably because the makeup was so embarrassingly bad. No surprises to speak of: they are killed in the exact sequence that dictates the formula for these movies, leaving the "final girl" to fight herself, although the final girl is caught and fertilized in a refreshingly crap through the monster. <br /> <br /> The story itself couldn't capture the weight of feature length, and it was stuffed with seemingly endless shots of wildlife and insects, which of course were shot at another movie and inserted randomly as a remedy here. be. to make the movie long enough for a video release. On the positive side, the wildlife photos are quite nice. Also among the highlights is Bostwick to a baby girl, a decent rock-climbing death agreement, OK Gore, and the Big Jackie Coogan in his final movie, as the rude local sheriff. It's far from Charlie Chaplin, but it was still nice to see him. It's just for treasure competitions.
