Flesh Feast starts at Miami Airport, Ace reporter Dan Carter (Harry Kerwin, also credited with production center). His friend Ed Casey (Phil Philbin) called him back from South America where he had investigated Carl. Schuman (Doug Foster) and that he was on a great story, but while still talking on the phone, he was stabbed in the back and death. Schuman meets dr. Elaine Frederick (Veronica Lake, his also executive producer) recently released from a spiritual institution, together they discuss their pork plans. The news of Cater's death reached Casey, and he decided to record the story himself and investigate. Actually, he gets his secretary Viginia Day (Marth Mischon) to do most of the investigations and just report back to him lazy bugger. Virginia tells Casey that they have someone inside named Kristine (Heather Hughes), since Dr. Frederick renting her spare rooms to nurses, Kristine reports back to Casey about Schuman and dr. Frederick's grotesque youth recovery experiments including human flesh and specially grown virgins ... <br /> <br /> Co wrote, co-produced and directed by Brad F. Grinter Flesh Feast is a fairly poor film on all accounts. First, we start with the script by Grinter & Thomas Casey, who was also responsible for the movies (you get the feeling that most of the cast & crew had more than one job). It's really awful. The character is one-dimensional idiots and has no personality, I didn't like anyone in this movie. For what it is worth, I love many of the ideas here, the carnivorous virgins, the cellar laboratory, hospital stalwarts and the unforgettable 'twist' ending it is almost worthwhile to go through the rest of the movie yourself. down. Unfortunately, the dialogue is so badly written, stiff and unnatural, it is untrue, I think there is one scene in which a nurse says they "will not leave us out of the house" which is good, except for the fact that she is talking OUTSIDE in the garden for someone. No thought has been put into the story, as there is never an explanation for why meat-eating virgins can restore youth, in fact at one point near the end when questioning this issue. Dr. Frederick claims there is no time to explain at that stage which seems to me like the people who wrote it, have no idea either! Even for a very short 68 minutes, Flesh Feast is very slow and boring, the poor editing does not help with scenes and shots that last too long. For example, there is a scene in which an ambulance acts outside a hospital, drives up to the doors, the man walks out, walks to the back doors and makes them. etc. do we really need to see every detail? There is also another order in which dr. Enter Frederick's room and put some gloves on, then take them away in the opposite room and put on some more! Personally, I think Grinter probably didn't shoot enough material, so he stretches out every scene as much as he can to make the time run. However, I do that bizarre end, but I really do. Technically Flesh feast is a complete crap, I'm not sure what the budget was for, but it should have been small. About the whole movie takes place in one house. Dr. Frederick's lab consists of a table, some plastic cups and test tubes, some old electronic medical equipment and a strange screen with funny colors on it (don't ask). The cinematography is poor, the music sucks and the whole movie is bought, also called bad. The exploitation components are also disappointing, there are a few makeshoes, but they do nothing but wander a little. There is a short scene where a dead body has its bone, cut off and an OK-checked body and limbs hanging on hooks. The acting is terrible for everyone involved, and I mean very badly, which makes the dirty dialogue even worse. Do yourself a favor and avoid Flesh Feast, yes, there are one or two inadvertently funny moments. The end is good, unique to say the least, but mostly it is a real amateur filmmaking that is quickly painful to watch. I doubt most people will go through it, it's one sitting, I can only tolerate just about anything, but even I considered switching it off. Definitely one to avoid, you'll be glad you did. If you really have to see it, don't say you're not warned!
