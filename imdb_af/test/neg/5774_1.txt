And unfortunately I did. Any movie that relies on a bad pun if its tagline or its title should be transferred to the $ 2.00 bin, but we decided to try a second movie movie movie that was going on for a second. We had a winner in "House of the Dead" - go with that one if you want a laughable movie. <br /> <br /> Some witch jumped into the water after being hit by Mr. Miner has been appointed. Some have a shower in the forest. And the same man grabbed a new girl right in front of his guy. I don't remember much else. The last third of the movie was completely indifferent, and we were all waiting in the pain until the end.
