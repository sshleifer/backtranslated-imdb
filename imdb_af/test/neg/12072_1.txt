Well, I think I finally saw my last Woody Allen movie! I read the review in the paper and will see this movie with the expectation that I have a good Woody Allen experience (as I have had many times in the past). Well, that wasn't the case. This movie has nothing to offer. Even with the wonderful performance of the talented Sean Penn - this movie failed. One of the features of his other movies is various characters - variety, witty dialogue. This movie basically consists of just one character - very one dimensional. It had almost no laughter. It probably looks good on paper! I think the only thing special was the performance of Samantha Morton. Now I'm looking for her movies in the future. So, finally, this movie was a big disappointment. >
