Being one of the founding members of my region's monkey movie club (including apes / chimps and orangutans). I reviewed this movie from a monkey movie standpoint. After that, it's a whole summer of monkeys, 100+ days for monkeys to do what they do best, solve cause of mishaps, psychologists, hypothesis, human problems and teach us about ourselves. <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough. In short, poor boy needs money for things he wants. Fortunately, there are a few monkeys (chimpanzees) who have a bounty on their head that will get Boba Fett or Dog's (Duane Chapman) blood flow. As the boy tries to catch the monkeys, he learns about himself, his family, his grandfather, the local weirdo, flirting with a girl twice his age and learning the animal's way of dealing with bulls is to get someone a shotgun on them. br /> <br /> Inside lies the problem. So much focus is put on the boy that the chimps just don't get the screen time they deserve. The chimpanzees are not as talented as the chimpanzee (s) Jack plays from the M_P trilogy or the legendary orangutans who play Dunstin or Clyde (1 or 2). So don't look at this movie that expects to find the next big thing in the Chimpanzee genre. The chimpanzees hit a few sweet flips, which needed the movie more. There is an epic scene of the chimpanzees breaking into the poor family home and destroying all the stuff they have worked so hard. Serious monkey movie enthusiasts will want to rent the movie alone for this scene. <br /> <br /> So in the end, this movie isn't for the serious monkey movie enthusiast. I would not recommend this movie to families as it encourages a child's uprising against their parents. I can only recommend this movie as a rental for hardcore monkey loving adults and well supervised children.
