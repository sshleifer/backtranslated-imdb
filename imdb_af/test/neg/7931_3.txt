This is another pseudo-intellectual "Let's make the Nazis really bad" movie. The Nazis were pretty bad, no doubt. Most already know it. However, this does not necessarily make every movie on the theme good. A Discovery Channel presentation by "The Wannsee Conference" would have been much more interesting. <br /> <br /> "Conspiracy" falls on its hole between two categories: documentary and drama. It doesn't cut it as a documentary, the movie is "staged" and the presentation is too general. It doesn't cut it like a drama, the characters are too shallow and conflicts are too easy to solve. <br /> <br /> Another thing is the tagline: "One of the greatest crimes against humanity has been committed in just over one hour." As the movie shows the Wannsee Conference, the meeting had nothing to do with reaching a consensus on the final solution. The decision on the solution has already been taken by the SS. The sole purpose of the meeting was to commit all significant stakeholders to an already established plan. There were no decisions or plans made at the Wannsee Conference. There were only threats and coercion (some needed less than others). Finally: The one thing that the film shows (though not in any way) has the tendency towards culture and aesthetics in an effort to hide from itself the fact that it is committing terrible atrocities. It is seen in most power congressions 'leaders' and politicians.
