Let me first say that I am a believer of ghosts, and I know they exist. I had enough experiences with them to know they were there. <br /> <br /> What I hate is the people who bring the Bible and Religion into all these things. People forget that there is more than one "Bible", thousands of religions and beliefs, and different ways of interpreting what is said in the Bible. Not everyone believes in God, and not everyone believes in stereotypical religion. <br /> <br /> Religion does not make everything by itself, one of the things I have to mention in the Bible, which many do not know is that even the most turbulent Bible bumper transgresses the rules that are inside. ... you should never carry more than one substance at a time, slavery is OK, and you can kill your neighbor under certain circumstances. Not one of these, "Oh, that was the Old Testament, and now we have the New Testament." If the Bible is the word of God and cannot be changed, there must be no changes or versions. Religion is full of wrong interpretations, mixed facts and people so blindly following that there is "There is no other way." The apologies that blind followers have been used are pathetic, or they themselves cannot properly explain the differences, but use excuses that they deliver from their pastor or teacher. <br /> <br /> But anyway, on the review. I am a decent fan of "Ghost Hunters" and when I heard this show was coming soon, I was very excited and thought it had a potential. As much as I like to watch Ghost Hunters, I don't like their members, and I don't like the way they can dismiss a haunted house, but can't explain anything about it. Just because your investigation equipment doesn't pick it up doesn't mean the camera that filmed the show. I'm glad they are skeptical, but that's the way they don't understand, just because you haven't got anything on your recorder and movie doesn't follow the place or not. If it were so easy to catch, it would be known as a fact, not a faith. It's more of a "right place at the right time" kind of thing, as well as if there's something there, what makes you think it's going to do for you? This show is kind of stupid. It's usually boring, and there is a lot of talk, a lot of psychology, but almost nothing happens. The chief's filtered narration is usually boring to listen to, or is basically unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Trust in psychology is too much, because I believe many of them are actually gifted. Silvia Brown is one I definitely believe, but most are sometimes hard to believe. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this show, but I was quite impressed by the ones I saw.
