On the positive, I would say it is reasonable enough to be vigilant. Negative is insufficient to regret another 2 hours of life wasted before the screen. Long, shiny and useless. And I didn't say it was meaningful, I wanted this movie, everything seems to be going on, the so-called "buzz", and it was also a hassle to continue tracking. If there is a little more trouble on the story side, I believe it would have been wonderful. And I expect the team to do great work behind it in the future, they clearly have the ability. But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.
