I was aware of Man of the Year's critical pans and unbeatable gross but was prepared to give the film the benefit of the doubt, because I know good pictures can fall under the radar during the sustained release schedule of the autumn months. <br /> <br /> What I found out is that the movie is surprisingly uninspired. Surprisingly, an understatement is considering Barry Levinson's gift for political satire (demonstrated in Good Morning Vietnam and Wag the Dog) and Robin Williams's obvious comic gifts. Robin Williams, in fact, is mysteriously underutilized. On the "Making Of" featurette coming with the DVD, Barry Levinson talked about how sometimes he made Robin Williams improvise the writing, as it was a naughty secret of her. Um? Are you really so much of a moron, Barry Levinson? When you have Robin Williams in your movie and want to use it for his comic abilities (basically, every movie he has in others like Insomnia or One Hour Photo), don't get him in a screenplay. Let him ad lib what he wants, because he is more beautiful than anyone else can write for him and his uncontrolled comics can instantly boost the bar on any mediocre movie like RV or Patch Adams. What I was even more surprised by was failing to use Robin Williams in 1987, Levinson used this exact formula to perfection in Good Morning Vietnam. Robin Williams's outbursts of comic zaniness in a war photo injected around a resounding political piece. <br /> <br /> The movie isn't so much of a laugh as it can be and feels awkwardly lost in its tone. If the film has the potential to work as something, it may have been made in the style of The Pelican Letter, The Fugitive, or one of the Jack Ryan films in the mid-1990s. His plot has centered on an employee at a Silicon Valley company who has uncovered a glitch in a system stating that the country has chosen the wrong president and the efforts of the CEO to eliminate her before the secret. coming out, so if you replaced Robin Williams with Harrison-Ford-type actor, or maybe even Harrison Ford himself, a few extra explosions added, and maybe that's where the movie tried. I will never really know and it is not worth finding out.
