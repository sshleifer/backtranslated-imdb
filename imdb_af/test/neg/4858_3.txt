This 22 minutes short, short of a precursor to the later much better "Rock and Rule", features two folk singer mice that go nowhere. The female mouse, Jan, signs a deal with the devil to become a hit stone. So it is up to Daniel Muis to save her soul. Made in the late 70's, it has all the bumps of the said decade (crap music, crap clothes and hairstyle, terrible folk songs). This cartoon appears on the second disc of the 2-Disk Collector's Edition of Rock and Rule. It also comes with a make of it running almost as long as the show itself. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D +
