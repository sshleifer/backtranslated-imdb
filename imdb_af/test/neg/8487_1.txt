Well, I had the chance to see this movie. I didn't know what to expect, because I never saw the trailer and so ... but what I just discovered by watching the first 10 minutes is that this movie is the worst I ever had the accident has. <Br /> <br /> I wish I could give this movie a 0 rating. The first 10 minutes were bad, but as soon as it went to the party zone, I just wanted to enter a coma. It was really bad. The actors had no direction, there was not a real story, I read some reviews saying she was good if you had a little child to entertain 90 minutes, etc. But really, why should we expose children to this type of movie? She has poor humor, rude and coarse comedy at its best and focuses on poor special effects to fill 80% of his time. I'm sure a few people in Hollywood will be in these streets in the streets. <br /> <br /> Also, How can 39 people give this movie 10. I mean, get real someone who gives this movie a 10 has some spiritual issues and or works for the movie company. This movie should average 1.5 / 10 instead of its current 2.3 / 10 due to the people it ranked 10. Really sad.
