Okay, first I have to say I accept it's just made by a group of friends with a limited budget. With that in mind, it really should not be compared to firmer features and my rating will be higher. But still ... <br /> <br /> After giving it a chance, it still violated some basic movie rules that both the viewer and the amateur director cut into me. Think: Blair Witch in a car, but VERY bored. Think: You left your camcorder on the dashboard and lost yourself in the park at night. an hour, then your friends watch it. <br /> <br /> The scariest part (POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT ... IF SPOILING HERE IS POSSIBLE) was at one point the picture back and you might think you'll have to watch it all again. SCARY. <br /> <br /> Aside, it is a pretty good idea for a low-budget go-to-make-movie movie tonight. But the concept runs a fine line between really good and really bad, and let's just say it wasn't really good. There were just too many parts where nothing happened. Initially I thought it was the director's plan - you had to be left in a sense of security and then things would really start scary. But ... no. <br /> <br /> I've been trying to find good things to say about it (and I have enough time to think), and I'll say the music was so cool. And I have to give the female main credit to look through herself and be scared for a very, very long time. But that's it. The actors playing "infected" people seemed to be making fun of zombie movies. Or they got their motivation from the Bug with his Edgar pack of "MIB." Chances are, if you are going to watch this strange reason, it is on DVD or Tivo, so you can move it forward if you wait for something too difficult. <br /> <br /> I hate being so critical of something, but at the same time I watched very similar movies and nothing was ever so painful. If they just dropped out half an hour and added some scary stuff, it could be decent. Maybe it's the director's track ...
