Komodo vs Cobra won't fire the world. This is not a feature of theater history. What it is, is a group of underfunded filmmakers who are trying to make another movie, make another salary, and support themselves and their families. As such, I give these efforts very slack. I mean, come on, it must be hard to be a Russian special effects technician. Very big budget movies are not made. BUT - they are a dedicated bunch and more than willing to throw everyone into what a lame American monster movie needs affordable SFX. And I get a kick to look for the same places that appear repeatedly in these tabs. If for some reason you look at it again, look at the order where Pare and the company run through a "jungle". Look at their feet and you will see paved walkways. And if you still have a copy of "AI Assault" (shown a week or two earlier on SciFi), you'll see the people trampling through the same ersatz jungle. Think about it, I think the helicopters land in the same clearing in both flashes. I can admire the thriftiness of these films. Every dollar really shows up on the screen! Too bad there's just not enough dollars ...
