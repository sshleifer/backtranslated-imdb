Every major romantic comedy needs conflict between the romantic clues to provide plot, anticipation and enjoyment to the plot. This story falls completely flat in this area. There is no conflict - at least no one who will hinder the eventual accession of the two main characters, and such a tension is flat, there is no expectation, and there is really no mercy. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Richard Gere and Diane Lane is at best representative of friendship, and with the talent of these two particular actors I was quite surprised. During the movie, I expected them to play a game of checkers and talk about the weather than to see any passive passion. <br /> <br /> While being a fan of both actors, I believe the casting in this movie was down - or maybe the direction was out of base and it affected their delivery. The writing was very poor, which could also have affected the performances; Certainly, the writing could use some help from some Harlequin writers who have real experience of placing the heat in romance. <br /> <br /> This movie may be worth watching on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but only after it's on the cheap shelf. <br /> <br /> (Sorry Diane Ladd and Richard Gere).
