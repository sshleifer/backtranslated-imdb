It will be difficult to fill these 10 lines. But ill try it (just to prevent others from making the same mistake I did - to see this (terrible and boring) movie. <br /> <br /> I love Patrick Swayze - he has an excellent show in movies like Ghost - Dirty Dancing - Point Break - North and South (TV series), but in this movie ..... ARGH .... This movie is so booooooring, the acting is terrible - the script sucks - well .. i can't even find one good thing, nothing, absolutely nothing, i watched it with 2 other friends and we all agreed that this was one of the most boring movies we ever saw and the fact that it lasts longer than 3 hours (which we did not know) - when part 1 was over and said "go on", we almost cried "nooooooooooooo, we must watch 90 minutes more of this movie !!!!" . <br /> <br /> It is painful to see this movie: you do not get the impression that the actors are Russians, the action scenes are extremely bad. is when the e-truck explodes in the beginning of the movie! The rest is CRAP! Clean your toilet instead of watching this movie (and don't run, cry if you see this movie - you were warned beforehand!) Personally, I would recommend Patrick Swayze to call his agent and have them recall. so bad.
