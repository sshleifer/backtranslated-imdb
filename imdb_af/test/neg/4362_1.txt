Both Killjoy 1 and Killjoy 2 bump, but the first was better. The special effects in this movie were not special at all. Although the murder in this installment was better, it was not something to boast about. One thing that was worse in Part 2 was the characters. They suddenly changed emotions, and some of their lines were just silly. For example, one character quoted, "You have better R.E.S.E.E.C.T or you will find out what matters to me." As soon as I heard that line, it was the worst I've ever heard. Another thing I hated about this movie was the fact that it was too short. A successful movie has to last over one hour and twenty minutes, like Killjoy 2. If Full Moon makes part 3 of Killjoy, it will bend to the lowest level they can possibly go. Overall 1 out of 10. <br /> <br />
