I saw this movie and thought it was a sleeper. Sometimes I come in intellectual romantic movies. This movie just didn't move me. I felt it was about an hour long. Camille is portrayed as a very sympathetic sculptor, who just loses everything. I thought the whole movie was just sad and depressing. If you like tragedies, you feel that way. I just thought it was too long, which means it has many unnecessary scenes, which eventually lead to about one hour of boredom. I would not recommend this movie. If you want to see a good romantic tragedy, see Titanic.
