In the first place, Blythe Danner doesn't look DOWN old enough to play Capshaw's daughter (and she's not just ten years apart). <br /> <br /> I understand this is one of those magical, Moonstruck-type supernatural novels, but it's beyond the pale. Very, very poor in terms of acting, writing and direction. <br /> <br /> The only one who really shines here is Ellen DeGeneres, who makes this movie lookable - if she isn't really credible, as she is thrown a bit of a heterosexual sex dog. But still compassionate. In fact, DeGeneres and the skins of the young man Capshaw dallies make this watch. But no one can really know if Capshaw is really in love with the young man or not; Neither the writing nor her play draws it to us and we still have to wonder how she really feels.
