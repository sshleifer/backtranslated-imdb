Michael Feifer writes and leads this fictional story based on the arrest of Edward Gein in Plainfield, Wisconsin. Gein was responsible for a rash of horrific murders, which in the late 1950s sent a terror of terror by his rural hometown. His evil and distorted world is thought to be caused by his dominant zealous Lutheran mother. Ed gave the nickname "The Butcher of Plainfield". He will rob corpses of new graves of women who looked like his mother, and he will have sex with them before they dress in a garage like a deer. Divorced heads with bodies hanging upside down are his personal trademark. After his arrest, many articles would be made of human skin found in his home. In this movie, a young deputy Bobby Mason (Shawn Hoffman) made the search for Gein (Kane Hodder) a personal one when his story mother (Priscilla Barnes) missed out. The acting is much better than the ridiculous liberal narrative of the documented events regarding Gein. Also in the cast: Adrienne Frantz, Timothy Oman, John Burke, Michael Berryman and Amy Lyndon.
