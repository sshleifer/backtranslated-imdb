Irwin Allen, past master of movie bell, pulled all the stops in VOYAGE to the bottom of the sea. A very elderly Walter Pidgeon, who was actually dead when he played this role, is the commander of an atomic submarine that should be the size of the Empire State Building. Each room is huge and some don't even look like ceilings. You can bowl a formal ball simultaneously in some of these rooms. The sub, the Seaview, is running on his girlfriend when hell breaks loose: the Van Allen Belt gets fire and the Seaview has to start a missile in the belt in a certain time or the world will warm up in global warming ! Along the ride, a lot of really horrible character factors, many of which are borrowed from television. It makes them TV hack-tors. The worst is probably that poor man's Stella Stevens, Barbara Eden, as a secretary in tar clothing, sports high heels and acting as she appears in a beach party. Perhaps this is because Frankie Avalon is also together for the ride. A bad old Joan Fontaine, almost unrecognizable here, plays a visiting doctor with a great bad secret, but in the truth that cares? VOYAGE is a very bad movie made for small children, but which child will sit still for endless shots of a miniature Seaview model moving from right to left across the screen, which of course is a studio song ? There is not one scene where we believe these people are actually aboard a sub. When the Seaview shakes, the actors flash themselves, sometimes in opposite directions. Just like the good old STAR TREK TV series, when the bridge shakes. If I remember correctly, not one fish or sea creature was seen - except for an octopus that nods briefly on the sub, 20 000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA. The octopus, if it really was, was probably about a foot long and it shows. Worse, when people are standing at the Seaview's glass nose, the ocean they are supposed to watch is, of course, a close-up that is unseen air hose spraying bubbles, probably filmed in a fish tank. You've never seen bigger bubbles in your life. You would think these bubbles alone would destroy the damn sub. Unfortunately, a bad parent Peter Lorre is also for the ride. By the end, when the missile enters the flaming belt, Lorre Piggie is congratulated, while everyone is still waiting for their clues to shake hands and embrace each other. A one scene if I ever saw one. What a stinker. It's not even good for a laugh. Hold on with SILENT RUNNING.
