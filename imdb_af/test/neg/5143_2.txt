The movie plot seems to be built of a dream of disagreement. There is not enough realism to keep the viewer interested. The Vermont Farm scene was a failed opportunity to show how farming was built and farm families who would have been interesting and entertaining. There was little or no research on the whiskey booting trade of the period. The Canadian Costumes look like something from the French Revolution, totally unbelievable. The fiddle was good and of the time, but Chris's movements were apparently incredible. The owl's appearance was a never-secret layout and the train disappeared into the air. I couldn't understand how a live trout had frozen in the ice and why two men in the desert would leave the trout without food, a good source of food.
