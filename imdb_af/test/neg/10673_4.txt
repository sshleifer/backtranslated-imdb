Frank Tashlin's 'censored' is a so-called Private Snafu card aimed at learning the importance of censorship to stop military secrets from leaking. Snafu tries to get his girlfriend to station in the Southern Pacific, but the Censor does every effort he makes to send the letter. These early scenes are the best, with the invisible censorship picking the letter from the air with long mechanical arms, nets and even a specially designed eagle! The second half of the cartoon in which Snafu manages to send the letter using Technical Fairy, First Class (which actually teaches him a lesson) is less funny and climax with a disappointing only dream final. The main interest in this part of the cartoon is the appearance of Snafu's extremely sly dressed girl who is even seen naked, though with strategically placed limbs at all times! In the military field, the Snafu shorts were often characterized by an increased folly, but these jumped-up plays are by far the most erotic I have ever seen in one of these shorts. In spite of this, I prefer the Snafu shorts that go a little more for the jugular, usually because of the death of the main character. For good examples of this, Tashlin's "The Goldbrick" or Chuck Jones's "Spies" are looking for. 'Censored' is fairly poor in comparison.
