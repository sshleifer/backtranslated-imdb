But like the two-generation Disney movie, this movie also fails in the department of accuracy. But at least Disney used a Skye Terrier. <br /> <br /> Is the true story happening to film producers? I do not think so. There is enough documentation to accurately portray their true story instead of the fictitious accounts we had to suffer. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, a movie Bobby's owner, John Gray, will portray correctly as the Edinburgh policeman he was, and correctly portray Bobby's license that Lord Provost paid for him. When that happens, I'll be at the theaters.
