After the success of Star Wars, there was a boost in interest in Sci-Fi movies. It was one of those cheap attempts to pay quickly. <br /> <br /> A group of survivors of a spaceship land on a planet inhabited by stop dinosaurs, where half of them are systematically murdered (people not the dinosaurs). Porn Film Acting. Inexpensive special effects, even for the time being, although it seems like a lot of effort has been put into them. <br /> <br /> Costumes were purely 1970s, just like hairstyles. Ahh, the 70's. I expected a disco to break out at any moment. <br /> <br /> Nothing to really recommend in this movie.
