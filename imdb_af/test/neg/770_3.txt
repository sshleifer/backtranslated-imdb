It wasn't a very good movie, the play almost stank and the effect was bad most of the time. But there were some funny moments, but most of them were not meant to be funny. The most hilarious part of the movie for me was the part where a small child falls into the wheelchair (it's not the funny part. What is the kind of person you think I am). In any case, the child falls out and starts screaming for his big brother. the brother came running and the way the kid ran was so funny that he stumbled all over and really about the acting I had to rinse it several times so that I could laugh even more. so if you are looking for something to rent, but just can't seem to look, look at this one and look for the running part.
