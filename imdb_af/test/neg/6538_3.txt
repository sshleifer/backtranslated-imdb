I saw it at the independent theater of my city - no surprise, because no mainstream theater wants its fingerprints on this train wreck. <br /> <br /> The camera work is very distracting. The constant shift, refocusing and zooming can cause a sensitive person to have motion sickness. It looks more like a film student's project as a serious film. <br /> <br /> Although well behaved, the characters are unattractive. Josh is ominous and always tries to manipulate situations and people to his advantage. Without any context for Emily and Josh's relationship, she comes down as a shiny, unsafe girl who is desperate to marry. Rhett is an emotional baby, unable to understand the complexities of human interaction. Without any redeeming qualities, I didn't care what happened to any of them. <br /> <br /> It was clear that some people like this movie, because the couple sitting behind me laughed hysterically. Of course they can just enjoy it. I could barely accuse them.
