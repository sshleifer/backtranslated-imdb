After two terrorist attacks in Europe, one in London and the other in Amsterdam, the main suspect is the Al-Saleem leader (Alon Aboutboul). Middle East CIA agent Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) is appointed by his superiors at Langley Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) to oversee a "safe home" in Amman and call the head of security in Jordan, Hani Salaam (Mark Strong). Roger doesn't reveal the entire operation to Hani, and it fails because of Ed's intervention. Meanwhile, Roger has feelings for the local nurse Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani) and comes close to her family. If Roger made another scheme to catch Al-Saleem by using the innocent architect Omar Sadiki (Ali Suliman) to lure Al-Saleem, he would not only harm Sadiki's safety but also Aisha's kidnapped. After performing Sadiki, Roger tries to negotiate the release of Aisha with the terrorists and proposes to save himself to save the nurse. <br /> <br /> "Body of Lies" is a disappointing pirate tour of Europe and the Middle East. despite the names of Ridley Scott, Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe. The IMDb user rating indicates that there are many viewers who, like this kind of fast-paced movie espionage, use high technology, satellites, and all sorts of disrespect for the sovereignty of other nations in the name of oil that doesn't give time to think, but this is not my case. It's boring and ridiculous to see the fat Russell Crowe with a cell phone like a relative while his partner is in a dangerous operation. The rich character performed by Leonardo DiCaprio has been poorly developed and I think this great actor is due to his biotype as an operative agent in the Middle East. But the film never explains its relations with the Middle East. The salvation of Roger Ferris alive is also very stupid and maize. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Rede de Mentiras" ("Lies Network")
