Definitely the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I can't find anything positive about this movie (if this production is even worthy of the word). <br /> <br /> This production is not even the standard of a low budget porn movie! <br /> <br /> My question is simple: why did someone look at the script and think, "Hey, I'm going to make it a movie?" <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie I didn't even hope that "Nicole" would make it. She was really annoying! <br /> <br /> For your sake, don't see this movie ... unless you want to waste 85 minutes of your life ...
