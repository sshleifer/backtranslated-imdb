This movie is about a group of people infected by a powerful human-made virus. They are pursued by government men in the desert. <br /> <br /> The assumption of the movie is very interesting, but is hampered by the fact that the delivery is extremely boring. In no way does the movie enter any level with the viewer. Admittedly, the minimal budget is a problem, but is not the reason for the film's failure. Much more to blame is the very po-faced delivery. There is a lot of narration, but unfortunately the narrator has an annoying dramatic voice. Very few seem to these people and before the end you will root for the government. The sooner they kill the protagonists, the sooner the movie will end. A much better title for this movie would have been Four People Run About In The Desert With Some Stock Footage Of A Helicopter. Overall, very boring.
