It's a bad movie. There is no denial of it as much as I want. Tommy Lee Jones is about as good as possible with the script they gave him, and he had some decent action sequences that were really out of place because of their acceptable quality. <br /> <br /> Somewhere along the line someone thought that all the shortcomings of the script could be counteracted if they handled every workhorse actor in the business. Unfortunately, even very talented actors such as Goodman, Beatty, Sarsgaard, Gammon, Steenburgen, MacDonald, Pruitt Taylor Vince, and so we don't Jones himself can't forget, the wood dialogue can't be fixed, and the progression that has gone nowhere is on the point. <br /> <br /> In fact, at one point, I looked up, sure the movie for the past 2 hours just to find that I was 51 minutes in it. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most painful point of the movie was the subplot of ghost-confederate soldiers who seem to have little or no help. Unlike slightly detracting from the confusing business at the end of the picture. * If you have not seen this movie, ignore this previous statement that looks mighty and knows it is not, you will not understand it better after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this movie might be that it's actually a sequel to the movie "Heaven's Prisoners" that Alec Baldwin wore in the same role by Tommy Lee Jones in this movie. I may have to look now, first to see if it is as bad as the Electric Mist, and the second because I can't seem (no matter how hard I try) breaks my husband in love with Alec Baldwin.
