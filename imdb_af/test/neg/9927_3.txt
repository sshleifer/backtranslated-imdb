Grace the movie, actually starts as a somewhat decent movie, and ellen barkin gives a strong performance. But if you've read the book and actually got the characters and cares who did it, the movie doesn't compare it. It is always difficult to snatch a book on film and unfortunately this one ends ...... 3 out of 10
