It's more than just an adaptation of Bond: it's a simple finishing touch! With mediocre character sets that Ian Fleming would not have approved, this movie is going to be the worst 007 movie. An older (even haggard) Connery is trying to relive his past 12 years later. The result is a humorous, tough version of the classic hero. Give me Roger Moore any day!
