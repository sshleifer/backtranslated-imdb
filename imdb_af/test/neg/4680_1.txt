I recently became a big fan of Patton Oswalt. I think he is the nicest original comedian to come together in the ages. He is refreshing and fearless in his routines, which spans the scope of subjects how much Bush sucks to the sloppy benefits of 1970's Robert Evans. I am a longtime fan of Maria Bamford and her wide-eyed innocent / schizophrenic routine. Every time she switches her naturally high-pitched voice to someone who is cut and beaten, I can't help but giggle. I love Brian Posehn long before I even knew he was on "Just Shoot Me," and there's something so funny about his aging nerd persona. All three of these talented, unique comedy titles "The Comedians of Comedy", a Netflix documentary on their American tour. They really earn stars, and this tour has given them the recognition they deserve so richly. I thought, no, I knew I wanted to keep this movie ... <br /> <br /> But I went wrong. Instead of the three comics each getting their own routine segments, the comedians of the comedy are captured by bad and dim documentary scenes that have no humor, no insight, nothing of real interest. I think there are a total of 30 minutes of intermittent rise up routine in the 109 minute movie. What a rip-off! Come on, is anyone really interested in seeing our stars in their RV? Where's the humor to see Posehn in an arcade and a comic book shop? Does anyone find random dinner scenes especially funny? If this movie could not show our comics what they can do well, at least make it how life is on the road. It's not even about it. Worst of all, the comics never seem to have fun. Oswalt admits how bored he is doing a radio interview, Posehn suddenly admits how much he struggles to give a tour of his home, and Bamford improvises every time the camera is shown to her and her humor is just sporadic. <br /> <br /> Sheesh, these guys deserve a chance to show the world their unconventional, incredibly crafted humor that is a refreshing change from the mindless entertainment of mainframes like Dane Cook. Instead, we have to put on the road in a substandard drill of a movie whose quality can easily be surpassed by any student video through their everyday, everyday routines. If you can find any of Oswalt's, Posehn's, or Bamford's performances on DVD, do it. Their talent should be a joy to see, not a task as it is here.
