Sideshow is a good example of a basically interesting idea that went very, very wrong. As far as horror movies are concerned, and especially with the influx of teenage movies at the moment, a movie based on a lot of teenagers attending a mysterious freak show is something you can enjoy a lot. <br /> <br /> However, the author decided to make a very straightforward, very boring, very simple story about five teens who became part of the show when the furious midget Abbot Graves turned them into freaks using " a pathetic machine that entertaines them in animals. <br /> <br /> The five teens are picked up one by one until the last man remains, his 'punishment' is that he can't join his friends and therefore be 'alone'. What a rubbish! <br /> <br /> The 'actors' are really poor, this movie has no comedy (and it could have been so funny!), no gore (and it could have been so greedy!), no action and no horror (and it could have been so much from both!) <br /> <br /> The director failed in his duty to even try to make it a little interesting to watch. Of course, his experience in soft core has no creativity he has ever had, as all the shots are the same, with very few modifications and little movement. The quality is generally poor. <br /> <br /> I am not normally nudged in movies, but believe the only highlight in this movie was a few breasts.
