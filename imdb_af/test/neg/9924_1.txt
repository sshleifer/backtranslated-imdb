It contains some spoiler information, but the movie is definitely not worth watching. <br /> <br /> Why Ellen Barkin and Peta Wilson agreed to be part of this debacle by writer-director Damian Harris is beyond me. The story is full of unrealistic police investigation techniques, which include going to a party with a suspect and leaving the suspect to your home and becoming intimate. The story also has a male psychiatrist who has nothing but female clients - and he sleeps with them all. <br /> <br /> Even more so is the idea that female victims are a terrible S / M crime belonging to a large but secret group of S / M lesbian drivers. <br /> <br /> Full bad editing and continuity errors, the movie is sterile in all its quirky places - including Barkin's detective salary apartment. And the lame dialogue is fit to sleep one. <br /> <br /> Damian is a bad writer and a bad director. He tried and failed to sometimes create a strange atmosphere. Furthermore, he couldn't get Ellen Barkin to give 110%. I firmly believe she realized the film was pathetic and tried to give up. <br /> <br /> Standouts were Peta Wilson, wasting time to study with a Dominatrix for the part. The highly underrated character actor, Marshall Bell, has given his absolute best ever. <br /> <br /> And since Damian couldn't deliver at any level, it was hard to feel emotion for any of the characters. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, he doesn't know much about the real world of BDSM and prefers to create the typical "Hollywood Reality" of beautiful men and women who are tolerant and dangerous. <br /> <br /> Save your time, money and braincells and succeed this one.
