I just wish there was a grade lower than F to give it! I counted it a 1 in the vote. I don't even dig it as an ordinary movie, but as a T&A movie, and it's the worst, ugliest, crappiest and most horrible movie I've ever seen. music is all terrible, not to mention, there is not even a nudity for the T&A connisuer.it about a male cheerleader. The viewer is made to do through many painful scenes of him, and that is a pity. this is the worst bad 80's teen cinema.
