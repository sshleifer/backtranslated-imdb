I hired this movie because I like watching things with Lauren Graham in them. Well, she was the highlight. Everyone else was completely separated from the picture. You looked around at those watching the movie while you were going, what? However, she gave clarity because she was the only normal character in the picture, who didn't really say much to the film. Personally, it was too far out for me. However, I am glad I rented, despite the fact that I would never have owned it. I still feel that Lauren Graham was a strong actress and even thought she wasn't the main character. She seemed to be stealing the movie. My husband and I were happier and more caring about her character, ending with Josh's character as we were about the two main characters.
