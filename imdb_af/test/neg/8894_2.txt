Any fan of the Russian theater will have great difficulty in the sub-par performances performed by Mashkov and Bodrov Jr. promulgated. Perhaps it is totally confused by Bodrov Sr. its hacked and confusing writing, accompanied by uncharacteristically poor direction. Most characters wander through the movie as if they have no idea who they are or what they are doing. It's also sad to see that Jennifer Jason Leigh's acting skills have not progressed since the fast times at RIDGEMONT HIGH, and her screen exposure is graciously limited. This is a terrible mafia movie; so much so that the GODFATHER III looks like a winner in the genre. To see the most important Russians at their best, look at Bodrov Sr. 's work on PRONSER OF THE MOUNTAINS (which also includes Jr.), Mashkov's turn in VOR (THE ANIMAL), and Bodrov Jr's new criminal in BRAT.
