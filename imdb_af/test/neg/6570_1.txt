When I first saw it 9 years ago when I was 9, I thought it had hit. I'm now 18 and I still think it stinks. I mean geez no special effects or anything, it was boring and kinda anti-climate. My cousin once watched and George Takai (Sulu) talked about how much better it was, but they kept on budget. It would have been a great episode, but it was a terrible movie.
