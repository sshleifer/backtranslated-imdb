Read the book I felt again in Castle Rock (Essential Things are the final part of the Rock Trilogy), and the plot was a variation on the "demon coming to a small redhead town" that told Story King. The characters were all described in loving detail, which made both a good psychologist and greedy horror. The movie on the other side is terrible. Gone is the character interactions and clever plot, and replaced by a story that tries to be exciting, but misses by mile. If you haven't read the book, you can enjoy it, otherwise you avoid at all costs, like most of King's books.
