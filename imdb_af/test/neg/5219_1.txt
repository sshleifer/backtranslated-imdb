OK, Chuck Norris has shown in an entertaining movie in recent years. This is not one of them. I won't even try to get into the plot about a Bible transmission that went wrong. The "acting" of the main characters is so wood like, Pinocchio would have done a better job! The synthesizer-based soundtrack is even worse than the one in Deathstalker. While traditionally low budget spooky movies often try to capture their audience by adding many graphic violence, this one tries to catch an audience by throwing religious mambo jumbo at the spectator. The plot comes down to different versions of the Bible.
