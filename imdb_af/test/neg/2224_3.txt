Based on an Edgar Rice Burroughs novel, EARTH'S CORE offers little more than escaping and resting your brain. A Victorian scientist dr. Abner Perry (Peter Cushing) is investigating a giant excavator, which he and his American partner (Doug McClure) use to crawl their way deep into the earth to explore what secrets it may hold. They soon discover a lost world of subhuman beings who have conflict with prehistoric monsters. <br /> <br /> Cushing comes across as an absent professor about to be annoying. Instead of being a daring adventurer, he has an effect. On the other hand, McClure has conveyed enough to lower himself. Caroline Munro plays the beautiful Princess Dia who refuses to leave her world near the center of the earth. Also in the cast are: Godfrey James, Cy Grant and Michael Crane.
