This movie was disturbing, not because of the subject, but because of the way it was handled. The excessively abusive mother (Angela) didn't even make it on the cover of the video case when most of the rest of the team did. It is not fair, but is a statement in itself. I also see that her photo is missing from IMDb (perhaps her own choice) and it looks like it's her only movie ever? The language in this movie was unnecessary. Watched with my ten-year-old son because it was rated PG in Canada and the language came out of their mouths, was shameful and disgusting. Never before has Shirley Maclain appreciated as many others seem. <br /> <br /> LOVE Kathy Bates and will always. Chinese part was irritating. <br /> <br /> The little boy Alex is a great little actor. I will have to see what he has been recently.
