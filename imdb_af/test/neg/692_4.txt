* POSSIBLE SPOILERS INSIDE * <br /> <br /> I will just say what has not been said here (and I will continue for the rest of my WWF / WWE comments). <br /> <br /> If you want a Women's title match, make it interesting at least, rather than just a squash to put the current champion. I think Moolah couldn't handle an intense match, but they wanted the legend in a WrestleMania. <br /> <br /> I thought the killer bees were being wasted in WrestleManias, especially here. I became a fan in 1989, about a year after the B. Brian Blair left and Jim Brunzell became a canvas. So I didn't realize for a while that they were a top-team team, even the best contenders. <br /> <br /> But I loved seeing Bill Fralic royally. He really came here in his own, which created a crooked character in a pre-match interview and even made an elimination in the battle royal. Besides Steve McMichael and Kevin Greene, he is the only professional athlete of my generation with any respect for wrestling (someone remembers Dennis Rodman?). And what was with the Heart Foundation's ridiculous green tights?
