** Warning - this review may contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> The idea behind the character of Danny (Jet Li) is a good one. Young boy is taken by caplum and raised to act like an evil pit bull, controlling mainly whether his collar is on or off his neck. <br /> <br /> However, the author did not know how to deliver this idea into the interests of credibility. <br /> <br /> He met Danny a blind pianist, Sam (Morgan Freeman), who must be the most reliable fool you ever was, with his nit-white, endless babbling, rather unattractive stepdaughter , Victoria (Kerry Condon). I was surprised when I learned that Victoria had to be 18. She looked at me 25 or 30. <br /> <br /> There is no romance between Danny and Victoria. <br /> <br /> When Danny wakes up, wounded, what does Sam do, but takes him straight home. Danny is out for 2 days, but does this descendant take him to a hospital? Nooooo. I don't know if they even called in a doctor. <br /> <br /> Of course, now, Danny isn't a spiritually stable person, it turns out, but Sam takes him into his home, where both he and his stepdaughter could seriously harm or even be murdered by this stranger. young man. <br /> <br /> Why Morgan Freeman has taken this undisputed role in this asinine movie, I can't even guess. Certainly, Mr. Freeman is not so desperate for a salary. <br /> <br /> Then we have Bob Hoskins as Bart, the gangster who owns "Danny" - now you're talking about a boy of a gun that's hard to kill. The car in Bart is loaded with dots, which would compete with Bonnie and Clyde's downfall. We think he's dead, but no. <br /> <br /> Then we have another car accident. And again, oh, Bart escapes intact. <br /> <br /> In addition, we also have Danny to fight half a dozen fighting guys at a time, plus a scene where Danny decides he doesn't want to fight any more. I don't care how much a person does not want to fight, if it fights against the wire or you die, I think anyone will fight. <br /> <br /> As I said in the subject - this movie is about 40 miles outside the reality limit as we got to know it. It is not just a case of faith belief - it is completely out of it. <br /> <br /> Also, I never understood why Danny's mother, who apparently was a good lady, rather than the prostitute Bart claimed she was, was mixed up with Bart and his gang and shot. Perhaps it was my fault, I was right about the time the scene went - but she and Bart seem highly unlikely to ever cross roads. <br /> <br /> 4 stars out of 10 - and it's spacious.
