If you want to see someone accidentally eat another man's testicle, or watch a row of pathetically fake hard-we at a wedding or listen to a man talking about how well it feels to have sex with a girl while she comes up, then this is the movie for you. Alternative, in the neck breaking fashion, between romantic and brutal comedy, Tomcats is definitely interesting. The beautiful Jaime Pressly plays Horatio Sanz's wife (tell me one more) that is found in many covert situations with other women, but there is surprisingly no nudity. Jake Busey is thoroughly rebellious as a dog dog you don't want as your friend. Shannon Elizabeth and Jerry O'Connell are both good and make a convincing couple, but the film is too busy trying to be disgusted.
