It's a very well-known Ninja movie, but it's not a nice movie. If you want to see some ninjas and some figures, you want to know a few things about Ninjas, see this movie. This movie is just for ninja fans and who wants to make nostalgia. <br /> <br /> The first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes of the movie are best. You can only see and fight Ninja figures in these scenes. Between these is below average, almost bad as a movie. Acting is bad. Sho (black ninja) is the best actor in this movie. Frank Nero is a good actor and charismatic, but he can't fight well. Scenario is also not good. It's so simple. Franko Nero comes close to his best, old friend of army and war. He also protects him from mafia, but he has sex with his wife, and his friend knows it but says nothing to Nero negatively. Is it possible in life? What a friendship! <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie started a genre; Ninja movies. There is also the ninja master Sho Kasugi, but some fenders are not realistic and not fast, even with shoo. This movie is below average, even though it's a classic.
