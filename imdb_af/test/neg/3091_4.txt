What a pity. What a terrible shame. The table was set, the candles were lit, the guests arrived ... and then ... <br /> <br /> ... nothing really. Just pretentious bravery. It could have been good, and maybe not good, but it could have been very good. All the elements were there, but at the end of the day the bottle was empty: NO LIGHTING! How it happened, is a mystery with everything that is at the disposal of the director ... <br /> <br /> ... the story was pretty brave, though it certainly needs a lot of work with possibly several rounding reviews to solve the story and the characters a lot (the only thing that was consistent and constant and unnecessarily tight was the cinematography, but I will get it). But the direction was mean, the acting was just like: _a-CTin-G_ with a heavy side of cheese and lots of ham, and then cinematography ... <br /> <br /> ... it was something to to see! But only if you never use a professional movie camera in the cinema school's "Cinematography 101". It was clear that in a part of the lecture's introduction, the student fell asleep and only heard "... use a professional movie camera ...", then blissfully back to la la land when the sentence was finalized . <br /> <br /> What can I say; amateur and pretentious to the last! I can only see this movie intended to appeal as a Chick Flick, because it is supposed to be sad, but then fall flat and just become "sad" (as an excuse for a movie) ... so even those 'chicks' will not be deceived by this trickle game! <br /> <br /> PS. I felt bad for Miss Diaz. She is much better at her craft than this film allows her to be, even though she was totally wrong. Actually, I feel sorry for everyone in this movie except the director and (you guess) the movie maker! I say '1 to the wall for them when the revolution comes!' OK, it's not really a movie, but maybe a good "tar and feather coming out of town" might be more satisfying or at least much more entertaining! <br /> <br /> TTFN :-(
