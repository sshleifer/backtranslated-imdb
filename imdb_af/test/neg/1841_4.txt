Don't agree with people who say it's a horrible horror movie with good acting and camera work. I would say it is a good horror movie that works through shockingly improperly acting and poor camera work. See 'Ju-on: The Wrew instead to waste your time with this garbage. The main idea behind the film is rather an original, taking into account the abundance of killer pop-based terrifying festivals over the years; Unfortunately, the story is dealt with all the subtleties of the latest Michael Bay actor, with a shoot of characters that are unlikely to be played and played with precision-perfect fears by actors suspected of being screened by Korean soap operas. It is not scary and only succeeds in dampening your expectations of the next Korean horror movie to come-a-calling. Oh good.
