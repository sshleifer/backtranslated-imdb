It was a very good performance. I enjoyed the real-time and flashback construction and saw the old Diggers meeting again and remember the horrors of their captivity in Changi POW Camp. The biggest problem with the way the show was written is that the scenes of life in Changi are more like a holiday camp than where it should have been. I'm old enough to remember that men's movies are being freed from Changi and other Japanese POW camps. No actor can lose enough weight to have an agreement with the state of those men. They made the Jews of Belsen look like sumo wrestlers. I've met several Changi veterans over the past few years. Many will never drive into a Japanese car, let alone own one. The physical and spiritual torture that the people endured was too terrible to even speak. What percentage survives? John Doyle might write a comedy for Roy and HG (I hate it too), but it's a serious sugar cover of history that should never be tolerated. I am happy for satirists to write "The Life of Brian" and to enjoy the Crucifixion, as it is of course comedy, even though some think it is bad. "Changi" is written as a portrayal of an actual event and can be regarded as a true record by younger people. Great performances by a fine cast cannot solve this lightweight script.
