First, Mexican Werewolf in Texas's title is misleading, as many others pointed out. It's actually about El Chupacabra, which is a similar being to a werewolf, but not the same. <br /> <br /> The production and editing is just sucking. When it was over, I would probably not be able to give a very accurate description of exactly what the Chupacabra looked like, because when it was in a scene (despite one or two exceptions), the camera was all shaky and you could only see the monster's face clearly. The special effects were laughable, but it is expected of a low budget horror movie. <br /> <br /> Along with the terrible production comes the bad actors. Now give some reasonably credible performances (Erika Fay and Martine Hughes), but then there were the bad actors (everyone else), who apparently had no emotions when people died. Then there is the absolutely terrible actor (Sara Erikson), who gives one of the 2 worst shows I have ever seen in a movie. I mean my god, she was indescribably bad. <br /> <br /> The plot was very simple. Actually, a Chupacabra is in a small Texan village that kills locals and a group of teenagers try to stop it. Although the plot was so simple, a few plot holes managed to leak through. <br /> <br /> Anyways, horrible movie. However, if you are looking for a movie to enjoy with your friends one night, this will be a good thing. My friends and I had a good time watching it. Probably the 2nd worst movie I've ever seen, 1/10. Awful.
