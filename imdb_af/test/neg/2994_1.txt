I can't think of anything, I repeat, something positive about this "Movie"! The entire 1 hour 45 minute movie can be filmed in a short 5-minute movie! In most scenes there is absolutely nothing going on and it just seems that the camera has just been left on the recording to increase the time of the movie! All you see is someone in the background walking around or watching television with no specific topic or even talking what ever! I just felt I knew nothing for 105 minutes of my family and my friends' weekend! If a movie is bad or the scenario isn't good, it's a whole different story. At least this makes you discuss something, but about DISTANT, I just have to call it a "Movie" because it was moving pictures taken by a camera. . <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, imagine a 105 minute movie based on two and three lines! What will you end up with? 5% of the content and 95% of the fillers! That's exactly how "Distant" was at least for us! Actors played a wonderful working role that had nothing special in them, they barely spoke or showed any special emotions! I picked up this movie in the comedy section of a store that relies on what I read on the back of his cover. I still wonder what was funny about it other than our face after watching the movie.
