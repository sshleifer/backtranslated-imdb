Gritty drama? Emotionally powerful? Blah! The BBC has lost a lot of time to master HBO's productions such as The Wire, Sopranos and Carnivale. Well, so the budget can be much smaller, but 'The Street' was poorly acted last night, predictable, unrealistic, stereotypical, insensitive and a huge waste of fat. TV (British TV) is not as good as it was and is still falling behind American productions. <br /> <br /> There was no sense of brutal violence from the 'local gangster'. There was no indication that this man was "bad" enough to defeat a man he had respected for so long. There was no remorse when he did this and it should not be the kind of character that would diminish when Bob Hoskins calls his son a pansy, in a show of 'bravery'. <br /> <br /> I wish I was more eloquent to express my contempt for this show, but I'm not and although I can't prove my point well enough, believe me when I say it's filth, shock TV , which offers no real inner perspective on life. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars.
