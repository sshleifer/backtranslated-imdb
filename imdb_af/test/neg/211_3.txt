After watching it for 15 minutes, I knew how it would end. This is a clich√© movie with a silly setup. I'm a big fan of thief movies, but this one doesn't deliver anything new or special. It's about an insider who's gone bad because "hot head bad guy" shoots a bit, and of course, "do good-bad guy" goes on a moral journey. The reason it's stupid and not credible. If you have already gone so far to kill a bum, just kill the one man standing between you and 43 million. They have 45 minutes to stamp the money and set up a robbery. No one would hesitate to contact Mr. Don't shoot well. In this case he is a guy who knows them for a few days. to progress quickly from the middle, but I took it out and regretted it
