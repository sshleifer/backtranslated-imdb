From the fertile imagination that you brought to the irresistible HERCULES (1983), it comes even more preoccupied (read nice) prosecution: to the right of the bat we still get a cumbersome proletariat from the beginning of time which even commits to the same events completely contradictory than drafted in the first film! A condensed set of highlights of the same will soon be followed by a SUPERMAN-like scrolling credits sequence. Narrative way, here are four rebellious gods stealing Zeus' seven (but poorly animated) thunderbolts? a crime that cares for the moon on a collision course with Planet Earth for one thing! Faster than you can say "nepotism", does Zeus (once again a kind-hearted bearded man by relatively young Claudio Cassinelli) send his champion? Who really took his place among the elite, thanks to one supposedly almighty task performed in the first film? <br /> <br /> No sooner has Hercules (Lou Ferrigno as if you didn't know) touched the earthly surface that he came in contact with two attractive ladies. (Milly Carlucci and Sonia Viviani) in need of emergency The former (who would become an Italian TV personality) seems to have the ability to talk to the small people (!) ?? what looks like the little sisters of GODZILLA USA. MOTHRA (1964) !! Likewise, they can destroy as much as possible of the first film of the first film as it is humanly possible. The divine quartet of the villains relives good o 'King Minos (William Berger) again from his skeletal sleep and once again puts him against his eternal enemy. Typically, Hercules is made to meet a number of potentially deadly enemies, including a Gorgon? a terribly underproductive series that led to a safe plagiarism pack, the filmmakers behind the much better CLASH OF THE TITANS (1981) have bothered to watch this movie (completed with the same "reflection in a shield" emergence and preceded by the lean that lets the audience live into his tactics before they perform as if we show how smart he is! And just to make it clear that he wears his influences on his sleeve, Cozzi has announced Hercules and Minos in a cosmic version of King Kong versus Godzilla for one of their battles and later King Kong with a big snake, a encounter straight out of the classic 1933 original. I swear: it is the whole truth and nothing but the truth! <br /> <br /> As in the first movie, the cast is full of old trusted ones such as former Berger, Cassinelli and Venantino Venantini (as wizard with a really bad day of her) coming stars? not only Carlucci, but also Maria Rosaria Omaggio (as a younger Hera!), Serena Grandi, Pamela Prati and, again, Eva Robbins (whose costume in her first movie is easy to dress up here); For what it is worth, Pino Donaggio's score for this one is being recycled from musical clues appearing in his soundtrack to the previous movie. If you have determined this review so far, you must now realize that it is one of those movies that is so incredibly bad that a reviewer is forced to choose which course to take: either release it or spend it in one unobstructed sense " An undeserved amount of time analyzing its errors. I'm sure I left out some of his indifference, but I wouldn't forgive myself if I didn't mention the only biggest, hard-hitting example in the whole movie, almost dropping me off my chair <br /> <br /> At that stage, it is possible that one could exceed the goods of the rebellious god's army in the form of a giant marble quartet. wonder why I gave this film (and its predecessor) a rating instead of a (not totally unjustified) BOMB; In the past, have I had several protracted online discussions about whether the star rating of any particular film should reflect the overall artistic quality or its entertaining entertainment value? but these are two instances where I consider it necessary to be aware by influencing the latter in my final assessment. I don't know: maybe it's because I'm currently in a "sword-and-sandal" state (with about 10 more respected examples scheduled for the next few days!), But it's uncharacteristic for me to decide this. add two movies to my DVD collection, just based on the fun I had with them in this recent visit? And it alone has to count for something, no?
