Parrots? Parrots? I am longer than most of this old earth and have seen almost all of the Westerns that produced. Old West history is my passion. Comanche Moon is one of the most poorly-crafted, focused and performed stories I've ever seen. There was very little historical accuracy, but then it is clear that you are working on a scarce budget that <br /> <br /> played a clear role in this insult to intelligence. I'm glad I had this show. It was bad enough to sit down and watch the movie plus the awkward advertisements. Again there was not one actor who came anywhere near convincing. I hoped it would improve if the three days progressed. WRONG! I'm ashamed to say I wasted 4 1/2 hours of precious little time.
