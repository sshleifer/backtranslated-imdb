Undoubtedly, one of the most racially disadvantaged movies I've ever seen, with the bias being made against Hayden Panettiere, as she has to move to a difficult city center. She is constantly called "white girl" and other shoe-based shades. Firstly, would this be allowed the other way round if a black girl was the butt of all the abuse? Secondly, the stereotyping of the ethnic children of the city center is also a shame. The authors' apparent desire to show that they were "hip" has also expanded to the point that the downtown school is winning the cheerleading competition, not by talent, but by intimidating their white opponents !! These overtones to the film have expected it from the expected direction of a harmless, casual family-friendly comedy in a vehicle that has none of the participants. Hayden Panettiere has star quality but I will be surprised if any of the rest of the class ever goes much further. All in all, a charming film that was a waste of time.
