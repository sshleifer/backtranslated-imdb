I have to give this movie a 4 because of a few things. <br /> <br /> 1. What I call the "stupid victim syndrome". If you have the killer on the floor and you have his gun - please shoot him. If you are a policeman and you showed your shotgun to the killer's back - please shoot him. <br /> <br /> 2. If you are in a high stress situation and you have your finger on the trigger of a gun - your first instinct is to push. This is one of the first things they teach you during handgun training and why you don't put your finger on the trigger until you're ready to burn. Ask any hunter or infantry. If you are electrocute, your muscles should also contract so you press your finger. <br /> <br /> 3. It is really hard to keep quiet on the floor for 8 hours without 2 other people - one of them is a doctor - not noticed you are not dead. Even more if you were presumably dying of a brain tumor and were hospitalized just a few months earlier. <br /> <br /> 4. Technically, the killer killed one of his victims - the man he injected with poison that had to get the antidote. If you poison someone, it's murder. <br /> <br /> 5. What was Adam's lesson he was supposed to teach? Yes, the doctor had to be there, but what was Adam's crime? Maybe I just missed something. <br /> <br /> Unlike those things, I would have given this movie a higher grade. The plot was pretty good, and the ways the killer wanted to kill his victims were very inventive. I can even forgive the horrible action on the doctor's side - the scenes with his family were enough to make me sick. The cinematography and soundtrack were very good, but the end was cut and just didn't work for me. Thank you, I didn't pay to see it, or I asked for a refund.
