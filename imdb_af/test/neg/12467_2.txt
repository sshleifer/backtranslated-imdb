TART is the worst movie I've seen this year, including both the Affleck / J.Lo bomb GIGLI and the Rob Zombie drill HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES. I don't know if this is a fair comparison since TART was made two years earlier and is probably a budget that is half the low budget 1000 CORPSES. Regardless, all three movies suffer from the same shortcomings: horrible writing, terrible play, horrible direction. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** (although I honestly don't think there is anything to spoil) <br /> <br /> TART is about a group of wonderful private schoolchildren. Most of them live in bulk flats along New York's hyper-expensive Park Avenue, thanks to the finances of their neglected parents. The film shows the aimless life of one of the students (Kat) as she throws away her only true friend (like mercilessly a person like her) in pursuit of "good life" with the crowd. This, of course, leads to sex, drugs and music that are significantly worse than rock & roll. Everything is too dramatic in the way really bad movies are. Kat's first sexual experience leads to the fact that she is branded a tramp and eliminated by her newly acquired circle of friends; Her first encounter with drugs leads to the fact that she becomes almost a rubbish dump after her cohorts believe she is dead from an overdose. There were no heavy-handed messages there, he said sarcastically. <br /> <br /> It's mainly what the "seen it for 100 times" plot entails. Other minor, and even less interesting, plot details include one friend who steals jewelry and trinkets from all the others, a wild kid who lives on the verge (and eventually ends up in the East Hamptons), an anti-Semitic British chick ending her friendship with Kat is the moment she finds out Kat has a Jewish father, and Kat's tense relationship with her single mother trying unsuccessfully to get Kat to appreciate the privileged life she has. The thief seems to be an irreparable lowlife. The "wild child" is played as a well-rounded version of one of the Hilton sisters. The British girl disappears from the movie after the breakup. The relationship between mother and daughter is considered completely indifferent to the film's final skemaltic scene, where she and her beloved mother have a reconciliation of sorts. * Given * <br /> <br /> *** END SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> About the cast and crew .... Dominique Swain came on the scene with her role as the downfall seductress in 1997's highly viewable LOLITA and FACE / OFF. Her performances were strong enough to land her on a number of ones-to-watch lists at that time. She was 17 and I hope they will not be the best roles in her career. If she still has a few roles like the one she's in TART, it can be very good. <br /> <br /> I only saw Byou Phillips in another movie (BULLY) and I swear her performance in that one was almost identical to the one she gave here. I am not sure if she is unable to perform varied performances or if it just happened, her roles in the two were so similar. My guess is that the former is true. I feel this woman has very little talent as far as acting. Here she is the actress who was drawn to portray the whipped Hilton sister. Being such a poor show is incredible, as she grew up and remains friends with the real Hilton sisters. She essentially plays a version of herself in this film and does a painful job. <br /> <br /> As for writer / director Christina Wayne ... I know nothing about her other than TART was her first, and only film project to date. With a first attempt like this, it's no wonder her career in performance business was brief.
