and one of them is a 14-year-old girl in a swimsuit. To fans of this movie I would like to ask: would you allow your daughter to move such a resort so dressed? And would your 14-year-old handle the response she can get from men? If so, I'd like to know why, on both counts. Such a suit is a clear invitation for men. It is hypocritical to suggest that it is not. <br /> <br /> And at another point, what teenage girl would ever claim to be her father, was her lover without the excuse of serious spiritual problems? It's almost as disgusting as the swimsuit. <br /> <br /> Simply put, some things just aren't funny or appropriate, and they'll never be.
