According to Hollywood standards, this movie has been filmed and edited as Hollywood movies are and looked like a movie you will get from Hollywood production studio. That's where something near Hollywood standards ends. It was the most popular movie I've ever seen in MY life! I'm not joking. The story was so incredibly stupid and unrealistic that I couldn't keep my laughter in the movie watching the movie. I know what you're saying, "it's a horror movie that's not supposed to have a good story, it's supposed to scare you." Well, let me tell you something, the movie isn't even scary at least. It's too full of stupid bits to cancel the tension there. The acting was also terrible, along with the murderer of the murderer, who do you constantly see through flashbacks locked in a cage. Throughout the movie I still got a sense. I looked at something that was invented, written, produced and directed by a high school looking too much pornography. Please, don't see this movie, spend $ 8.50 on other things, like a snow cone, which would be much more valuable.
