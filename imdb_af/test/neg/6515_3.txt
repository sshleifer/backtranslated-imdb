My Age: 13 <br /> <br /> James Cole, played by Steven Seagal, is sent to help detective Jim Campbell, played by Keenen Ivory Wayans, to solve a series of killings in which the victims are crucified. Since Cole arrived on the spot, he noticed that the murders had changed a bit and thought there was another killer. It becomes personal when his former wife is murdered, and Campbell finds his fingerprints on the body. Campbell investigates the mysterious Cole and finds out about a very shady past. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of Steven Seagal. I enjoy action movies, but he's the worst actor I've ever seen. This movie is not much fun to watch, incredibly stupid, and of course, Steven Seagal's performance is absolutely terrible. However, Keenen Ivory Wayans is not bad. The only redeeming thing in this movie is the occasional good action scene, although most are due to bad judgment reasons. The plot in this movie is absolutely gibberish. I didn't mind at all. The whole "glitter man "'s past of Seagal's character was stupid, all the Mafia fights and battles in the restaurant were almost no reason. Give this movie a miss. <br /> <br /> Australian Classification: MA 15+: High Level Violence <br /> <br /> Rating: 35 out of 100 (Very Generous)
