I saw this movie last night and came specifically online to see if others thought it was as horrible as me. <br /> <br /> Of course, some people see a lot in this movie I didn't do, so if you are one of those people, good - good luck to you. But I'm a patient. I have enjoyed many long films before. But it was a torture exercise for me. <br /> <br /> I honestly felt it was one of those little movies and that it was more about style than dust - but also the style made me feel like tearing my hair out. Almost anything that is interesting in the course of the film happens OVER-SCREEN. It's like a deliberate attempt to make a movie out of the box - the bits that would usually be reserved for portions of a shattered DVD, if shown to the public. <br /> <br /> You're not finally getting something about the main character, Francois. I had no sympathy for any of the characters in this movie, except perhaps the violin and his goat and the old man who believes that octopuses live up to 300, because they are really smart. Seriously, I was excited when it cut to a shot of Francois who had a gun on his head. I was so scared when his inevitable suicide was even gut-wrenchingly boring. <br /> <br /> Oh, and where was the editor? Of smoke opium, too? I swear, I almost screamed every time I did a lost shot of absolutely nothing, except maybe someone moving back and forth, and finally there would be a very quick cut to the next scene, and that will be a year later. , and we've all missed the interest that has happened in the meantime, and everybody still wore the same bloody dress. !!!!!! <br /> <br /> So, when you're done, if you like it - wonderful. But this review is intended as an antidote to fawning. "You will love this movie if you love movies" I saw here and elsewhere. (See? I hated the movie and included another crap about the content!)
