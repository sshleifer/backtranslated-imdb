I looked at my friend a few years ago. He picked it up as a wonderful funny movie that is one of the best comedies ever. I think he was cracking or something. I recently learned that this movie was not released in the theaters. I can understand why perfect. <br /> <br /> The basic plot involves a group of guys who deceive almost all their school duties to get good grades. This is the biggest problem this movie is that the morals are all bad. There are other teenage comedy films where students do bad things, but these are mostly things that don't happen at school. So I think the concept of a whole movie that basically cheats children at stake is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> I didn't like the characters in this movie either. The main character is a totally smother arrogant idiot who is not a good protagonist. Actually, I'm not sure if you can say there is a protagonist because they are all wrong at school. The other supporting characters were not funny at all and basically the role-playing in this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie has a bad message and even worse acting and characters. There are other teenage movies that are much better than this movie. So you don't have to see this one and it's a good thing because I don't recommend this movie at all.
