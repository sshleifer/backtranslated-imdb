This documentary is trying comedy, but never quite comes to me. Camp? Ehn, maybe. The more appropriate word that everyone will agree - and it's hard to avoid in any review - is kitsch. This drank the kitsch. It was as if the filmmakers were worried that their viewers would take the movie too seriously, and so they bent over to put kitsch and say, "We're joking here! Look?" <br /> <br /> In short, I felt it was too hard. For example, the dolls that imported every scene were (for me) annoying when I was sure they would be entertaining or at least (ahem) kitsch-ey. <br /> <br /> Don't, however, avoid this movie based on my complaints. Just be ready to enjoy kitsch, rather than giving it to you unprepared. If you are interested in a sad rate, you can do far, much worse. At least, the facts surrounding the rise and fall of the Bakers make it interesting and worthwhile. In the best case, gaggles of similar kitsch lovers will be sown in the film about the choice of pieces.
