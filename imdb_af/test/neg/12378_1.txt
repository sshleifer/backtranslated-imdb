This is a horrible movie !! Some people told me it wasn't that bad, but I definitely don't agree! The monster is incredibly cheap (and funny), but it is something we all know I think. In addition, the dialogues are terrible and the writing is just awful. <br /> <br /> As bad as it is, this movie is the quality of entertainment. Not always for the good reasons, but it's a good "so bad that it's fun". <br /> <br /> By the way, there is no such thing as "La Castagne". According to a secondary character in the film Pierre (described in the film as a French Canadian), there is a legend among the French Canadians about a giant bird known as "La Castagne". As a French Canadian myself, I can assure you that I've never heard of such a legend. It certainly made me laugh ... :))
