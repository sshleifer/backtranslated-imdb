Before I took a job as a judge, I never went to movies like that, and so apparently I remain unaware that the soul of the Hollywood movie is a deeply hatred spirit that thrives on its knees on the place silver screen. everyone to either empathize with or revile. Or is it just a particularly bad year? An ugly trend? <br /> <br /> Here we have another seemingly sweet, innocent, beautiful woman who has turned deadly weapon. The kind we warn under every bunch of eyes and nesting instincts is a wild oasis that ensures that everyone's lives make a living hell within 50 miles. <br /> <br /> This month's example is Jewel Valentine's (Liv Tyler), whose simple dreams have her own home, a backyard fountain and a mondo entertainment system. Unfortunately, Randy (Matt Dillon, in his first 3-year film), the thin-bull barman she's coming to rob at McCool's one night to rob is less materially oriented. The kind of guy who drinks beer from a toilet bowl prefers to save in his dead mother's home with some creativity, except his snowdrop collection. <br /> <br /> In that same lower bar, the devil knocked in the red dress also beat Randy's cousin, Carl (the very amusing Paul Reiser), an ego lawyer the size of St. Louis. When things go within an hour south, the widow detective enters with a heart of gold (John Goodman). The result? Three men sustain large, bad crushes on the leopard-clad offspring of Steven Tyler and Bebe Buell crushes who do what common sense would normally contraindicate. Like getting involved in the first place. <br /> <br /> Multiple points of view and flashback patch together with the newspaper about how easy it is to become a victim of your libido, especially if you are male. Since each of these men holds his perspective on a confidant, his desire to own The Jewel has the "truth" of the situation colors. About 70 minutes later, things come together in a reasonably amusing way. But it is fun from the same source that tells you that the stuff on the popcorn actually tastes like butter. <br /> <br /> MCCOOL'S is the first film by Norwegian commercial and music video director Harald Zwart, and his pedigree is clear. during some of the fantasy segments, including one over a car wash, soap and a snake that you probably extrapolate. It is also the debut project of the manufacturing company owned by Michael Douglas. He found his niche as a played sled ball in a bingo salon. <br /> <br /> Dillon and Tyler will probably not win gold images for this one. Given the one-dimensionality of their exaggerated film noir-type characters, you can't really make them guilty. Several small roles carry unexpected guests. Reba McEntire plays Carl's psychiatrist, and Andrew Dice Clay doubles as both the Hoodlum Utah and his equally scarce brother. (Lastly, an outlet for all the aggression.) <br /> <br /> This movie speaks unfinished volumes about the dynamics between men and women - or men and their moms. But in the end you will probably find more lasting psychological truths in a Bugs Bunny episode. I'd say it's better, funny, more sophisticated than other recent gems like TOMCATS, but should we really choose what to see based on what's lowest on the misogynism scale?
