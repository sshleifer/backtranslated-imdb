The spoof genre, which has had creativity and humor for quite some time, is again spat out by hacks with no talent. No point, no fun, no originality; just a few cheap money for the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> It requires more than a few recent movies and refers to double-meaning characters to be satire; to make people laugh. Any bunch can pick up a feeder, and some bad-mates in cheap costumes imitate someone. Since the targeted genre this time is inspiring sports movies, there are a few lame references that are thrown out of those types of movies: the jokes are so weak that the characters actually have to emphasize the references in various ways to leave you hysterical laugh. It doesn't work. <br /> <br /> It's not comedy. But the same old exhausted sophomoric "jokes" ripped off from a middle school washroom (even more gently done than usual) are all here. If that is not enough, there is a running "gag" of a bus that someone overflows. So funny, right? Also, a pathetic poor scene, does more product placement than Michael Bay; again with the same unsuitable results. A musical bit fatter. Sorry Carl Weathers, once Apollo Creed in the Rocky series, now stuck with roles in the swarm like this. <br /> <br /> Lousy beyond words. Looking at a snail, the marathon will be less boring than watching this movie. Probably also much harder.
