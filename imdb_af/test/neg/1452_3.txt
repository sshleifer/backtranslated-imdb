I seem to remember many hype about this movie when it came out, but avoided seeing it over the years. I wish I had waited longer. Maybe this movie was funny in 1988, I don't know. I was younger then, but the world didn't look that different. Michelle Pfeiffer, beautiful as she is, is never convincing. Mercedes Ruehl not only walks in the scenery, but bumps it into her cheeks like a gerbil to save later. Dean Stockwell is about as convincing as a mobb boss as James Gandolfini would be as dancer for the Bolshoi. And Matthew Modine showed the most outspoken case of delayed puberty I have ever seen. All in all, it's not bad enough to make your eyes with a melon, but it's not far off.
