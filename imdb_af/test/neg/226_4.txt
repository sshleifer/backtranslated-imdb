"Fool for Love" is one of the many now forgotten films Robert Altman throughout the 1980s. This one, a screen adjustment of a Sam Shepard game starring Shepard, is simply not very good. Altman made many non-very good films during his fascinating career and many times the mistake was his. But here I think Shepard's fault is to write such a thin game. Altman's direction is assured, the performances are etc. Shepard is Eddie, a stuntman who has a love / hate relationship with May (Kim Basinger). . The two fight endlessly over the evening of an evening in a dusty motel in the middle of nowhere, while a mysterious man (Harry Dean Stanton) who can be a figurative or literal father to both Eddie and May can observe. Randy Quaid encloses the four-person cast as a gentleman caller. <br /> <br /> The only dramatic hook in the whole plot is the indication that Eddie and May's relationship is oblique. However, this hook feels more like a gimmick than anything. The script explores their relationship in no detail, and does not use their relationship to explore more universal themes. Shepard and Basigner create eccentric, manicured characters that become annoying within the first five minutes. Stanton and Quaid have little to do but give reaction shots. <br /> <br /> The last half of the movie is especially bad when Eddie's and May's backstage begin to play back over monotonous, somnolent voices. <br /> <br /> Krit this one of Altman's experiments went wrong. <br /> <br /> Degree: C-
