This film series of production line planning. The movie makers seem to have watched recent hit movies, and throw spaghetti on the screen - Jimmy Stewart! June Allyson! Anthony Mann! Baseball! War! Baby! Airplane! - ROLL 'EM! - The film addresses the age of the Stewart / Allyson artists; although I'm sure we still have to think they are much younger. <br /> <br /> There are messages in "Strategic Air Command". I found frightening and offensive, but I will stick to a really miserable element: The happy married couple are challenged when Mr. Stewart's character makes an important decision without consulting his wife. In the film's most dramatic scene she calls him there. It ends completely unsolved - Allyson cries her heart on their bed, and Stewart walks out on her. NO discussion; He simply says he is correct and runs out on his devastated wife. For all he knows, she can split her wrist. <br /> <br /> Later, Allyson apologizes for her husband's decision. <br /> <br /> Incredible! <br /> <br /> Stay with Stewart-Allyson in "The Stratton Story" (1949). <br /> <br /> ** Strategic Air Command (3/25/55) Anthony Mann ~ James Stewart, June Allyson, Frank Lovejoy
