Last night I watched this movie with my boyfriend. I'm 20 years old and this movie was too much for me. I can't imagine being a teenager, preteen, or (especially) a kid to this movie. It was rough and offensive. I was totally deceived by his PG-13 rating and the previews I saw for it. I saw original previews on Nickelodeon, and I thought it looked pretty cute (maybe I just don't remember the preview right). Plus, Drake Bell (the movie's main character) stars on a Nickelodeon television show targeting preteness and young teens. I really didn't think the content of the movie would be so risky. I had to do more research about it before I went. However, I hope parents will read this movie before they take their children to see it just because it has Drake Bell in it. <br /> <br /> Make sure you don't take children or teenagers to see. This movie. The rating should have been R. There are tons of sexual references, drug references and disturbing events throughout the movie. Examples: Drake Bell is attacked by sexually charged animals, various scenes involving men's men's breasts, much of the curse, Drake Bell uses a bong to smoke vanilla ripe (or something), people get bruised, hit and hurt the movie, and an elderly lady and her dog are cut. There are tons of other offensive and disgusting scenes throughout the movie. It was really humiliating for women in general. The movie is made by the people who made the Scary Movie series so it really tells you something. Please remember that watching movies like these kids and teens can give you all kinds of wrong ideas about sex, drugs and violence. Most children and teenagers cannot decipher between spoofs or comedy and reality. <br /> <br /> I have a sense of humor. I also know that the humor in this movie is typical of his genre. But I find the possibility that children and teenagers will see this movie. <br /> <br /> Regarding the overall quality of the movie, I didn't think it was original or funny. It dragged in parts and some of the humor was just forced and painful. The acting wasn't too bad, considering how bad the writing was. If you're an adult or older teenager looking for a funny movie, skip it or rent it.
