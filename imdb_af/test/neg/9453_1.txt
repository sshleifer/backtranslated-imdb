A friend of mine loves sticky horror movies, so I often get low budget stuff like this. However, this is the first time I have been obliged to write a review of one. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen! Worse than Boggy Creek II! <br /> <br /> The entire budget for the movie looks like a short scene in the middle when dr. Klaus stands in this room thing and all vampire ish changes. <br /> <br /> The only good thing to say is that it is hilarious after a few beers (but for all the wrong reasons).
