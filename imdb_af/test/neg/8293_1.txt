This movie spends most of his time preaching that this is the script that makes the movie, but apparently there was no script when they wasted this time! The trailer makes it a comedy, but the movie can't decide if it's a comedy, drama, romance or action movie. Press releases indicated that Shatner and Hamlin made this movie because they loved writing (what were they thinking?). If you like William Shatner (see me), see "Free Enterprise" rather.
