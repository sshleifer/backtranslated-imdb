Although I watched Sal√≤, I do not know whether to taste taste apart. If so, this "movie" is titled accurately. So much roughage, so little dust, it's the celluloid equivalent of celery - it not only cleans the palate. It leaves the taste of wasted time in the head of the head, and if I can vomit this movie and get that extension / cost back, I would have liked it. The detention was more exciting. The director must be forced to wear a dunce cap, and the Spirit of Ed Wood Jr. this semi-professional projection cannot save some failures. A waste of time, a mess. ** Don't be fooled by the dental Dominique Swain: skillful eye-candy she was in the Lolita remake, less tragic and savvier than Sue Lyon, but not better. However, a previously capable turn of the screw does not make her a skilled craft person. You need craft for it, not crap, what is this movie. The rules belong in the girls' bathroom, rinse until the pipes burst, while director / live-law Christina Wayne has to do 5-10 in the study room. Look anything else and pass this class, by (day), forever!
