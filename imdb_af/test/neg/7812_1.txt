To be fair, I couldn't see this movie completely, so I have no idea if it's going to get better halfway through the movie. But the first 30 minutes or so is among the worst I've seen for a while. Children under the age of twelve may get a kick from the poorly written, acted and directed slapstick humor, but adults in full control of all their faculties should eliminate this stinker.
