I was really disappointed with this movie I had a lot of hope for. It seems to have come from the success of screw-ball comedies at the time (including MGM's own "Decayed Lady", containing two of the same stars) and the success of William Powell and Myrna Loy. For three years, they were quite appealing to look at and filled with fire in their screens, but a poor script and rushed prospect destroyed the chance that it would be a good follow-up to last year's "Libeled Lady" and the two "Dun" Man "movies they've done before. "Double Wedding" tells the story of a clothing store manufacturer, Myrna Loy, who is planning the life of her sister (Florence Rice), future brother-in-law (John Beal) and her own servants (including Sidney Toler and Mary Gordon). When independent enthusiastic William Powell comes into her life, with Rice and Beal coming from Loy's constant control, Loy meets her game. Sounds good so far, right? Yes, an interesting presentation falls short, sad to say, because Loy's character is so one-dimensional. It's hard to even let her stand, seeing Powell fall in love with her, which we soon know. It's another attempt to put a professional-minded woman in her place by changing her view of her, how she lived, something Hollywood often did during his golden age. When Loy says she doesn't have time to do both business and have a man in her life, it's greener. <br /> <br /> Luckily, except Powell, there's a generous Jessie Ralph on board. A gentle, wealthy older woman who helped Loy start her business, got to know Powell and could see through Loy's cool claims she betrayed him. Rys and Beal are a boring couple, and the whole assumption that Powell gets between them is pointless. Then an ex-wife of Powell's performances, which is actually not needed at that late stage in the story, and the final wedding scene (where a crowd of people are trying to get Powell's small trailer) is a poor attempt to bring some farce. (However, it is funny that Powell is still hit by items intended by Loy to hit Edgar Kennedy. Those are very welcome as there are so few others.) Powell and Loy will do better in two later screwball comedies, " I said, Love You Again and Love Crazy, which are sophisticated, witty and fun. This film attempts to be all three, but ends with a sophisticated drill.
