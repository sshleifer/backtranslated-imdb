I'm not really sure where to start. From start to finish, bad, smelly, like walking on a 100-year-old in a harbor-a-johan. If you force yourself to see it as I did, some Vicodin will be useful for the pain. I will never understand how movie it does badly beyond the cutting room without the whole line ending on the floor. The movie is a cross between Gumby rides Pokey, meets the terminator, meets Wally Beaver who plays cowboys and Indians without the cowboys. I saw better animation in the original track of the Blob. You'll have more fun watching Gone with the Wind while you are having fun and poops. Bad plays and hokey lines will make you squirming and wish you hired Peewee's Big Top or watch every episode of Gilligan's Island. UGH. I'm gonna split my wrist now.
