very disappointing and incoherent - every now and then a germ of an idea will develop and be thrown away in the next line - it had the feeling of a movie cut and cut to try to make it work - I was bored and pulled all the way through, and I speak as a big fan of the series. Many of the jokes were original and tired. The medieval section went too long and the quality of acting was very poor. Some of the small guest spots, such as Simon Peg and Liam Cunningham, have spent more than 30 seconds in their awards as the main thrower has done in 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> It's a pity, really. <br /> <br /> The only very interesting thing was to see a look at the small barn on Soho Square - which is something everyone is ever wondering about in that part of London.
