The point of departure is interesting and the film does the best it can, but the script and the direct effort are so poor that it is not surprising that this film is buried - which is appropriate with the script. As I watched it, I couldn't decide what was worse, the script or the direction. The actors are over, the art looks like a Disney movie, the music is confronted, and the sentiment so sweet that it gives viewers cavities. This is a bad attempt to imitate "For Weddings And A Funeral". If you want to see comedy that is as flat as a pancake and how poor direction a story can make in cavity, it's a good one to watch.
