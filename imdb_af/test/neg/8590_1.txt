I just came back from "AGS". After I saw it, I was convinced that no matter how much it was written, how he explored the film in detail, Stone never looked at an NFL game in his life. Great cinematography? Give me a chance. The game montages were almost unimaginable and 90% of the other shots in the film were near. Was there something in this movie that wasn't brought up in "North Dallas Forty"? <br /> <br /> Aging star player ... watch. Young hot shot .... check. Painkillers .... watch. Owner who doesn't "get it" .... watch. Crazy off-field behavior .... check <br /> <br /> Also this is the playoffs in Dallas (ie Dec or Jan) in an outside stadium, but people are sitting there in tank and shorts! And what was the light? Were they in a Japanese Kabuki theater or a sports stadium? <br /> <br /> And the strategy shown in the game was laughing. This is fourth and 1 in the "Sharks". 30. Dallas leads 35-31. KICK THE PURCHASE PURPOSE. It would not only be soccer-wide, but you have an even better final order where they could have achieved and had to go for the two-point conversion. Hell, tie the game with the extra point and Stone could have made it even 3 hours with overtime. <br /> <br /> Was the lame montage of "old" soccer players supposed to be a tribute to the game? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> And the writing ... ugh. More cliches than you can shake a stick. Oops, there's another. <br /> <br /> "Slapshot" was better than this movie. Far. <br /> <br /> 1/10. <br /> <br /> Break it at all costs. <br /> <br />
