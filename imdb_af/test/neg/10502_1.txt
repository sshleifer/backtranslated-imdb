If you've come here, it's because you've already seen this movie and were curious what others were saying about it. <br /> <br /> I feel you, I * really * do. And I apologize as a Canadian (because that's what we do) that this role should ever cross your eyes, even if it's just a moment. I hear there is no cure for the retinal bleeding reported from every dozen cases. <br /> <br /> I, like everyone, rented this movie to believe it was a bit of blade from Blade. I thought, "sure I can use a good laugh on a silly movie." I will give the creators of this movie ONE positive comment about their "creation": Thank you for removing the REC XX / XX / XX from the bottom right corner of the screen. I can see how this movie would be a distraction. <br /> <br /> And for the record I * saw the movie, but didn't watch it. The dialogue was incoherent and most of the screens took place in my grandmother's trailer. I swear to God. <br /> <br /> You know what? I'm no longer writing about this. It's not too painful.
