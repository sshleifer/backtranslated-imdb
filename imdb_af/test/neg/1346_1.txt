This movie is not a comedy. It's not even funny in the "this movie is so bad it's funny" department. On the contrary, it's just bad. Other reviewers call the bad lighting, but besides, the plethora of bad plastic surgery is. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, many good actors have been wasted on a poor script and unspoiled direction. The main characters are one-dimensional and boring. (It's hard to feel sympathy for any of them). It is also difficult to see the four characters as good friends. It seems as if only a lot of women being thrown together pretend to be close. <br /> <br /> I won't list all the problems with this movie as it doesn't deserve much of someone's attention. (It's also not worth the time to see it).
