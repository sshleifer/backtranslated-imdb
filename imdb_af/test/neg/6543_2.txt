Although the movie has a pretty attractive appearance for a low budget, it's not what I'm watching movies for. There was not one character I found sympathetic, they seemed to lose absolutely nothing. Everything they try ends up bad, it's too hopeless for me. Reviews refer to the Puffy Chair as a black comedy ... comedy? The brother Rhett acts like an escape from an institution. When Josh talks to Emily's friend about his brother, he almost shows that Rhett doesn't play with a full cover. Still, Josh does a "wedding" to Rhett and a woman Rhett just met a few hours earlier. There were some interesting shows by some of the characters on the road. For me, however, it was the most prominent thing people walked out of the movie ... and I saw it on a free screen.
