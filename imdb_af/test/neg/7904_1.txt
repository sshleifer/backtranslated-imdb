This "movie" and I say it lightly is nothing but sheer waste. I feel sorry for the people who actually wasted their money watching it in theaters. I saw a show of the movie from a friend and I already regret it. <br /> <br /> As a black woman, I'm very shy to see it. More so, I am very horrible that people of other races have seen it and may believe it is black people's behavior in general. It's full of stereotypes against all nationalities and generations, terribly vulgar coarse jokes and crippled one-liners flourished by some well-known African American comedians who needed to know better after reading this script! I also have to mention the many rap and hip hop singers / rappers who populate the movie as if it were a long music video --- they had absolutely no place in the movie. I think they were the "Jiving & Singing Minstrels?" Horrible. <br /> <br /> The authors, producers and anyone who has the folly to fund this "movie" must all be shot or locked in a room and forced to see the rest of their lives. DO-NOT-WATCH-THIS- MOVIE !!! It's time to waste your life, never to return.
