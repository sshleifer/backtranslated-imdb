Terrible, boring zombie successor is just slightly better than yours's terrible first movie. It consists of a group of soldiers going into a zombie pest campus on campus to find a certain type of blood that can help find a cure for the infection. These soldiers are your typical lambs to kill and none of them are pulled out (or at least not very interesting) so you don't feel a sadness in the pit of your stomach when they get rid of. The movie has the typical zombies that bite people and plow blood. It even has the same munching on the intestines. It just doesn't do anything for the zombie genre to give it memory. And the story's climax is rather anti-climax and ridiculous. One wonders how two people can immerse in an army of zombies and not get a little (because they are the main stars that seem to always be able to manage escape) while others seem to get a little easier. The movie alone motivation is to show people get a bit. Nothing else. Just watch a Romero movie for a lasting effect.
