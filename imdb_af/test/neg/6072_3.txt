I expected so much as I watched from this movie. It is not that I object to the literary license, especially if there is no overt attempt to say "based on a true story." But this movie is about Beethoven - a truly historic person so widely known and deeply embedded in our musical experiences, and I expected the movie to be true at least in the primary elements. This movie has taken such a great exception to the historical record that just disappointed. <br /> <br /> My assumption (because I didn't research the movie at all) was that it was true. Halfway I stopped the movie to look it up on IMDb. The rest of the movie was another remarkable experience. I was relieved that it was not correct with history, because it was so difficult to believe much of the story. To enjoy this movie, I had to recognize it as a fantasy, a "what if it was like this" story. The movie lacked this honest indemnity. <br /> <br /> What disappointed me the most was the fictional execution of the 9th symphony. The concept portrayed in the film put my imagination to the point of accident. I finally doubted anything else to Ludwig van Beethoven as his relationship with Karl van Beethoven. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the performance of Ed Harris - an exceptional actor who knows how to play a role and keeps himself out of it and it was about it and therefore I give it a 3/10 . <br /> <br /> Those who say that this movie is as good or better than Amadeus also have no idea of ​​composers living and just watching what this movie really is, as it was a cheap novel of a story - pulp fiction.
