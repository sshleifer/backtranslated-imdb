During my struggle to stay awake during this drill banquet, I fought my near dose to discover a crazy plot on brotherhood cheats, very incredibly annoying, in trouble with a psychotic, radioactive damaged half-man / half-cyborg called Splatter who sends his soldiers to them for the murder of their coveted, political vocal leader (... for whom Splatter killed himself, set them up to blame for being the leader). These face-painted freaks form a group that expresses their feelings anarchically, though not violent, leaving on dilapidated streets by the "civilized world" who expressed their concern about nuclear disarmament. Anyway, most of the movies have these five frats goons who walk through darkened streets with graffiti walls, as Splatter and his punks pursue them. Thanks for these guys, they find a punk chic to help them on their journey from this ugly terrain they are unfamiliar with. This area where the guys are immersed is a real maze of streets and streets with the idea of ​​an outing difficult, especially if the mad and Splatter's cluster occupies almost every turn. Yes, I was dumped like others thanks to the best HR Giger poster. If he was the designer of this drink, this is not the case, and we are the viewer, a film modeled on him. Of all movies, it looks like Walter Hill's THE WARRIORS, except this movie doesn't have the style or grit that the movie has. The film has an abundance of unique pieces and lame confrontations between the freak and the punks with hand in hand, often stubbornly fighting. The environment is quite interesting, and there are some atmospheric uses of neon light, but it is not the environment that is the problem. It's the plot and characters in the area that get annoying. The saddle pockets under my eyes waved heavier every minute. This movie continued. Yes, Texas CHAINSAW stars Edwin Neal (.. a funny tuner who has an entertaining interview on the DVD I rented for this blazing movie) and Marilyn Burns has a key role as opposing members of their faction against the government eventually the final conclusion within a building complex resulted. Neal's character Splatter uses these metal spikes coming from his metal arm to kill his victims.
