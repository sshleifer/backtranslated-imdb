It is a film that uses any interest or praise it receives to be a lesbian interest. The performances are mostly emotional compared to better movies in the GLBT genre. The whole of the film's perceived value is gained by modest tension on how and when the relatives of the partners will say something discouraging about their lesbian relationship. The best feature of the movie is probably the beautiful New England landscape, although much of the movie is inside. It's hard to see any viewer watching this movie and not trying to confirm the GLBT lifestyle, or to confirm it from others, even through poorly-realized drama, in any meaningful way. It's a terrible movie.
