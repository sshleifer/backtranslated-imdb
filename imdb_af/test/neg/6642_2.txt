There are many puzzles in life. For example: Why did any of the other people like Carrot Top agree to appear in this movie? Why did anyone distribute this movie? Why did someone pay money to see it? I don't think any of these questions will ever be answered, but one thing I know for sure, this movie is one of the worst ever made with such a budget. It would be bad, but adding Carrot Top's "humor" makes it even worse. The only entertainment you could possibly get from this movie is to burn, smash or otherwise destroy it in an amusing way. If you would arrange it against every movie ever made, it would be right between "Problem Child" and "Biodome". Nuff said.
