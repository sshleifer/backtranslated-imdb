To enjoy 'Fur - an imaginary portrait of Diane Arbus,' Stephen Shainberg needs the viewer to suspend all reality and prior knowledge of American photographer Diane Arbus. Paradoxically, it is the use of Diane Arbus's name and knowledge of her life and work, which makes this film on a large scale on a large scale. <br /> <br /> What turns out well with the decisive of the beautiful WASPish and glamorous Nicole Kidman as the anti-glamorous Jewish Diane Arbus, is that Shainberg didn't get Arbus or what her work was (unintentional realism) and apparently just on Arbus on her superficial level dressed in her circus freak photos. <br /> <br /> What follows is a beautiful and trivial Beauty & the Beast fantasy biopsy featuring Robert Downey JR as Kidman's hairy fictional love interest. However, this is not the banality of the story that is the biggest mistake in this film, but the directors' misogynistic stance that Diane Arbus, one of the world's most simple and original female photographers, was unable to make her own ideas about her. form work. While his previous film "Secretary" was a study of female masochism, his continued portrayal of the female as submissive completely boasts this movie - and flies in the face of real life Diane Arbus's courage, determination, and fearlessness in the one-handed exploration of the often shady world of outsiders. <br /> <br /> Imagine an imaginary movie on the star Madonna's life with Guy Richie as her Svengali, the man behind her career, and you will get a sense of how seriously flawed and imaginary it is. movie is: it can only work if you have absolutely no knowledge of the subject, or just choose to ignore all the facts. <br /> <br /> This is a pity, because once you have removed the reference to Diane Arbus, this film may have risen on its own as an interesting study of fetishism and a good companion to the Secretary. 10/04
