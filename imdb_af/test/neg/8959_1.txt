I have this movie as a buy, get one deal at troma.com with The Ruining (which is not much better). The main reason I wanted it to be Star Worms II: Attack of the Pleasure Pods, the DVD is a dual feature with that movie. I didn't really know what Actium Maximus was at the time, and when I saw the trailer, I was scared. It looks terrible. But hey, what can you tell about the trailer? Well, I can tell a lot. This movie made me honest. The special effects were so terrible, you can't say what's going on in God's name. I understand Mark HIcks had a very low budget, but come on. And it's sad because in the interview he sounded like it was an epic movie and meant more than you could see. But the movie is unfortunately one of the most boring hours and 15 minutes of anyone's life. It's so painful to go through. I can't even explain the plot to you because I didn't understand it at all and I unfortunately saw this movie twice! Apparently, they used some dolls for the "strange dinosaurs" as they did in Star Wars. But these special effects are terrible, I can't stress enough. And most of the time, bad special effects are good, but this movie doesn't really need them. It takes place on a futuristic planet where strange dinosaurs fight each other and wander bad actors in a sweatshirt with hairstyles, and they look like they're in the cock. And a box with a blue light on it is the president. I know in the interview Mark Hicks said something about making this a television pilot. Well, I can see why it didn't make CBS or NBC. There are two good things about this movie. 1. The music is actually pretty good, it has an epic score that stands in your head for days. And 2. Lloyd Kaufman's introduction is as always hilarious. Generally, don't waste your time but watch Star Worms II: Attack of the pleasure paws!
