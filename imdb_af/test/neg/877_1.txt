While I'm not a woman, I can enjoy a chick fly if it's good. However, this one is over. You've got it with the book story, the girl is divorced, the boy with issues pointing out. BOOM magic happens and his demons are banned because she realizes her life has a new purpose. <br /> <br /> Now that I can believe that something can happen, I'm not an idiot. It won't happen over a weekend of geriatric rumpy pumping, it will take time. Yet the producers know that they only have 1 hour and 30 minutes, so they make the changes of the two, I think a night to be hammered and a night of gramps and grandmother going on, like dogs in heat, can be enough if you believed romance novels were the gospel ... but most people do not. <br /> <br /> Now, if that's not enough ... the producers remembered that a chick finger should make the viewer cry. Well, they tried to make you cry with the two senior citizens miss it by failing ... so how can they hit you again? Why I know, we can't kill any of the characters except that a random death will surely bring a tear to the eye ... and now let the teenager tie magic with a heart-breaking mother without any reason except that it will be nice (totally unreal but caring). <br /> <br /> So there you have it ... girl finds boy, boy finds love, death finds boy and mother cry ... What a movie - NOT.
