Frankly, people who gave this movie would have given 100 for pulp fiction. This is the level we are talking about here. <br /> <br /> The movie is not bad, but it's not like OMG, the best movie ever since Pulp Fiction! Some people have incredibly low expectations for movies, even those of variety. Personally, I found my interest in the movie down to the half hour. The plot denies logic and faith. You should hear the part about why the woman did what she did to save her husband. Yes, right. I guarantee that you would like to think of the theater, "hmm, now it's no use at all." This is a movie in which you really need to suspend all logic and beliefs. <br /> <br /> Those who said the music score was good probably listened to their MP3 players. It killed the film in some parts. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, just look at the movie if you don't have to do anything special. I give it a three because there is one long gender series in the motel that is decent.
