I've seen the movie many times, and each time I'm more and more disappointed, which is a pity because the movies of EX YU are usually very good. The shame here is that Holiwood tried to make a film about the place and people didn't have an idea. My self comes from the Balkans (Macedonia) found this movie disappointing. Only the Bosnian characters are not really understood and are not really portrayed. To understand the mentality of a person of EX YU, you need to know their background, way of life, which makes them cry and laugh. And the film's director didn't use it as a guide. When we make (EX YU) movies, there is a lot of symbolism built into it, which makes the characters recognizable and likeable and usually portray the truth (if based on true story). The movies like "Pretty village, pretty flame" "Tito and Me", "Underground", "No man's land", "Before the Rain", "Black cat, white cat", "Otac na sluzbenom putu" peva "(Who Rare the masterpiece of Balkan cinematography, and nothing can be compared to it, not the half-baked story of Holiwood studio, as someone mentioned from the panel, the story jumps from one side of the town after another with no real connection, I'm sorry, but when the movie is made, it's not just for the American armchair variety viewers, but also for the rest of the world, and some of them also live in the Balkans and Sarajevo And to add insult to the injury, half of the things in Bitola, Macedonia where I come from, are shot. Image shocked me when I saw the Bitola Broad St in opener. movie, when the bride is shooting the sniper, and what was the real picture creation news of the news coverage in the film? Anyway, very disappointing, because the truth is far from the movie. Shame that no one consulted the right people about how to live in Sarajevo before shooting the movie. book is one thing and real life is different, and this film both leaves.
