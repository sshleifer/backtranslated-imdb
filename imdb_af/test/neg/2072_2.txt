Another pretentious film by Vicente Aranda. If "Juana la loca" shone the same, its quality was at least better (mainly due to the great performance of Pilar LÃ³pez de Ayala), but "Carmen" is boring and full of subjects (fiery brunette with a dagger in the stocking, the poor man is clear by the passion, the Sierra Nevada gangs, "toreros" ... .... Paz Vega is a beautiful woman, but there is more doubt about his talent, and Sbaraglia's role is so stupid that it is almost unbelievable. The script is weak and Aranda's excessive character influences the entire film. With these ingredients the result could not be good. <br /> <br /> Not the worst movie I've seen, but a complete failure, in my opinion.
