The idea behind this movie was wonderful. The story of a little girl experiencing abuse (both emotionally and physically) and trying to handle and survive. What the film is falling apart is the terrible use of voice wars and the stingy dialogue. The actors have to show the obvious things over and over. There are also very boring, almost funny, over-exploitation of metaphors in the voice surplus. The highlight is the actions of the girl. Nice try, but this is a stinker.
