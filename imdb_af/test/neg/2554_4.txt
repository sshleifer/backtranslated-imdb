If it wasn't for Christopher Guest's hilarious role, I would have stopped watching this movie after 20 minutes. The jokes were flat, the movie was slow and slow, some characters were offensive and painful to watch, but Gaste's character made me laugh so that I was stuck to it. <br /> <br /> There are far better choices out there!
