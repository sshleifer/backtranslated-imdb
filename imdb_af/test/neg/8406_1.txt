I watched it because it seemed the plot was going somewhere. When it came ambiguously, I was very disappointed. I'm going to tell you what really happened in the next sentence. But maybe I won't. Maybe I'll just imply that something will happen. The authors had no imagination. It's not even a B-movie - it's a TV-B movie.
