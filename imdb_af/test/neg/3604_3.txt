I really liked the movie 'The Emporer's New Groove', but it was like coming home and seeing your wife have a lama relationship. Seriously, this movie was bad. It's like Club Dread to Super Troopers. I have to write 10 lines, but I don't even know what to say. I laughed a few times, but just because I drank. A movie like it should be at least funny if you're drunk. It wasn't. Maybe llamas are just funny and regular cartoon people are not. Anyway, just stick to The Emporer's New Groove if you want a funny, cartoon, lama theme movie. Line 10 is this rule here.
