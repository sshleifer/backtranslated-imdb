I don't see how anyone who actually read the M. Didius Falco mysteries could make such a mockery. An Aussie has no business in ancient Rome. None of the books are in this movie except the institution and characters, and they are wasted on a plot that reads the foolish script. Kevin Connor and Lee Zlotoff have many nerves that show their names in the credits.
