This movie had terrible relief and horrible camera movements. This movie is a jumping horror flick with no meaning. The slashes are totally fake. It looks like a 17-year-old idiot wrote this movie and a 10-year-old kid shot it. With the worst acting you can ever find. People are tired of knives. Keep at least guns or fire. It has almost exact lines of "When a Stranger Calls". With gruesome murders, only crazy people will enjoy this movie. Obviously the author does not have children or even cares for them. I mean to show some grace. Just to sum it up, this movie is a "B" movie and it gets sucked. Just for your sake, don't even think about wasting your time watching this crazy movie.
