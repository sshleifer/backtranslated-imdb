All dogs went to heaven was a strange, funny movie; Well-known talent whose voices have a fame for a cartoon basically for children. It was just interesting enough to be fun by adults, apart from something good for the kids to watch. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, ADGTH2 is a worthy successor, trying to make some cash on the medals of the first. Charlie Sheen is an acceptable substitute for Burt Reynolds in this second movie and Sheena Easton's voice in some of the movies. Nice, but forgetful songs make her a valuable choice as a co-author. Add Dom DeLuise from the first movie and you would think it would be a decent mix to at least make this successor relatively decent compared to the first one. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, even with the addition of other good voice actors such as Bebe Neuwirth in the terrible role of Anabelle, this movie cannot be saved from the horrible production values ​​and animation skills (or lack thereof) anywhere in this movie occurs. Scary editing, synchronizing the voices and spaces where the characters' mouths need to be moved to move, but are not combined to make this movie look like an animation project by college interns instead of the decent sequel it could have been . <br /> <br /> All I want to say, unless you were a huge fan of the first movie, I would give it a very good fit.
