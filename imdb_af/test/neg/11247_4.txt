The first movie was quite hip and had amusing moments. This movie does not have exactly the same standard. Calvin Palmer (Ice Cube) is still trying to keep his hairdresser, but it is not only against stylist Gina (Queen Latifah) with a beauty house next door, but soon a big barber chain called Nappy Cutz will be opened across the street. Calvin, along with their co-workers and friends Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer), Jimmy (Sean Patrick Thomas), Terri (Eva) and Isaac Rosenberg (Troy Garity), do everything they can to keep regular clients, and eventually they business running against the competition. Also starring Michael Ealy as Ricky Nash, Leonard Earl Howze as Dinka, Harry Lennix as Quentin Leroux, Robert Wisdom as Alderman Brown, Jazsmin Lewis as Jennifer, Kenan Thompson as Kenard and Bad Company's Garcelle Beauvais-Nilon as Loretta. I didn't have as much as the first of this film because of the unnecessary flashbacks on Eddie, and it's not that greasy, I just got bored. Okay!
