"Milo" is another answer to a question no one ever asked. We really need more slashers. I think for one that we have more than enough. I think the professional old guys overloaded so much so that we go with a murderous child. also a zombie or a ghost when he feels it. A long time ago he drowned, but it didn't bother him and he still kills people ("Friday the 13th", what is it?). One day, her survivors have a great reunion and as a surprise turn, Milo comes to visit them. Through some very bad shots that show everything except the murders, the throw is thinned out until only the final girl remains to find out Milo's dull. I mean the dark secret. She and her friends died to know. Milo attacked another murderous rampage (isn't it yet his bedtime?) And the girl, well, she screams a lot. The play is not even at the bottom of the walk, the barrel refuses to be associated with it. Milo can be a creepy bastard from time to time, but I give it to him, but some movies just can't be saved without a big writing or free nudity.
