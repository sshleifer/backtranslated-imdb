Jean Claude Van Damme's film career went to hell in a handcart, so ironic to see him playing a character that literally meets the same movie! It is also interesting to note how many, very similar, the plots of his films play, regardless of who the producer, director or screenwriter is. Van Damme usually plays a character living in France, and because of a series of circumstances he finds himself in another part of the world where he has a brother who dies and that is Van Damme's action that is helped by a character he has just met. Look at AWOL or LEGOINRERE or many other movies titled "Starring Jean Claude Van Damme" and they all have almost the same kind of story structure. This doesn't mean they are of course the same, just very similar and if you saw one Van Damme movie, you actually saw them all. It's the same with MAXIMUM RISK
