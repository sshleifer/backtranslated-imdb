First there was Tsui Hark's Zu Warriors (2001), which is visually groundbreaking, but much lacking in acting and writing departments, now this movie, which is visually almost as good as Zu (but no longer pioneers), but is even worse in the acting and writing departments. It's really sad that there seems to be almost a lack of plays in the HK film industry. I think you have to understand Cantonese to understand how bad and vulgar the dialogue in the movie really is. It's like some criminal children talking in the street, it's so bad. To make it worse, the actors and actresses look like criminal children, and can't act, even if their lives depend on it. I understand that this movie is supposed to be a comedy that is aimed at the younger generation in HK, but has really become so brave that youths can appreciate nothing but such youthful and vulgar plays? If that is the case, it makes me ashamed to be HK. <br /> <br /> I wish HK filmmakers will learn lessons from directors such as Zhang Yi-Mou or Ang Lee and eventually make a movie that is both visual. impressive as well as competent and mature in acting and writing departments. And stop using young singers / idols / heartthrobs as actors because they can't act but many fans they can have in HK!
