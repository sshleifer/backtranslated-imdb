One of the scariest movies I've ever seen was Carrie (the first one!). Now, as with other movies, they totally destroyed the Carrie franchise with The Rage: Carrie 2. From the beginning, the movie, like geriatics, has followed up in a relaxed order. There are scarce scarecrows and this movie is full of all the different high school steroids (that is, the soccer jockeys, the tuftsman leader, the followers and of course the black nailpolish wear misfits). Another sad thing about this show is that you know what will happen when you see the opening credits. Certainly, girl is urgently humiliated and then yawned into a crazy psychic killer ... ya ... There is. Do this. <br /> <br /> Even the actors look like they're forced to do this movie. Emily Bergl is as scary as a dummy doll while Jack London ... let's just say I didn't pay to see wood. Apart from the actors, the flippers serve more to annoy than to join the first movie. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, If you can radiate objects like Carrie, then the love of God becomes you from that theater ......
