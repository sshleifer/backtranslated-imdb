This movie was in a box with 20 others, of different quality, and I can safely say that this title was right under the hope. <br /> <br /> It is senseless to go the plot, there was something wrong, because I didn't get all day long and life is short, reminding me, I only have about 85 minutes lost from me to watch this time. <br /> <br /> The acting was bad at diabolics in a way that made it funny, though, while the comedy elements like the two idiotic police had to make Laurel & Hardy fans moan. One of the only rare funny moments was when the front lady joked about her former friends, plastic T * ts, who would have been good if I didn't have to look around their bob when she was clouded on the screen. <Br /> <br /> The lowest I can give is one, and it probably deserves Heather Thomas in it because she was definitely sexy and good, although her acting was as bad as everyone.
