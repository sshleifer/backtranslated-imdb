I don't honestly know what legal or illegal substance they - the writers - were when writing this horrible piece! <br /> <br /> Throwing - sucking The plot - sucking The editing - sucking The whole premise of the movie is that a girl with psychic / telekinetic forces comes across a lesbian vampire murder, you just have to get out of your head be even watching one minute of this. <br /> <br /> The only reason I had to see it - it was here! network as part of a two-photo purchase and the movie that came after it was the right one I wanted to see. I quickly came across the whole thing and was just surprised how stupid this movie was in double speed! <br /> <br /> Don't rent, buy or watch this movie .... the vampires in the movie don't suck as much as the overall movie and production do! <br /> <br /> If you want a good lesbian vampire movie - The Hunger with David Bowie, Susan Sarandon & Katharine Deneuve - excellent movie to watch / own / rent in place of this piece of pure sh * t
