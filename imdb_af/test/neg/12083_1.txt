This movie had potential. If it was handled differently. What it needed was another director. This is for sure. And maybe another leading woman. I can't understand the Minnie Driver character - or at least how she played it. She was absolutely incredible. I can't believe she would also like her performance in this movie. She was probably left by the director or unable to deliver what the director was trying to do. I'm writing this because I'm still watching it. I think I'd hate to be in her shoes to do something I didn't understand. Well, we just got on with the thing she started with the boy (I'm still watching). I am now deeply embarrassed by all those involved in this business. If you like watching movies that miss their point in a big way, watch this one.
