It comes from an adult who has managed to prevent the first one and expect a movie aimed at children and was amazed at the mature humor that was in Emperor New Groove. The character I liked was Kronk, so I was excited when I heard of the successor (sp) with no other than "Kronk". <br /> <br /> I just watched Kronk's New groove, it took me two days because I had to turn it off, I was bored halfway through it. I finally watched the rest of the next day and unfortunately the 2nd half was just as lame as the first. <br /> <br /> Being a Disney movie, I expected to have some musical scenes, but this one was They were full and they were not amusing. The great thing I found about Emperors New Groove was that it could be appreciated by a wide audience, from toddlers to adults. In fact, Kronke New Groove did nothing to me or my girlfriend and we both loved it first. It's really aimed at young children, the comedy is pretty childish, the music tones aren't very well done and the plot itself is extremely grainy. <br /> <br /> Save yourself money and rent this movie as possible because she's definitely not worthy to get a second look. I was very disappointed and shocked at how it was whipped. They actually managed not to make a character (Kronk) funny in this movie, it is wonderful in itself. It is clear that everyone's opinion differs, but I am very easily amused, I usually enjoy successors (sp) even when others discredit them, mostly because I first loved, I needed more of the characters and no matter how bad the plot was, i would enjoy the movie. I can't say the same for this one, I never thought I'd go through it halfway due to pure boredom. <br /> <br /> Buy at Own Risk.
