There is something going on in this movie, directed by author John Shiban, X-Files, which prompted me. You get the feeling when the movie moves that everything doesn't look what it looks, but I feel the movie fails to give you enough to take care of later. It's about perception. There are characters who meet the heroine Nicole (Jaimie Alexander) in the movie she talks about and disappears. It may look like a destroyer, but it is something that really only focuses on the filmmaker's part. It looks like they are fun on us when we see how curious we are or what trust Nicole sees or not. It never gets a proper answer, and I for the one was a bit clueless on the point. There comes a time in a movie when ambiguity can only be frustrating because the viewer is guided on a wild goose hunt that ends at a dead end with little explanation on what we just saw. It eventually feels like a tiring exercise instead of an exciting psycho-drama. Now there is nothing wrong with ambiguity itself, but give us something to fix or you will evade us. That's how I felt when I looked at "Rest Stop". This film is thought to be a young woman named Nicole, who decides to fly to California with lover Jesse (Joey Mendicino) to raise it in Hollywood. They make what is supposed to be a little detour at a resting place so that Nicole can protrude, but it gets scared of her when she finds her Jesse completely missing. Somebody in a crunchy, dusty yellow truck is a nut that finds Nicole very difficult and we soon realize that he is behind Jesse's disappearance when things start to happen, signs given to her if you want, she will have. away from a very difficult situation. Nicole is far from any existing town and with limited resources to defend herself from a maniac that gives her strong evidence of how angry he can be. <br /> <br /> It's the easy part. When a female character comes into play, the movie makes a very bizarre leap from logic, because we're not sure where she came from, how she got there, and more importantly where she goes, Nicole tries to free her from her alleged jail breaks down into the toilet's cabinet. She meets another, a police officer in the area (Joey Lawrence), who may look like her savior. But if he is also a victim of the truck driver, it is once again wonderful things that happen when he was actually there. The truck driver commits tortureous acts to Nicole (like keeping her in the toilet and if she tries to unload a wire that wrapped the murderer around the door lock, she gets a nasty bite). He then sat at the toilet and left her without a lasting refuge from the animal. <br /> <br /> This is the timing of the truck driver's attacks that made me lousy. Perhaps he likes to worry, but he looks appropriate in some situations where Nicole has time to flee or prepare. It doesn't make much sense, its motives, which produce the film in an illogical idea. Why does he make himself so obvious? Why does he allow her to prepare? It looks as if I'm here on a limb, that he likes to believe his quarry that they can only find an escape route to knock that hope out when he comes to his next creepy attack. Still, why does Shiban decide to play with the viewer by experiencing Nicole with strange encounters with non-existent people? What is Shiban and the writing team trying to say? And to cut down the movie's unhealthy weirdness, a family is in a RV. They play a small role in the scheme of things like religious bigots themselves, but the movie doesn't do enough for the viewer to explain why they should be in this movie whatsoever.
