Will there be an end to hyping movies dealing with social conflicts or other human disasters? Okay, "Care" is about childless children, "Care" is about perverting abusive boys in school and how disgusting it can be. If it is a movie with poor writing and made with bad plays, it remains a bad movie. "Care" is a movie that could have been, but it was because it was a TV movie I didn't know, but everything was so limited that it came as a cheap movie that some housewives and fathers will see that decided not to go to bed. There are so many unanswered things in this movie ... the relationship with his mother, for example, or the death of an abused boy we know nothing more about. "Care" had to be much better.
