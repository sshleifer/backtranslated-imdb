I saw the movie after checking its rating on IMDb. Then it was around 8.0 and I thought, "Wow! It must be a good one". I thought wrong. The start of the movie actually holds what the plot promises, but then it goes exponentially under its basement. I think without the character of Richie Nix, it might have been good - though he is the reason why the story line follows the course. The character is just too extreme for my taste, and hard to endure. Also the journey that takes the main character from the beginning of the story to its "climax" at the end is partly irrelevant and could easily be omitted. The alternative is, I didn't understand the movie. <br /> <br /> Although I have to admit that it is "easy to watch" and I had no trouble sitting through the movie, when I was done, I was a little implied by the end. All in all, rather mediocre.
