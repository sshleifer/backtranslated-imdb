I'm very surprised to see the good ratings for this movie. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie 9 years ago and remember how angry I feel about sitting in the movie and watching this mess. I'm a big fan of John Boorman's work. I really like his movies. So I went to Beyond Rangoon with great expectation. But I felt like I was watching a stupid, cheap Chuck Norris jungle movie with all the action scenes cut out. Even the soundtrack was very annoying. <br /> <br /> I can't believe John Boorman was the director, because this movie was done so badly. I think the Burmese people deserve better movies to illustrate their struggle.
