I found this Robin Williams vehicle at its best comfortable. I think you would find it a political satire of similar. It's about a political talk show host / comedian who decides to run for president and win unexpectedly. I dry most of the humor, and Robin Williams is much more determined and calmer than usual. I would say the movie is more of a drama than a comedy, with a little secret and tension. I think the dramatic parts worked better than the comedy parts and the riddle and tension aspect (although it is a small part of the movie) worked best. I wouldn't consider this movie very high. For me it was an OK waste of 2 hours, but nothing special. to catch it on TV / cable or rent it cheaply first before making a decision on how to buy. My vote for Man of the Year is a 4/10
