I wanted to keep this movie, but there is very little to keep it from. It starts with Jean Stapleton and a Randy Newman song in Iowa (Northwest Iowa, I think), reminiscent of Norman Lear's Cold Turkey. It was one of the best movies ever made, according to people at IMDb. So far so good. And the idea of ​​Archangel Michael living at Pansy Milbank's motel on earth? Well, give it a chance, it's supposed to be a comedy. Good, so far, so good. But Michael does things that an angel who has not fallen will never do, and it blows the credibility the movie might have. The other characters in the movie also don't have much appeal. Michael brings a dog back to life, and we must upset it. The people are singing country songs. In the end, Stapleton dance with Travolta. Great story. If she was smart, she wouldn't even be in this movie. When it was over, I thought, "Give, what a stupid, tasteless, boring, crowned, holy movie!" It is not suitable to be seen by children or anyone else.
