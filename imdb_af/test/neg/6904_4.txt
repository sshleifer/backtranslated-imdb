Let's see ... a few dozen Gary Larson gags, as well as his illustration style, a possibly legally difficult wholesale award of an Aardman character, a more than generous sprinkling of artistic expression from several Pixar movies, positive Leeu King-esquire villains live in what quantities are an elephant's cemetery in the middle of farming land, and a stinking Riverdance joke ten years after any possible relevance. The children (three and five) liked it, but boy, it was a haul for dad. Just another poor attempt by Nickelodean Movies to hold onto the animation blast. I really wish they'd spent a little more money on character design, on a screenplay, on a director.
