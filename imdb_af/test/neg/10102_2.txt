I just watched it on television today. It was on ABC's Sunday Afternoon Movie. <br /> <br /> It wasn't a very good movie, but for a low budget independent movie like this it was right. There is some strain, but there are so many bad features that really make the film. The writing is pretty lame, and the plot elements aren't very realistic, like the way a 911 operator laughs and hangs when someone reports a murder. I don't know what the author thought when they got that idea, but it's not very realistic. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie would be a great thriller because there were a few scenes that seemed to be doing something good, but unfortunately they never did. There were a few plural elements used in other films like this, and in the end it wasn't very creative. <br /> <br /> If there's anything good about this movie, it's cast. Every actor in this movie did well with what they had to do. Scary actress Elizabeth Pena was great in this movie. She is very sexy and has an incredibly sexy voice. However, if you want to see a movie of hair that is really good, watch the excellent animated movie The Incredibles. In that movie she used her sexy voice well. <br /> <br /> What can I say, this movie is not really worth your time, but the actors were good. Unfortunately, they are all messed up on this movie, which is a real shame. This movie was trying to be a good tension player, but eventually it became flat. If you want to see a good movie similar to this one, but much better, see The Hitcher. If you want to see something with the role players of this movie, watch any of their other movies. You can really easily pass this movie if you ever get the chance to see it.
