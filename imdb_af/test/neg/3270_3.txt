Every time I watch this movie, blood comes out of my eyes. Yes, you read it correctly: I watched this miserable, dirty thing more than once. <br /> <br /> Caddyshack 2 went wrong for so many reasons: Harold Ramis switches in writing and leaves the direction duties, Rodney Dangerfield (wise) walks away from the project because they don't allow him to Don't think, Bill Murray has excellent judgment and not part of it and a puppet continues as the player of a much-earned role player. better. <br /> <br /> I can't help but think of Dyan Cannon in it and wonder why she is constantly laughing and smiling. The only conclusion I can draw is that she is indeed the face of pure evil. Stay with me for a moment. She should have watched as the movie came together and attacked in the ominous pain, that it would be countless soon to be extremely sorry filmmakers would have this movie on them. She could also have been very drunk. This is what I have to do now to wash off the bad taste of this complete and complete failure of my mind. If I am happy, it will be wiped out forever. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie several times. I blame many of them in childhood and are a very dim and dull boy who apparently had no aesthetic sensitivity. Maybe dolls are just funny if you're a kid. No, the Muppet show is now more beautiful ... I think I was just boring. Caddyshack 2 is that scarce kind of movie so extremely disappointing at so many levels that you have convinced yourself after the end credits that it could not have been as bad as everything. It was. It is. This will only worsen with time. <br /> <br /> Graciously, my reasons for going back to this movie are getting smaller. Randy Quaid is limited in his role as Jackie Mason's lawyer. His opening scene is not bad and has provoked me only. We see him a few more times, but it gets as tired as the rest of the movie and descends with unhappy speed from incredibly amusing to stray desert. Randy Quaid praised him well, and this film owes him a great deal of time, because if there was reason to see this movie as something other than a torture, he was. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's the trick of the movie. It has enough potential intrusive features that people see, are appalled at what they have done to themselves, but later because the stickers were so slim, they can only remember what they actually amuse. Years later they see it unconsciously again and the cycle repeats. <br /> <br /> Jackie Mason is very indebted to this movie, but in fairness he is not sure he deserves it. He is really trying out there, but it is impossible not to notice that he is using the whole movie to make a Rodney Dangerfield imitation. That's where the movie was written, but I'm not sure, even though he could have saved it. Ultimately, it fails through terrible direction, bad editing (will we count continuity errors?) And a rehashing of the same story with none of the cruel humor or heart that impressed the first movie. <br /> <br /> Dragged and shouted to a three out of ten instead of two by Randy Quaid's bulldog determination. It's not even bad enough to laugh. I definitely saw it worse, but trust your memory - this one is a dog. If you have never seen it before, you have made excellent life choices and I salute your excellent judgment.
