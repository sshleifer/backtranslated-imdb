This film is a very bad example of uninspired storytelling, trying to hide behind an "art movie" facade, trying to shock the audience with unmotivated violence (against women) to prevent it from lacking in psychological depth. of the characters and internal conflicts. Everything in this movie is pretentious, from the thank you to Bela Tarr at the beginning, to photography, the play, music, the story and editing. When suddenly, for no reason, you are forced to keep almost a charismatic outlook of Hungarian landlords in their boats, while the soundtrack tries to convince you that this is a dramatic moment, although they are just heading to the funeral of the local alcoholic, that's one thing. To put totally unmotivated rape scenes as a shock maker is another thing I have absolutely no understanding of. This movie is trying very hard to enter a certain genre of artistic (Eastern European drama type) movies, but does not have the subtlety, observation skills and soul of other directors.
