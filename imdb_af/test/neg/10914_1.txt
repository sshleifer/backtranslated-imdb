<br /> <br /> Man, I can only believe this movie. I totally watched it (believe me, I did it!) And the best part was the trailers at the beginning (and I hate trillers !!!!). <br /> <br /> No plot, no acting, no nothing. I watched the movie and thought, "When will it start?" It never started. How can people spend money and time making such a crap? <br /> <br /> The "plot": A dog is bitten by a bat and gets rabies. Well, until now, no problem, nothing special, but OK. Now the rest of the movie will be - the dog will chase people !!! it's nothing else !!! Add to that some of the worse actions / actors I've ever encountered, some totally irrational scenes (and some others really idiotic, as the child can't breathe and the mother gives him a big and strong hug to see if he gets better) and a lot of lame end, that's it, here you have CRAP ... ops! .... CUJO. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and make something more worthy, such as hitting your head against the wall or playing with yourself. <br /> <br /> ZERO from 10. <br /> <br /> Gabriel.
