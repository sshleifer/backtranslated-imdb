With the cartoon stupidity that the cartoon "Bullwinkle" has made a quarter-century fun, NO DEATH HAIR has shown that you can exit a good movie (THE MAN CANDIDATE) without having a single sob copy your looting. The play not only records on the cable-access TV scale, but the plot is less nuanced than an old "Sgt. Rock" competition, and only Boris J. Badanov styles become "bad old" mustaches from the Commissions are missing. This movie achieves the unusual achievement of being too bad, too stupid to enjoy anyone with opposing thumbs.
