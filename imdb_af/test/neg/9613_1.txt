With most critics welcomed when it first appeared, Frenzy recently did the rounds of British TV. I remember seeing it on its original release, and then thinking if Hitchcock wanted to parade a kind of screen confession about its complicated misogynism, he couldn't find a little small vehicle. <br /> <br /> But Time changed perspective, and so what was uncertain in 1972 may be upward revaluation years ago. <br /> <br /> Maybe. . . but not. 'Frenzy' is foam. The foam of an obsolete director desperately wanted to use the artistic freedom of the 70's movie show without realizing that freedom imposes its own obligations - especially the necessity to bring integrity to its work. <br /> <br /> There's no one here. And not much evidence of the earlier direct glory, either: the shift from spine tingling that is explicit to indignation is also not shocking, even for a supreme stylist. It's just banal (the long murder scene is precisely this: extend without speed, without reason, without any purpose other than the cheapest of direct desires to appear as a contemporary artist, like the other well-known cheap sleaze practitioner, Michael Winner). <br /> <br /> It's going from bad to worse, with dialogue covering any human origin (not in the ridiculous distractions in the home life of our Dear Wood Inspector and his wife's cooking). Perhaps the scene that best summarizes 'Frenzy' (and remains the most explicit charge of Hitchcock's persona) is the swap exchange between two lawyers in a bar where they discuss the serial killers and then agree that at least the women are a had good time to get raped first. <br /> <br /> I remember my aversion to The scene is back in '72, and it's still discomfort because it wasn't Hitchcock who was smart or sardine, or trying to make a universal point ( great themes, great truths, were not Hitchcock's forts, or personal preference.) It was just Hitchcock, who reflected a reflection of his own distorted mirror on life to shine through the texture of the movie. <br /> <br /> Calling 'Frenzy' Hitchcock's last great masterpiece is to betray little as any understanding of just what Hitchcock actually <br /> <br /> "Frenzy" is now what it always was: " a cheap, nasty and haphazard movie that had no service to play. any of those involved, or in the memory of a movie maker who was really in his Hollywood days, was one of the greatest ever.
