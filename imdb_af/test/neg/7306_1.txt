It was (foolish) with some pleasure that I sat down to watch what a friend promised, the worst / best movie experience of my life, would be the mighty 'Roller blade 7'. 2 years and I am still in therapy. Oh, my best friends, it's really that bad. They apparently have about 40 minutes of footage in the can and then decide to use the footage one day and repeatedly to use the brain-following effect. My only fear of the kind of post-apocalyptic world found in this turkey is that somehow this pressure of this horror would survive. Surely the living would envy the dead.
