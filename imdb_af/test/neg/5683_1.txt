I've never heard of the zero budget "author" Neil Johnson before I saw "Battlespace" on DVD at Hollywood Video. A few minutes in the movie, I realize it's not a bad thing. Like many straight to Sci-Fi movies, it's a movie that is predominantly dominated by bad special effects and a constant parade of pretentious sci-fi concepts that don't create a story. <br /> <br /> Viewers are tortured with a religious sound introduction, then a spoken introduction followed by a narrative by the main character's daughter. For me, it looks like a smoke screen to mask a movie with militant ugly visual and null character clips. Some people here all seem too right to take this movie seriously and it seems to be new age-hitchhiking and slowing down. These favorable reviews should come from the same kind of people who can deceive themselves into thinking things like "Battlefield Earth" were a brilliant movie, or that Shasta is just as good as Coke. / Annoying Speakers. What you will not get is excitement, emotional stimulation, memorable dialogue or a good story. <br /> <br /> "Battlespace" is impenetrable bull and the constant nuisance of the narrative proves it. True science fiction, hell, real movie making, about characters and their dialogue, not special effects and dull predictions. It is right below with similar direct to video sci-fi such as "Cl.One" and "Recon 2022". If the boredom of "Strange Horizons" and "Alien Visitor" is something you're looking for, look at the crap anyway. If you enjoy a good storytelling and hate fake lens flares, you're better off with a real movie.
