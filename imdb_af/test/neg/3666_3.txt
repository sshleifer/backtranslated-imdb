Dark Reality is a Saw like a movie that decreases slightly. While the plot and story are good, there is a little too much unnecessary nudity. While I felt the movie was technically well done, the play was spotty, it was just a little too dark for my mood while watching it. It basically says there are many people out there who will never be found and may be tortured by illness. I feel some information about the captors and their reasons for being so ill helped some. It came as a snuff movie, just made for the violent content. If you want to see women beaten, tortured and killed, it's for you. If you are looking for something, a little liter and more expressive and reasoned, skip this one.
