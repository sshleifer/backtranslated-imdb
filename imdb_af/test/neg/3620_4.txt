I'm not going to lie and say I'm not looking at the show - I do. BUT it has many, and many errors. 1) The residence is perfect. The drama is at a minimum. Everyone is so nice to each other, you know. Let's give it a reality test. It is impossible that any school is perfect like PCA. Free laptops for everyone. Large dorms. Mini fridge. If such a school were in real life, almost no one would be a virgin there. Two, everybody is so rich, and it's strange how nobody has stolen anything. 2) Characters really unrealistic. First things first, who speak in their right minds as they do. They talk like a perfect teen. Second, Logan Reese (Matthew Underwood) is a very rich boy's "hot" teen. My question is why is there not nearly ever girl in that school about him? He is rich and "warm", now all those girls will be to him, even though he was a while. Also, Chase is the most stupid person ever. He is this shy teenager who claims he is not in love with Zoey, and overreacts to everything Zoey entails. She must be blind to not see him in love with her. <br /> <br /> Come on Nick. I know you can do better than that. Please ..
