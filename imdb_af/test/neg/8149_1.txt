With the little respect it deserves, I would like to say that this movie was terrible. The filmmakers had good intentions, but the overall quality of the direction and production value is obviously lacking. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good hard laugh and then wasting another two hours of their lives, experiencing a painful experience. I'm surprised I even found this movie on the $ 1 DVD rack where it was fitted. I thought maybe it would be good and I might discover an incredibly independent movie - I was wrong. I wish I never saw this movie. My 3-year-old cousin couldn't make a worse movie. I'm glad I saw the movie, because I can finally tell people that I've seen and be the worst movie ever made.
