I was a little too old for this show. I was 6 when it first came out. Only when I was a young child were there a few children's performances that were on sesame street where I watched and learned, but otherwise there wasn't much else. My cousins ​​were all born to me a few years ago. 7 years was the first to come last. Barney was a huge part of what they watched. When I first saw, I told my grandmother how it didn't teach, just to use magic to fix everything. I was 9 when, how many 9 years have any idea that is really going on with a TV show. More and more what I saw or heard about Barney's teachings more and more, I told people how bad the show was. The funny thing is my parents who had a young child in the middle of the late 80's who was me at the time. They agreed and said the same as I did. The sad thing about this is my cousins ​​who are older now 13 and so it still agrees with what they have seen. It doesn't make its creative point out, it's not right to think differently than someone tells you. Its like to steal if the person doesn't know or remember it's gone. Let's be honest with ourselves, Barney is out to make money and doesn't teach children. The brighter the program, the more likely children will be to watch it. Children are stupid, not because they are not educated, they do not know better, the second time Barney was on a show and parents bought it. I never believed TV could affect people as Barney did. If you read a young child to them, look at a show that teaches their numbers, don't let them get involved in this show. Barney is like smoking, is once too much, smokes a few and your addict lets your child look at this show, they are addicted and one day their kids will see the same shit and buy the same shit you bought.
