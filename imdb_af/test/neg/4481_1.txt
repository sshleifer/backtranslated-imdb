I was very excited about this movie! my expectations were under control because I read the first soo book I expect differences. What I didn't expect was how big the differences were. Starting with the characters physical appearances ... like Channing Tantums lack of tattoos n Amanda Seyfried is not a brunette lol, but I let it go ... the character developments were not there ... you didn't have time to love amanda seyfried character and you can't feel her or John when they first got divorced ... i thought the two weeks were rushed and i hated she was first gone ... it had the emotional separation taken away ... and why did they change Tim from the book ... why did they make him a dad instead of a brother and why did they make him so old and the movie lacked that intense moment when they find out what happens at the end (didnt want to spoil it, but for those who watched it, you know what i meant) and whhhyyyy ooooo wwhyyyy they changed the end ... in the book it was heartbreaking and emotional. This emphasized Channing Tatum's character's decision. ... it just looked like a rushed end ... it was terrible ... the ts that disappointed me the most ... the end of the book should have been exactly the same.
