Nothing to look at here. It's all done before (and better). Who cares for this woman, who is impossible in all respects, as a mother as a woman and as a friend? At one moment, when she was able to get the highway, she jumped with both feet into relapse and held her breath. Not better than a man! "If she is not the beautiful and young person she portrays on the screen - but looks more like the real human wreckage represented by our relatives, neighbors and friends who are really suffering from additions are changing our channels into a nanosecond. . /> <br /> This movie starts underneath and goes downhill. Nothing reasoning, no lessons learned - nothing fussing in any way. None of the main characters even call sympathy, let alone empathy. (Well, maybe the snake.) I would have had more fun if I closed a door on my hand. Who has to insist?
