Nothing but the directors' youthful fantasy comes to life. This 'movie' is nothing more than an excuse for the director / actor to play kissy face with an attractive young woman who would never give him the time of the day. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, the direction is non-existent and the film draws while the actor / director / writer / narrator tells. Don't be fooled by the 'X' rating, there are no nudity and minimal gore.
