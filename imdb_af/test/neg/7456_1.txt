I ... I don't know where to start. Dragon Hunt may be the worst movie in film history. Even Anus Magilicutty was better than that, because it was deliberately bad. Showgirls? No, this had the kitsch value and was technically a good movie. But Dragon Hunt takes the cake, eats it, and vomits it again and feeds it to a homeless man. It's so much of a travesty. <br /> <br /> The acting, if it can even be called, is rough. It does not have the charm of improvised acting, so it has to be written, but it is demanded with an almost malicious tone of poor quality. Several lines have been delivered in a way that the actors (or basically those on the screen) have, or they regret being linked to this movie, or thinking of a particularly humorous joke of Saturday Night Live they watched before looking in front of them. the camera. I can write three more paragraphs about the quality of acting in this movie, but you and I don't want to hear it. <br /> <br /> The makeup and special effects (which with most movies are the only good thing) were laughable. The antagonist, whose name is so ridiculous that I can't remember, glued a Mohawk to the top of his head. Yes, glued to his head. And you can also say it's glued. If you look at the place where it comes to its pockmarked skull, you can see a plastic strip, other than on false eyelashes. Fortunately, he is pretty much the only example of makeup no-nos in the movie. <br /> <br /> There are also some terrible character development to lighten it. The women, who are strangely harassed by so-called benevolent fugly brothers (and I mean, they're really pushed) are not just ugly, but ... ... they don't know what they're doing! In one scene, they turn their seemingly lovers, join in the more ugly guy and then cut some coke. Apparently they managed to get their hands on a very good cocaine because they started shaking and even laughing before it all got their nose up. Great timing girls! In addition, they carry some really horrible things, clothes that were exclusively in the late 80's and early 90's. <br /> <br /> Overall this movie, this movie, this waste of movie I have to say is also a waste of time. If you see it, it will hurt you, and the suspension of not only your faith but also your whole brain will be needed. If you want to be stoned with your friends and have good laughs, see if you can get this movie (you will probably have to download it) or you don't even think about it. Hope I was helpful.
