The future of fantasy never looked so dark! Christopher Lambert gets the evil demon Grendel to fight in this grim, surprising fantasy epic. "Email" did I say? There is only one place, so you can't actually call it an adventure, can you? The location is a medieval / futuristic 5 inch tall castle, so how did they catch up with all the actors? Oh, I get it, those where special effects. A miniature. Silly me. <br /> <br /> Here are some reasons you might want or don't want this movie: <br /> <br /> - Lambert gets his sword-waving tricks back as he did. in Highlander. <br /> <br /> - The sets and costumes are incredibly cool (if you are 12 years old). <br /> <br /> - Rhona Mitra has a mature pair of claws that she likes to show throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> - ... there, Christopher Lambert has white hair ... <br /> <br /> - Every time they start fighting, overwhelming technological soundtrack is going on. So why fight this medieval brave while they have to dance. <br /> <br /> - They don't have electricity in this castle, but they have speakers that look good. So where's the amplifier? I think they borrowed it from the techno-dj that delivered the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> - Watch it for the climax in the end, which contains an outrageous demonic CGI creature that comes straight from any Playstation 2 survival horror game. <br /> <br /> If it's all for you, check it out (at your own risk), but don't tell anyone I told you I strongly suspect that Pinhead visits the set while shooting, because this movie has no soul. Anyway, if you want to see a beautiful Rohna Mitra, you actually see a little skin, then watch Paul Verhoeven's HOLLOW MAN.
