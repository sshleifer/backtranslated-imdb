Imagine the most cleaved B movie horror plot you can. Add more plot holes than plot. Written by a 10-year-old. Do the play done by A-Level drama students, who perform really bad American accents (in the Isle of Man!). Add sample special effects that would appreciate the lovers of B&W Dr Who. Result: duff movie. Throw Samantha Janus out of her clothes (make a point on the cover) and you'll probably sell enough copies to make a profit anyway!
