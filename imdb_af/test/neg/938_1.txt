Seen this as part of the DC Reel Affirmations Film Festival. I hope they have better movies than this, because this movie could not deliver on any of the hopes that the audience entertained. From the fantasy of seeing James Franco without his shirt, to simpler wishes, such as decent acting, coherent direction, character development or real production values. As a result of film school effects such as freezers to show emotional distress moments and obvious influences ranging from My Own Private Idaho to Terminator 2, this film has failed virtually every level to engage the audience. After the first twenty minutes trying to take it seriously, the audience jointly threw his hands and just started enjoying the inherent madness of the movie. I was upset that I paid nine dollars to see it, and it was two hours that I never returned, but on the other hand it was an entertaining two hours. I will never come back again. It would have been a classic Mystery Science 3000 episode.
