Very poor quality and the acting is just as bad. This movie is an excellent example of contemporary England and the mindset. There is no mention of Jesus in this movie, nor does the film have any form of Christian Scripture as most know it. <br /> <br /> I'm also very surprised that this movie is a BBC program and the BBC has been informed of their quality programming, but it seems the BBC's attempt at Hollywood psychology / drama movie to rival completely failed. <br /> <br /> Poor acting, poor plot, poor culture without religion. I won't even bother it, but better to try to rent or buy this one when it goes to the 2 dollar bin.
