I saw some atrocities of cinema. Over the past few years, producers and directors seem to be bowing to making films that approach me and drive closer to madness. Hannibal was no exception. I didn't expect much when I went to see the movie. The book was ludicrous and the saying, "The Book is always better than the movie", did not assure me that this movie would be nothing but garbage. But what I saw was a movie that made all other bad movies look better in comparison. <br /> <br /> Usually, if I see a terrible movie, I find myself more amused than anything else. Unfortunately, I can't even laugh at the sad excuse for a Hannibal movie. The movie was filmed with promise, I think. It had Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore and Gary Oldman. And for directing there was Ridley Scott. There were movies with considerably less talent that were terribly better. There was so much that I would have cut from this movie, that I doubt anything had happened. It was pathetic. The storyline was so ridiculous that it seemed like a complete idiot wrote it. What's even worse is that the book is even crazy, and there were some scenes that were too bad to be included. It is sad in the case of a movie where <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER AHEAD *** <br /> Ray Liotta's brain is boiled in pieces. That scene made me cry more than any other, because it has plagued its predecessor at such a monumental level. Silence of the Lambs was one of my favorite movies of all time. But Hannibal was a two hour plus joke. This movie should only be watched if people want to learn how not to write a good movie.
