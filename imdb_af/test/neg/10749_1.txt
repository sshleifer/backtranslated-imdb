I do not differ 100% from the reviewer who is 100% different from the reviewer. He gave this short film an "F" grade. The fact that Joe Dante's lack of ability to pull another Howling out of his suit of tricks is obscured in the trouble of political propaganda. The Masters of Horror series was a phenomenal collection of truly horrible stories, except for this episode. <br /> <br /> Despite the awarding of those who want to promote it, it is a political slant, "Homecoming" is the least effective episode of MOH season one. Unlike the rest of the series, Dante's entry is a parody of the genre, not only of horror and humor in the ham-fisted delivery of a cut political point. <br /> <br /> Dante can only get the blame for this stinker pulling off the shelf because it wasn't his creation. The zombie subgenre is very popular this decade, and under the crop of predictable George Romero tributes and turbulent fantasies are a number of works designed to push political or (exciting) messages. Such works are not written by or intended for true horror fans. Perhaps Dante is not a master of horror either. What has he had since The Howling? <br /> <br /> If you want a lame anti-war zombie movie, with a few pop culture references that are beyond humor, it's possible that Homecoming is just your thing. If you're a horror fan, look for something masterful, get ... most other episodes of the series. My personal favorite was Dario Argento's "Jenifer," loosely on a classic comic short by Bruce Jones and Berni Wrightson's team.
