A pretty interesting start, some nice scenes in sixteenth-century Japan, and a promising idea. But the performance? The equation that emerges after about fifteen minutes is "Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death." Really. A specialist in "Eastern history" who does not speak Japanese, is tatami without removing her shoes, and is usually silly like celery? Please. It looks like a student movie: the sets are risible, the acting (except perhaps for the title character) close to wood, the plot completely random. At least "Cannibal Women" was funny! It is best viewed with someone who knows something about Japan, just to watch disbelief that creeps over their face.
