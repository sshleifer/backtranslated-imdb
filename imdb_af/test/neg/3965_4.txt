A man is pulled from a London street and taken to a foreign country where he is tortured as a terrorist suspect. Dull, banal movie bored hell out of me. More an idea than a movie. I was halfway into this 77 minute movie when I realized I had no idea who anyone was on the screen. It was as if they had taken every other similar film and took out all the ideas and placed them in one place without the true understanding of character. True, it is good with passion, but there is no emotional center. There is only one kind of thing that the filmmakers feel is enough. It's not. And while the story lies ahead in theory, important as a warning, the movie is sowing to convince anyone, especially if someone has seen the other, better movies of a similar ilk (for example with Reese Witherspoon)
