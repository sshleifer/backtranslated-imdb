I'm a big fan of zombie movies and it's just a pathetic effort at one. I find the best features of zombie flicks the sense of solidarity and the need to survive. This movie is more focused on "Let's just make it". The movie was full of bad acting and even worse special effects. When the zombies come out of the floor and the man takes off, there is blood just jumping out of the hole. I was not aware that holes in aircraft floors are so bleeding. And the original zombie lady, Kelly or something, showed the worst acting I've ever seen when she woke up and got sick. I laughed pretty much when she died. I earned it in every way possible. <br /> <br /> I was a little confused why dr. Kelly could talk after he became a zombie, but then there was nothing spoken by another zombie, as it screamed and screamed annoyingly. And they seem to kill the zombies fairly effectively by shooting them in the stomach, but then dr. Bennett from the plane and being abolished in the engine and removing most of his lower half, can still live at the end. br /> <br /> I felt they had changed things to make a "good" scene. Then one of the bitchy girlfriends (I didn't take the time to get to know their names. They played a useless role) in the bathroom. She was attacked by a zombie behind the mirror. Was it a two-way mirror to watch Mile-High Clubbers? I have never broken a mirror on an airplane (accident and everything), but I doubt there is so much room behind, with the brand new space of the real bathroom and everything. <br /> <br /> The few redeeming features were too late, unfortunately. One thing the movie went to was the smoking flights, but they felt they had to kill everything but one. And I will admit that I laughed at damn when the old lady settled on Frank's arm and said, "She'll kill me," or something to the extent. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I'm sorry I wasted my nine dollars on this movie. The fact that I bought it less means it, but still ... It has failed at so many levels. Stick with Dawn of the Dead and 28 days later.
