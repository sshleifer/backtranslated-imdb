Of course, I watched the MST3K version of it, but it's not really bad, at least compared to others who deserve my cinematic hate. <br /> <br /> The story is about a troubled girl being sent to a "reform" school "Girls' Town. Along the way, races, salvation and rudeness (unintended) happen. The story and acting is a bit flat, just like the action, but the whole thing is actually entertaining to some extent if you're absolutely bored. <br /> <br /> Overall, just a simple sub-par 50 movie, but far from the worst movie ever made, with some bright spots in the movie (The Ave Maria sequence was good for me). <br /> <br /> If you get a chance to get the MST3K version look, you will not be disappointed by it yourself, not so much, but I can think of worse methods of torture ("nail somebody?").
