This movie was terrible. If it was never made, the world would be a better place. Come on, a flying wagon? What do they think? It was a horrific hook sub movie and I would like to have a written apology from the studio it produced, along with a few cookies to help me pay for the time I spent on this shit party can never return. If you paid to watch this movie, I was really sorry because I watched it on TV on Sunday afternoon when I had nothing better to do and it almost ruined me all week. A flying freaking WAGON?!?! And is it supposed to compensate for a terrible mother who cares more about her own needs than her children? No wonder they do not have enough sense to tell someone he is hitting them, their mother teaches them nothing, but what she wants comes before all. Absolutely terrible.
