The first thing I notice is the music. It's nothing as wonderful as Ruggero Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust's haunting theme or the masterpiece waltz of a story of two sisters, but I don't stop it so early in the movie. <br /> <br /> One should assume that the woman who was investigating her hypothesis for her PHd dissertation that was cannibalism as an organized practice has never existed. One would think they should keep in mind that they are wrong and prepare for the trip. Or why isn't it going to happen if you already believe the hypothesis to be true before being tested? It is pretty incredibly ignorant and makes the movie so much more unrealistic and badly written. <br /> <br /> It's actually similar to the Ruggero Deodato's movie, just totally unprepared. No guns, no decent walking clothes, just nonsense through and through. <br /> <br /> People are not traveling like this for college without months of planning and preparation. <br /> <br /> But I'm excerpting ... <br /> <br /> Things don't come for a very good start for us brave, but stupid adventurers, as they miss a legendary jaywalking. It's on the way, then to fall into a mud hole, and I think it's time to walk. <br /> <br /> Well then they flip a coin to see if they keep or forget the whole thing. How does the scene even make sense? All their conviction rests on the flip of a coin? After spending time, money and preparation, they just have to be there. It just gets worse. Much of the worst acting and essay and music ever confronted by the film industry. <br /> <br /> Mike talks about how he and his friend's plots were captured and in mud pits in 3-inch long leeches sucking on their blood. I found it interesting, because if you remember the first cannibal, they walk in the jungle, a man who makes them a simple indigenous mistake, sit on the ground and eat such leeches ... wonder if they are the same? Actually, this movie is just awful because the horror is terrible and the play is emotional in light of the content. They just agree to remove themselves, rather than being eaten by cannibals, because that is not a big decision. <br /> <br /> Of course Mike is insane, but just like in the first movie, they treat the natives with such terrible behavior. This is simply unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Ruggero Deodato's movie easily feels that the Americans have what they deserve, while in this movie they can hardly blame the natives for what the Americans once again attack. <br /> <br /> As a result, the movie feels somewhat useless. We already got the point of the first movie, so why was the successor made? The lieutenant's name is Rizzo? Can it get worse? Often with movies like this when you look at the role you find, they haven't really acted in many other movies, and their bios are all but non-existent. So you can imagine I was surprised to find Giovanni Lombardo Radice in this movie. in Scorsese's New York gangs. Now Lt looks like. Rizzo known and I found that he was in the 2002 movie Spiderman as a very small role as a tugboat captain. Remind me how William Shatner became the USS Enterprise Admiral to a police spokesman. Irony, sometimes irony works. Shatner could never get the music, until his recent album "Has Been" is really good, just as Bono of U2 could never get a haircut, and Dan Marino could never win Superbowles. <br /> <br /> Sometimes irony is just sad, like Christopher Reeve, Superman can't walk irony. The man would always be a legend because he was such a good man. Again, I am renewing. <br /> <br /> At this point you can say I'm pretty bored to even discuss Cannibal Ferox. <Br /> <br /> The Cannibal Holocaust's message was about who the rights are cruel and what is really angry? What makes the cruelties of natural life unknown to our moral records, or what we do with others with malicious intent? Cannibal Ferox's message seems to be "Be careful what you're looking for, because you can only find it." I'll tell Cannibal Ferox. When Gloria returns and writes her dissertation, claiming that cannibalism does not exist, she saves others who would be curious and go where angels are scared, but overall this film is really bad. <br /> <br /> *** / 10
