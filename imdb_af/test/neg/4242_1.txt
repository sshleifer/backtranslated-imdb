Playmania is extremely boring. This is the basis of the show. Mel or Shandi ask extremely easy questions that a 2 year old can answer at a very slow pace. This show lasts two hours and they probably only play about 10 games in that period. People like this show because the hosts are eyeball, but they are totally destroyed by the fact that they are so friggin annoying. <br /> <br /> During the show, they mention that we need more players a million. stop. The top 5 recordings they make are about 20 minutes out of the show. This show is probably one of the worst games ever made. One of the reasons they probably don't have callers is because the show is so cheap with the money. Most of the money I have ever seen was $ 210. I will not be surprised if this "match show" is canceled by the end of 2006.
