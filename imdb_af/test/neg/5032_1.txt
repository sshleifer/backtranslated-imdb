I watched this movie on TV yesterday. I just finished reading the book in which the film was supposedly based. In the opening credits, it said: "This is a free adaptation of the Eça de Queirós novel". I had to switch off my TV at that moment. <br /> <br /> Vera Sacramento's idea of ​​"free adaptation" makes a story about the influence of the church on people and the hypocrisy of people in the late 19th century in a story about sex. In fact, the only thing she adopted in the novel was the genitals, which are only mentioned lightly in Eça de Queirós's novel. And of course, the name of some characters. <br /> <br /> Of the characters, in the novel, were Amélia and João Eduardo victims of the influence of the church. Amélia was seduced by Father Amaro and all the time she was controlled by him. João Eduardo, her fiancee, was extinguished by the priests because he dared to criticize them. In this movie, Amélia seduces everyone she meets and Father Amaro is just another victim. João Eduardo is a drug dealer and illegal weapon. <br /> <br /> Vera Sacramento has changed a novel that criticizes moral costumes of an era and changes it into just another movie with many (bad) sex. Worse still, her story was completely empty of ideas. Two wasted hours! Eça de Queirós certainly did not deserve it.
