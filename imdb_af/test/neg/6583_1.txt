Much like Final Fantasy, if you look at a silent shot, it doesn't look that bad. But when people start moving, it's really terrible. Uneven rugged movements, terrifying lack of emotion and lack of a sense of life in the face give me the creep. The characters don't even appear ALIVE / organic. <br /> <br /> I saw a preview show at my daughter, who actually fell asleep! She wasn't busy at all. For the record, I thought she could easily be engaged by both Pixar-esque movies and some of the bad 2D movies like Sinbad. <br /> <br /> The lighting is painful and gives the kids the look. to hold a flashlight under their chin at a campfire. The lip synchronization is bad - actually worse than Final Fantasy. <br /> <br /> I also seriously ask Hanks to play five characters. It was a great distraction in the movie. The role of the conductor is ominous - although I just can't figure it out. It reminds me of my dad's false "phone" voice when greeting customers. <br /> <br /> I think that's why the multiple roles are distracting - you are aware that the voice is the same, but clearly different. It gives every character the feeling of being WORK rather than being true human characters. The illusion of reality is broken by Hanks' multiple role play. I saw the technique work - a lazy Eddie Murphy, but Hanks just can't get away with a voice alone, with the horrible animation. <br /> <br /> I won't waste my money - wait for the rent.
