I'm not sure why I like this movie so much. Maybe I'm too old or too male or too little. Just who was the target audience here? If you are and you like it, then I'm happy for you. Personally, I found it a bit of a pill. The characters were uninteresting and unattractive, the writing was just ashamed and some, though not all, of the acting were uninspired. Mawkish, boring and sometimes deceptive. Certainly there is something better. <br /> <br /> About a related issue: Why is it that when I see Chris Klein in a movie, I get a craving to slap him? Does anyone get it?
