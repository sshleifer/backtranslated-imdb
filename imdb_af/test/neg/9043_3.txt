I recently watched a copy of this (entitled "Forget Alive"). Talk about scary! Any movie Ed Wood has ever exhibited, looks like Oscar material compared to this laughable tosh. To be honest, a few lines of scripture will remain in memory for a long time, such as: "These people (Cannibals) don't buy frozen meat from a supermarket like us, they get it fresh from people like you or every day." I. The crazy Jonesville type leader in the jungle was the best character in the movie, and he really looked like a neutral look and I think he was the only actor who shouldn't be baptized in (bad). American characters in their movies, why don't they get Americans to speak in the dialogue, instead of English people trying their best to sound like Annie Oakley, I'll give this 3 out of 10, I'll give it three because it's really harder than most comedies from these days.
