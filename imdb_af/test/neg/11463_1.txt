I realize that most people do not know who Solomon Kane is and that the film is placed at that much larger audience. But then, why does it first save 'Solomon Kane' if the name doesn't have marketable value? The characters certainly have nothing to do with the R.E. Howard character. Except he has a big hat. This is where the agreements end. <br /> <br /> It is always a bad sign when any superhero / fantasy / sci-fi movie hangs on an original story, but if you have one whole piece of cloth like this for a character who doesn't Not one thing, you missed the point completely. Kane is no longer the fanatical Christian warrior of the stories, but rather a former bad man who tries to save his soul (this part is in the opening scene). <br /> <br /> With the most basic character elements changed or simply ignored, the use of the name Solomon Kane is simply confusing. Is it just so they can say, "From the creator of Conan" and hope to join an emerging franchise if the new Conan movie comes off the ground? If I ignore the complete departure of the stories, the movie is capable of being completely generic for the first half, but then it is divided into the climactic scene. It involves multiple super bad things (think three "boss levels" at the same time) is the least bit interesting or threatening. <br /> <br /> If I wasn't a Kane fan who was disappointed that they had completely ignored the source material, I would probably give the movie a 3 or 4 instead of 1 Even for the (majority of ) viewers who come in here know nothing about Kane, it's pretty thin gruel.
