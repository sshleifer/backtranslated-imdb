For an indie movie, it's probably a bit better than a 3 out of 10, but in general it just gets 3. The effects are not terrible and they have at least some adults who play adult roles rather than all children . Indie low budget horror movies do. The acting is a lot of wood, but at least they have a better display than some movies in the harmful budget category. It's filmed in a building rather than a friend's basement. The plot as a whole is not the worst. It's a Resident Evil rip off over an evil corporation that enters a small town and outbreaks people into zombies. I'd like to have seen some kind of creature rather than the big bath, is just a "super" zombie. I'm not trying to write spoilers, but this review has one so be warned !! WASTE WARNING !!! Not only do some of the role-players seem to just move about the zombies (the same is repeatedly reclaimed, but they have at least 5 people playing). But one of the plots doesn't really flow with me. The deputy coming in appears to be on the evil corporate payroll. He killed one of the other employees in cold blood and then met the head of a bad guy in an office talking about cleaning up the mess. The deputy just showed us that he is also a very bad person and speaks as if he could clean it up (meaning all surviving witnesses were killed) no problem. But then 2 seconds later he helped them out. There was no true "change of heart" emotion or anything to make me feel that this bad man of an innocent man just killed a few minutes ago and then spoke that everyone didn't have a problem to be their savior no. There was no incident or something to make me buy. Worth checking out if you're a fan of low budget flicks, otherwise you won't enjoy it.
