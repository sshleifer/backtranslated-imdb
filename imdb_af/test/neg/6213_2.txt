This movie was recommended to me so we went along. I won't call it a movie, it's more like a combination of 10 different unfinished, illogical stories that aren't so funny. There are several characters in the movie that look important in the beginning, and they just disappeared from the story. He just tries too hard to fit everything within 2 1/2 hours. I left the show without wondering what happened to this and the guy. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is just an extended version of "Hitch", filled with many more characters and dancing. <br /> <br /> If this is the best movie this couple ever made, then I'm pretty sure I'm not interested in any of their previous kids.
