Naked Deanna Troi! <br /> <br /> Richie's brother Chuck (from "Happy Days") with a reverse mohawk! <br /> <br /> Death Wish 3 has all this and more, including one clever scene where Chuck Bronson's character is set. a mouse-like device that breaks a punk when it opens the window. <br /> <br /> Chuck also puts a plate of nails on the floor near another window and smiles as he returns and sees bloody footprints turning away. <br /> <br /> All I can say about Death Wish 3 is that it is one of the most incomprehensible "serious" movies I've ever seen. Use of military weapons to cut punks. <br /> <br /> As I understand it, Bronson has denied this movie, but fortunately the check from Golan Globus paid. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy quality movies, avoid this one, but if you're in a cheap Jackass kind of excitement, it goes out.
