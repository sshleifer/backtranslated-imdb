I saw this movie when it was first released in Pittsburgh Pa. I traveled from Youngstown Ohio, a distance of about. 85 miles. I didn't know anything about the plot or the players. I didn't read any reviews or talked to anyone who saw them. Believe me, I will never make the mistake again. It is argued, I believe, as the first movie film filmed in the new 3D process. That was what led me to make a 170 mile trip. <br /> <br /> There was a two-line waiting line that I (2) stretched 2Â½ blocks and moved very slowly. I can wait to sit out loud. If only I knew at that moment what I would know soon, I could have gone from the road back to Youngstown by the time the function started. <br /> <br /> By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I've already clipped. The novelty was fast thin and from then on it was pure pain. <br /> <br /> Without going into turbulent details, I can only offer the following advice. If you've ever seen the well-known movie PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly filmed the worst movie ever, it's in my humble opinion head and shoulders above this garbage. <br /> <br /> I don't know if it ever showed on TV, if I know why. If you ever get the chance to see it, do something else. Take a step, cut the grass, wash the dog, someone hit you with a rubber hose. Anything. Your time will be better spent. <br /> <br /> This was my first movie review. It may be my last, unless a worse movie comes together and I won't make a book that will happen. <br /> <br /> Bill <br /> <br />
