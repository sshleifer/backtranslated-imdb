The film is apparently based on a popular French horror novel, by Arthur Bernède, from 1927. Not that I ever heard it, but Belphégor was previously a popular subject for movies and mini-series. The first film was released in 1927, along with the novel. Arthur Bernède was part of a group of writers who simultaneously wrote and produced films and novels. The character Belphégor is one of his best-known creations. <br /> <br /> Once, Sophie Marceau was a promising new European actress who would conquer Hollywood. However, she has now returned to movies like this. Nothing wrong to play in French quality movies, as this is the country she came from, but this movie is just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The problem is mostly that the movie relies on its special effects, to make the movie good and scary. Well, horror and special effects were never really a good combination, but with a few exceptions here and there. It is not as if the special effects are bad in this one. Especially for a European movie it's just fine, but it's just misplaced, because the movie has the feeling it could easily do without its effect. It would actually have made the movie a better and frightening one to watch, no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> The movie is not always tense or tempting to look at, as the movie has problems choosing the right approach. Sometimes the movie plays a light and less serious approach, while others try to be a horror movie. This is mostly the reason why the movie doesn't work out at any level. You can say the movie is a bit boring. It also gets worse after the end. After a while you just stop for this movie and its story and start with the wish that you have decided to look something else instead. <br /> <br /> Editing is completely down. It uses too fast cuts, without much style, while the quick editing was obviously meant to give the movie a good, modern style. Also, the timeline was just blown up, as if some rows were edited in the wrong order. <br /> <br /> The musical score is also very annoying and sometimes it doesn't even sound like the movie, as if it had been a long time before the movie was shot. I can't believe composer Bruno Coulais is an Oscar nominated composer. The musical score is almost as annoying as the movie that has its sound effects. <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with many characters, but you just can't care anymore. It also seems very unlikely that a woman like Sophie Marceau would ever fall for a man like Frederic Diefenthal. The movie also features Julie Christie, who is nice, but doesn't add much to the movie. <br /> <br /> A horrible watch. <br /> <br /> 3/10
