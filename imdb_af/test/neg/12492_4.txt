I have a lot of mr. Amitabh Bachan's role of SARKAR expected, but I'm disappointed. Being a Ram Gopal Verma's was not right for this kind of movie. Sarkar is supposed to be a strong character, but the film shows that Amitabh is too dependent on other power rather than she. There is a movie in Tamil called Nayakan based on the theme of GOD FATHER and Kamala Hassan starred. The movie is well directed and the power to the end stays in the hands of Kamala Hassan, not his son. Amitabh Bachan seems to be helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of changing things. The movie fails to show the strong impact of God Father.
