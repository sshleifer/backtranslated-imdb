Brodzki's creation is a good example of how NOT to make a movie. First there was a book written with a good sense of humor. Book that has many fans who would like to help when producers, for some reasons, decide to use people who have hardly heard of the book in the first place. Then a script came as humorous and full of nonsense as possible. At the same time, the script was written in a way to allow only those who actually read the books to understand anything from the plot. Not that anything in this movie made any sense at all (for example, "I'm like a ice shield. You can burn yourself," Yennefer said as a warning. Warning that logic is something that this movie is seriously missing ). To add to this, we must mention that regardless of the amount of money allegedly spent on the movie, everything looks like an amateur production with two (2) computer effects, one of which is a penetrating dragon. Even the costumes seem to have been borrowed from a very poor theater. That's the better that looks like. And besides, we have a few "bare screens" that are just there so they will be in the movie, because they have no explanation on what one can merely call a plot. The movie has only one power that can hardly make the rest - music is not bad. Although if I choose, I prefer it separately. It sounds better if you don't have to look at this superproduction failure.
