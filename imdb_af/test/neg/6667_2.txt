This film looks at the suffering a family experiences when a child dies, and the healing that can eventually come to them. <br /> <br /> The family learns about the death of their son at Christmas, 1991, ruining the Christmas season for them. They don't celebrate it again for many years. There is an interesting remark by the girl who will remind viewers to consider the needs of surviving children in such a situation. <br /> <br /> The Matthew character refers to Jesus, but I suspect that other comments he makes come from non-Christian sources. I wonder if any other viewers will recognize this comment. If so, it would be an interesting addition to the data on this movie.
