This SOFT soft-core / sci-fi B movie is what you want if you've taken an early Fred Olen Ray movie and exhausted the fun. Or vice versa, it's like your Boll movie, but without so much dissatisfaction. A young boyfriend guy (C.C. Costigan) agrees to sit as a space crew to stop the crazy Kim Dawson's plans of ... with anyone apparently having sex with everyone. Anyone who has gone into this movie is looking for serious science fiction. Well, you have what you deserve to do at home. First of all, Kim Dawson ever stared at something other than soft core Skinamax power. For a look at the CV's for Costigan and the Director before saying a hissy fit that you expected otherwise. Don't get me wrong, because for a space / action / soft core / titillation movie, this movie is not good yet, but if you expected something in the line of "Contact", I don't regret you . <br /> <br /> My Degree: D- <br /> <br /> Where I Seen It: Starz-on-Demand (Available until December 8, 2005)
