Pretentious horror movie that resembles a soap opera, is about a drug that sends you to a fantasy world hiding strange creatures. The movie has some good images, but its strange mix of what's really and not going. Worse are the vague statements in the voice of one of the characters. It seems to be a more serious, more meaningful movie, but I don't think they even came into the serious or meaningful area to start. So try to sell. The meaning comes from silly. There is not much to say, people are talking, drugs have visions ... they talk a lot more. It's not bad as much as useless and boring. The sowing is sin here and the reason you want to avoid it.
