For a Norris movie it's pretty easy. For an action movie, it's a bit dull, and as far as predictability goes, my friend and I are leaving almost every turn of this movie. It was nice that the killer's movements were not engraved by the click's 80 action movies, but come on, but the only predictable move is the plot and the editing. Mainly, it is said early that the killer (Jack O'Halloran, who is one of the few little-known actors) is just killing women. Yes, he suddenly keeps his M.O. and dead men, huh? I think it can somehow be explained and rationalized, but why was the movie edited to show that he was going to kill women ?? <br /> <br /> Again, I'm sure there's a reason (ie to build up tension), but why spend the time watching it when many other stressed movies are much better. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Renegade" can enjoy the smaller cameo by Branscombe Richmond as Victor, but his short appearance cannot save the movie and even a voice of 4 looks yellow. <br /> <br />
