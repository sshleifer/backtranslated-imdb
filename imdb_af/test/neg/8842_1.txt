I look at all the good reviews about this movie and I start thinking about myself ... am I crazy ..? Can't I see the beauty of a movie like this? Am I just silly enough to NOT understand the message this movie is trying to point out? I do not know. Perhaps one of those lizards came in my head and ate my brain as well. The movie idea was nowhere ... I was sure it would have a foggy end, and of course ... it did! Nothing exceptional. Not even the landscapes (I jumped in a mountain village. At least the landscapes would be nice but no). Just a lame story about a crazy teacher, and of course, her crazy students ... now all great, each with their own firm ideas. And boy, some of those ideas were stupid. For example, the lizard story. At one moment I thought I had looked at x files with the lizard entering the ear. No. From my point of view, this movie is a waste of time (not saying money if you pay for the ticket). The only part I liked was the action of the young blue eye "German" child ... He played very well and convincingly for his age ... The rest ... nothing! I read the previous review and I think the scriptwriter and director were both on drugs when they turned up the ideas. Well, there are many people who enjoyed this movie. I think again to myself. Maybe I'm crazy. Advice .. Don't waste your time with it!
