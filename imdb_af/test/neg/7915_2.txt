... because it's another dead one. Lifeless voice performances, two-day animation, confronted and incredible songs (although the little singer would have been dignified by devil Tim Curry) and a weaker plot than Land Voor Time 99: Parade Fossils <br /> <br /> I have to admit, I didn't see the first movie. I'm not a big fan of movies that include heaven or dogs, especially not in combination. Yet I hope to see the first one soon, because there was a reason why someone would create such a divine successor. <br /> <br /> If I didn't get this movie for free, I wouldn't. For a 'heaven' flick, the only good thing in this was the devil. 10/02.
