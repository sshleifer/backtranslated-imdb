A severe decline for the puppets in this mainly boring and boring outing. Guy Rolfe, as fantastic as Andre Toulon in part three, barely has this time and Richard Band's fantastic melody appears with the dolls a few minutes after the movie. For the start of the movie we are introduced to the caretaker of the Bodega Bay Inn (Gordon Currie) and some of his youth friends (many of the role players are Canadians and are all very good at unfortunately rather inexorable roles - Teresa Hill is quite nice) . Totems, minions of the Egyptian God Sutek want to live the secret of animation back and the dolls (when they are surfacing) with a previously unprecedented cunning to destroy the ugly and huge computer game that Totems is trying to destroy. The totems just complicate the series and derive from the things that made the series so unique. They do not share the wonderful beauty of the puppets and therefore do not really fit in. Top-notch is Pinhead with a cloth to clean blood from Tunnelaars drill bit, classic and most prettiest this movie goes. The fifth film was filmed simultaneously with this one so expecting similar parts of mediocre and a Toulon show that was apparently filmed in another era (or even the galaxy). Guy Rolfe earned better and series of fans definitely didn't. Grrrrrrr.
