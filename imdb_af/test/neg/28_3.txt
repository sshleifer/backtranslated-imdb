Rita Hayworth plays a Brooklyn nightclub dancer named Rusty, specializing in Christmas cake choirs; She managed to get herself on the front page of a national fashion magazine, but her approaching success as a solo (with romantic presentations everywhere) hit the boss, Gene Kelly. Strange tired piece of Technicolor cotton candy, with unmistakable musical sketches (the two worst being irrelevant flashbacks until the 1890s, with Hayworth showing her own grandmother). Kelly, as always, dances well but acts with false sincerity; When he is serious, he is impassable, and the rest of the time he flies on adrenaline. The script is a major weight, which doesn't even give the best players Phil Silvers and Eve Arden. * 1/2 of ****
