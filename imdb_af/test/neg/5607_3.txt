Rutger Hower fans Don't be FOOLED - he only plays a cameo in this movie and it's IT. This movie loses an extra point for that scam. I think Rutger Hower has a total of about 2 very short scenes and 2 very short voices. <br /> <br /> The female lead for this movie is beyond this poor material in looks and talent-she's great movie is a dog and she's messed up. The story is of a lawyer who hopes one day on the partnership and hopes that he will sail the boss's cousin all over the country. They have several encounters on the road with different balls and this is the vehicle for a variety of sketches and the man who played Napoleon Dynamite is thrown into the mix as a sidebar. <br /> <br /> This is a road trip where extreme conditions are mastered by our oppressed hero and he is slowly weakening at the end of the movie, and it's not love big, teacher. <br /> <br /> Just look at this movie if you want to see a hot chick irritate a truck for an hour and a half in a truck.
