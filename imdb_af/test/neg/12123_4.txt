Think Jumanji, but with a death curse. A lot of surfer dudes get their hands on a game that takes the life of someone who plays it. This is thought to have been made by the witch's skin during the Spanish Inquisition and carries a nasty curse. <br /> <br /> Good, unbeatable and just such a visible story is nothing you haven't seen yet. First of all, it's a place you've done and the story that hits all the right buttons so far away that you have no real surprises. Far from the worst thing SyFy runs, but definitely not the best. There are better choices out there, but if it's your only choice, you won't hate it altogether.
