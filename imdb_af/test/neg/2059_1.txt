This movie is a disaster from beginning to end. 75 percent of the movie is made from scenes made from HERCULES & THE HAUNTED WORLD and HERCULES & THE CAPTIVE WOMEN, which are badly crafted with original scenes that add nothing but a complete rip-off. I am a big fan of the two movies and seeing scenes taken from them, re-entrusted and redesigned with nonsensical dialogue, turned my head. This kind of cheap producer tactic to make more money from unsuspecting audiences, basically killed the Sword & Sandal genre in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> There is one unforgettable scene in the new footage and this is the one when Hercules fights with the bad Hercules. The fight is definitely cool and Giovanni Cianfriglia, who plays Antaius, definitely comes out. He makes Herc a memorable mark. The rest, however, is an embarrassment that was probably shot in a day. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs!
