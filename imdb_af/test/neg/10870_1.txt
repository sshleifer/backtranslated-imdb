This movie is so bad, it's hilarious. I watched Hel Ride in half and thought it was a comedy, though I couldn't really work if they actually took the p * ss, or if it was really a serious effort to make something decent. I see it's not listed here as a comedy, so they should be serious! It seems to be basically about a gang of pensioners driving on motorcycles and shooting each other and exchanging the most hilarious bad dialogue you can imagine. One scene inexplicably has two characters that hit bottles over each other's heads, and show each other 'get out of prison free' cards they made! See also Vinnie Jones' accent, where hell is he meant to be?!? Oh, and there are also a few naked girls in it, who for some incomprehensible reason want nothing more than to have no sex with these leathery fur little tits! The man who wrote it - a Pee Wee Herman lookalike with a Greeshan 2000 beard and an orange sunbed-brown - for some reason cast itself into the lead. Maybe it's part of the joke, I don't know. Actually, the more I think about it, the more I'm sure this movie is taking a p * ss. It was manufactured by Quentin Tarantino and it is possible that he released it in humor as a bit of a laugh. It is a total ripe of Tarantino's style, but only really done very badly. However, it is very amusing, and I think it can also be a cult classic, whether it is an amusing Tarantino / Rodriguez style parody, or something very unintentionally funny. Must be seen to be believed.
