Legend has it that at the gala show of the Hollywood premiere of 2001: A Space Odyssey, about 20 minutes in the film, shouted Rock Hudson: "Will anyone tell me what the hell is in this movie?"

Are there any rules for Quintet? Was Robert Altman and his cohorts on the movie while they were going? What did Paul Newman think of signing this? Perhaps, o 'Fast Eddie saw Zardoz and thought, "Well, if Connery can get involved in a futuristic movie that doesn't make sense, I can too." Perhaps the good things on the floor of the cutting room and all we see are the incoherent things. Also, all the throws have retained their individual funny hats? You have never seen such bizarre body hats in one place in your life. Quintet just confirms what I always thought: when Altman is good, he is wonderful, but if he is bad, he makes things like Quintet
