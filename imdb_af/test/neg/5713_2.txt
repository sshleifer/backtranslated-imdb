How about this movie? Does Mr. Lyne and his authors think that a sado-masochistic raft between two refurbished Yuppies can have a movie? Perhaps if it has some comic elements (it is not, at least deliberately), or there were some additional dramatic elements (which are not), or perhaps if it was difficult. No, it's just the history of the matter; a chronology of a lot of R-rated trysts. Ho-hum, who cares? "Nine Â½ weeks" deserves every Razzie nomination it received. This is a loser. <br /> <br /> And, incidentally, how about Roger Ebert and his rave review? Where was his head back in 1986?
