This is the movie that is somewhat based on Rob Halford's exit from the British Metal Gods Judas Priest and how the band replaced him with Ripper Owens, who was previously a priest's tribute. Originally titled Metal God this movie could have been something good. Instead, someone in an office who knows nothing about metal music decides to water it down. From the title change of Metal God to the 'safe' middle of the road 'Rock Star' to the lame soundtrack, this movie plays badly. After spending most of my life in a professional metal band, I was looking forward to seeing it. I dropped a lot of points from the movie. The soundtrack is not very metal for one, and the end of the movie is also lame. The movie does have some bright points in the writing and acting, but as a whole, it fails in the end, because ... 1) A movie based on a metal band should have a metal soundtrack. 2) There's nothing metal about Marky Mark or Jennifer Aniston. As Bon Jovi, Warrant, Def Leppard and Poison your idea of ​​'heavy metal' is going to look at this movie. As Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Dio & Black Sabbath is your idea of ​​metal, see this movie for a good laugh.
