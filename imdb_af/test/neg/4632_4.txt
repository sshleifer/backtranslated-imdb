History and experience over the past few decades have shown us that intellectuals talking about sex are about the most sexy and countless thing anyone can do, but it wasn't quite so obvious in 1986. The idea in this movie is basically that these characters drive insatiable to find comfort, security and pleasure in sexual acts, is actually the unhealthy motive that makes them so unbearable to themselves - that they hide from themselves with more sex. This row is linked to "the decline of the American Empire", as expressed in an early interview within the film. <br /> <br /> So the idea is that relatively atrocious people talk about sex and that the talk is supposed to reveal how contemptible they are to people. Arcand at least keeps it on fire and gives momentum by doing interesting things with the camera, such as isolating most characters in single frames, revealing their ultimate loneliness, and cutting quickly between them, showing them more in war with each other if they are in agreement. And to give Arcand credit, that's exactly what intellectual life is, a constant struggle with other intellectuals to stick out, even though everyone knows that stands out means they stand alone. <br /> <br /> But yes, the characters and action are unsexy and kind of pathetic. I think this movie is much more an aspect of his time than it is something that is meant to keep that kind of dated. It is also the exact type of spiritual bow in dialogue and references to people like Susan Sontag who make art house films so unpopular about populist entertainment filmmakers. Anyway, I take it anyway - it basically has its place among the exact kind of people the characters are. It's just that it's not really interesting or important to anyone who isn't those characters. <br /> - PolarisDiB
