I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie. <br /> <br /> It's something I haven't done yet - I've never fallen asleep. <br /> <br /> I love the original and have seen it several times and recommended it to everyone. It may have been the problem, but I don't think so, because there were some bright spots that had shown to be right, they could have made this movie. <br /> <br /> Bette was under use and Anne was over. use and disregard. <br /> <br /> I don't know why English or anyone for that matter lets it go. <br /> <br /> They billed it as a Gender in the City, but better? I didn't have a chance to have a lot of sex in the city and was disappointed with this movie. <br /> <br /> So don't waste your money on this movie - go see anything else!
