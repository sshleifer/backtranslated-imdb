Good, it's a movie for kids, and it's not one of those movies that adults will enjoy as well. However, there are inadvertently funny moments, most of which include holes in the story. For example, the child needs a computer part to return his father, and he doesn't have the money. So, does he ask his father for the dough? No, he steals it and gets caught. Children, if I ever got invisible, I will progress your allowance, okay? Also, while this kid is at the police station (without a doubt being a criminal), his beautiful blonde teacher comes in, announcing who she is and where she works, then pushing the child out of the limbs before THE COPS! To make matters worse, instead of making a quick getaway, put them in the parking lot of the police station and lower their performance. You know, I hate to choose, but the child stole something and has to face the consequences, but maybe in this movie is punishment enough. You will avoid it!
