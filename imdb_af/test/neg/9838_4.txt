Here is a movie that was about 90% of pedestrians, that it didn't have the right to eventually become so challenging and frustrating. Did the director decide to become a author suddenly, 80% by making this movie? Yeesh. SPOILER ALERT Thing is typically enough for 50's youthful game; There are drifters, good girls, bad girls, gangs, the friendly old dinner manager, and the village crawling. Things follow the expected road for about 15 minutes before the end, when the only similar character is killed and the anti-hero is the fault (it would not be so unexpected if it was the main tomb of the movie ... but all this things start happening and unraveled during the final line! Major curve ball). Then things get strange; the friendly old codger forms a gang and hits the hero on a bloody pulp. The mere presence of the hero's friend somehow dragged a confession from the real killer - the nice, creepy town utility (which in any real universe he would have been the first to start, even if the anti hero found with her body). <br /> <br /> We have a somewhat poor "happy" ending, which is about as out of character with the rest of the movie as the events of the 10 minutes that precede it. br /> <br /> Even more strange is this film's insistence on playing homosexual innuendo to the hilt, but always put the two male lead straight ahead. Maybe it was deliberate. Perhaps Bix's resistance was to settle with the girl, more because of his sexuality (which had to be properly suppressed in the fifties and thus not discussed or even allowed by him) as his need for a "wanderer". If the director's intention was to turn it into a sexual thread - that the driver drifted because he felt he was sexually erased; that his paternal respect to Danny is not actually father, but spousal; that his inability to stay with Carrie is rooted in a sexual dislike that he doesn't even understand - it could be made clearer. Instead, we get this very bizarre alchemy of homosexuality and completely heterosexual behavior. <br /> <br /> These young men sleep next to each other, even when they can get a space to expand. When Danny is suggested (and once in bed with a woman), Bix flashes and takes him away. Danny pays Bix's way (sure, there's another explanation for that, but it still gets a chord when you see Danny Bix buying lunch). They end up at the end. Not since Hitchcock's "Toue" has homosexuality so blatant but denied. <br /> <br /> MST3K did the right thing by recording this one. Apart from Jack Elam, there is little to recommend the movie.
