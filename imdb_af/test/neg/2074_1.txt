As the other man said it was sux, you could count the words that were said in that whole movie on one of your hands. Too nudity, she had naked like 7 or 8 times in a 1 and a half, and beyond the nudity you will find a Porn behind the movie. He took her all movie long, bad acting, bad story, bad language, Carmen. She has sworn the movie for a long time, so get out of that movie, pornographic scenes and dirty language, A lot of gaps in the movie, a great silence now and then The only good thing in that movie is the beautiful places where it was shot , otherwise it will be an hour and a half of your life that you will waste, so if you go see that movie Strength This is really Sux
