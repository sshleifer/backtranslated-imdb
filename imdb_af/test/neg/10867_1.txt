The worse movie I've seen. Like the other honest judges, it's just an excuse to get naked birds with their juggies. Don't get wrong, naked women aren't a bad thing, but there's another movie genre. <br /> <br /> Boyfriend beware. I sold it to my girlfriend as a classic bike gang party (due to reviews) to be greeted with every other scene full of naked women boasting about the place. Fuck me the shit. <br /> <br /> What makes me laugh most is that all the doveyfiets that they had in the movie were full of models with the works cosmetic. What do they have? They are usually slightly haggard with tattoos and many softer juggies! Totally unrealistic. The play is terrible, very senseless curse and a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> Has anyone used Vinnie Jones' attempt to investigate a US accent? It's as embarrassing as his soccer skills. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the pest. The only reason you would watch this movie is if you are a young boy who does not have access to p @ rn and has cut it for some perverse kicks from their parents movie collection!
