Oh, how did I laugh .... it has everything ... an Asian / White family, a disabled Asian boy ... everything a healthy person should see in the eyes of the BBC. <br /> <br /> Which fullest trunk: It was a total insult to my eyes who considered this rubbish for one episode and ONE EPISODE. <br /> <br /> Thinking of some of the quality the BBC has released over the years (Fawlty Towers for example) and then it comes in. It's a disgusting shame. <br /> <br /> It's all about political correctness and is not at all humorous. <br /> <br /> This is straight from the bowels of hell: but what do you expect from the ultra-left BPC ... I mean the BBC.
