I can't believe I bought this movie on DVD. I don't even remember being shown on TV last year. Why in the world could they not only have made a real successor to one of the best Christmas movies ever? Damn and Randy Quaid looked like he was on the same drugs as Jerry Lewis. I didn't know about this movie until I bought it tonight and thought I'd check it out on IMDb and see how it was announced. Boy I made a mistake. If you are reading this review, stay away from it and just stay on the first Christmas holiday. Well, at least I don't pay more than $ 10 for it. Maybe I can turn it on and get half of it back at tower records. Then maybe not again. PS I haven't watched it yet, my DVD player tonight watched a wonderful movie, The Chronicles of Riddick (Unrated Director's Cut).
