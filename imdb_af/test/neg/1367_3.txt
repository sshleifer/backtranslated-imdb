"The Brotherhood of Satan" is a stupefying combination of conventional horror elements mixed with some imaginative characterization and direction (Bernard McEveety). It all starts with dad Charles Bateman (as Ben) riding with his beautiful blonde from the west: nice Ahna Capri (like Nicky) and daughter Geri Reischl (as K.T.). Things get better and better for the trio, as they approach the town of Hillsboro, which is seized by a satanic cult! <br /> <br /> If the dull traveler hits Hillsboro, the "action" switches to the movie's more interesting combination of characters: townies L.Q. Jones (as Pete, sheriff), Strother Martin (as Doc), Charles Robinson (as Jack, the priest), and Alvy Moore (as Tobey). Their interaction is sometimes fun. Soon enough it becomes very stupid, and predictable. Mr. Martin is the stand-out (as you would expect); He sees the possibility that a Satanic cult is a "cock-and-bull story", but is (of course) their leader. The "Come in, Children" end is mysterious; unless it was the original title of the movie.
