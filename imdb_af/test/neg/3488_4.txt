One thing I noticed about British horror movies from the 1970s is that they are not being held up for repeated viewing. THEATER BLOOD is a case in point like all the Amicus anthology flies. Add the painting to the cell. <br /> <br /> Much of the drama of this movie revolves around building a plot revelation at the end. Once you know what the revelation is, it becomes a fairly flat movie. It opens with a pretty good hook, but then we are treated to long-borne rows of two old ladies who make small talks. Correct me if I'm wrong, but how many people are watching a horror movie that some old ladies expect to make small talks? The only kind of interest found in THE BEAST IN THE CELLAR is the anti-smoking attitude. Some people mentioned that it is an anti-war or anti-military movie, but watch carefully and you will see that every time a squad is raising a flight, he is killed. Quite strange about the attitude of smoking, is almost as hysterical as they are today
