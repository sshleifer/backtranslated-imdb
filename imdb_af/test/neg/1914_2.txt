I watched it on cable because I was a great Leelee fan. Big mistake. What a terrible movie. You don't mind one bit for any of the characters in the movie. Chris Klein plays a guy who's been in the movie for a while, and steals Josh Hartnett's longtime friend. If the writer knew what they were doing, this film would have followed the proven formula, and Hartnett made an ass and Leelee as the girl trapped in a bad relationship, after which she was saved by Klein. But Hartnett is a very cool guy who shows Leelee a lot of void and love. <br /> <br /> Then you hate leelee because she cheats on Hartnett with Klein, who is in town, trying to help him and really sting. <br /> <br /> It's also a lot of champion, and the characters do everything but run around the kitchen dance and lip synchronization, and with hairbrushes and spoons and fake microphones (though they come very close). <br /> <br /> What a terrible movie. You don't even care about what ultimately happens, because the director never cares about the characters.
