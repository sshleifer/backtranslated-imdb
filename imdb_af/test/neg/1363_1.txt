This mess starts with a real tank running over a car between the pictures of a toy box. This is followed by a family who goes home from a birthday party without saying anything. The inexplicable tank and relentless family take up, I swear, over 10 minutes of film. Finally, the family sees a car after it was in a wreck and decides to report it to the proper authorities, just to see that the town's citizens are hiding everything in their homes and hiding the police at the police station. Interesting? Almost. When the townspeople come out of the family's presence, we learn that both the author and editor merge to replace tension with incomprehensible storytelling techniques in the hope that the audience's inability to tell what is going on will somehow cause discomfort to the audience . and it works! ... but not in the way they thought it would. I was very uncomfortable with how bad this movie was, but not afraid. The dialogue consists of things that make little sense. Not in pleasure, David Lynch, but such a kind of a kind of a walk-in-the-middle-of-a-boring conversation. In the course of the next hour we learn that the filmmakers are trying to kill us for fear of boring, worldly scenes, combined with the above "what's going on?" tap scenes. <br /> <br /> The plot involves something in the light of shiny old people who put children in a trance by the power of Satan and then bring to a party to play with toys, and even more sinister intent and it is up to a group of white men (everyone's white in the movie) to grab their guns and save the day, and a long ear-candy woman who falls on the drop of a hat. They search for the kidnapped children by looking at random places and shouting the children's names. <br /> <br /> This is a great horror movie for anyone who has never seen a horror movie, because the person is afraid of the mere thought of Satanism, paganism, Wicca, or even Catholicism due to a lifetime diet of brainwashing the Trinity Broadcast Network. It represents Satanism as elderly people in Halloween costumes with candles while mixing at a party in front of an Ankh. Replace with a priest who sends out completely rolled up nonsense about Satanists, calling them "Witches". The message that anything that is not Protestantism can all be thrown into the same category for easy condemnation. <br /> <br /> About 30 minutes of footage is being wasted to make mediocre actors uncomfortable. Babbling overwhelmed pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up. <br /> <br /> Highlights include a guy who laughs at the idea of ​​small green men for a solid 3 minute, a family staring out of their car's windows without talking for 10 minutes while listen to the elevator music. A priest who studied Satanism for 4 minutes with oh-so-terrifying drawings of demons to scare the Church Lady crowd. Random shots of dolls. Casual shots of children. Paint instead of blood at every chance. Film School-level dream series. Introduce unimportant characters who do nothing before they leave. Sometimes they act as if nothing is what they do. <br /> <br /> Directing is at its best messy. An example of directing includes a scene in the beginning where a man and woman kiss and the man moves away to look lovingly in her eyes and a dark red paint falls on her cheek. Look, they see it's not blood, but drops of a girl's snowman. Snowcones are ice and colored / flavored water, and would not have made drops of the same texture as paint, and do not mention the fact that her snowboard was a bright red orange. Hackneyed wrote, definitely, but made worse by the bad direction. It then cuts to an alternative shot of the man, woman and girl and shows that she stands about four feet from them, so that the snow cup would not drop on the woman, even though she had her snow head over the woman's clothes. . Away to go, editor! Of course the play is blah. The role of the entire role player can be scaled and perfectly balanced between excess and underactive. <br /> <br /> The director's most offensive technique is to give the actors no motivation and then go out for lunch as the bright eye of the camera learns when the actors fool themselves. <br /> <br /> Finally, we came to an end that would have been good if handled by skilled people and not Jerry Falwell.
