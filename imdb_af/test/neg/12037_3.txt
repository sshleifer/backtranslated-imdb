Some movies you watch, and you say, "Well, that doesn't make sense." And you don't really mean it. You just say things are too complicated or slightly stupid. <br /> <br /> "Bread And Circus" doesn't make sense at all. And I mean it. And that's not because it is surreal. From the start, it's pretty clear it's a bad excuse to do explosive special effects. There is no writing. There is no plot. There is no story of any kind. One event does not lead to the following - that's how fundamental the bad writing is here. <br /> <br /> So what? I mean, there are TONS movies out there that fall into that category. They want to show you, they give you gore. Why even talk about it? <br /> <br /> Because in this case "Bread and Circus" gave me hope. Well, there are some surreal elements. Vaginas, in the ground - people crawling out of them. The earth, in space, two legs on either side. These kinds of images are wonderful, fun, strange, crazy. But the movie doesn't do anything with them. <br /> <br /> Stuff happens, the movie ends, and it's all very unsatisfactory. I suspect the script was captured. Sorry. If there was a story of any kind, it would have made for a much more entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is much like the beautiful car you want. Then you lift the hood and there is no engine. Just a little man riding a bike. <br /> <br /> GRR!
