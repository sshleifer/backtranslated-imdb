This movie and several other 1950s films with a religious overtime, such as The Robe, Quo Vadis, and Samson and Delilah, unfortunately show all the heathen or anyone who is not a Jew or a Christian as morally depraved and decadent. The focus is only on Biblically related stories that ignore the world outside the Bible. As far as they are concerned, nothing comes from pagan Egypt, Greece or Rome. <br /> <br /> Any film that preaches about the one true God gives a short shift to religious freedom. The movies ignore the fact that ancient Judea's lack of religious freedom made it a fruitful ground for religious extremism. Most of the 1950s, religious movies also appeared to be the freedom that emerged after Christians adopted political power in the 4th century.
