Ugh. Stephen Baldwin. I have never noticed before I got the DVD at home and saw his name in the credits. Double ugh. What's worse, HE is the NAME in this low budget, senseless, wandering, wannabe shoot'em up. I mean, where did they find the man to write this garbage? Drive a caterpillar in the LA City Dump, hoping to break into the movie game? The whole plot was laid in a ridiculous situation on a ridiculous basis. Baldwin is as convincing as a poster boy for the American Gothic, Sans Fork. His entire acting repertoire looks like he needs the potjie and then looks as if he has found it. <br /> <br /> So there you have people: bad writing, bad acting by non-name actors, low-budget institution and a hero so convincing as a girl seeker looking for a cookie client as an action. hero. It's too late for me to get my money back on the DVD, but you can save yourself - unless you're one of those who likes to look at the dogs to laugh ... honestly, this one is too boring to be funny .
