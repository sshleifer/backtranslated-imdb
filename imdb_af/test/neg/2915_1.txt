Remember the old kung fu movies that we had on Friday and Saturday late night when our babies thought we were in control? Well, this movie plays exactly like one of those movies. Patsy Kensit's biggest claim to fame was the love interest for Mel Gibson's character in "Lethal Weapon 2," and this show was one of the reasons she never made it big. She is a terrible actress. <br /> <br /> In "Deadly Weapon 2," I thought she was cute. Enough to some of the other movies she included, including 'Loves Music, Loves to Dance', another great anticipation, which of course I didn't like either. But as attractive as she had my eyes, my soul screamed for me to eliminate it because she had played another inexpensive, predictable role and did so very badly. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Kensit stars as a comedian (and not a good one), who works the clubs of France (couldn't cut it in her own homeland, so she made their ears blossom), which falls on her luck, but, worse still, the French government wants to throw her out of a stale visa (or maybe they just turned her hand). But she marries this Casanova (Freiss), who is just as happy, and the predictability begins ... terrible! Is there any way to give this movie a negative rating? 1 out of 10 stars is rating this!
