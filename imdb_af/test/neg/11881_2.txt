For several reasons, this movie is not terrible. Other posters listed some of this movie's historical flaws. Well, I have a layman's knowledge of Roman history and even the inaccuracies I found remarkable. I usually forgive mistakes in historical movies because I understand that the purpose is to entertain, not to educate. And shrinking a long saga into a two-hour feature requires some, let's say historical license. But this movie goes much further than just finishing. <br /> <br /> There's worse. To tell a story of a distant time, use the movie flashback that just makes the story more confusing. Unless the viewers have prior knowledge of the period, they will be lost quickly. In addition, the film is, of course, filmed simultaneously in Italian and English, with several actors mentioned later. Sometimes the actors seem to be in completely different movies, which were then edited together. In fact, it's not far wrong. The actors are apparently pasted on a cheesy computer that ancient Rome has generated. <br /> <br /> The only reason I am wasting this star is that I always find an entertaining Peter O'Toole. But it's no reason to rent it. If you are curious about Roman history, there are much better movies available.
