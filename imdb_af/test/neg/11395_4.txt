After watching this movie, I thought to myself, they really left Errol Flynn's life! The movie is very nice eye candy. They really had the Hollywood atmosphere of the 1930s and 1940s. The costumes were great. All the women looked glamorous and all the men looked beautifully. They are beautiful and rancid. <br /> <br /> Is this a serious movie about Errol Flynn's life? Nah! It's a fun movie based on all the scandalous things he did in his life. <br /> <br /> Why am I criticizing this movie? It's a movie that had a lot of promise but couldn't deliver. Duncan Reagher was really good like Errol Flynn. He was not as beautiful as the original, but he made you believe that Flynn was not only a beautiful playboy who didn't take him seriously, but as a man who, although gifted with great talent, inside the disturbed and was unhappy inside. Flynn's love life was a disaster as he had so many failed marriages. He also lost very good friends during his life. He also suffered from uninvolved love for the elegant Olivia DeHavilland. The last scene of the film told Errol to beg Olivia to stay with him and instead walk away. He is shown in his tux, looks really empty and walks slowly around the pool as he throws his drink into the pool. It was a sad way to end the movie, but a good fit, because everybody now knows how he finally got rid of his alcoholism and his weakened lifestyle. <br /> <br /> This movie could have had much more depth, I was better written well. Certainly they showed all the scandals, but they never showed Errol Flynn's human center. Surprisingly, Duncan Reagher was able to put emotional depth in the character of Errol Flynn, although filmmaking did not put depth there. <br /> <br /> I'll probably never see this movie again, but I can still remember reading this movie, "Gosh, it could have been so much more .....!" I give this movie a D +.
