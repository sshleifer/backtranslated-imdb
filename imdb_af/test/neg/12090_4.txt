I wanted to like this one - the situation was rich and the setting was unusual and interesting. But the story is overwhelmed with childlike female gothic romance elements that are difficult to swallow. The director is unfairly harmed by the 'goy' characters - content to make their grotesque cardboard caricatures - and inexplicably lenient to the heroine's gay behavior. The potentially interesting power struggle between the inventor and the governor is not really dealt with. <br /> <br /> Feminist filmmakers will gain more credibility when they stop manipulating situations to throw all the sympathy with the heroine and start trading honestly. with issues. This movie looks more like 'The 7 Pieces of Gold', another serious failure, more than 'The Piano' - a true story of passion.
