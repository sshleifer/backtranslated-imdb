Art-house horror tries to use unconventional aesthetics to cover the fact that it is just another serial killer that ultimately relies on pornographic combinations of teenage sexuality and violent gore. The suburbs are as good as they have been in every piece of Australian writing (book or film) since 1960 - surprise surprise, the suburbs have a dark abdomen - and the plot is so confronted with anything you've seen. "The neighbors will never know this man," one of the filmmakers said about Joel Edgerton's character. "But he was completely credible about what he was. Serial killers did not all have patches over their eyes and scars in their cheeks. They look like the man next door." Another pornographic dealer who sees a serial killer in every street. But the real insignificance of this film is in the fact that it is a genre film that no one has seen. Backed by substantial funds (including a part of Film Finance - that is government), it won it during the Underground Film Festival in Melbourne and had to rely on ACMI friendliness for a very short discount season. Q1: What does the FFC financing genre flicks do, even if they are "arty" and aesthetically unconventional? Q2: Why are these nasty films (ACOLYTES; BEAUTIFUL; PUNISHMENT; NO THROUGH ROAD) made in the first place? Richard Wolstencroft & Co encourages their creators to believe they give the masses they really want, unlike what the cultural elite in state funding think they want. The truth is, these brutal and forgetful nasties earn much more critical praise - and win more dark awards - than they owe.
