This movie is one of the worst remakes I've ever seen in my life! The play is laughing and Corman hasn't improved his piranhas since 1978. 90% of the special effects are lifted from Piranha (1978), Up From The Depths (1979) and Humanoids From The Deep (1979). It makes Piranha II: The Menu looks like it's on the American Film Institute list.
