This stinker is here in mystifyingly frequent rotation on one channel, and I watched myself again and again in horror. The script is like something that would come with friends over too many drinks, and the production values ​​look great. <br /> <br /> It is meant to be a children's movie but features a grotesque (and poorly explained) kidnapping scene; the star dogs have a lack of star quality that is only equal by the other actors; and it generally seems to be filmed in someone's backyard (the climax game doesn't have more than three dozen extras that have been shamed in the background.) <br /> <br /> It's even everything with a budget run. From voice-over sequence when the story, to relief, simply stops. The high-riders here must either be the producers - or the majority of the extras of the soccer game!
