Some good set design. Good songs, but like the other man said they weren't carried out with much energy. Bea Arthur, who tried her best to do something with the material, sometimes had a good one-liner like Mame's friend, Vera, and helped move the song "Bosom Buddies" together. Other than that, there is nothing here that is worth your time. Slow pacing, incredibly bad filmography, not very good singing (except for Robert Preston), a horrible screenplay, bad play (except Bea), and a terrible main actor. Who thought Lucille Ball would be good as the elegant, life-loving Mame? The Heads at Warner Bros. was undoubtedly cracked when they decided not to use Angela Lansbury, who did so well on Broadway, and rather used Ball, which was not as funny as she was 20 years earlier. , could not take the part "the right way", and use a painful croak as an excuse for singing. Even if (maybe because) the movie was painful for her to make and even if she funded it, she was just not Mame. Auntie Mame is such a better movie and the soundtrack of the Broadway musical with Lansbury sounds good. For the most part, there is nothing here that is wonderful, interesting or interesting. Forget it, unless you're a big Lucy fan who thinks she can't go wrong. Hopefully, after you see it, you'll realize she was just human.
