Any horror movie that Robert Englund (Freddie Kruger!) Throws, then makes him dead 5 minutes before the opening credits, should immediately be considered with nothing but suspicion. <br /> <br /> Tony Todd (Candyman!) as a marsh tour guide (his James Earl Jones voice performance is hysterical by the way, I don't know or care if he's trying to be funny, but I was laughing it). Unfortunately, his role was also 5 minutes long. More reasons for suspicion and right. <br /> <br /> Mercedes McNab (AKA Harmony of Buffy & Angel, I had to look her up to see what I remembered from her, but she gets half naked!), Marcus The token black man (Not another teen movie) does not fill a comedy role that is really needed in a horror movie unless it is intended as a spoof. <br /> <br /> Joel Murray (Bill Murray's brother and Pete of Dharma & Greg) plays Shapiro, the man who shoots the gonzo video with the 2 cute girls. As they take a "Spooky Swap Ghost Tour", the 2 chiefs meet characters with other people and run on rocks and leave the boat. Once they have all been isolated in the swamp in the marsh. <br /> <br /> Once the true story of Victor Crowley has been told (his make-up looks like The Goonies Sloth) we found out he was dead (Well, you don't come back by hitting an ax in the skull !) Once the old man is attacked, despite pulling her gun and having a very clear shot, Marybeth takes more than 30 seconds to actually shoot a guy who hooks up an old man with a greenhouse. Is she stupid? It's 29 seconds long! In terms of plot there is actually no one (I do not do an amazing psyde as a plot, sorry) and the pacing is also very bad. You have a murder, some run away, a little light relief then some slow dialogue before you start the cycle again. <br /> <br /> After a very long scene exploring a wobble forest with a raccoon in it, Victor appears again (with some kind of power tool) and kills the dark-haired porn girl, he also manages the tour guide half with a kick cut? As soon as Misty was left alone to look at Ben, I felt it was pretty obvious. She would be the next to die (I was right, but you can't see it). <br /> <br /> Filmmakers? Rain won't burn fuel, OK? Idiots! Apparently after the 2 cemetery in the cemetery, Marcus was dead and Ben was injured in the foot, but they managed to find a boat after Victor threw it. <br /> <br /> She got the water through something unseen, he tried to save her, then suddenly she was pulled into the boat by Victor and shouted and the movie suddenly ended. <br /> <br /> Yes, just like that. No idea if Ben was dead (he lacked an arm) and no idea if Marybeth was going to survive and what happened to Victor. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible end and no doubt that my verbal attack on the filmmakers has removed the last review. So much for free speech, eh?
