Once a friend tested me for my first movie (a very bad video issue), I argued that I could grow; Orson Welles's first movie was even worse. He challenged me that it could not be, so I took out the Criterion laser disk of (I think) CITIZEN KANE and played HEADS OF AGE. My friend just lasted a few minutes before I gave the point. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of humor in this brief, but it's basically as pretentious as (and perhaps a collegial answer to) BLOOD OF A POET and other avant garde movies of the time. This is what it is: a sequence of vague theme images, and unless you really enjoy any of Welles' footage (in heavy makeup, to get started), it's not really worth checking out no.
