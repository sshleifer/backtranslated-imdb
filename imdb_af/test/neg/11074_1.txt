The person who wrote the summary and rave review for this movie is either an idiot or an avid fan of shitty movies. From the beginning, it has only spoken of a cheap rypoff of "The Descent", a much better movie that certainly does not start slowly. <br /> <br /> Of the first moments of "The Cavern", I was amazed at how bad it was, how uninspired and inexperienced it was, how poorly written, heavily acted and badly it was. This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life, and it says a lot, as I recently suffered from "Pulse". I can't believe that this piece of garbage has actually won prizes, just going to show the quality of marijuana and other illegal drugs, is much better in Australia and other countries than in the US. <br /> <br /> The scenes where the group of "creature" runs badly, especially the delayed "upside down camera", intended to show disorientation, but only comes off as a cheap effect that a first-year film student by their teacher. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this "director" will continue to make other movies, more than probably of the same low quality as this "movie" because I'm sure he didn't learn from his mistakes, which on this picture too excessive. <br /> <br /> If I had my way, the whole casting and crew would be sent the river for life without parole. This film is a crime against humanity.
