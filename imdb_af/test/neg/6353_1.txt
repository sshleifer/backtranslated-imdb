Wow, Jeez, I don't even know where to start commenting on this thing they called a movie. I don't really know how hell David Bradley started smoking after making Hard Justice, which, in my opinion, was a good movie after the US Ninja features. I didn't see any of this guy's last movies, after Cyborg Cop. Luckily I saw them on Amazon for 5 pounds each and I can say the following safely: if I threw the drain, the 5 pounds I spent on Total Reality, Crisis and expect to die, I happier than to have sat through the 90 minutes each of them lasted. My God, how the HECK can anyone label it as "movies" ??? And why do action / martial arts actors become knee-deep in the smelly horse when they reach their peak? I mean, David Bradley's Oscar defender, but his first movies were pretty entertaining. Hard, cool guy with very good martial expertise who corny lines, but at least entertainment action and martial arts fans to some extent. But I would like to know what the man's head did after making Hard Justice. His final 3 films must honestly be the WORST I have ever had to go through. As I mentioned before, I would like to get my money back on the 3 DVDs I bought. Crisis was the indication of drowsiness, the total reality was hard, but this expectation of dying is just nonsense. I'm sure the director was either mega-stoned when he made it, or he just took out the pope from every David Bradley fan who would sit through this heap of shit. The plot circles around a doctor (Bradley) who develops a kind of Virtual Reality game in which he kills different people one by one. Sorry, but I couldn't take this man seriously to play a bath with those beautiful hair, glasses and gray slacks and do absolutely NO physical fights (honestly, his best asset). The movie is even worse than any of the Saturday afternoon B-movies, because the play is laughing, directing is terrible and the couple are fighting in the movie. Well, what can I say? The actors look like they practice with their gymnast. We get a silly muscular policeman who starts showing his fighting events like one hour in the movie and badly ... A French hairy version of Van Damme who just can't fight, act or speak to live his freaking life and save Bradley . , the alleged protagonist, plays the evil doctor for which I was very happy when he stopped making this kind of useless junk. I even think he didn't throw a kick in this movie, probably because of his heart condition already playing on him. For a B-actor, I have to admit that I really liked this man, his style, body, fighting skills. But I'm really glad he stopped acting after this monstrosity because I honestly couldn't sit through another ninety minutes of the stocking stuff like this one. Avoid at all costs, even if you are David Bradley's family, you'll be glad you did.
