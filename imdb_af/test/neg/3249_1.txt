This movie made me laugh so much. It was a bloody joke to tell you the truth. So incredible and the worst plot ever. The acting was also bad. I don't know how many popular Bollywood actors come and actresses have taken on this movie. The writing had to be a joke. The visual effects in this movie were extremely painful to watch. I believe a preschooler could have done a better job of the visual effect and a monkey could do a better job of getting a plot. <br /> <br /> The plot has many attempts to copy large Hollywood movies. like the terminator, but it fails miserably. I laughed my head to see this movie. A total disaster in Indian film history!
