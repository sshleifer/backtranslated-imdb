Poor old Robert Taylor. Unlike the FEDS, there is nothing much left - this almost shocker is a wasteful ninety minutes and not much more. It's one of those cheesy detective crime planes with the story of the main character all the way through - usually it's only reserved for comedies, but this movie takes itself too seriously! N pity; Australian films, especially in the 2000-01 era, were overall exceptional quality - but I think there should be a few misses. Why even make a movie like this, wouldn't it be good?
