What a disappointment! I enjoyed the Jon Cleary books on Scobie Malone, but there is little resemblance between him and the film Malone. In the books he is an urban detective, devoted to his wife and not involved in physical bonds. For the film, the character is refreshed, in an outside buyer who uses his fists and is not inclined to jump with a beautiful girl in bed, although she and the film's other gender interest in him, I do not know; Taylor was 39 and his face was puffy. <br /> <br /> But his character's stamina is remarkable; he flies from Australia, apparently goes straight to the commissioner's house (rather carelessly to arrest him during a black tie reception), saves him from murder (in a battle in the process), goes to a casino with one girl, leaves with another and takes her in bed. So much for jet lag! On the way back to the commissioner's house (which reveals a good knowledge of London's back streets), he is defeated by the bad people, but is still only after breakfast! It is also remarkable that the commissioner's limo miraculously restored his windshield and headlights within minutes of the murder attempt and that one character has a striking belief in the exact timing of a clock-activated bomb. <br /> <br /> The best thing is Joseph's Butler's contempt for the brazen Malone. And at least the movie avoids a travel book in London, although some scenes take place during the Wimbledon tennis week.
