"Grande Ecole" is not an artificial exploration of mixed sexuality, but if you need it, a movie for an X-rated channel. Although I suspect there is nothing in this movie to spoil a willing viewer, the plot is just an excuse for male-to-female and male links that are in the unconvincing context of a competition between a Parisian school for future heads and a main school for those seeking higher degrees in the liberal arts. There is also an emergence of cultural clash between high status and lower status of French youth, as well as a societal conflict with native Frenchmen and Arab immigrants from North Africa. All that is missing is a female link, which could easily be arranged with just a slight twist in the plot. <br /> <br /> The acting is at a somewhat higher level than in the usual pornographic movie - but "Grande Ecole" is about it, just like pornography with artistic aspirations. I'm not insulted by sex. It's just repetitive and long boring. Where is the Hays office when you really need it?
