Talk about being boring! <br /> <br /> I was expecting a fascinating insight into the life of the man who wrote mythical night on the Galactic Railway. I expected to see crazy stories and witches from an eccentric man and discover his inspiration for such bizarre material. Son, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Spring and Chaos are mostly boring with just occasional moments of innovative animation. It's definitely nothing to write home about and nowhere near as good as NOTGR, it's something I suggested you look at. Leave this drill alone. If you absolutely have to see it, buy it somewhere cheap. Don't pay the best dollar.
