I think it's in the public domain like this on DVD. First, it is a good propaganda movie shown to a war-Aussie audience, so it is not considered a serious revocation of Tobruk. The first half to 3/4 are very dry things in Australia, I think like many American war movies where the recruits come together, oh man, it's so long. When we come to Africa and Tobruk, pretty bad, low budget materials. The battle scenes on the DVD copy I watched were almost completely black. See it if you need to, but be prepared to use the fast forward as I doubt you can take it in a few minutes. I enjoyed the Italian "Battle of El Alamien" much more, also Richard Burton did an African theater war movie that was good "The Desert Rats". This movie is just a real time and should have stayed in that time, don't keep up well today (I doubt whether it's both highly regarded). I say the same thing about my American counterparts, so don't personally take Aussies (I love Australia, there twice!).
