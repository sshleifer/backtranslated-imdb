You know, after the first few Chuck Norris movies, I got so much that I could tell that a movie was made by Golan-Globus, even though I set up in the middle without ever watching the credits or the title . What I could tell more was Golan-Globus within a minute of screen time. Something about the story structure, the goofy relationships between the characters, the manipulated dialogue, the wooden display (spiked at the occasional outright terrible performance), the stage pace and rhythms that Albert Pyun looks like, look like John McTiernan, the paper dough stands and non-ready-to-prime-time choreography ... Golan-Globus has been consistently consistent in style, subject and position over the years. <br /> <br /> What can you say, it must work for them, because they literally produced dozens of movies. You go to one of their productions and you know exactly what you get. And it's not brain food, people. <br /> <br /> "Ninja 3" is another piece of hackwork in a long range of products from the GG sausage factory, and offers the typical limited enjoyment to moviegoers. 'Palate. You have a bad Ninja, prune police and criminals and anyone else who gets in their way. You have a good Ninja, who promised to stop him. You have a Westerner who was thrown into the mix so we can identify and reassure Americans with him (or in this case): "We can still beat the remaining Orientals at their own game." You have a love interest (usually also the worst actor / rest in the movie) fenced with the hero. You have your endless rope of assault, assassination and dipping shots of men grabbing in fear while an arrow or throwing star stumbles unconvincingly out of their eye, neck or chest. You have your Beefy White Guy / Bodyguards in packs that call a Ninja a Sun of a B * Tch 'and throw a round housekeeping, just to get his * ss handed to him. You have a final confrontation between the Good Guy and the Bad Guy, which lasts 20 minutes and just kind of stops like a RoadRunner cartoon rather than a climax or a resolution. <br /> <br /> Ninja 3 is a little different, as the plot revolves around a slim female athletic type owned by the Bad Ninja. So she ends a lot of police and criminals and Beefy White Bodyguards in Suits while he is under his spell. But all the other elements are there, as formal in their way as a Kabuki game or a Noh drama. <br /> <br /> I actually thought Lucinda Dickey was pretty nice in this movie. She is well-muscled and crooked, has a big cheekbone and some athletic 'ooomph' to her movements and you can actually suspend the faith to assume that her character can do some of the feats she moves in the movie. She can wear this thing almost, but not quite. One extra start for her participation and good energy. <br /> <br /> Of course, Sho Kusugi is here, and he dominates the last 10-15 minutes of the movie. And just to show you how 3rd-rate and uninspired GG movies are, the director and editor cut the last climate battle between Kosugi and the Bad Ninja scene with many Dickey reaction shots and her boyfriend watching the life and death struggle with an expression of soft intervention. I'm serious ... for all the emotions and reactions they show to the proceedings, they can look at a sea turtle in an aquarium in Marineland. I can only imagine how Dickey felt when she saw the final product. She probably wanted to run the editor with a katana, because the reaction shots made her look like a complete idiot. <br /> <br /> An enjoyable waste of time ... but it's definitely a waste of time. Maybe if you're a Sho Kusugi fan, or even a Linda Dickey fan, you'll find it worthwhile.
