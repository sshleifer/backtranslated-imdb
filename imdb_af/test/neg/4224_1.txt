A desperate attempt to make a "movie noir" sci-fi thriller, but the movie falls short. It has no credible plot, some of the key actors were a joke (NOT Lars Bom, he's cool!). However, I looked like the "bandwidth access restriction". I finished it in principle, but went home with the feeling that I lost two hours of my life ...
