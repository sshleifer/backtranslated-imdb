My friends and I just finished a preview of this new Australian movie. Everyone in the theater agreed, what was the point of this movie? There was no good story to follow, the characters were undeveloped and the plot was unmotivated. I find it bizarre that this movie, which is probably in the high millions of food, is bought and funded. It doesn't serve a purpose for the drama community, it doesn't add anything to the Australian theater's palette. It was really a waste of time to create this droll unemotional piece of work and more time really needs to be spent shopping and creating good stories, not creating such a mess. Hugo Weaving and Rose Byrne were OK, but severely hampered by a bad writing. Pia Miranda's character was unnecessary and abstract from the plot, and her lines were at best average. A true waste of talent. The saving grace was Geoffrey Simpson's ACS cinematography, which, like most Aussie films, was excellent. <br /> <br /> Come on, think about next time. <br /> <br /> 4/10
