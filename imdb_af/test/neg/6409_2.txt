What was hell? I would admit there were a few scenes that caught my eye, such as the 23 bullshit where the protagonist saw or calculated number 23 wherever he went, but it was almost the movie in a nutshell?! Crying aloud, it was supposed to be a suspension film and, as a psychological tension, would I have expected it to have at least a catastrophic effect on the mind, but instead what did we get? We have become as frightening as an animal manager who finds himself in the midst of a mid-life crisis and his journey to salvation. Just like an old man flashing when you ask me. I probably only had to hire Wild Hogs, it wouldn't have made a difference. I mean who we estimate, they must have made someone else the murderer of that girl. By saving Sparrow with the main character of the book. The number 23 pretty much handed them out to the viewers by hinting that he was the killer. How would it shake our heads? Scan for all of you who choose to show some generosity towards this miserable work you call a movie and kudos for most critics who agreed with my response.
