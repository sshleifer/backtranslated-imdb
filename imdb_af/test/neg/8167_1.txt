It is difficult to make a bad movie with the "undercover finally successful" sports theme, but this movie is amazing. My thoughts are about how useless and boring this movie is. <br /> <br /> I think the director couldn't decide whether it was the runner or the coach. It's not about it either. Ultimately, who cares? No character has a nice personality. There's nothing in the movie to care for anyone. Even the "bad guy" is not really bad. (I think he is in two scenes, and apparently is on a kind of barbituate.) I think he asks her once and politely to leave the coach and train with him. Then he later asked 'kinda' to move in with him. That's it. Conflict! Stress! What will she do? !! <br /> <br /> - And what about running? Did the director ever see a real marathon? Christine's shape is so wrong, it's absurd, like the form of the supposed "champion" she competes with (a character without lines. -Perhaps they may have hired, you know, a real RUNNER?) <Br / > <br /> And the speed of the race is out of order. Were they running or speeding? This is actually laughable. I can literally walk back faster if they run into the big race. Maybe it was too difficult to move the cameras at real speed? <br /> <br /> Another absurdity: (spoiler, I think). At one point in the big race, the two women fall inexplicably at the same time. What attacked them is a mystery. Perhaps they both just exhausted and fell? And then they get up, but don't start running again for 30 seconds. Oh yes, very realistic. This ridiculous event does not even add tension, as the other runners are not close, and except at this point you are condemned in a state of catatony. <br /> <br /> I especially enjoyed how all four of her male teammates, highly trained athletes, all fall out of the big race due to charlie horses, or trends, or something unlikely. <br /> <br /> But who cares? This movie has almost no voltage, no resolution, nothing. Some woman runners with absolutely no personality are discovered by an old, boring coach with a few failures that almost occurred. They practice a lot. She's not happy. They practice a little more. She wins big race. Woopie. <br /> <br /> My description is actually more interesting than the real movie. I only saved you 90 minutes. Avoid this one like the pest.
