I'm surprised that so many people find this movie even close to the good. Let me make it clear that I am a BIG Hitchcock fan and I've had so many of his films on video as I could, but the one I felt was so under par, not just for Hitch's movies. I'm very nice here. This picture really sucked. I don't mind that Hitch had a favor with the talented Carole Lombard, but I saw 50s of sitcoms with more craftsmanship and style than this boring turkey. Chemistry between Lombard and Robert Montgomery? Lists I like potatoes and ice cream, but I don't want to taste them together. I saw better chemistry in chemical pollution on the highway than here. <br /> <br /> If you really like Hitchcock, avoid this movie and see one of them better. To cry out loud, the pieces of Hitch helped on the old TV show, and it was even harder to deliver.
