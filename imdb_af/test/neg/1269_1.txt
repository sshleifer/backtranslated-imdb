I was excited about the concept that my favorite comic book hero is on television ... and very disappointed with the end result. <br /> <br /> The only "wonderful" thing was the crawling wall (despite the visibility of the cable). I didn't think Nick Hammond was Peter Parker ... and he was visible from another building than the man who did the stunts in the spider. You can tell they were two different actors. <br /> <br /> Granted, I can also touch modern Spider-Man movies when I look at Tobey Macguire and when I look at CGI. But it is from a trained eye and experience with CGI. However, the 70s could have been better, despite a lack of special FX. <br /> <br /> The web was hokey and looks like ropes that seem to be turning things, rather than keeping them. And what was there to give him a spider to drive around. Hello? He is the web sling people. <br /> <br /> Sorry ... didn't mean to work that way, but our beloved wall crawler earned better.
