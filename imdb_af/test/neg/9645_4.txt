The three-quarters of Bill Boyd, Robert Armstrong and James Gleason play Coney Island carnys, who work for Ginger Rogers, a working gal who sells salt water table. With the outbreak of the First World War, the three pull the Ginger far away. The first half of the RKO Pathe production is difficult, with the three male leaders chewing the landscape with cold one-liners and a snappy dialogue that is fast becoming busy. The second half focuses on action sequences, as the US fleet both strives for a German trade cruiser and a U-boat. These rows are lively and well-filmed, but overall it is a long and unsatisfactory flat-end comedy drama. Only for fans of the stars.
