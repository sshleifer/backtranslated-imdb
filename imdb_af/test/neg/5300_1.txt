Uma and Travolta were very good together, but unfortunately - when they left the screen, the movie was nothing but a lot of boring and secondary characters wrapped up in a very bad writing. Instant glowing of greatness such as the dan scene between Uma and Travolta quickly wiped out when Harvey Keitel's containers and similar uninteresting thugs sustained. And the white man who has tried black has a lot of very difficult, too much exposure in the picture. He was weighing a pretty good performance by the Rock, the only secondary character you can't wait to watch, leaving the screen. Bad, dumb plot. The authors clearly couldn't find out if they were writing to Generation X or the 12-15 year old rapeseed, and the combination became a movie staring at me on my watch!
