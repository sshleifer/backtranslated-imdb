Actually terrible waste of space. My friend and I tried to watch this movie, but had to turn it off about 30 minutes from the end. And I can count the movies that I turned off at one end before the end. <br /> <br /> The script and direction are guided and deeply uninspiring. I won't be surprised if they found the script in a stack of copies in 1983. For example, the annoying throat threatens the property man from his home. I mean seriously. The police will hit her through in minutes. The scenes and events were just through you like villages in a river. It is difficult to understand the actual print of the movie. The narrative flashes between characters in a seemingly random way, breaking the pathetic attempts to build the characters. Oh, and what "characters" are they. The main player Rourke played is terrible. He could have sent a cardboard cut out of himself and stayed in bed. After 60 or so minutes of the movie I built absolutely zero attachment to this character. He is not sympathetic or hateful. Just an unsuitable dummy from a shop window blundering through every scene. His motivation is impossible to distinguish from his generally mumbled and emotional delivery. Is he happy? Is he sad? Angry? No idea. Only those same dead eyes are staring at you from a freaked piece of flesh. And the native American theme is just awful and useless. <br /> <br /> The good guys are at best indifferent. A dull white board stereotype and a sympathetic neurotic ex-woman stereotype. Cue archetypal woman with shotgun face down with a bad man, "you're not going to shoot me". It is both very original and irritating. <br /> <br /> The Richie Nix character looks interesting first, but soon comes down to an annoying one-sided psycho character. It seems to be contrary to the apparent intention of motivating the bad guys in some way or at least realistically. <br /> <br /> Roasario Dawson's character begins with a few promises, but soon falls into a sickly and childlike parody of gang members. chick scenes from Jackie Brown. You really want me to believe her character is so attracted to Rourke's? Or worse is she just a floozy who sleeps with anything moving? Realistic female characters FTW! <br /> <br /> In summary, a complete mess of a movie. Hopeless characterizations and performances. A guide and cut script with uninspired direction. And finally extremely boring. It's not even comedy either. Laughing at Rourkes Haggard's face gets pretty old after being put through the first 15 turgid minutes of the movie.
