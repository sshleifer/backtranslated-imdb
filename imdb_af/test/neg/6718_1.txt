Lord, be merciful! Why was this movie made? Why did Seagal and the upcoming star Max Ryan agree to be in it? The foreigner is so ominously bad in every imaginable way that it gets the mind. <br /> <br /> The movie has an ultra-cheap look at it. Like a budget of a few dollars, it was far out of reach. What's worse is that the makers know it and try to make it look good. The result is a movie that doesn't look right. The battle scenes were so dull and "discretely" edited to hide the fact that Steven Seagal is no longer in good shape. None of them are tempting or exciting. The plot is nonsense that is not in any way interested or uniqueness. The places in Eastern Europe (a clever move by the producers to keep the budget or not exist) seem unpleasant and should not serve as the backdrop for an "action" movie (what action?). <br /> <br /> And what is the deal with the title? As far as I could tell everyone in the movie was strange. Which ONE refers to the title? <br /> <br /> The DVD is in 1.85: 1 anamorphic widescreen and in Dolby 5.1 audio. Not even enough to justify a single rental. The foreigner is not worth one second of your time. Gotta love that tagline tho! "If they think they can stop him, they're dead wrong." Wow!
