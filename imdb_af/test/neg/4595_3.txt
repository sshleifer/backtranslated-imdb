I watched the unprecedented version of this movie and as someone who has studied Speck's life and crimes now, I must say this movie is a flawed but ambitious start to the real story. While the real horror of Speck and the murders is captured, this film makes the following factual errors. 1. Speck did not inject drugs on the crime scene as depicted in the film. In fact, he was mainly an alcoholic and pill popper who rarely took drugs via syringe. 2. The Asian nurse who survived Speck's massacre did not shrink her under the stairs and under the couch in the lounge as depicted in the movie. It would have been impossible. In real life she hid under a bed while Speck eliminated his 8 victims methodically. 3. The movie shows Speck as if he is violent and brutal with the women as soon as he meets them. Not true. In fact, Speck was initially calm and gentle, reassuring the women that he would not hurt them. That's how he could connect each one of them. 4. The real Richard Speck was not the deep thinker who portrayed the film. FBI professor Robert Ressler interviewed Speck in the 80's and said that Speck not only knew why he had committed the murders, but that he was not interested in learning why, or he could shed light on why. Speck was known as below-average intelligence and not the philosopher who interpreted this movie. If the story wasn't so tragic and horrible, the voice would be overloaded. All in all, Doug Cole's performance is sufficiently threatened and cold-blooded, though I don't think the right Speck was so forward in his violence. Undoubtedly, he was a very violent person while under the influence, but he was also known because he was a fairly smooth man who could make the people comfortable before complaining. Beverly Ann Sotelo's performance as the surviving nurse is the best in the movie. She is a very good actress. If you're sorry, don't see this movie. It is very graphic and disturbing.
