I didn't really know what to expect from "Future Death", but I certainly hoped it would be a bit better than I got. I knew the review was bad and the reviews were unfavorable, but the Subversive DVD cover illustration looks overly cool and I can't resist it. For a very long (too long) time, this film got the impression that it is an unofficial successor to Porky's with lame, vulgar and offensive brotherhood. Five mega-dorks, one of those who look like a precise young clone by Jim Carrey, desperately want to join a frat house, but their eventual initiation may just be a bit far-fetched and dangerous. They are dropped into the city center with provocative marks painted on their faces, at the same time as a violent gang war. It doesn't take too long before they are confronted with Splatter, a seemingly half-man and half-machine warrior, who leads a gang of whom I never really figured out who or what they were. Were they a government experiment? Cyborgs? Terminator imitations of a distant future? Does anyone care? "Future-Death" is a bizarre amateur movie with a scenario jumping from one subject to another, without any logical connection or narrative. The plot lends important elements to large movie cultures such as The Warriors, Escape from New York and The Terminator, but the end result is a giant Sci-Fi monster. The costumes and special effects are pretty spicy and there is a truck of cheap and free nudity. The acting is terrible, but I am prepared to blame the delayed dialogues instead of the role players. One to avoid at all costs, despite really cool DVD cover art. Resist it!
