OK, number one - this "movie" is a "90's" version of a 70's crappy show that nobody remembers! Number Two - As soon as the movie started, I was confused, it was as if I was halfway through the movie! There was no plot! it was very annoying! Horrible wardrobe! Call me crazy, but it's not just credible to me. The little skinny Omar Epps can pursue a big adult man without a gun and scare him to talk! This is a ridiculous plot. I'm sorry, but for me children can't even put their pants on one leg at a time, let alone an evil, underground, murderer. I walked out of the theater and asked and got my money back! I don't respond to this movie to anyone over the age of 12!
