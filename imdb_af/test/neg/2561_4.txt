I remember when it came out, it was the first kung fu movie ever seen on our way and we were all excited to see it. Although the action was at its best, it made our first taste of kung fu and our first taste of bad dubbing as well as bad movies or exactly how Chinese people made movies at the time. They were inferior, but there was entertainment value here and it definitely got caught up. The Kung Fu fool has begun, and Bruce Lee and "The Chinese Connection" will soon follow either "The Chinese Boxer" with Jimmy Wang Yu. Anyway, this movie was chosen to guide the road.
