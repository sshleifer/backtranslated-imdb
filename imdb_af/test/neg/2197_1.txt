We can conclude that there are 10 kinds of people in this world. <br /> <br /> Those who understand binary and those who don't. Those who understand binary put this movie with hackers, while those who enjoy this movie for the sake of nothing of this crap can happen. Ever. <br /> <br /> For a movie trying to be a modern film with fiction applied to it. It failed. Awful. Only 11 years old and under can enjoy and only 30 years and older can be afraid to take their identity. It loses on the main market for a resale value (I see it now, it's more boring than it was first released).
