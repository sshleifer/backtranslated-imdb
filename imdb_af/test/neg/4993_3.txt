The rise of the undead begins like a great nuclear fission through an unnamed American city, a few people survive in a building by leaning on the door so it remains shut and the nastiness (!) Stay. They argue among themselves for centuries, then a monster comes from seemingly nowhere and starts killing one by one. <br /> <br /> Written, produced and directed by Jason Horton & Shannon Hubbell, one has to say Rise of the Undead is terrible. The writing takes itself very seriously, but doesn't make sense. The first thing I asked myself was whether there was a major core problem going on, destroying the whole city. Why are these people I still keep alive? Why is the building in which they are still standing? Then I asked when something was going to happen, the whole first 20 minutes was in one room, actually it's a bit generous, it's more of a go than the main character's arguments. Then it comes in a return of the living dead (1985) with a government-created virus that transforms people into zombies, before one of the most abrupt, useless and seemingly random plot twists I've ever seen that has most of what just got a total waste of time happens. Then the end of the 30-year-old minutes in the mystery of the Undead comes in a strange sci-fi type thing, as something that looks like a ball drives energy to kill everyone, I was the only one who floated this energy ball is and where it came from? Get back to what happened outside, what was the reason again? Oh, that's right, we're never told. The resurrection of the undead is a mess, the character is terrible and is not even the names. The halfway turn will tear your hair in frustration, sucking the dialogue, nothing is explained and there is virtually no story here. The last 10 minutes (maybe a little more) of Rise of the Undead has no dialogue and the movie ends suddenly. <br /> <br /> Of course, director's Horton & Hubbell works on a low budget, the whole movie is put in about two rooms and three times! Photography is horrible, they use annoying color filters seemingly random and sometimes it seems that Rise of the Undead was shot on a camcorder. There are no special effects, there are some false blood splashes, but no real makeup effects to speak of. There are a few CGI shots of the city being engulfed in flames, which seem right, but the swinging ball of the energetic looks awful. There is a shocking shot early where two people are sitting talking to a corridor, for a bizarre reason their heads are cut off on the screen! Only their lower bodies from the neck are still seen, nothing else happens in the frame, they are moving and there is no other, but for a strange reason their heads are cut off at the top of the frame as they talk to each other ! It is quite a strange thing to actually look at. <br /> <br /> With an ultra-low budget of about $ 10,000 and a two-week IMDb shot, I have to congratulate the creators on the emergence and spread of the Undead rise. This is where my congratulations stop because otherwise it has terrible production values ​​and is located in about three corridors located somewhere in New Orleans, Louisiana, because that's where Rise of the Undead was shot. The play sucks so I won't live there. <br /> <br /> The rise of the Undead sucks, it looks like a zombie movie, but it's not fair, everything is subpar and I know The filmmakers worked on a low budget, but it's not really an excuse for me. Definitely not recommended.
