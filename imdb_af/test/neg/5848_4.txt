SPOILERS THIS: <br /> <br /> Not good. The film is completely different from the book (Not that the book was exactly a classic, but it was really good.) <br /> <br /> I think Demi Moore was OK. Actually, I don't remember much of her performance in any way. The big disappointment, however, was not with Mrs. Not Moore. <br /> <br /> WHY did anyone who did the rewriting decide to suddenly make the millionaire a heart? (I refer to him as "the millionaire" because he also had another name in the movie, then the book version - just another change.) People who didn't read the book of course won I know nothing otherwise, but in the BOOK version, this man is much more relentless and complex overall. He is also fascinating. The fact that such a big change was made in the movie changes the whole plot. It was almost like watching a completely different movie. <br /> <br /> I know many movies differ a lot from the books. But I also thought Redford's character was a bit of a wimp. It is NOT Redford's fault (he is a good actor and can play relentlessly), but without those traits he just falls in love with another shiny man. That is why the story is just another clich√© love story that includes 1 woman and 2 men. It wasn't really the point of the book. <br /> <br /> It could have been much better. Even if I didn't read the book version, I wouldn't have liked it so much, but to change that much, it takes me a few points.
