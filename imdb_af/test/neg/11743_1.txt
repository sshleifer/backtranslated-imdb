A horrible movie, poorly understood and rough. The play by Anne Heche and Vince Vaughan is as inferior to that of Perkins and Leigh in the original version they must be seen to be believed. There was no reason to make this picture, which just emphasized how perfect and brilliant Hitchcock was and how inevitable. There is also a crawling, pervasive insensitivity in the film that is not there in the first film. Hitchcock's Psycho was scary and shocking, but one can really feel for everyone involved, even the pitiful Norman Bates. There were moments of pathos, irony and fierce humor that the remake did not have. One of the best things about Hitchcock's movie was the incredible and intuitive depth and sense of nuance, from when to cut away and when to show something, to use a close-up or long shot, or an actor sympathetic and when to make him terrifying, and so on. The remake has none of these features and does not even try for them. It's an idiotic exercise that I was surprised to even released.
