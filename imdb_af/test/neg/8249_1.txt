SAPPY. <br /> <br /> I love how they went to the "Shark Bay Baaa" to quote books to impress the ugliest girl there. <br /> <br /> Probably the custodian at my school is a Genius too, but wait to land that big building. <br /> <br /> Just because you keep your nose at the gravel stone, there's no reason to cut a steak with it. "Do you like apples?" <br /> <br /> The man nods or something. <br /> <br /> "Well, how were you like DEM APPLES!" Wow, this is genius. <br /> <br /> Duh, Minnie Driver will give her number to anyone. Robin Williams can't paint and keep the good books on the top shelf. And there is a professor always wearing a scarf for no reason.
