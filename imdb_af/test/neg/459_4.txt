Less than two hundred and fifty years ago, the last of the great pirates wrote their names in blood and fire over the pages of maritime history. This is the story of a chief captain whose name, for a short year, had frightened the hearts of seafarers and merchants from the Caribbean islands to the London trading houses. <br /> <br / > Hmm, that opening the movie sounds like we're in a hell of a swashbuckling, looting, ripper of a movie? Well, it's not. It is not totally worthless as a curio piece. From the 20th century Fox, Anne Of The Indies was adapted by Philip Dunne & Arthur Caesar from a short story written by Herbert Ravenel Sass. Board is by Jacques Tourneur, the point is by Franz Waxman and Harry Jackson offers the Technicolor photography. Jean Peters is the title role of Anne (AKA Captain Providence) and comes from Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget, Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez and James Robertson Justice. <br /> <br /> Originally meant to be based on true life spirits Anne Bonny, the film eventually turns out to be a story of a woman seeking identity and finding herself in the predominantly masculine learned world of piracy and sea based shenanigans. Filled with clich√©s and well-known pieces, the film also suffers from a largely misunderstood role. Peters gives it a good road, and Paget lifts up the screen with bustling beauty. While Robertson Justice, although interrupted, looks actually the part and doesn't overwork like the rest of the male cast. Some reviewers have desperately tried to dig deep into the film to find intelligence and hidden meanings, purely because it is Tourneur in the legal seat. But there is no depth here, it is just a work for Tourneur, a professionally awarded one, but it is thinly plotted and has no swash to go with the buckle in the action pile. <br /> <br /> In the best case, throw away. 10/04
