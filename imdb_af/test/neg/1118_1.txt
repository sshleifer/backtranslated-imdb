I'm speechless. Matty Simmons managed to do something I thought impossible. He made "The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island" like "Citizen Kane." Painfully cannot even begin to describe this piece. I do not know. Note, the point of departure sounded funny, but now that I've seen it, it's funny because it's funny to drop an anvil on your scrotum. <br /> <br /> I won't be in the foreground, as the title says it all, but to say I don't think there was literally one funny thing in this movie, not one, not even the monkey bite. How can one of the funniest characters in the "Vacation" franchise, the sloppy white garbage Eddie (Randy Quaid) be made so terribly unfunny? I never felt so much sympathy for an actor in my life. I also have the other actors participating in this "comic" horror, Miriam Flynn (Catherine, Eddie's long suffering, but sunny woman), Dana Barron (the original Audrey Griswold), Fred Willard and the beautiful Sung Hi Lee The only reason to watch the movie, even if only with the sound), except for the old Commie, Ed Asner (Uncle Nick), he got it. Oh, the audience didn't. I just thanked Chevy Chase, who had been in a slump for years, knocking out of this diarrhea. This is the smartest career movement he has ever made. <br /> <br /> I don't know if your people are religious as I am, but I know I will pray to the Lord tonight to add 2 hours (if not 2 years) to my life for the time I am before spending the TV I will go Never come back. <br /> <br /> Hot water baby says NEWS from 10 stars (If you take a few hits from the bong and drink the water, maybe 1/10 of a star out of 10)
