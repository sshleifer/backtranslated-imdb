The DVD version we bought had Sandra Bullock on the cover, but we discovered it was a picture of her from another movie. Unfortunately, she is very little in this movie. However, you can see how far she has come. <br /> <br /> The one brightest spot in the movie was, apart from her small part, some of the screens shot in NYC and New Jersey. the 1980s. <br /> <br /> The noise is terrible. Sometimes the background noise is so loud that the dialogue is difficult to hear. Sometimes the dialogue is reduced without any background noises, which is disturbing. For example, sometimes when in the car, the sounds of the car are too loud, and then suddenly there is absolutely no extra noise. The director likes to look at faces, and then it is clear that the film is over-obscured because the words do not match the lip movements. Through most of the movies the voices sound like people are talking in a can. <br /> <br /> Background music, when there is music, is distracting instead of adding to the movie. <br /> <br /> The direction is laughing. Sensitive camera angles and sound effects make the movie a joke, especially during times when tension, such as in the middle of gunfire, is supposed to be. The writing is terrible. There are some subplots that do not make sense, and most characters are very dumb because there is no explanation for their motivation. The author / director tries to explain some of the relationships between the men who were in Vietnam, but nothing makes sense. These top killers and former soldiers do not seem to see other people's shadows or other people moving. The actors go from calm to panic and go again without warning. It's just a combination of bad direct and bad writing. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are so bad that we first thought we had stumbled upon someone's student drum that had only Sandra Bullock in it. If you like to laugh at really bad student videos, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, avoid this movie.
