In vain bad movie allegedly about a croupier who wants to be a writer and the incidents that make casino life. Move at a snail's pace Deaf, boring, boring! Almost everything about this movie is amateurish and unconvincing - with a very significant exception: the performance of Clive Owen, which is like a Rolls Royce by a slat. Advice for casino sequels was allegedly provided by a professional, but by the way it was handled, the director was completely ignored. While casino staff may well be a different race for the rest of the world, they are nowhere as white and boring as the characters presented in this screenplay. Stops and stops are thrown into the script in an attempt to provide it with convincing background, but it appears to be placed in a list on a cocktail napkin. For anyone making a living in the casino business (as this author has for the past Forty years!), This is a poverty-stricken depiction of their world that has never even reached the farthest and darkest of England. have not been! A terrifying, insulting mess of a movie that makes plods and plods to an idiot and unconvincing end. American critics loved it.
