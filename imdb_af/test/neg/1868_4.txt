Some things just won't stay dead. They just have to come back for more or we like it or not. I think some people like to beat a dead horse. The first "Ghoulies" was a surprise whistle and the first successor was a better movie. The third film adopted a more comical approach and by this time the little buggers began to overshoot their welcome. I think someone out there in Hollywood thought it was a good idea to revive the franchise, but the outcome is likely to disappoint fans of previous entries. Advantages: The acting is pretty good for a movie like this. A deaf but fun score. Move at a good pace Some cheese for those who love it. Some nice good action packs. Has a bit more plot than the other, and unlike II & III at least they try to connect themselves to the original. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Not as much fun as it is. Although it's more plotted than before, it's a bit ridiculous. Poor effects. The original Ghoulies only appear in flashbacks and here they are replaced with two trolleys that serve no purpose other than to be comic reliefs. Speaking of comedy, all attempts at humor are lame. Is a direct successor to the first movie, but there is so much loose ending. For example, I thought Jonathan was doing black magic to what happened in the original? Not that it was spectacular in the other, but the direction of this movie is particularly fine. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: The first three Ghoulies movies are a bad movie lovers dream. This fourth, and so far final successor (Let's hope), is a bit of an eclipse. Sure, there is a little fun to have, but it's just not the same. The other is also a low budget, but the people involved have put much more in them. See if you are a finalist or you want to see beautiful women in skimpy outfits. Otherwise, just keep the other three. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/5
