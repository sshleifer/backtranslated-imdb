Disappointing movie with Walter Pidgeon as a hunter going to Germany to kill Hitler. When discovered, he is committed to signing a document stating that he has acted on orders from England. His refusal to sign the document brings us to the plot of the film. <br /> <br /> Pidgeon is pursued to England by evil George Sanders and his cohort, John Carradine, who speaks little, but is again, as always, the personification of wickedness. <br /> <br /> Along the way we follow, Pidgeon meets Joan Bennett, the latter showing a wonderful cockney accent. <br /> <br /> The story is cut down a bit like love between the two, but again when we reach World War II, realism becomes the object of the day. <br /> <br /> The nearby scene in the cave between Sanders and Pidgeon is well-known, but we know where that arrow goes. <br /> <br /> Very interesting that Pidgeon Nazi Germany flies, he meets again with a young Roddy McDowall, one of Pidgeon's co-stars the same year in the memorable "How Green Was My Valley." How green was "Manjag?"
