*** SPOILER ALERT *** Incredible and confusing arson drama dealing with a sinister plan to burn a big holiday resort before New Year's Day. To be 10 million dollars assured, the man behind Valley View Estates in the Blue Mountains in Australia, Julian Fane, Guy Doleman, is determined to bring his own project into flames to collect. This should happen by January 1, two weeks before the insurance policy expires on the project. <br /> <br /> With his mind he has no idea whatsoever of his workman and architect Howard Anderson, Tom Skerritt, that his boss, Julian Fane, is planning to burn the resort he built and possibly erect him as the falcon. Anderson gets a little suspicious when insurance investigator Sophie McCann, Wendy Hughes, informs him of some fishing trips between Fane and the insurance company Proud Alliance. It seems that Proud Allience is actually owned, or 60% of it, by Fane himself! This explains why Fane has burned all this arson that is going to collect the ten million dollar insurance, which is at least twice as much as the entire Valley View Estates are worth. <br /> <br /> Later, we killed Sophie McCann, in a flawed swim accident, to avoid finding out what was happening to the suspicious fries around and in Valley View Estates. That's when Lloyd's of London, whose underwriting Proud Alliance, insurance investigator George Engles, James Mason, shows that the Plane is leaving a powder that leaves its bait firefighter alone and out of control to blow the Fane's entire plan. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Anderson has become wise for both Fane and English who, unlike the Fane, want to undergo the Valley View Estates for reasons that have never been made clear. Just look at the last few seconds of the movie to realize it. It is author and director. The arson is exposed as he goes into his girlfriend, while Anderson comes to her rescue. We then have this game season scene with the arson just disappearing in the Valley View construction site, to set it on fire, with the help of Howard Anderson, where he finally burns a cookie, by the time the fire house emerged . off him. <br /> <br /> The sudden and inexplicable end has never made clear what exactly happened to the Great Cheese in this whole scheme of things the sinister and evil minded Julian Fane. It is as if the flight spot is shot-free and only its unstable and confused hooker, the arson, which was just the instrument of flight's crimes, eventually became the only person who paid them.
