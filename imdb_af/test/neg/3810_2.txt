I don't understand what the big hype about this movie was. All the horror sites said this movie has all the necessities of an 'old American slasher' flick that will satisfy your needs. - Although similar to an old American slasher movie, my needs were not yet satisfied. <br /> <br /> My big problem with this movie is that we are now in the 2000s, not in the 1980s. 1980's horror is the past and should remain in the past. Gravel flies have changed so much that older movies seem to be stocking and unrealistic. Although it's fun to watch, they don't offer the same realistic blood thirsty gores that the recent movies offer. <br /> <br /> Hatchet is cheesy, unrealistic and rightly horrible. If we wanted to see an old American slasher movie, I could just go back to Friday's 13th series, Elm Street Series Nightmare, or the Halloween series. I have to admit, the movie is better than some of the horror movies being released, but it's one of the worst. The jokes aren't funny and the actors are horrible. <br /> <br /> I will personally stay away from this movie and never look back.
