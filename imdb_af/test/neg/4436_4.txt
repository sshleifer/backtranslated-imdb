Quintet is the only business of both Paul Newman and director Robert Altman in the field of science fiction. Newman said he could not do comedy, but he tried until he finally achieved a real success in that genre with Slap Shot. But the failure of this movie embarrassed him and he never tried it again. <br /> <br /> This is one of the biggest downer movies I've ever seen. It's a futuristic ice age, brought by who knows what, but presumably it's a core winter. Even during the ice age of thousands of years ago, the equatorial parts of the earth still maintained animal and human life, but apparently not here. Seals survived and Paul Newman is a seal hunter on the outside. <br /> <br /> But hunters need a bit of R&R and Newman goes to a futuristic city where things are so boring, the natives played some kind of game with six people and that's kind of Russian roulette. To win you, five other players in your game must be killed. <br /> <br /> It is a sad turn to see where the man came. What is one of the reasons I just couldn't find in this story. The atmosphere is dark, the story is dark, the people are dark, it's so dark. No wonder this thing came to the box shortly. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that almost everyone thinks will never be on the top ten Paul Newman movies, including me. <br /> <br /> This is man's future, which is a bummer.
