If I say worse, I mean less entertaining. Todd Sheets has been learning some dumb camera tricks since the last Zombie Bloodbath, making the movie even less tolerant. In the last movie there were no special camera effects, where in this one we treated shaky jaws, and constantly switched to black and white. Also, it's called Zombie Bloodbath, despite the fact that the zombies are rare in this one. The film began in 1945, where some Satanists kill a violent burglary and set him up as a scarecrow. Back in modern times, some children have a car problem and go to a house, the same house in which Satanist murder took place. Some mean people are trying to rape the children (or something), and they bring back the scarecrow intrusion, which comes back with some zombies and now speaks like Darth Vader. Mr. Sheets strengthen the language and reduce violence. If you want to see what a bad movie is, it goes out! <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 96 minutes. Not rated, contains violence and language.
