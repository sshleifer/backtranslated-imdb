The Forgotten (AKA: Don't Look In The Cellar) is a very cheap and very cute horror movie. <br /> <br /> The story is very slow and never really reaches anything to get excited about. /> <br /> The patients at the asylum are embarrassing, especially Sam and the old woman who always quote an old saying to everyone. (Watch out for the little bit when she comes near the camera, tell me you can watch without laughing!). <br /> <br /> Now the gore is very poor, with the blood looking pink in many scenes so don't really deserve its place on the list of videos! <br /> <br /> Overall, if you're not looking for a fantastic horror movie and have time to save, it's worth a watch.
