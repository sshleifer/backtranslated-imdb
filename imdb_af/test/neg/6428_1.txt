Well, it was a complete waste of celluloid. The preview was promising, but looking at the movie, the preview seemed to be the whole movie. No plot, no clear story, just some wrong tension. The director seems to have tried very hard to create an atmosphere of mysticism and fear, but there are still gaps to be filled. Why the drugs? Why the number 11.11? (VAT While Sara enters the library, the clock says 11.14). What is the connection with the murder of the parents? What is the role of this Rayden woman? Is she one of the children or not? Who are the kids anyway. There is a lot of material running around to create the ultimate cult film like the Omen, but the director just lets them lie on the floor without digging into the story. Even the "Blairwitch project" was more frightening than that. All the gaps you would like to fill out as in "The Butterfly effect" remain open as the credits start rolling. OK. Off to the next movie ...
