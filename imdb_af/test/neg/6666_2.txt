I bought the DVD of this movie because I'm a fan of William Devane and I was really disappointed with a Christmas visitor. The story of the movie is so boring and slow in the development that you just want to turn off about half of your TV or DVD player. The dialogues are really bad and belong to a daily soap opera, but not in a TV movie. William Devane did well and he performed reasonably well, but he did so much better in other films and projects. Meredith Baxter was terrible and couldn't bring the hot-hearted mom to the viewers. Instead, she plays very cool and was no better than a middle-class actress. I absolutely can't recommend this movie. Save your time and money for this one.
