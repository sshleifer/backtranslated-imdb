I hate to be critical, but this one was really bad. I like the Baldwin brothers, I just wish there was more talent spread among them. I looked like the general plot, but there was just too much 'trying' and not enough real 'doing' as far as quality was concerned. <br /> <br /> My favorite character from the whole thing was a bald head. He reminded me of Dmitry Valtane (Jeremy Roberts, I believe) of Start Trek 6: Undiscovered Land. Just without the hair. <br /> <br /> If you have Hollywood Video's MVP program and really are trying to get your money's worth, then pass it on with one of the three MVP movies you add. It's worth a couple of laughs. <br /> <br /> The most impressive special effect throughout the show is the sound of Stephen Baldwin's gunfire. I guess it's a bit of the quality and excitement of the rest of the show.
