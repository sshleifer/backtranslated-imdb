It's hard to believe anyone can take such a good book and make such a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Imagine King Kong playing as an orange grind and Fay Wray's role by a young boy. How about Elton John as Rambo !!!! This movie is even worse than the TV remake of The Night of the Hunter. <br /> <br /> Using the title Watchers and Dean Koontz's name, the makers of this movie should be charged with fraud by readers of the book who expected a fairly accurate adaptation of the book. <br /> <br /> Read the book, I've never talked to anyone who didn't like it. Another good book is The Winner by David Baldachi.
