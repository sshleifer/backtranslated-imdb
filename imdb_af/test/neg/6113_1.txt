One day I watched television with a friend and we caught the last twenty minutes of "Going Bananas". Believe me when I say it's enough to get a good judgment from the movie. The first scene I saw was the monkey, the kid, the fat man and the black man who looked like Dave Chappelle and flying in thousands of feet in the air. While everyone else was solemn about the trip, the monkey appeared to be a kind of scarecrow, where he showed something that looked the English word quicker. They then landed on a 20-year-old port in Africa. After a heart farewell to where the monkey shouted (Hahahaha), the villains of the film appeared. They tore full ass in their vintage Cadillac when the evil monkey took an Air Jordan jump from the boat on the boat, sailing a clean 40 meters away and sinking their pretty car into the Pacific. Having seen this movie, I have a new purpose in life; to find the miniature that the monkey played and stabbed in the eye with a fountain pen.
