Hedy Lamarr, who was arrested by more men on the screen than any other actress, is again the alleged mistress of Kent Taylor, the soccer ghost boat and the whole world around the gear. On a boat from the Yucatan after Taylor gave her the brush, she tried suicide. But Doctor Spencer Tracy saves her from drowning in the Caribbean. <br /> <br /> Tracy is quite a medical fellow. I think he never heard the word specialist. He manages a clinic in Manhattan for the poor and his journey was a sideline in medical research. Lamarr and he marry and she tries to imagine him in her world and he even becomes a partner of community doctor Louis Calhern. Of course Kent Taylor the photo and the Hollywood inevitably happen. <br /> <br /> Seeing this woman, it seemed to me that the authors were heavily influenced by Tracy's Oscar-winning Boys Town. Unfortunately, his role as Dr. Karl Decker is not a patch on what he did as Father Flanagan. Maybe they were trying to give Father Flanagan such a little romance in his life in this movie. <br /> <br /> Tracy and Lamarr didn't get too well together. In fact, this film was mentioned I return this woman because the original director Joseph Von Sternberg walked from the film, presumably because Lamarr didn't work out for him like Marlene Dietrich did. She returned Lady of the Tropics and then MGM to film it with their contract director Woody Van Dyke, who was known for the speed of his productions. And a whole new supporting role has been introduced. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, both Spence and Hedy had better roles for them.
