I had more boring 80 minutes in my life, but there is not at the moment. Hell Ride is based on the retro cult 70 theme that Tarantino brought back, and done right, in movies like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. The problem with Hell Ride is, unlike PF and RD, the story is garbage and so is character development. How many movies does Bishop think he can steal? The brief case in Pulp Fiction, the Air Pistol in No Country, etc. Etc. What about the bishop, what does he do in this movie? I can't help but laugh at the scenes where he stands with his pelvis trusting and trying to look like a hardened biker. Nothing in this movie is credible. And why Dennis Hopper? Do they really need the Easy Rider motif? I blame Larry Bishop for his terrible plot and dialogue, not to mention his failed attempt at the lead. Don't bother watching this movie, it's a waste of time.
