I decided to watch this show and let it go, but I found it boring, and more importantly dull. Sow. <br /> <br /> There are too many sarcasm and the characters are all boring. , there is far too much talk and the character Lorelai ... just keep on and over and over and over ... At a second glance, the characters choke, the banter does not work and the whole love and romance thing just ruins who's already a crap show .... I can't believe this show survived the pilot. It seems to be a show that forces the 'Listen to your parents' line' .... No real drama exists. .... <br /> <br /> Staying a pilot ... and a pilot alone ...
