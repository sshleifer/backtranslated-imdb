"You know - I was in some towns where the girls weren't so beautiful. In fact, I am in some towns where they are really ugly. But this is the first time I've been in a town where there is no one at all" a girl. "I'm sure the fans of the great classics remember this phrase that belongs to Vin ... one of the VERY beautiful seven (of the first movie) ... Now I want to repeat him here again. You know - I saw movies where the plot is not so good. In fact, I saw movies where the plot is terrible, but it is the first time in my life that I have seen the movie where there is no plot at all. <br /> <br /> OK. Perhaps my above statement is, but honestly ... how to call the plot, a shit in this movie. The bad guy (oh, don't ask me to give you his name, because I don't remember and she's not even somehow close to Calvera whose name and character is unforgettable ...) try the church in the build name. of his late boys, killed in battle, and this bad man kidnapped poor villagers to force them to build the church ... first of all, how big must church have to force hundreds of people to build it ... is it an Egyptian pyramid or something? but okay, let's stop here about the plot and absolutely forgetful character of a bad guy and let's say few words about the seven itself ... <br /> <br /> Yul bryner's good old Chris, always calm, always quiet, talk less, but speak wisely is gone (unfortunately). Oh no ... he's as calm as he was ... but now he's calm, so fake you're not buying it. (Imagine, he meets a good old friend Chico, who should he save after so many years, and there are just a few "Hello" and not even a handshake (as far as I remember)) ... honestly, that Looks more like meeting two strangers in some internet chat, rather than meeting Chris and Chico. It makes "new Chris" look more like robocop or terminator rather than our beloved fashion quick gun ... <br /> <br /> I won't stop talking about other characters here. There is simply no ... not. (Imagine if strong actor such as Yul Brynner is forgotten as much as fake, then what other characters will look like) ... <br /> <br /> There are still some attempts to give us a background story for everyone of them ... for example, one is a favorite woman for women, the second is a man with a dark past whose wife was raped and killed by Indians and since then he has killed everyone and everything that moves. But not these characters make sense or they can take your heart. <br /> <br /> I remember being a small child and then O'reilly (Charles Bronson's character) died in the first movie I was. Here I just didn't care about each of them. Even if all the people die with all the crew of the movie, I don't care anymore. <br /> <br /> So, please, go and see this movie ... I recommend it because you won't have the other chance to see anything worse than that.
