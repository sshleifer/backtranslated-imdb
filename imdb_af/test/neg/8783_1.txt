This movie sucked! Don't even rent it! You hate it! The plot didn't make sense, the characters sucked and why was that penguin anyway the pebble? If that girl just wants to keep penguin out of him, because he has a nice pebble if the relationship is not based on love just for money! I didn't like this movie very much (Hate is such a strong word!). And penguins can't fly! Even if they believe what they can do, they can't. P.S. I'm not who you think I'm!
