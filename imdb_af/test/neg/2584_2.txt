This is clearly a French film. It's about young group of idealistic / revolutionary / anarchist people. It moves very slowly. Long take. LOng closeups. A minute or more devoted to an attempt to lift a pipe full of rabbit / opium. A long take on how a group crashes and burns a car. It is a black and white film. The captions were white, about a third of the time they were unreadable. (Why do they do that?) I went out after about an hour and three minutes when it became clear that this photo was nowhere, slow. I wasn't the first to walk out. It was the first time I walked out of my picture in my long life. (Well, maybe the second.)
