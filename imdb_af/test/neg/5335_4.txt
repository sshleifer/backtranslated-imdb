Maureen O'Hara is always beautiful and attractive. Here she plays an actress terminally ill. We don't know what. It is a precursor to Love Story in this regard. <br /> <br /> William Bendix is ​​good, like most of the supporting role players. John Payne is meant to grieve, but he seems asleep. The girl who plays the child he and O'Hara adopt, does her best with a complicated plot device: Of course! Accept an orphan. She will live after your wife's passing. It's a lovely movie, but it doesn't feel sincere. I was hoping to be moved. I was, by O'Hara's gentle performance. But I don't like to feel manipulated.
