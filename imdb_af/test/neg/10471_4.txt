.... OK, small village, clueless sheriff? Cheque. Sheriff's hot daughter? Cheque? Ne'er-well-boyfriend of Sheriff's hot daughter, who hates the sheriff? Cheque. Corporate land developer making people profitable? Cheque. Developer's rank-and-file accidentally unleashed a jungle monster, then pushed to cover it? Cheque. Native warning of mass death and destruction if things are not returned to the way they were? Cheque. Amateur CGI special effects that could be produced by a Commodore 64 computer? Cheque. Seriously, virtually all the clips of your typical Sci-Fi original movie are compacted in a classic, so bad-it-good movie. The only one missing is the scientist / expert to give his knowledge; There is a palaeontologist with three students who caught my The Bean Eater fairly early in the film, but they are basically extras in the movie. And I can honestly say that I have virtually all of this foreplay; right down to who survives and who is not (although I have to say I had the real death time of one of the characters wrong about an hour). I swear I could have done this movie myself if they gave me all the characters. Despite this, the movie is fun to watch, but for no other reason than playing MST3K with your friends. If you're a bit of an irreverent fun, it's a good movie to watch and that's why I give this movie a surprisingly respected 4, though it deserves a much lower rating for all purposes. But then you won't be watching a Scientific original movie again if you're looking for a movie with a real plot, substantive characters or good special effects?
