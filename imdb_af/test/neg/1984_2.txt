This film is sometimes called "The Story of O-Pt.2", which tries to leave it as a sequel to the erotic S&M thriller "The Story Of O". Although I have never seen the original version, I got to see this sorry mixed bag of sexual and social politics. I think the O-corner comes from the occasional S&M overtones (which were never so explicit (and unpleasant to watch) than those in 'Mistress'. Klaus Kinski is the only recognizable face in this French / Japanese production (but speaks its lines in English - at least in the version I saw.) The unnecessary use of surrealism just manages to make some boring examples in pseudo-porn even more pretentious (which they try to prove with the portrayal of a piano that floats in water?) It goes without saying that the manufacturers had to scrape the bottom of the barrel after they took out the whole "porn-chic" trend in the movie (ouch-sorry, bad pun!) / Art Cinema, so movie-goers had to be drunk like 'The Last Woman', and others like it.
