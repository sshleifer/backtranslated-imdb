I must admit, ashamed though I am, that it was one of my favorite all-time movies as an impressive teenager under this horror chiller. However, nine years after the first look at Stephen King's frightening story, I came to my senses and Fritz Kiersch's work could more reasonably be judged. <br /> <br /> Indeed, King's story of a small Nebraska farming community turned upside down by a young demonic preacher boy and his sadistic sidekick is really disturbing on paper, but it makes a cheap, average horror program selluloid. Many of these outcomes can be attributed to the fact that Kiersch makes it possible to become a hacker slasher almost the beginning of the film. Then the finals become a hocus-pocus special effect nightmare. <br /> <br /> The movie is reasonable, but they can portray as much credibility as it is incredible. Over the top movie they will allow it, and the soundtrack by Jonathan Elias is nicer than the photos. <br /> <br /> A real shame that George Goldsmith's script changed Stephen King's haunting short story into a shocking horror. Isaac, Malachai and all the other "Children of the Wheat" are actually not so terrible. <br /> <br /> Sunday, August 7, 1994 - Video
