I love how everyone is treating this show, as it was the next big American sitcom. I have seen five episodes of this horror, and the only person who came close to a real teacher was the old guy who hated and hated him in the same way. The rest of them were just nice people trying to read the lines written by people who never actually went into a real classroom. I loved how every episode from the two idiots (one lying and the other not being) became a form of difficult trouble that indirectly involved their students. The British girl who thought she had found a good quality in the head, but somehow it was shocked that he had become a jackass. The hot chick that was there for the specific purpose of being hot, and the principal and her brother who somehow served, moved the almost non-existent plot forward. I loved how almost all the teachers on this show were very young, but I ask you to think back to your high school days and remember the teachers you had. . . did they look like that? Or did you go to high school teaching middle-aged people? This is the high school everyone else is going to do. The show had no form of research on what happened in schools. In public schools, principals do not have the power to higher and fire teachers, but the school board does, but in every episode I watched, the principal had threats to fire her teachers. Think back to your history class. . . . . or think of any history class, have you ever seen an incredibly hot British chick? Learn an American History Class? No. Have you ever seen a teacher's lounge so big that you can actually play basketball? No. <br /> <br /> Teachers could have been a good show if it was basically in some form of reality. What makes curriculum the stories you get from interacting with students, and the teachers find it funny because they handle the day and day of the students. The overemphasis of their lives beyond education has made it just four camera sitcoms that had unrealistic people in an unrealistic environment that says unrealistic lines. I'm sorry, I just didn't buy it. The show could have modeled itself on other successful sitcoms and used a single camera format, and it had to be more about the teacher's relationships with their students and not with each other. <br /> <br /> It gets a star to try and a star for the hot chick (she was really hot). <br /> <br /> In the end, it was a failed sitcom that declined in history as a hacking profession. I just hope that if they make another sitcom based on the teaching that they learn from their mistakes, then a monstrosity like this will never touch the television screen.
