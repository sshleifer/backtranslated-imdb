What. Uh ... <br /> <br /> This movie is so dissociative and messy that I literally lost some of my common sense after it was over. I will never be the same person again. I'm trying to get my finger on what is exactly as crazy. It's not just the hilarious techno music, or the "out-of-time" medieval / Blade Runner / Wild West / Highlander area, or the weird CGI "Grendel" monster that looks like a man made from animated sausages. or even the "Grendel's mother" sample, which resembles an Alabama table dancer who grew claws and tentacles when she stayed tanning for too long. All of this is strange, but what is actually the strangest thing in this movie is the play. I simply can't explain. Of course, this writing is completely stupid, but the actors evade deadly seriousness through it all. Lambert is always strange and usually boring, but for this one he went in the Dolph Lundgrin area. I can't help but just start laughing every time he speaks. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie credit to be completely scattered and crazy as opposed to conservative and boring. I will always take a bizarre disaster of a movie about a completely mediocre one. <br /> <br /> Warning: if you plan to watch Christopher Lambert as Beowulf, be prepared to spend a few hours wandering the streets in some nightmare, hyperactive catatonic folly. It is true. When I was on my Beowulf spirit journey, I woke up in the middle of the Siberian tundra in a pool of blood and milk. There was a dead wolf next to me, and I later found I had a handful of human teeth in my shirt bag. My VHS copy of Beowulf was on a hurriedly built stone altar in the vicinity, trapped with candles and wilted flowers. The band told me to walk. I got up and I walked.
