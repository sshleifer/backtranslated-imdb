I'm almost a two-decade old man who reads most of my life comics. I'm not a big fan of the Fantastic Four, but I'm pretty familiar with them. In 1994, Roger Corman (B-role legend) produced the first, feature-length, Fantastic Four movie feature length. The result was such a pure shock that it was never released. Yet copies, mostly on the net and at conventions, exist. If you are looking for a laugh and find a copy, do yourself a favor and look at this thing. <br /> <br /> The movie repeats the FF's origins and a meeting with Doctor Doom and a villain named The Jeweler, basically the mole man with a penchant for small lesions. As in the case of these cartoon films, everything must be in everything. The FF therefore plays an important role in the development of dr. Doom. He and the Jeweler play an important role in them. <br /> <br /> First of all, I just want to mention that despite everything that went wrong in this movie, I really liked the guy who did Doom. He doesn't get many decent lines, but when he does, he hits them. The armor also looks good. <br /> <br /> As for the rest ... it's a dirty, dirty mess. Bad plots, bad acting, bad effects, bad stuff basically. Angry especially for Jay Underwood, who overworked the word than Johnny Storm. He does not persuade, he is extremely. <br /> <br /> As for the FF, well, they seem right, and Sue is played by a very attractive actress, but they don't look like a real team. For one thing, they have no reason for Sue and Johnny to go into space. In an early section, Ben and Reed are going to watch the two, Johnny's like 8 and Sue. It's just to make their ultimate romantic mating a bright, many creepier. The Thing costume looks more repetitive than anything else, not very rocky, and the only time the human torch is actually a human torch resembles the Silver Surfer tinted red. <br /> <br /> I could write hours, but I think the best-summed up scene is a climb with the aforementioned non-human torch. He recommends a laser beam, and he eventually destroys it with a punch. Yes, a punch. A laser beam. With a punch. Then he flies around and goes "Yippeee!" a whole lot, after which the camera settles and he flies back TOWARD EARTH. Apparently, the intellectuals have forgotten to inform Johnny that fire does not exist in the vacuum of space. These and many other scenes work like Looney Toones, if the character doesn't know they are over a cliff, they don't fall. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I cried, I was glad it was never released.
