CAMP BLOOD <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.33: 1 (Nu-View 3-D) <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> While Walking In The Forest Near The Desert camp Blackwood - place of an unsolved murder ten years earlier - four young city dwellers are targeted by a masked psychopath who kills their guide (Courtney Harris) and stole them through murderous intentions ... <br /> <br / > Low-rent time waster, filmed on the camcorder using the Nu-View sequential 3-D format. There is at least a plot, but the script is closely related to an established blueprint (obviously nodding like "Friday 13th", "The Burning" and "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre") without anything. add new interesting to the formula. Director Brad Sykes - also responsible for similar 3-D efforts such as THE ZOMBIE CHRONICLES (2001) and BLOODY TEASE (2002) - mention the early works of George A. Romero and Sam Raimi as major influences on his career, but while those filmmakers challenged Sykes uses video technology as a mainstream with its non-budget efforts merely to emulate its films, leading to a home movie with delusion. Apart from the 3-D format, there is NOTHING here to justify someone's attention. Followed by CAMP BLOOD 2 (2000).
