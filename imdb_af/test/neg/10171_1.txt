Like many of the comments above me, I also had the average scifi movie, but unfortunately it wasn't. I found it satisfactory and indeed proclaimed. <br /> <br /> But that's not the only comment. The screens are very 'artificial' (not like in scifi, as I explain a few minutes). (The next sentence is a small spoiler.) The movie is more or less a discussion between two groups. The physical setting of a discussion typically involves two or three men standing side by side, the middle one typically speaking. In the worst case, the other party is represented by one person. <br /> <br /> The interviewers' interviews are also very artificial, sometimes even unprofessional. For example, sometimes the conversation between the reporters (I mean, from an interrogation, "akward"). In addition, the maintenance staff remain calm, they say everything without normal emotions. That is, you can't say whether they lie or not, are crazy or not. <br /> <br /> It's also very unprofessional. The Christian reporters always believe everything they tell by the people they question. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: <br /> <br /> All conversations include: <br /> <br /> facts <br /> <br /> - pro / con arguments <br /> <br /> There are no lies. Nobody lies. (The next sentence is a destroyer, ignore if you are still planning to watch the movie.) The only lie that happens is to demonstrate how bad non-believers are. <br /> <br /> It makes me conclude that the movie is a B-movie. It is very similar to 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' (from the 50's), but this movie also has annoying, wrong conversations about strangers and Christian faith. <br /> <br /> PLEASE NOTE: I'm not going to offend Christians, people who believe in aliens or whatever. It's a thought I have about the movie, not people. <br /> <br /> I would also like to note that I do not know if the actors are bad or have just given terrible scripts.
