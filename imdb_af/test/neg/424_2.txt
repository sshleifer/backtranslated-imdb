THE EXPERT, starring Jeff Speakman, is the definition of DULL !!! <br /> <br /> Deaf, characters, dull situations, dull direction, dull actors, dim cinematography, dull music. <br /> <br /> I really don't understand this movie. Is it supposed to be an action movie? It's almost as if Speakman wanted to be in a serious movie, but the level of acting and writing found in the expert is below your average TV drama. And there are some typical "Speakman pummeling bad guys" scenes here and there, but the main aspect of the movie is based on some kind of credible drama. It is totally wrong for Speakman or is so badly directed that it just doesn't work with the action star. In the end, this tangled movie seems to be very indescribable and soft. The worst thing about the expert is the music. The composer is a Jerry Goldsmith wannabe, with his pompous and melodramatic score, which simply doesn't belong in this kind of (dim) movie. It was as if the producers knew they had a very dull product on their hands and they asked the composer to make the film more compelling and dramatic with his score, which made the whole movie even more confused, goofier and dull look. <Br /> <br /> Don't waste your time, even if you're a Jeff Speakman fan.
