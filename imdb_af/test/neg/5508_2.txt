I am a fan of Jess Franco's bizarre style and a beloved even of his trashier movies and my personal opinion is that he has created several masterpieces, such as the brilliant "Paroxismus aka", besides several very entertaining movies. Venus In Furs, 1969, for example. However, it is an unmistakable fact that the 180+ movies targeted this highly productive filmmaker in his career, including a bunch of great stinkers. "Sadomania" of 1981 is definitely one of those stinkers, just a very bad and plot less movie with the ability to carry hell out of you despite constant sleaze and nudity. <br /> <br /> Certainly, the constant Nudity will entertain you for 20 minutes, but as it continues and so on, you will get bored after a short time. The only thing that really watched me was the intensity of the sleaze, which is generously speaking, a little amusing. <br /> <br /> After some newlyweds lost in the desert on an island, they were stopped by a lot of topless women carrying guns, custodians of a local prison camp. As the man is banned from the island, the woman is taken to the prison camp, a place of torture and sexual humiliation, ruled by the sadistic nymphomania Magda and an extremely distorted governor. The prisoners are, of course, completely hot chicks, most of them are blondes, the warders are completely topless women wearing guns. <br /> <br /> Of course, the plot, if you can name it, is very stupid, but who will see it for a good plot now. The (only) interesting thing about "Sadomania" is the high level of exploitation, even for a "Women In Prison" movie. There are probably two short scenes in the movie where we see that a woman is actually wearing a top, the sleaze contains all sorts of sexual perversions from rape to bestiality, and some of the torture scenes are really nasty. <br /> <br /> It is amazing, however, that a movie with this extreme level of sleaze can still be so boring. The sleaze will keep you going in the beginning, but after the first 45 minutes I actually had a hard time not to fall asleep. It also makes me wonder why Jess Franco, of all pornstars, chose Ajita Wilson, which, according to most sources, was a transsexual who was born a man (well, perhaps that reason). If you really want to see it, make sure you have enough beer at home to watch it and just look for the sleaze and exploitation (and perhaps for the slight unintentional fun factor). Don't expect to be highly entertaining, but it's almost unbelievable how a movie with such a sleaze level can be so boring. I'm a Jess Franco fan and I'll always be, but "Sadomania" is just bad. 10/02
