It is one of Shakespeare's joys that there can be no definite performances - no single show can be right, but some may be wrong, and this one is. There are at least two things about Hamlet that cannot be completed: 1. His impudence and inability to undertake any kind of action. For the sake of God, this is what keeps the game going for as long as it does. If you had Othello there instead of Hamlet, Claudius would be dead at the end of Law One. Any production should try to explain why Hamlet is delaying why it is unable to act. 2. His sexual dislike. His total aversion to the thought of his mother and uncle getting up in bed fills him with a complete dislike of all sexual things. That means any kind of relationship with Ophelia is impossible. At the slightest hint of sex, Hamlet throws up. So what does Mel Gibson give us? Funny action man. You can't get any further from the character of Hamlet if you tried. There are many ways Hamlet can be played, but it is not one of them! What I don't understand is because they managed to get such good actors for the other parts - Claudius, Polonius and so forth, why couldn't they find one to play Hamlet. Mark Rylance in the section would have made it a wonderful movie. This Mel Gibson, whoever he is, releases the rest of the roll. And we can see it, Hamlet doesn't really work without the prince.
