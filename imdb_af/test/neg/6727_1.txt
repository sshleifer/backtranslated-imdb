First: I like S Segal! But in this movie he hit the ground and started digging! <br /> <br /> THE PLOT What plot? Very strange and incredible plot. <br /> <br /> THE ACTIONS AWAY WITH Segals Standards! <br /> <br /> THE GOOD PARTS Mr Segal is a pro. And show it. This is it. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY I could write a better writing for Mr Segal (and did it). If you read this Stephen, send me a better script to make a better movie! The only realistic part is the one true ... (see spoiler part). <br /> <br /> SPOILER PART (stop reading here if you plan to see the movie!) - - - Gas leak? Wow. It's a black box recorder in a hotel room? I work in the industry, ridiculous! The bad guy gets 'gone', so much is true in life!
