Beethovan Lives Upstairs is a very bad movie. In my World History class, our teacher looked at this movie and Amadeus to compare the two composers or something. We first looked at Amadeus and it was a very good movie, but when she watched us at this movie, I couldn't believe what I saw. The acting was terrible, the costumes were ugly (the little boy was particularly ugly and girlish), and the cinematography was z-grade. My friend compared it to a home movie without the date display in the lower right corner. I understand it was a T.V. movie from Canada and probably earned $ 10, but please. They could have done better. I saw some good TV movies in my time, but it wasn't one of them. The biggest thing I do not understand is why my world history class could not only see immortal beloved or something. How is it possible to compare composers when they gave the movie Amadeus, Mozart and Beethovan Lives Upstairs, to Beethovan? It is not possible to do this if it is the choice of a movie for Beethovan. I give Amadeus an A (9 out of 10) if anyone cares to know, but Beethovan Lives Upstairs gets a F (1 out of 10).
