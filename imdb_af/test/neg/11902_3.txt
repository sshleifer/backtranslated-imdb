This is a bad movie, as the central message is very stunned and the plot seems to be the result of the merging of various divergent scripts. As a result, it does not make sense at all and certainly not a movie. Miss Dunne or Mr. Huston had been proud of the making. However, the movie is worth checking out if you are a fan of "Pre-Code" movies because it contains an incredibly messy plot that says pretty girls aren't smashing - even if they aren't married and all is their partner IS !! <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Miss. Dunne as a social worker helping troops travel to Europe for WWI. In the process she met a scalag (Bruce Cabot) who eventually convinced her to sleep with him. She became pregnant and then continued with the next unsuspecting woman. However, Miss Dunne doesn't want him back because she realizes he's not worth it, but later her baby dies at birth. While all these very controversial plural elements are being used, they are always pointed out - almost as they wanted the adults to know in the audience, but hoped that if they were to print it out or film correctly, children in the audience would be clueless (Movies have not been evaluated and children can attend any movie at this stage.) <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, this entire plot ends with a still-born baby and Cabot is about 1/4 of the way through the movie and becomes never mentioned or referred again. It was as if they had filmed a movie and dropped it. In this second phase of the film, Miss Dunne is unexpectedly starting to work at a women's prison (although we really never see her doing anything there). What we see are many terrible scenes of serious abuse and torture that are likely to be titled. And because of all this violence goes to me. Dunne on a crusade to clean the prison and become a reformer and famous writer. <br /> <br /> But then, out of the blue, another kind of movie comes up and the women's prison reform business goes along the way. Dunne meets a married judge (Walter Huston), but he wants her desperately. Dunne is now portrayed by the film as a very good girl - even though she had unmarried sex with Cabot (she was more or less tricked). But now, only Irene, who is a tireless reformer and good lady, starts sleeping with a married man. He tells her that he and his wife are alienated and only married in the name, but she never thinks to investigate whether it is true, and with his assurance she flies off her clothes and they are in the baby business! BUT, while she is pregnant with his love child, he is charged with being a crooked judge. He assured her that he was innocent, but he was found guilty and seemed to be a rogue. Use inside information from people who came before his bank to get a fortune. Then, in the last moments of the film, Miss Dunne tries in vain to free him and vows to wait with the child until Huston is released. That movie then ends. <br /> <br /> So, basically we have three separate movies and a bizarre early 30s idea of ​​how a pretty girl should be. I gathered that she must be a strong working girl who immediately becomes an idiot in her personal relationships! It really upsets all of Dunne's positive character and it's really hard to imagine anyone enjoying the movie. A strong female lawyer can easily offend against how weak and needy she is and religious people can presumably regard her as completely amoral or at least morally! With a decent rewrite, it could be a good movie or at least interesting as a debaucherous and cowardly movie, but it couldn't be what it wanted to be and was just another dull Pre-Code movie.
