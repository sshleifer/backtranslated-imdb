Well, this was my first IMAX experience, so I was especially blown away by it; Although I can help afterwards, I wish it was another (less-black-white) movie. <br /> <br /> Beautiful Destruction had much the "School Program" as it all listed astronauts and it made it feel like reading the National Geographic Magazine in 3D. Oddly enough, it actually has a very two-dimensional quality that has only occasionally exploded into reality and much time has felt like a PowerPoint presentation. There was a moment in the movie when an unmarked abyss opened; seemingly to you, who had a bit of a WOW factor, but to be honest, it might have been more about me as an IMAX virgin. <br /> <br /> The comments provided by Tom Hanks personally found many, (which is a nice way to set it?) "Flag-wavingly nationalistic" that has not come down too well in Central London not, judge by comments we have heard. <br /> <br /> All in all, I loved the IMAX experience, but wanted to have another movie on that day. The Moon is not a particularly colorful subject and to be honest, many of the 3D effects in the monochrome landscape have been lost. All that was good was not for the documentary inputs and distractions like the interviews with American schoolchildren who spoiled it
