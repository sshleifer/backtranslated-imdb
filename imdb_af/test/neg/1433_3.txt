This movie was one of the most boring horror movies I've seen long ago (and I've seen a lot). Personally, I liked the piercing taking up everything that was original, but it was quite incompatible. I couldn't be Dee Snider as an actor or as a singer. I seemed to have tried everything he said to make it a memorable quote, which they were not. I can get free movies and I still didn't think it was worth the time.
