This is the type of movie that lets you admire what your past admiration for a particular director has before you stop and remind you that there are very few people whose body of work does not contain any clunkers. <br /> <br /> The Casting in Lelouch's movies is of the utmost importance because he places the viewer in such intimacy with the characters. The actors need to bring real screen magic to reach the intensity. Otherwise, it's not hollow. <br /> <br /> None of the actors in this movie, in my opinion, had any of those screens. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons and Patricia Kaas went far short of the leaders. Irons is a talented actor, but he was wrong for this part. Loving villain did not tackle his strengths. His brand of charm also hit a fake note here. Iron's persona is too decadent-toned to fit into a Lelouch love story. <br /> <br /> Although I would hesitate to give any opportunity to hear an English accent, I also think an American actor would have worked better in this role. So many of the songs that Kaas sings have been so carefully identified with the Americans of the particular lyric that it was a pity that Jeremy Irons was playing love - although it didn't really matter. It somehow screwed the flow of the movie. At least for me. <br /> <br /> Of course it had to be the right American. I think George Clooney would have been great in that part. And he would have brought the screen magic into spades. Brad Pitt also did a very good job delivering his particular combination of charming and edgy. <br /> <br /> I was also very disappointed with Patricia Kaas. In her reading I learned that she has a very successful career as a singer and many supporters, so what do I know, but I found her screen presence as a singer very boring. She was actually a much better actress in her talkative than she was a singer in the scenes in which she had to interpret and sell a song. Nothing she sang moved me. She was pleasant, but fatter. <br /> <br /> By contrast, someone like Kate Hudson, who is not a professional singer and only voice coach, has treated French one million times better. Not to mention all that wonderful French talent out there that could be awaited. It was distressing to see Patricia Kaas taking up space when there are so many charismatic French actresses that can be thrown instead. <br /> <br /> The music was so important in this movie, it couldn't really work without the music working. And since Kaas did so poorly in this respect, the movie never really had a chance. <br /> <br /> Lelouch made the fate of this movie when he threw Patricia Kaas. JMO.
