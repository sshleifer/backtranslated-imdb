Killer Flood: The Day the Damn Broke: 1/10: Finally a movie whose title spoiler has been proven. Even by the low standards of disaster films, apology, allow me to correct myself, even by the low standards of TV disaster movies, it's really awful. Where do I start? <br /> <br /> The dam model can once have seen a dam photo, but I doubt it. Most dams, especially generators who generate electricity, have o I do not know a power station in the area, some locks for water to walk through, even a high voltage electric wire or two. <br /> <br /> The dam is also somewhat understaffed. Two, they count, two employees staff the whole dam, all three shifts. And the workers are apparently imported from a clich√©d famous world war two movie, as they had heroic and rather unnecessarily long paintings of death, complete with photos of grandchildren who swing. Heck, one of them is able to be shot by the dam himself in a way that gives description. <br /> <br /> The special effects consist of flowing water set up in the pictures of the town, in a method that resembles a 1960s Godzilla movie like the Matrix. A three-year drawing with a blue crayon on the film stock would have achieved better results. Since the disaster money shots are worthless, how is the rest of the movie? <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the script and play are following the special effects. It's not a rough diamond. It's the rough. So is it a guilty pleasure? Killer Flood is awful enough to generate a few laughs and the film itself has that serious incompetence that makes a good cult classic, but bad disaster movies must age like a good wine. It is also doubtful that Michelle Green, who is hiding from the flood in a dumpster with a gold retriever, will ever match the big Henry Fonda being peeled by raisins that must be deadly bees. Look back with me in 2024.
