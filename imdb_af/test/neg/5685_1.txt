I have no idea what these people think when they made this movie. No plot, very limited action, and what is the third person's comment throughout the movie ???? Instead of walking around on the planet to shoot at all these sites, they had to spend money on screenwriters and actors. What was there was common. It was 90 minutes of my life, I will never be able to come back again. I have to pay the director for the cost of renting this movie. To the director and writers of this movie .... please go out now. This movie should have a marker on the front for boredom. The only good thing I can say about this movie is the computer generation. It's good as is gender. This movie should never have a prosecution .... ever.
