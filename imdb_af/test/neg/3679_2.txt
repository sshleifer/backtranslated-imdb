While in Madrid, I was able to see a screenshot of this movie. Wow! Gallo is incredible in it. Very unusual performance he gives. However, apart from Gallo's genius, the movie is a dull movie I've ever seen in my life and sometimes it's so bad it is eager. I'm also a Val Kilmer fan, so he was part of the reason I made such a great effort to watch the movie. The problem is that Val is just in one scene. With its name in the role as lead, it's an insult to my intelligence and to the rest of the role. I just saw other directors from the directors. Both films are far below average, but both feature very interesting Vincent Gallo performances. If you are as much as a Gallo fan, I see this movie, no matter how bad it is. If you don't like Gallo, then there is NO left to love.
