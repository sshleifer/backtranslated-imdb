I survived the first hour of this and returned the last ten minutes, just to say I saw the end. If you want * real * mythology done flawlessly, look for Armand Assante's "The Odyssey." Big story telling doesn't have to be cut - the stories are fantastic on their own. I just hope Sean Astin needs the money. And Sophocles and Ovid must be buried in their graves - wherever they may be. <br /> <br /> At least with Sorbo's version, the tongue was ruthlessly beaten in the cheek - we knew it was mostly balderash, but perhaps enough was interest. Generated in the background to send someone to the library. I'm surprised. Halmi can point out something so amusing (the TV series) and it comes with something that is without quality.
