Crazy Six is ​​torture, it must be Albert Pyun's worst movie. Even Blast and Ticker is better! I can't believe how boring this movie is! How did it even grow? I saw this movie about 3 years ago and the only thing I remember is how bad it was. It's not a good bad movie, it's just bad, bad, bad, bad, bad movie. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 (½ out of *****)
