Like a terrible cancer raining out of the air, I turned the crocodile into a crocodile the other night. As a fan of bad movies, and actively involved in the purchase and viewing of the bad movie, I was inspired by the idea of ​​a truly horrifying search movie that comes from modern times. Then I turned my hands inexplicably against me, grabbed anything in the reach and crossed over my head and neck. There was something sinister in the band ... Err ... where was I? Anyway, these ranks among the more embarrassing bad bits of film I run. William Forsythe can't play more than one character, and that character is always a joke. Even when set in a comical background and given things to do and it's supposed to be funny (Ala Deuce Bigalo), he's laughing the wrong way. Erika Eleniak is very similar, with her honest share of the horrible movies and doing terrible work in all of them. She does not help to deflate this one. Classic bfil rogue Andrew Divoff does a respected job, but hardly even has a beauty to chew. Even trustworthy assistance for b-movie Daniel Bernhardt fails to deliver entertainment. Regarding the film's own merit, the plot is vague, the script, like the action and the plot movement, is both boring and ... good, stupid, due to the lack of a better adjective (Lord knows they are not anybody who has seen enough movies has seen some bad people, and anyone who has seen enough bad people can learn to appreciate them, but there is simply nothing here to enjoy unless you are one of the most bad movie tolerant and just as inclined to test your mettle. Before you do that, take it away from me, this one is not even terrible enough to enjoy (other than to say ... some of the more ridiculous Italian zombie movies) A ​​fan of the b-movie action would be much better to watch most of Bernhardt's other films, or rather anything else ever set in. America is simply not the place to go Don't go, it looks, especially now, and if you have an urge, look at something from the se e, movies like Heroic Duo or the slightly less common Hakaider (along with anything else in the incredible Keita Amemiya's cannon) will offer much more fun and better action than you need to find elsewhere, especially here.
