I have never heard of this movie before I caught it on the telly last night. I hope it's never been given a cinema release, as it would be an insult to the silver screen and movie goers. <br /> <br /> Was it supposed to be serious, was it supposed to be funny? Why the outrageous basic plot? Does anyone care? ... <br /> <br /> Awful movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10
