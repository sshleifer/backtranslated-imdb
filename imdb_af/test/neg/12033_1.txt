First, let me start by making this film SOUNDED very interesting: a serial killer who is copying the works of Edgar Allan Poe (which is one of my writers of all time). Sounds cool, right? Yes, definitely not. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Ever. And it's not an exaggeration. I saw many very, very bad movies. This one takes the cake. And I was even prepared for a bad movie before I entered it. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the author should have studied some law enforcement procedures: If you have the name of the killer, his entire life's history is a criminal record, and HIS ADDRESS, where is the first thing that you have to look? Hmm. . . possible. . . his home? What ?! NO! This is a deadly idea, Anthony! How can you give something so obvious and flat to go to a building line? * spoilers end * Honestly, sometimes I can forgive a movie if the writing is good, but the acting is bad or vice versa. . . <br /> <br /> I think my biggest pet spot was how the police / FBI acted. <br /> <br /> For example: Black FBI Agent: "Good, Endangered Woman, just sit in the car here in an empty parking lot while I go inside and look at the potential crime scene where a serial killer is supposed to be "Sounds good to you?" Moronic Female FBI Agent: "Yes, it sounds good to me. Go straight ahead. I'll probably not focus on my environment or at least check the perimeter." Black FBI Agent: "Excellent, that's what I'd do!" Honestly, if you want to be in law enforcement, hire this movie so you can learn how not to act. . . or if you are a man and want to learn the same. <br /> <br /> 0.5 / 10: Half a point just to get a movie made in stores. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
