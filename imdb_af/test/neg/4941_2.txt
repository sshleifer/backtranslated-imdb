Don't choose this one. **** Spoiler Alert ***** The plot of this aggravating bad movie is four friends who are spoken to take the airport shuttle by an avid driver. On the shuttle with them is a little milquetoast looking for business type. <br /> <br /> Shortly in their journey, the shuttle driver takes an exit and an ugly driver tries to get off the road. The end result is that they get a flat tire. The driver gets one of the people on the shuttle to help change the band and the jack slips and the guys' fingers are smashed between the tire and the shuttle. It is at this point that the driver reveals himself as a kidnapper and has taken all the people hostage. <br /> <br /> Now the movie becomes very slow and boring, because the characters do one thing to another. One of the men is killed to escape - even there is no tension. Finally, it is revealed that the milquetoast is the man in the chicks with the driver when milquetoast man kills the other male friend by hitting his throat. <br /> <br /> There are a few attempts to escape the women. Milquetoast is beaten over the head with a band of iron, but he survives. <br /> <br /> The driver is also beaten and somehow survived a head on collision with a high speed fence while kneeling along the steering wheel. Somehow he didn't go through the window or even seriously injured with a windshield collision. Still, the woman driving the shuttle became unconscious - but she had a steering wheel to protect her and he had nothing between him and the windshield. <br /> <br /> Eventually he can suppress the women and get an underground garage that is a front for human trafficking. One of the women died. The other puts the driver in the leg with a good piece of broken mirror and shoots in the head, but he is capable (in which should be a severely impaired condition - severe blood loss, two head injuries and a large leg bone) around her. drag from the shuttle, drag her to a big crate, throw her in and close it, all the time with her to fight him. <br /> <br /> Now, some people admire the message of the film about trafficking and how it's going on today. This is a serious problem. But, to make an extremely boring movie about the subject, it doesn't give a higher rating.
