It's one of those road movies that wants to tell you a lot about women, the universe, the better life, the terrible loneliness of the brilliant Manhattan architect, which includes all links with everyone, including his three-year-old child. It may seem irresponsible to some. In fact, the hero hands off when it comes to egoism and the scene with his old school couple, starting as a good old-age conversation and ending on a threatening note, is the oasis in a desert movie. <br /> <br /> The scene with the father-to-left-home-a-wash-a child was told and told and said. Of course, it did not prevent the offspring from coming out of life. And if you see the hero's wife's attitude, you might think she should never have heard of woman's lib. <br /> <br /> Best is the soundtrack that features excellent songs by Willie Nelson, Tom Waits or Bonnie Raitt ... But you can enjoy them without this boring pretentious work.
