Talk about false advertising! I wasted an hour and twenty-five minutes looking at this piece of shit and there was not one casual dress, not one platform shoe, no pointed finger dancing, not a single disco ball. I watched it on a Saturday night and ended up with a terrible fever, but it has nothing to do with the music. <br /> <br /> Seriously, with or without John Travolta, this movie is sucked. <br /> <br /> From the opening scene you will ask the question: "Where does the rope come from and will it hang me?" From the trivial prejudice against the rich abilities of the Pennsylvania Dutch, to the scameless advancement of the seemingly eternal abilities of Alienware laptop batteries, to the inexpensive horror effects brought directly from the Japanese theater, it is the worst movie to hit theaters since The Grudge.
