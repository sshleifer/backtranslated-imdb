This movie is really strange. Clearly, some of the events depicted identify the main character as the Dublin criminal known as "The General", but almost everything is just wrong. We are not talking about a distortion of ancient history ... but a complete distortion of irrefutable, documented facts. The question is why? The garda is shown as Keystone Cops, his gang as non-threatening, and the man himself as Kevin Spacey. Almost pure fiction anyway, why worry about trying to give a look of realism? To say all this, it's a poor exercise * any way you want to see it. Not a second of anyone's time.
