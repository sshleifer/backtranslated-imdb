History teacher Mrs Tingle seems to be Leigh Ann Watson, who has her heart to get a school scholarship. She still receives a low grade from Tingle, which doesn't help. When one of her classmates Luke steals the paper from the final history exams and puts it in her pocket, Mrs. Tingle it out. She threatens the three that she is going over, but he is not available. So before, she reports it the next morning. Leigh, her friend, Jo Lynn and Scott, went to her the night and tried to convince her not to tell the principal. But because of Tingle's stubbornness, it finds themselves drastic to stop it. <br /> <br /> If I hadn't seen it before, and looking at another, I'm not one. Author Kevin Williamson was on a role after playing the successful contemporary teenage horror movies; 'Scream (1996)', 'I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997)', 'Scream 2 (1997)' and 'The Faculty (1998)'. He played the success (also not forgetting the TV show 'Dawson's Creek'), but this project will be the final hit. The difference there, compared to this entry, was different from writing the script, and he also made his debut. The strange thing, however, was that I found his direction to be proficient, but the material he got odorless and tired. It looked like it had become a black comedy and straight-out player, without making it gel. The script is tinkering with fast, turbulent gags, trivial regions and clumsy references to other films, but the problem is that it is too watery with so many faced developments and juicy moral streams that disrupt the flow. The broken script had to be stronger and stronger, as it is a small-scale production that feels like you are watching a stage show because of its mostly limited sets. It tries to play mental games with the characters, but these moments are there to serve the story's poor progress only in a pool of stupidity and senselessness. The end of the movie takes the cake. Williamson's polished direction is healthy, but more so in a pedestrian way, so it has no tension and pacing can really get going even with its solid environment. You finally feel it to the halfway point, and it shows how small the story is. The performances are acceptable enough, but if not for Helen Mirren's elegant, icy portrayal of manipulative skills such as Mrs. Tingle and an exciting Marisa Coughlan were not, we would have held to watch a fleeting, fine shoe Katie Holmes. Barry Watson is modest in his slacker part and Molly Ringwald has a lesser role. The soundtrack packs enough energy, but I have sharply overshadowed it and found it formless in its choices. <br /> <br /> Viewable but mechanically everywhere.
