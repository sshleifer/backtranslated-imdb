It's a very unpleasant performance. This is actually an example of how low television has fallen since 'reality' became silent. Tanya is beautiful, but she is also extremely rude and has terrible taste. Is a Home Appeal the Place for Sex Appeal? Apparently some men look like the show because they find Tanya attractive. The other boss is not beautiful, but he is so rude and also has terrible taste. It is a pity that so many homes should be shown while someone is still living in them. Most of the people who are allegedly viewing these homes before making changes should move into brand new homes or completely empty people so they will not offend anyone. Most of them. Like the 'crew' .. ways have to be learned. I can imagine how terrible the British performance is, as British reality courts are even worse when it comes to ways and tastes. <br /> <br /> What happened to the Arts and Entertainment channel? When it started (and a few years later) it was full of delicacies. Now it's a big garbage machine.
