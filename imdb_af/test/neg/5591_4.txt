It's one of those movies I just knew I'd hate, but it didn't get as bad as one would expect. <br /> <br /> It has lots of T&A in it and even the DVD menu is shocked. full of women's chest. The first few scenes of the movie have lots of sex and nudity and I started thinking there would be no story, just to exploit nudity for making money from a popular prequel 8MM. <br /> <br /> As I continue to watch, there were only more sex and nudity and main characters I could give less, but then the story began to unfold and I began to see something and it was a a little better. <Br /> <br /> It's about a man whose fianc√© is the daughter of an Ambasador and they all have a promising future until new photos of a menage, a wedding sex action and extortion are in the transmitter cards. The man and his fiance must now be at the bottom of whom the photos are sent and how to close them. <br /> <br /> In the first place, the film is nothing to do with part 1, it doesn't even have anything to do with 8MM's, it's about a sex video, although I can see the similarities, so small as they may be. <br /> <br /> The acting is not good or bad, it is just nobody who plays parts that anyone can do. The production value of the films is in the middle of the road and its pure drama yawns. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed going along for the ride coming at the bottom of the blackmailers' motives. I expected answers much more than I can say to the first one I consider to be rubbish. This movie also has some nice twists that are always welcomed. <br /> <br /> It's not nice, and it's starting very slowly, but it eventually ends. I was not on the edge of my seat and I would not rip my friends to see it, but if you watch a lot of movies and always look for something new, it can entertain you for 90 minutes.
