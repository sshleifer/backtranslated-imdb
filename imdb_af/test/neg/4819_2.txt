New Orleans is nothing like how it is portrayed in this <br /> <br /> debacle of a movie. Quaid's attempt to talk to a cajun <br /> <br /> accent (incidentally, there is almost no one talking in New <br /> <br /> Orleans) is terrible. Plot = elementary and pointless. This <br /> <br /> picture refers to itself as a mystery, but a puzzle involves a <br /> <br /> gradual process by which a viewer is given clues and rotational movements through a movie. There is nothing here. "Great <br /> <br /> Easily" try out the trance New Orleans stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled - the real Big Easy is nothing like the town. <br /> <br /> Quaid & Barkin bumps their way through.
