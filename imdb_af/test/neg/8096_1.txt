I was expecting a fairly simple R-rated graphic, sexual, rough teenage comedy when I sat down to see it ... it was pretty accurate ... just that was much more sick and disgusting than I thought . I don't know if director / writer Gregory Poirier is sexually or ill, but I doubt whether a normal person could make such a movie. I could've guessed it if it were, as the only thing wrong was that it required a hard stomach ... but it wasn't. The film is also terribly moderate and disturbing. Every single character who has more than one full second of the time on the screen is an extreme ... sexual, mental or physical. I don't know if it's just the director's sense of humor, but I just found it wrong. Just wrong. Even in a comedy, it's supposed to be serious. The plot is stupid. The acting is bad. The characters are inconsistent and poorly written ... all of them. There isn't a single similar character in the movie. The humor is disgusting and goes way too far. The movie is just as incredibly poorly done so I really don't think it's worth somebody's time. If you like R-rated, rough comedies with lots of sexual innuendo and graphic stuff, watch The Groomsmen, or better still, American Pie ... or Road Trip, my personal favorite. But don't look after that. I can't tell you how bad it is ... you'll have to experience it yourself. However, this is one of those times when I will say that you are better off wondering. That way you can only imagine that this movie goes very close to the bottom ... without knowing it's going through it, and much lower than that. This movie looks mostly like a group of horny teens gathered, a movie staff compiled. Each time one of them got an idea, they filmed it and later compiled the whole thing. It has structure, consistency and taste. I only recommend it to horny teenage guys who have seen every other R-rated rude teenage comedy and don't care about quality. Everyone else ... do the sensible thing; Avoid it. It is not even worth seeing the loot. Believe me. 10/01
