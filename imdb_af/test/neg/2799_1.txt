I think there's a reason why this movie never came close to the theater. It was probably my neighbors in the street who filmed this movie with their mother's video camera. The acting is very amateur. This movie is definitely not something you want to see unless you were very bored. The actors even look like directors and crew members, with no "professionalism" whatsoever. If the director (s) and / or actors choose to continue their film-making efforts, I would definitely recommend them to brush their skills and maybe a few (and many) classes on film-making and acting.
