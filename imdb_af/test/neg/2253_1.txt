Previous Tarantino movies were in love with other movies from an old one. This one is from a man in love with his own writing. It's not Inglorious, it's disgusting. <br /> <br /> I absolutely hated Inglorious Basterds. The whole point of a movie is to entertain - if you call bashing people's heads and removing their scalps please !! - and if there is one unpardonable sin that can commit a movie, it is extremely boring or disgusted. <br /> <br /> The movie is just a collection of endless and ominously boring and disgusting scenes of people speaking at tables in different languages. . There is even one scene where 3 people are talking at the same table for almost 45 minutes before they are all shot. I wish they would be killed after 5 minutes. Even Woody Allen knows when to close the F ** K-up. <br /> <br /> Talk table style is a Tarantino feature, but in other movies I actually care about what they said and the people talking. Here I couldn't care less. Al Quentin's films show great confidence, especially Jackie Brown. But here's a pervasive feeling in every scene, Tarantino didn't know where he was going with the movie. <br /> <br /> Is it violent? Sure, there is torture and scalping, but you have to remind me. Fortunately, the film was so thin, I didn't even remember seeing it earlier in the day before I saw a review headline on MSNBC. <br /> <br /> He's out of the mopeds and apparently dies for a book. But we do a favor QT and save us the movie. <br /> <br /> I walked halfway through this movie and I would never recommend anyone to see it, no matter what the hard-quarantino fan he or she is. <br /> <br /> I give it 0/10.
