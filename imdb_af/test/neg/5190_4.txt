The movie starts with its most intelligent joke and goes from there (pun intended). After that, there are lots of potty humor and sexual situations. The beautiful women were the best part of the movie. Sword words are not meant to be central idea jokes, but they try it here. The struggle between the two groups in the local town (wealth and poverty) is an old tried-and-tested approach, so how can it go wrong? Well, there is no reason to envy the wealth, nor to pity the pity, so we can forget about the central plot. The situational humor is all toilet or sexually aimed at teenagers, but just garners giggle, no real stomach laugh. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves the comedy for this movie is the character humor, with the blind man some rehashed, but rarely use setups, and the black bar owner who is the formal "street" or "hood" "humor. <br /> <br /> Forget the jokes, there should be some killer snowboard shots as it was a commercial venture. Unfortunately, there was only 4 seconds of background action that might be inspiring. The rest were all "B" grotesque or worse. The big moment, when the main character "drive the goat", a male shooting range, gave one shot where a small deluge eats the stuntman. This was the best of the lodges in this movie. Any serious snowboarding fan will be disappointed with the quality of the stunts in the movie. <br /> <br /> Regarding the technical aspects of the movie, the soundtrack was average, which is surprises, as the snowboard documentaries are often filled with quality voices. You can capture many editing errors and although it was shot on a ski storage, the majority of "paintings" did not convey any sense of true size. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's probably worth checking to see if your brain is completely disconnected and you like silicon breasts. Even then, you don't remember anything about this one two days later. <br /> <br /> Snowboarding is still waiting for the definitive comedy because you can do better to see a snowboarding documentary.
