When I first saw 'Race Against Fear' (don't you just like LMN movie titles?), I had to keep my head tight. Was it meant to be serious? Why can't the main character run like a normal person running, much less like a star winner? How did I know the coach was just 1 minute in the movie? All these questions, and no answers. Then I just let go of the rude script and the terrible direction just ... it was easier not to resist ... then the movie became more fun, and I now classify it among my top ten junk movies of LMN. Some have said that Ariana Richards is very talented, but the material was wrong - I disagree completely. Not only can she convince me that she is an athlete, she walks widely through the rest of the story, just as she landed on earth. Maybe the coach broke out of prison and put her off ... at least I hope so.
