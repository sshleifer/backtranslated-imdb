The Nest is just another 'nature runner', a horror movie that fails because of its low budget. The acting is OK, and the setting is great, but the whole movie looks somehow. The gore effects are not the best I have seen but are nice in a cheesy way. The chicks themselves are just ordinary cockroaches that bite people. The Nest reminds me of a much better movie called Snails. If you like The Nest, Snails are a must-see because it's ten times better. It's also worth Lisa Langlois who plays Elizabeth in another nature run amock-type movie called Deadly Eyes (aka The Rats), which is about deadly rats as you might guess. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy this kind of horror movie, you might give it a watch, but you'll be much better off seeing Snails that are more interesting and stingy.
