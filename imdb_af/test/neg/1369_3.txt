I was a teenager when it first appeared in theaters, and I saw it in Japan. The movie's plot was not my cup of tea as a high school's neighbor, but I saw it for the 3-D process. It was ballyhooed in the press, so even service staff heard it from abroad, although it was never selected at the Post Theater. <br /> <br /> The film has tended to throw objects into the audience, which was taken. to absurd levels with later 3-D films. <br /> <br /> I don't know if it qualifies as a spoiler, but you're warned if it is. In many films of the time, actors would often work in front of a "back-screen" screen, where backgrounds could be projected to appear to be in a different environment, such as a jungle background when the actors were at a sound stage. It works well on regular movies, but when seen in 3-D, they look like a flat scene behind the actors. There were several scenes in the movie where rear-projection was used, and it didn't work well in the theaters. If it is seen in 3-D, it will be another disappointment. <br /> <br /> The only importance of the movie is historical, as it was the first of its kind.
