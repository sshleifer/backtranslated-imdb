Ghost Story has an interesting feminist vengeance storyline, A-list veteran actors, colorful flashbacks with delicate look-like youths from the old men. scary staccato music that repeats the impending horrors, atmospheric New England winter weather, and excellent charismatic actress in the title role. Ghost Story could have been much more effective in black and white and in eliminating some of the more boring special effects, and giving a more sought after screenplay (we don't have to wonder why the two trailer-parky accolytes The writing is) The biggest drawback of the movie is Craig Wassan (definitely divorced at birth of Bill Maher) who may be editing or just acting badly, being totally ineffective. He seems to specialize in wide eyes, wide mouth reaction shots; not much personality here. However, the revelation is Alice Krige, light, mysterious, frightening under the quiet outside. However, her Eva Galli is scary even before she meets her fate; I mean, a young woman who likes things like "I want to take a little with you" or "Dance with me, your little way!" is not already in the land of the living. Ghost Story would have been much better in a low key, Val Lewton. The exaggerated special effects completely suppress the chill factor.
