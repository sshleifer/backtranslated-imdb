OK. Well, I think it was worth putting my time through it * once *, but I won't watch it again. There are several things about this movie that irritate me. <br /> <br /> First, man ... I hate the characters a lot. I had the same problem with Sid and Nancy. I have a hard time spending to spend a fair amount of time on characters I really don't care about and can't relate to. It's not that the actors or the writing were technically bad; It was that the characters were written in such a way that I only had contempt for them, and when the movie went on, I almost wanted to see the air falling on them. And this leads me to the second problem and a question I think is at the heart of this movie: Was the intention to document this generation and this kind of bohemians who were in Europe in the 1970s? Was the intention to criticize and paralyze them? Or was this movie a kind of warning? My final review of the movie (that is, to determine if anything is reusable) depends on this question. <br /> <br /> Regardless, these characters are really disagreeable, and as a result, it's difficult to really give a crap about the plot or what's happening to them. If this was a kind of statement about this generation, the movie became a bit more tolerant. It is clear that Schroeder is not a type of geriatric settlement. The way he continues here carries more weight than the myriad of stupid AIP movies that occur in or in the 60's counter-culture. <br /> <br /> At least, this movie has two things for it. First, the soundtrack (of course). I like how Cymbaline is used here and others have mentioned it as it takes the lead in the movie. I guess if you are a Pink Floyd fan and want to see it, you probably won't stop it. It won't stop me either. The curiosity about hearing Pink Floyd in a movie can be enough to get you scarce. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there is a beautiful scenery. Ibiza looks like a nice place to visit. Maybe I'm just sick of watching movies in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, but European movies that take the time to show us Europe (the beautiful or ugly - mostly beautiful here) are always welcome. <Br /> <br /> But I really don't see any particular genius here. No revolutionary camera works, not even a moral, tone, message, sensibility or plot that has something new to say. Perhaps it was revolutionary about this, but it was just like a man like Schroeder - a film that is critical of a mindset that at least partially makes its movies marketable. To the extent it is an honest movie; There is no glorification of the insignificant surplus of the 60's here, it might be something you can expect. In fact, the portrayal of the characters in this film now reflects the (somewhat distorted, in my opinion) modern cultural memory of that generation. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, a lot of (yawn) nudity and sex here; nothing new if you watch this kind of movies from this period. I think it was considered novel or challenging at the moment. I don't find it offensive or biased (I doubt if you will too); On the contrary, it just expands the running of an already boring movie. In this way, this particular use of sexuality in movies of the time (especially the European one) becomes a bit of a clich√©. But I think afterwards, you can't blame them; they were only able to get away with that in that decade, and I suspect (I guess here) the presence of this kind of graphic sexuality was a political or social statement in and of itself (that is, sexuality is part of the life that this generation will not all be strange as their parents were.) <br /> <br /> Should you see it? If you're a Pink Floyd fan, sure ... it's worth a watch. Anyway, The Valley is a better movie. I went in this movie, which was largely what I got. If you don't normally watch this kind of arty, avant-garde movie and don't know what to expect, it's annoying like hell. It's a normal, healthy reaction :) <br /> <br /> If you're not a Pink Floyd fan, I'm not sure why you'd like to spend your time here. I noticed one fellow who left a comment, enjoyed this movie very much, so maybe I just miss something. I don't need guys who are slow in moving fireballs, special effects, explosions or something like enjoying a movie. But I need some sort of handle. I need to find something about a movie, and generally I have to participate in an aspect of the characters' fate (including some new movies, camera work and so on). Here's just nothing to hold on to, except for Pink Floyd's wonderful. What is * just enough * to make it tolerant. At least, if you are a Pink Floyd fan, you start with the Cymbaline, I promise.
