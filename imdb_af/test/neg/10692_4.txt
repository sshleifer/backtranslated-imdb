I was looking for the documentary self-destruction of the master brain behind Boondock Saints, one of the most aggravating and useless movies I've ever seen. But the makers of "Overnight" - friends (ex?) Of the particular master brain - also have to learn how to make a movie. Several improper remarks, screaming obsessions in the phone, and enjoying his alcohol make Mr Duffy like a putz. But it does not provide insight into why the man got a contract in the first place, what his creative process or vision is - how about Boondock Saints? How difficult is it to meet Patrick Swayze? What are these strange institutional machinations in which we are captivating her disgusting heroes? Because the film doesn't try to answer these questions in a coherent way, it doesn't matter that dippity-doo will also say about Hollywood. So who cares?
