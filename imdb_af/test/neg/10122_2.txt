It's probably the worst of the big Ava Gardner movies. Yeah, she's beautiful. But it can become thin over time, especially after the curly and predictable film ends. <br /> <br /> In this turkey, Robert Walker has to pretend that he has Eddie Bracken (who surely embarrasses him). Olga San Juan is sharing Jane Powell (golly, giving). Dick Haymes plays a kind of dull sidekick (!), And Eve Arden plays Helen Broderick (and an army of other sensible women's semi-comedians). Yes, the movie contains a great popular song, "Talk Low." But look at the other, completely forgotten pieces. Dick Haymes sings very well and naturally, and also the unknown vocalist for Ava. <br /> <br /> The sets are cheap, the writing is filled with clich√©s and failed humor, and Tom Conway seems to have been struggling with liquor (as he was). In short, if you want to see Ava in her first, buy a photo and stay clear of this movie.
