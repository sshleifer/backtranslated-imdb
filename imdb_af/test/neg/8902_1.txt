Endless repetition about the evil World Bank, the IMF, globalization and the Americans is blamed for all Africa's problems ?? and the movie is long, about two hours, but it looks longer. The French kept centuries of Mali, the country where the film takes place, but are only peripheral bad guys. <br /> <br /> One doesn't learn enough from any of the characters to really see what's happening to them? They are completely marginal for preaching, what is going on and on and on. There is no plot, no character development, no humor (except for a few pokes at Bush and Wolfowitz, but it's almost cheated it's so easy) and the production values ​​are mediocre. There is no salvation there. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that a movie can spend two hours on such a large topic and actually can't convey real information. The Irish ballad "I was dead, and then the famine came" has more content. <br /> <br /> The movie is boring, the sub titles are hard to read, there is no real content on the subject of the movie, and the propaganda is relentless. <br /> <br /> Skip this one.
