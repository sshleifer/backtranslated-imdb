These 1950s, how bad it is, it's unintentionally funny. Tom Conway picture dr. Gerard, a scientist who uses natives in a sample using voodoo. His poor wife, played by Mary Ellen Kay, is captured by her wacko hubby, who doesn't have time for her, but threatens to kill her if she leaves him. Together, Marla English comes as a greedy murderer who has already murdered a man to find a treasure in the jungle. Her idiot boyfriend, portrayed by Lance Fuller, is on the safari. They hire "Touch" Connors, (later named Mike Connors, of Mannix fame) as a guide. English is a terrible actress, but hey, no one else in the movie was also in academic award-winning performances. "Touch" (I'm sorry, I can't even type the name without cracking, I mean, what the ...) gave the only halfway proper performance of the bunch and it says a lot. The monster is only briefly seen, and the end is predictable to say the least. I would say this movie falls into the "it's so bad, it's almost good" category of movies. It's right on a rainy night when there's nothing else on the tube.
