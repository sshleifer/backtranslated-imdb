As you may remember, I already see three trilogues of trash and the first movie is the only one even close to awake. Part two was low grade sewage and this installment is slightly better than two, but still one steamy pile of something I removed from my yard last Monday. The point of departure doesn't make sense, why did the moonshine kill that poor old lady and even in 1921 I think someone would see a lot of oily guys where a cute cute lady ever lived. Secondly, that scarecrow is pathetic compared to how cool they were in the first movie. It's just old clothes and a bag. Let's see, the series is garbage and must be forgotten. THE EMERGENCY!
