This movie looks good, and it's about where my praise ends. "Love is a very beautiful thing" came in the entire schizophrenic year of 1955, when candy-colored nonsense like this coexist with a touching artist's screen like "Kiss Me Deadly." As a trend toward smaller, socially-conscious films such as "On the Waterfront" and "Marty" settled in the mid-fifties, other directors needed to stick to the inconspicuous, pandering melodrama that so many other films of that decade, and "Love" is one of the latter. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of 50 movie where the Technicolor is used to make its richest extreme and the lighting is always highly key; Even scenes that occur in a dark room or at night are brighter than the average sunny day. I never want to hear the theme song again, as it is often played enough to keep someone alive over the course of the film, and I definitely don't want to hear it singing through the shrill, overbearing choir that doesn't ring it out. over the end titles. Jennifer Jones and William Holden are wise, but really someone could have played these parts. Jones's role was terribly written - her character is incredibly contradictory, and it seems as if her character is required to decide on something, the authors reversed a coin to decide what that decision would be. <br /> <br /> People will undoubtedly tell me that I take this movie too seriously, that I am irresponsible, etc. But I loved "All That Heaven Allows", released the same year and just like cornball in his own way, except that Douglas Sirk can change melodrama into an art form, while Henry King (director of "Love") doesn't. <br /> <br /> I usually enjoy bad melodrama, but in this case I just got bored. . <br /> <br /> Degree: D +
