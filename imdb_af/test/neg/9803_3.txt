I kept waiting for the movie to move me, inspire me, shock me, somehow deceive me, but it didn't touch my emotions. It just slammed to the end. None of the characters were very unique or complex, they just looked like actors who recommended their lines. I think it could have been a better movie if the characters expressed more emotion. The only one who did and was credible was the veteran and probably committed suicide to get out of the movie as soon as possible. It was a waste of talent, film, their time and mine. If there is a message or meaning or genius in this story, it is definitely well hidden or I am very dense, which I doubt.
