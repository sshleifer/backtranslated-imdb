Leonard Rossiter and Frances de la Tour wear this film, not without a fight, as the manuscript suddenly emerged from the old episodes. When it came out, it had to be a great disappointment as it was also done on a bus ticket budget. Attempts to move it out of the house - which is actually unrecognizable, a bad job everywhere - with a picnic, fantasy sequences, rugby and a boxing game in the local gym simply doesn't work. Most of this is just character-light for a lonely, not-very-good group. That said, the interaction of Rossiter and de la Tour (and anyone else with him) is mostly hilarious; they even succeed in making a sophon gag work, but you can see the battle with the retrieval of a literally uninspired writing that changes half the graph. Don Warrington has little to do except "black", and because of the random scripts, Christopher Strauli changes at least twice. And in the end, as he often did in the TV series (although you may not remember - read the scripts), let Eric Chappell finish you with a time trial. Were they so cynical, or just too desperate to be in the movie industry? Rossiter and de la Tour are always funny, but as a movie, it's a horrible story for a TV show. TEAR.
