It had potential ... it really did. But there is so much about the movie that was ridiculous and ridiculous. I'm a horror movie ween and I thought it was stupid; just like my 13 year old! I expected to be at least. And yes, the gross factor of the vineyards in the people was there; but the prospect of getting to the ruins is just stupid, stupid, stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean who's going on a hike ... in a jungle ... with a total stranger. With a little water and a few cups ... IN FLIP FLOPS, NO LESS? Puh-lease! Better still, who goes to a foreign country and leaves the tourist area without an interpreter or can speak a little of the language? Are these people finished with morals? <br /> <br /> The German's brother is not heard and he does not ask for help? Who doesn't? He just finds a few Greeks and Americans looking for and finding a bit?
