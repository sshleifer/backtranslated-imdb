From the praise I expected I would expect more of a Korean horror if it were to be considered the same caliber as a Tale of Two Sisters, as some other reviews have said. This movie is not in the same caliber except in the budget that is spent on special effects. Think Amytiville horror. With a tree and sparse dialogue. <br /> <br /> If you want a limited-dialogue movie, the plot line and characters must carry the movie. This movie can be well-interpreted in a 30-minute short-film concept, 2 hours of staring at trees and terror scenes that don't just scare you, but a "What the ... doesn't make a good horror movie. <br /> <br /> The people who stated that this movie gave them lasting impressions should literally have heart attacks if decent horror movies take it.
