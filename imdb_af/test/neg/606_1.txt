There is not one character on this sitcom with any redeeming features. They are all self-centered, offensive or two-dimensional. My husband looks at it and claims that there is nothing else, but I'd rather not see anything. <br /> <br /> The only sitcom I can think of was worse, yes, dear. At least that one didn't have 9 seasons. <br /> <br /> Being overweight doesn't make a comic genius, and Kevin James doesn't have the talent of John Goodman, Jackie Gleason or John Belushi. Leah Remini may have talent, but if so, she is wasted on the cruel woman. Jerry Stiller is convincing as an annoying old man. Maybe there's a reason for this. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect example of why sitcoms are deprived.
