A girl is looking for her soul mate - this movie was very strange - many of the sequences that look like hallucinations. Tommy Lee Jones is the only stable one in the picture. It was hard to figure out what the director was trying to say. Most of the time, the main character was dressed in strange clothes and makeup. A strange combination of reality and madness.
