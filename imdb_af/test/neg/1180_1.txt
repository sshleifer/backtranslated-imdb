What a waste of time watching this movie. Poor picture quality, poor sound, poor acting and certainly not based on real facts. The deputy's "girlfriend" agreed so much, as the sheriff did, that it was more comedy than horror. The deputy is trying to make an emergency call by dialing 911 ... QUESTION ... in 1957 the emergency number didn't exist. This is just one example of shiny inconsistencies. <br /> <br /> The "scary" aspect was very subdued. I just didn't seem so horrible. <br /> <br /> I thought the actor playing Gein did the most admirable work in the whole movie. I can see the mental disorders in his character image. <br /> <br /> Sorry ... this one just doesn't get it!
