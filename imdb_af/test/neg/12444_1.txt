Everyone has already commented on the obvious fact that the first few comments were clear from people who either had an interest in the movie or had friends / family who had an interest in the movie, and that is right - if I made a movie, everyone of my family and friends would be there to compliment it too. In all honesty there are some good things with the bad things in this movie. Unfortunately, the bad things keep silent far above the good. Good: The overall plot was lightly interesting. The music was generally pretty good. Several of the songs (when you could hear them) were pretty cool. The only musical issues I had were: # 1) the first tension scene with some quiet instrumental (it was really taking away the tension); # 2) played the song when the main characters went to an outdoor party at a friend's house and # 3) the songs that were good were too quiet, especially when a heavy metal song played in the background while Danny Trejo " hung a man (sounded like a pretty cool song, but it had to be torn over the scene when Danny Trejo got froggy). Now for the very bad things: The writing was horrible. I mean, HORRIBLE. I saw a smoother dialogue in a Star Wars movie. Advice to the author of a part-time writer and full-time movie buffer: If you write a dialogue, ask yourself: Is that something people would actually say? Honestly, the writing was laughable. I want to blame the scene, but with that kind of writing, it's hard to know if they have talent or not. The lightly interesting plot was seriously hampered by the mad dialogue. I know it was low budget, but words don't cost money - if you have a good writing, even semi-capable actors can deduce it. This film didn't look right, but hopefully the director will get a second shot to make a better movie.
