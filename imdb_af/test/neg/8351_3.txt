'Volcano' is at best a B-movie, and the worst is more of a disaster that is supposed to portray. To be honest, you must be prepared in any movie to suspend unbelief for one big concept. 'Volcano' asks you to suspend disbelief in science, human interaction and common sense. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones becomes the solid but 1990-sensitive head honcho of the Office of Emergency Management. He's good if he's not stuck with the stupid dialogue that the writing offers. Anne Heche, however, gives a bad performance as a smart geologist who becomes Roark's love interest (while the city is burning, consulting). Gaby Hoffman goes from Field of Dreams and US President to Jones's desperate, needy and victim-for-life daughter. Don Cheadle sits in a very coooool office and takes Jones's phone calls, does the work that Roark should and should do. <br /> <br /> In any case, the movie starts really downhill when Heche's geological partner gets. suck in a lava vent while breaking into the subway lines. It picks up the speed when Jones suggests that they use buses to drain the flow of lava flowing into the street, Heche's geologist (who would like to hear about the Science of Geology) is apparently unaware of the fact that lava is hot and it melts metal and rock, and a dead bus probably won't have much effect. It really sucks when the movie Rodney King likes racial tension between two bad actors like a policeman and a fierce black man who doesn't understand why the fire brigade is doing this great river of flowing lava. But in the end, the three will work together to build a K-track dam to stop the lava from eating its environment, although the dam is built in the wrong direction and the material used will not stop lava in each case. Besides, K-rails are barely waterproof, but I think lava wouldn't think of throwing its head through the gaps, not when Tommy Lee Jones screamed about it. Don't start me on the underground underground motorcycle, where a tunnel comes warm, but strangely, it's not too hot to try to save, it's not too smoky to see, and there's no poisonous gases so that everyone can breathe. It must be LA Lava or Lava Lite. You know, it's eating cars, but it's eco-friendly. <br /> <br /> There are moments of pure camp here that almost make you wonder if it's a comedy. For example, the two security guards packaged by Hieronymus Bosch paintings have a completely meaningless and dangerous conversation about weight, and in the end, the little boy Roark / Jones did not quickly realize that everyone looked the same while being covered in ashes, if a rainstorm breaks out and cleans everyone - then the sun comes out and Heche says something like "Red", "Shark, Roark". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Heche does not come to Travolta-like badness and is properly dealt with the technical aspects. If you're out of the LA environment like me, it's funny to think of a lava flow that wiped out Wilshire Boulevard. I gave it a try for the effects and the small amount of stress you get from it.
