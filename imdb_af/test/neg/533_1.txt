As a sci-fi and casual Angelina Jolie fan, I thought this naturally low-budget movie might be a glimpse. Perhaps it had some scenes or story that would be for all its other mistakes. Plus, it might be interesting to watch Angelina start with her star-bound career. <br /> <br /> Oh, how wrong I was. One thing I learned - at 18, Angelina Jolie couldn't act. So, to make her comfortable, the producers sowed the whole movie with people who couldn't act. Since Jack Palance (who can actually act) decides to overreact. Watching 10 minutes of this event is enough to burn your eyes. <br /> <br /> To the horrible play and overhearing adds an unconscious writing, indifferent dialogue, bottom-of-the-go cinematography. bottom of the walk everything. <br /> <br /> The story features Angelina as a cyborg programmed by her corporate rulers as an assassination. She escapes the corporate headquarters with the help of her combat instructor. The corporation sends them bounty hunters. Stupid things happen. The end. I'll tell you more, but I didn't want to waste my life, and look at this drink. <br /> <br /> I beg you - it's not worth watching. It's not even worth looking at. Save yourself the pain and move on.
