John Travolta reprints his role as Chile Palmer, Hollywood gangster, now turning his eye on the music business. With his "negotiating skills" he tries to run an independent record company with the wife of a murdered friend, played by Uma Thurman, and tries to get his young singer (Christina Milian) a hit record. <br /> <br /> Before I saw this successor, I heard it was a terrible movie. But Cool is still a pleasant comedy, though not as good as the original. The movie focuses this time on the music industry instead of the film industry. The music business is depicted very poorly in the movie and they use a lot of lame stereotypes. I can't say whether that was the intention or not, because Get Shorty did a good job of spoofing the movie industry. The same cannot be said for the successor and the efforts come just as lazy. <br /> <br /> An impressive movie is what saves the movie from zinc. The best performance is given by The Rock and it's nice to see him in a different role. Vince Vaughn also gives a funny performance, although he has become annoying before the end. Surprisingly, Uma Thurman gave an average performance and I expected more from her. John Travolta returns as Chile and he does a good job. However, his performance is boring. Christina Milian gives a horrible performance and she is not so good at a singer either. Cedric the Entertainer gives a good performance although he is not in the movie for long. There's also a bunch of comos, including Steven Tyler and James Wood. <br /> <br /> F. Gary Gray is aiming and doing a bad job. He just doesn't handle the movie very well and the movie is kind of a mess. There was also a lot of product placement and it became annoying after a while. Also at 118 minutes, the film is too long and there are very slow patches. The film had to be changed badly and it wasn't clear. Fortunately for the movie, the actors can rise above the weak direction and writing and they deliver some funny scenes. Sometimes the movie tried too hard while other times it was pretty funny. Compared to the original, the successor does not measure well. But Be Cool is a fairly harmless and forgetful comedy. In the end, Be Cool is worth a rent and that's it. Rating 6/10
