This movie is worse than the "sky gate" or "outer space 9 plan". Don't know why it even got one Oscar, it had to get a million raspberries, just like the audiences who either came out or didn't show up in the first place. The hospital was a first-class financial failure, but I am sure the elite classes of left-wing intellectuals have been affected by the fact that the American public was very much embarrassed to appreciate bitter social commentary when they saw it. and so on. George C Scott, in one of the most artless and embarrassing roles, along with the obsolete sex symbol Diana Rigg spends most of the movie trying to cuss in an increasing way as they bump into a stupid plot. Poor old George is impotent and is just crushed by the event, but after very dirty language between him and Rigg, he raped her several times on fine night in a dirty, crumbling NYC hospital that looked so disgusting that I was not dying. pet treated in it. There is also some sacred cross-dialogue that is tossed here and there. It ends by depicting the erroneous idea that unusual stress without physical exertion always leads to cardiac arrest. Never want to see another minute of this horrible movie.
