"Until there you are one of the worst movies we've ever seen. This fails in every respect. Jeanne Tripplehorn was better (than actress ...) in Waterworld. In comparison, this movie is Dungworld. When a character stumbles once, or even twice, in the course of a movie, one can understand it. But Jeanne's character falls, travels, stumbles so often that she may have a bit of Jerry Lewis in her. In her defense, every (talk?) Trap is probably blocked, choreographed and rehearsed. And rehearse. Although it is bad enough for a movie, it seems that the actors (Dylan McDermott and Jeanne Tripplehorn) spend most of the plot going out or looking for a place to smoke. If the movie was a treat, I had no place to smoke. Okay - BUT, it's not. <br /> <br /> But this movie lasts a long time, it is too long with 10 minutes past the run. <Br /> <br /> Ag, Jeanne Tripplehorn, ALMOST acts at a public forum meeting. You just see her life in character. Oh, it's just as convincing as her scene shouting at Michael Douglas in Basic Instinct - hmm, on the second thought, not really. <br /> <br /> It's a movie to avoid at all costs unless you need a cigarette and is trapped in nicotine addicts anonymously or forced to watch trips from HOOPER (Burt Reynolds). And even then, throw a coin or go to bed.
