As a wrestler, movies about wrestling generally suck (Backyard Dogs, Body Slam, Jesse Ventura story), but this one is not the worst I have ever seen. Yes, it's bad, but it's better than some of the others I've mentioned. <br /> <br /> Hulk Hogan stars basically himself and for some reason a competitive network wants to beat him because he doesn't want to be on that network. Let me explain it so that everyone can understand .... picture USA Network with Rip ... and TNT goes any length to get him. <br /> <br /> Does it make sense ... no? Well, don't feel bad, because it doesn't make sense. Neither of these movies makes much sense, but compared to other wrestling movies and later Hogan does not flourish so badly. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
