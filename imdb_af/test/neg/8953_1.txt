This show is the worst show ever! Norris and his family write it, produce it, lead it, and so on. The only reason I ever see it is because my goofy likes it. How often can Norris fly from the naked eye to land a kick on an obvious blind villain? No trees, no building, just who ..... thin air. He ALWAYS solves the issue or is the best at whatever skill. No co-star ever gets the glory. It's all Norris. It is noticeable that Norris is holding on to himself and allowing no one to find him in any scene, regardless of content. Terrible acting, horrible writing, horrible series.
