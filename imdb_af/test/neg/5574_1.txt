This movie is so bad. but it is so bad that I laughed my ass. For people who like movies, don't look at this one. For people who like movie good and bad, I recommend this one. The story lines are shaky, the writing is terrible, the acting is terrible to be mediocre. the soundtrack throughout the movie was corny but i loved it. the cool catches were a plus. ha ha. "If it can bleed, it can die". the battle scenes cracked me. It seemed to me that they spent more time on those parts than any other cuz. The conflict statements were mostly reasonably clean. I almost feel like this movie might have been good if it wasn't for the f / x. no, it would have been another crap shot. The case was corny. and how the chick eats the guys stomach in the kitchen, they can do something where the barn actually eats something or at least puts more of the false blood on her face. and the lighthouse explosion disappointed me. I thought they could have gotten real fire instead of crappy computer synthesized stuff. and the end was so predictable, which surprised me when they actually did what I would do. so common. ID says it's a classic as far as crappy movies go. it's in my bottom 5.
