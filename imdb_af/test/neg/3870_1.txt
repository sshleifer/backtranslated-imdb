The great Yul Brynner, who won an 'Oscar' and who, among other things, experienced a Ten Commandments, ended his remarkable career with cheap backlot movies such as 'Sartana' and so on. Really, indeed. One must be sorry that he does his best to make this idiotic thing. Gone was the days when he was surrounded by Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Eli Wallach, in The Magnificent Seven and walked under the well-known Elmer Bernstein soundtrack. It is difficult to make an actor sometimes.
