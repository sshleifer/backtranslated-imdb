Great subject, director, and somehow, adds to a really poor movie, telling in the flat, semi-documentary style that was so popular at the time this movie was made. (And hello, it's NOT a movie noir!) The shiny, overly complicated, overcrowded story has no bow, no focal point, little excitement and staggers from one scene to the next with no observable purpose, except as a valentine on the alleged and highly questionable cooperation between US and Mexican governments on the issue of illegal immigration. <br /> <br /> The scene that made me, HATE this movie, is when Montalban and Mitchell make a daring escape from their prisoners, to avoid Montalban's injured partner presumably being murdered by a throw with " a gun that manages a farm machinery, Montalban says something like, "fast - we must try to save him", but instead of lying on their stomachs and taking into account for about 5 (!) minutes of screen time while the machine goes on Murphy and finally he walks over (or so we assume - the machine just stops, another goon discovers the presence of the two "rescuers" and shoots them as they run again.). The whole thing is so terribly filmed and totally anti-climatic. There is nothing worse than a protagonist (presumably Montalban, though he is off the screen for more than half of the film) who doesn't even try. Jeez, Ricardo, do something! <br /> <br /> I know Anthony Mann, but hell, not all his movies are classic people. How bad should an old movie be here to get something lower than a 6 rating?
