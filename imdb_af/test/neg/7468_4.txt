I saw Grande Ecole at its world premiere at the Rotterdam Film Festival. I didn't know what I was entering and if I had any idea I would not have entered. This is the most pretentious movie I have ever seen. It tries provocatively, but deeply, with its full frontal homosexual sex scenes - succeeding! It is nothing more than another bad excuse to show mere people on the big screen. 10/04
