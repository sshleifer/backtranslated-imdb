Cairo, or Pulse, as known by English-speaking audiences, is in Tokyo and started as Sunny Plant Sales employee Michi Kudo (Kumiko Aso) decided to visit her friend Taguchi (Kenji Mizuhashi) to inquire about a computer disk he was working on , When she gets to his place, he gives her the disk, but then she commits suicide. Meanwhile, a student named Ryosuke Kawashima (Haruhiko Kato) recently signed up for the internet and still remains haunting messages and images on his screen so he asks his computer worm Harue Karasawa (Koyuki) what happens, she doesn't really know, but it seems that the place where people's spirits go when they die is full and they need somewhere else to go. The earth is as good as a place, right? These spirits don't like to share, so they make people commit suicide or change their ashes, or something, I don't really know, because the movies are a bit of a mess. . <br /> <br /> This Japanese production is written and directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa and to the right of the bat. I must say I hated Cairo. I hated everything about it and proved that an Asian cinema can do something like an American movie maker. The text is a long mess, the thing just doesn't make sense to scenes that look like they are from another movie, sequences that do not make sense or are explained in any way. Cairo is also the most straightforward boring movie I've put this year. At two o'clock it's a real thing to go through, I really wanted to make it ahead, but I'm fair to nothing else so I stuck it to the bitter end and I didn't want it. There are so many things wrong with Cairo, I think the filmmakers are going to a surrealistic ambiguous and deliberate cohesive, but these are attributes I despise in a movie unless properly done. Then there is the whole internet thing I couldn't handle at all, I use the internet all day and it's not scary in me somehow. Then there's the fact that Cairo as a movie for my zero-entertainment value, maybe I'm a Neanderthal, but I like the movies I'm watching to entertain me, make something and not kill. <Br /> <br /> As far as possible, director Kurosawa has been given the best insomnia. If you find it hard to sleep, it stays in the DVD. If you fall asleep within 10 minutes, I guarantee you. I didn't think that Cairo was the least scary, the whole internet thing was laughing and for frightening you should see some popis ads I get, now it's scary! I hate this movie, I hate this movie, I'm sorry, I just have to make the basic point twice. Forget about any action, tension or gore as there isn't any. If you have a very nervous attitude, then there may be a few scenes that can crawl you, otherwise it is kiddie-friendly PG-rated stuff altogether. Urgh. <br /> <br /> The movie looks so boring and boring, it's untrue, the camera just sits there for very long shots. As it moves, it moves very slowly, it has the style of a Mexican soap opera. Since Cairo is subtitled, it is difficult to judge the original performances, so I will not bother, it is difficult to care for someone when they do not even speak the same language and you do not know what they are saying. <br /> <br /> Cairo is shit, I hated it and it's so straightforward and straight forward. Just because it is an Asian movie, it does not automatically do well and the mess of a story, the plot holes, the fact that it does not make sense and it is an absolute drill means that Cairo will be torn by people if it's a US production. The worst movie I've seen a few times this year. Cairo has a Hollywood remake as Pulse (2006).
