The Robot vs the Aztec Mummy was one of the silliest and least credible movies I have ever seen. Oh, I can buy that woman in the movie is a reincarnation of a virgin sacrificed to an Aztec God. What I can't buy is that of the incredibly cowardly mummy and the worse looking robot. If you want to see a movie like this, you want to see lots of fighting action. But the robot and the mummy are fighting for about a minute! Probably the worst of all was the slide de los muertos art they had in the credits. It's the worst I've ever seen. Avoid this one if possible.
