no matter what someone says, it's a b-movie, and the effects are poorly done. If you're a vampire fanatic, I think it'll be fine, not 10 out of 10, you can't mean it to others. We should see it as a movie, don't read it as a book, so the effects and characters are important as well as the story. The story is good, but it doesn't carry the movie, no wonder it has a low rating on everyone. I write this because I have chosen to watch this movie when I saw some good reviews on IMDb, but I was very disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I thought the blade movies were great and loved the underworld movies, but these characters are not close. The makeup on the vampires is poorly done, and the effects are worse. it sucks. I might not have been so disappointed if I didn't read reviews here that told me how good it was. The judges had something to do with the production company or something, seriously, if you thought it was wonderful, you didn't give up or act. it is better than a book. 3 out of 10 for an OK story.
