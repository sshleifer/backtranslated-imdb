This movie is probably the worst movie ever made. It's definitely the worst I've ever seen, and I've seen quite a few bad movies. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens in the whole movie. One can literally start the movie, take a short nap, and then know for sure that nothing has become interesting while you sleep. And I saw this movie three times, awake throughout. I feel congratulated. <br /> <br /> The movie is as expected, according to a formula, with no variation. Hunters catch baby bigfoot, are killed by the parent, and the nearby town goes into a bigfoot drunk madness. It is surprisingly boring for a Troma edition. <br /> <br /> Please do a favor and skip this movie. If you have to see it, you will understand why.
