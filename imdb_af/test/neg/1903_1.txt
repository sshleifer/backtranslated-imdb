Plunkett and MaCleane are two highway people who rob the rich to give up ... well the rich; relatively, they are the rich. But we know they are the good guys, because the shit behind the powers of law and order, Mr. Chance, isn't that bad. He raped women - or tried. He beat up his mutual. He commits murder. He has bad breath. He doesn't shave properly. He has no fashion sense. He tortured puppy dogs. The last one is just an inference from me: we don't actually torture puppy dogs. But I'm sure he does. Little of Chance's villain has a lot to do with his quest for Plunkett and MaCleane. It's just something he does in his spare time, a kind of hobby he takes to make sure we don't love him. He didn't try so hard. No one in this movie is likeable. <br /> <br /> Let's take stock. Attractive characters? There is no: I believe we covered it. Lots of adventurous? Not a swash. Instead, we have some kind of grim heavy breathing. Don't stamp? Shine? Power? Everyone went the way of swashbuckling, I'm scared. Realism? Not one of them. I think they were trying realism, as everyone was so dirty, but the characters and action had all the plausibility of Errol Flynn - with no sense of excitement to restore them. Beauty? Nope. Fine camera work? For a TV crew, maybe. Humor? You can giggle once or twice if you're in a benevolent mood. Then again, you may not. Dialogue? See `humor 'above. Music? Don't start me on the music first. The music in 'Ladyhawk' was, for comparison, unpleasant. and at least the deceived aesthetic of that score was a consistent one. <br /> <br /> Ugh. I apologize for `Ladyhawk 'for thinking this even in this context. <br /> <br /> Summary: There are many positive bad things here and nothing good unless you count Liv Tyler, of which I am in two minds. <br /> <br /> I feel like I've just written a review of the smallpox. "Not very good," the review says. It would be much more interesting if I could defend the smallpox in one way or another, claiming that critics of the smallpox had misunderstood it - but I don't know how to do it.
