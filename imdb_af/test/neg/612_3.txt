I've been a fan of carpenters for a long time, read the biography, look at the special, and see the Karen Carpenter Story. This movie didn't really show the real Karen Carpenter. In the movie, it looks as if she is ashamed and a bit of one-off (except for one girl friend). The real Karen Carpenter was very different. She was outgoing and friendly. She had many friends, especially Olive Newton-John. The film doesn't even show Karen's efforts for a solo album and her encounter with Phil Ramone and his wife Itchy "Karen". Itchy knew the real Karen Carpenter in New York. When Karen was in New York, she saw a psychologist, but it was voluntary and once a day and then she went to her hotel room. Karen also took pills to increase her thyroid gland so she could lose weight, but stopped taking them because the psychologist did not recommend her either. The Karen's man in the movie is also called Bob Knight, but in real life he called Tom Burris. Also, Karen wasn't divorced from Tom, but only divorced. Karen had to sign the divorce papers on the day she died. Agnes also found Karen naked in the cupboard, unlike the movie she was wearing white. The music was very good. That was the only thing I would recommend to see.
