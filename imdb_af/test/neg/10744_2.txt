I can appreciate satire reflecting my own view, but it must be meaningful and well placed. This movie is ... how can I explain it. It doesn't make the slightest attempt at subtlety, much less intelligence. In fact, it's hardly even abominable. Death soldiers come to life, but they do not interest a brain, just in polling stations. Why? Cue a never-ending stream of the most idiotic, banal, puffed up winds of "bad president, bad conservatives, bad republicans." What a self-indulgent, schmaltzy, cornball piece of the difference it was. <br /> <br /> Even if they agree with the episode's "points", only the stupid liberals would say they enjoyed it. Then the dedication of some stupidity to the mad, angry, hostile, anti-social and anti-anything-half-normal liberal spectrum in itself is a great task. <br /> <br /> Avoid like a liberal convention.
