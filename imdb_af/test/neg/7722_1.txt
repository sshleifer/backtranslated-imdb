This is one of the most horrible movies I had the accident to pick up. Don't get me wrong, I love a good zombie movie, but it wasn't one of them. <br /> <br /> Also (from the opening styles, at least) is called "Titty". Zombies from outer space '. It has absolutely nothing to do with the other movie or the video game (as far as I could tell.) <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is how the two main characters can be covered with so much blood. and remain as non-split. I would definitely recommend giving this one and staying with a safer zombie pleaser such as '28 Days Later 'or' Dawn of the Living Dead '(the remake, of course, unless you're in a serious campaign.)
