If pulp fiction and Get shorty don't exist, it could be an OK movie. If I say this, I mean nothing of this movie is it unless it's a bit of a terrible dialogue or a cliché full of scene. All the lines like "I will not say more than I want to see from Get Shorty in this unfinished sequel are all the comos like Steven Tyler's terribly acted out and not needed and for Christina Milian, husband, don't get me the corridor Some of the coolest actors and actresses such as John Travolta and Uma Thurman seem to be coming down with the kids and the hip. They almost ruined the reputation of this movie, and frankly I think the best play of The Rock is with one of my least favorite actors, Vince Vaughn. The man is trying to be quite funny with him, with the microphone of how apparently rappers speak. Cedric, the entertainer and André 3000 play another terrible double act. (I personally think the background actors were better than Cedric a André) and the only funny part of the play by Cedric, André and the rest of the gang, is the way there are pants there knees, so you clearly boxers there can see and the only reason I find it is because it is a lot of people actually doing it. In this way, this film tries to make a funny and unsuccessful movie, it has no new material, comedy or coolness throughout, because it copies every other movie and ultimately the only reason you need to see it if you want to compare how bad it is is that brilliant predecessor . Get short. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention there is a BIG CLIENT in the end.
