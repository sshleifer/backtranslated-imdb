There is no doubt that Alfred Hitchcock was a seriously talented director. Many of his films are undeniable classics that have been the test of time and are highly vigilant to this day. This list can include the 39 steps, the rear window, North North West, Dial M for Murder, Vertigo, the birds, shadow of a doubt and some other movies. <br /> <br /> But, "Suspicion" isn't obsolete at all and is really so unshakable that it seems to me to be a bad movie, even in 1941 standards. The list of scenes that work well can be listed on a game book with a chalk. The writing is loose and ridiculous most of the time, but the play looks so forced, and wood and edge amateurish throughout, that it is almost incredible. Joan Fontaine tries to conquer things, but she is on a smooth slope and Cary Grant doesn't give much help. His play is sometimes so bad that I have seen better performances in high school or college theater experience classes where a chemical engineer is acting for the first time without formal training. After about 30 minutes Watching this movie, you find yourself in the dark for the DVD sleeve to see if you accidentally bought a special version of the edition that was pasted without any editing. <br /> <br /> The subject is serious, but the movie has a foolish and naughty feeling that seems to be out of place, you become corrupted. <br /> <br /> "Suspicion" is basically irreconcilable and yet a very much overestimated BAD movie.
