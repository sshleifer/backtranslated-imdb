The strawberry blonde has a good script, but I just wish Errol Flynn was there instead of James Cagney, he was not the person for the part. I think Olivia did a good job. This movie is also a day dream wrap around, so it's hard to follow. I don't like the male character attitude; the way Cagney offered it was just down. I give it a 3 for the poor who deals with the main male character. (If you like tough ruff men who like to fight and argue all the time then it's your movie). The strawberry blonde would have been better if the main character had more positive attitude and changed the writing to make him happy with Oliva. <br /> <br /> This movie shows off Money doesn't bring happiness, women are joking. Simple and not the best movie, but everyone has to decide for themselves.
