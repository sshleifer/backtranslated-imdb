Not even the Beatles could write songs that everyone likes, and although Walter Hill is not a mop, he is unmatched when it comes to thought-provoking action movies. The nineties came and social platforms turned into music and film. The rise of the Rapper had the movie star in full swing, and the acting had a back seat for every man's overwhelmingly regional accent and transparent acting. It was one of the many ice-movies I saw as a child and loved, only to see and shrink later. Bill Paxton and William Sadler are firefighters with basic lives to a burning building renter over to go up in flames handed a map of gold implications. I give it to Walter for quickly and neatly setting up the main characters and location. But I owe everyone involved to eliminate Lame-o appearances. Ice-t and cube had to be red hot at this moment, and while I both enjoyed their careers as rappers, they seemed to fall flat in this movie. It's about ninety minutes from one man who makes his back on the other man ridiculous to the point that you've locked yourself up in various states of unbelief. Now it's a movie, it's not a documentary, so I won't waste my time telling all the stupid tombs in this movie, but there were a lot and they didn't go anywhere. I saw the feeling that everyone on the set was confused and just playing things off the cuff. There are two things I still enjoy, one involves a scene with a needle and the other is Sadler's big 45 pistol. Bottom line this movie is like dominoes pizza. Yes, I eat it when I'm hungry and I don't feel like cooking, but I'm aware, it tastes like crap. 3 stars, meh.
