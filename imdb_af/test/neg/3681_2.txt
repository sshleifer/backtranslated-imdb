I was addicted by the assumption that the performance was about demons. From hell. And a doorway to hell. What I didn't realize was that I watch some guys running around tunnels driven by little kids, which may be for the whole movie. Certainly there was a dialogue between and a large underground landscape, but the lack of a plot, developed characters, any twists or developments in the story was not at all. Oh, and out of interest, there were no special effects. The entire budget was spent on actors' salaries, sets and plenty of time to walk around with a camera underground. <br /> <br /> The end was one of the typical dull boring ends that let you say, "I endured this movie of boredom for that !?" If you want to see demons and a doorway to hell, I promise you would be better off watching the trailers look at the game. Hellgate: London, which is shorter than this movie at 5 minutes, packs more dialogue, character development, action, plot and satisfying conclusions than this. <br /> <br /> The second star is for effort, but generally a low score for failing to make a movie that stands out and promising much more in the tagline than was provided.
