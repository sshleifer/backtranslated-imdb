In 1945 Skenbart followed a failed Swedish book editor who decided to take a train to Berlin. Unfortunately, it is for everyone around him a disaster, where he can go everywhere. The train also holds a man and his mistress in the screen to kill the man's wife (who is also on the train), a soldier heading home, two gay elderly men, an evil conductor, two nuns, ' a lot of refugees and even more people. <br /> <br /> Means as a mixture of noir-ish thriller (which does well - at least to start with), and comedy, the movie fails with both. It's not right, because the movie is changing with every new scene. And as the train goes to its final destination, the movie becomes more and more bizarre and ends on a real surreal note. <br /> <br /> The good bits are wasted in a multitude of useless plots and characters. Skenbart is packed with well-known Swedish actors, no matter how small the part is. It feels like the filmmakers are ringing everyone they have ever worked and presented them a role in the film. Bad that the performances are just as bad as the dissertation (acting on your lines - don't read it!). <br /> <br /> The comedy is more or less slapstick, with the same jokes repeated over and over. The pace is sometimes incredibly slow (often, actually), especially on the scene, especially for about ten minutes for no good reason. The author also suggests that suffering is a good way to replace good dialogue. However, the movie looks nice, in moody B & W, but it is being wasted on such unclear filmmaking in every other department. [10/01]
