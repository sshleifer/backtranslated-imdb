Many people stand in front of the house while some women cry ... Men stand in close groups and talk in silence ... a few guys come in and discuss how sexy the daughter can look today. . You will soon know that someone in the house is dead. The dead person's wife is worried about preparing food for so many people. Her friend next to her gives an idea to make things easy by making simple roti sabji. One of the dead's son talks to someone over the cellphone. Daughter is busy with her makeup. Her mother suggests wearing salwar kameej, but the girl is more interested in the looks good when so many people go to their house and therefore prefer jeans and T-shirt over salwar kameez ... another boy asks her mother to complete all the kriyas and also indicate that he is not expected to leave the office early. Then the camera slowly focuses on the dead person ... the white cloth covering the face displaces slightly because of the wind, revealing the face ... His Anupam Kher ... sudden alarm rings and he stands up from the bed ... Is it his dream or a flash back? You won't get an answer until the end of the movie. Well, that's what comedy is for director Dibakar Banerjee !!!!! Later you find out that this scene has nothing to do with the real movie and so make everything clear that the earlier described is a dream. Is this a movie comedy? Well, it's supposed to belong to that category ... But it's not really !!! there is nothing remote about comedy in the movie !!! More about the director gives the message that none of the police will get justice !!! so everyone must cheat the cheats! or forget about justice !!!! Music by Bapi-Tutul & Dhruv Dhalla is OK ... Nothing much to tell from other sectors ... Bad writing destroys everything ... not even Anupam Kher's performance manages to make it at least a paisa vasole no.
