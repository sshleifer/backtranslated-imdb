Carlos Mencia is not funny. From his performance special to this train wreck of a TV series, Carlos Mencia is not funny. I tried to convince people for two years that he was stealing other comedies' jokes, and as far as his comedy material was concerned, he was a regular "Johnny-comet" lately with far less than sub-par results. Psycho astronaut jokes? Britney Spears breaks down jokes? I hope it's just a schedule error, but come on Carlos and Comedy Central, those topics, and many others, have the spectrum of late-night TV show hosts' opening monologues, Saturday Night Live, Mad TV and many others . Lamponic ethnic and racial stereotypes? Comedy is not a chance to develop with Carlos Mencia. Perhaps people, especially viewers and Comedy Central CEOs, will get the point because this week's New York magazine edition has accurately marked him: "Carlos Mencia, fearless joke."
