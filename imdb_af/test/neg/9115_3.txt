The setting for "Nature of the Beast" is ingeniously simple, and has an unlimited potential for tension. Harry's salesman Jack (a very dominant Lance Henriksen) is having trouble in the form of crochet Adrian (Eric Roberts), who appears to possess incriminating information against Jack. Oh, and more than a million dollars were stolen from a casino and someone called "Hatchet Man" is people who are disbanding in the desert. Sounds good, right? Kind of like "The Hitcher" meets "Psycho." One or both of these men have a secret, and nothing is as it seems! Well, writer-director Victor Salva (of "Jeepers Creepers" and "Powder" fame) doesn't have enough ideas to keep the movie, the scenario doesn't make any tension or tension (poison for what is called a "thriller") , and the inclusion of an underlying gay erotic tone seems out of place. Henriksen calls on an unusual, non-eternal federation, but even Roberts is as threatening and frightening as an extra in "Death Wish 3"; we are never sucked to the point where we actually care about what is going on, and the conclusion moves to unlikely territory (i thought it would be "Fight Club" again, but i was wrong). Sorry. The nature of the animal could have been something else instead of nothing else.
