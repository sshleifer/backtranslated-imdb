Years ago, when DARLING LILI was playing on TV, it was always the pan and scan version that I hated and decided to watch the movie in its right widescreen format. When I saw a cheap DVD of this July Andrews / Blake Edwards opus, I decided to buy it once and for all. <br /> <br /> Boy, what a horrible movie. It's so bad and on so many levels that I really don't know where to start with describing where and when it goes so badly. Look at it now, it is obvious to any movie fans that Blake Edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors have hit Andrews in musical (MARY POPPINS, SOUND OF MUSIC, THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE, etc.), but also because Andrews was in the lead in July-famous projects (CAMELOT, MY FAIR LADY, etc.) because Hollywood thought she wasn't sexy or glamorous. Thus, Blake created this stillborn attempt to portray his wife in a bizarre fusion of spy story / war movie / romance / slapstick comedy / musical. DARLING LILI suffers from various personalities, never knowing who or what it is. Some specific scenes are good or effective, but as a whole, it doesn't work at all. It is very embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Do you think the DVD version is the director's track "or, in this case," let's save what we can "from this infamous box office flop. Edwards cuts 19 scenes (19 !!!!!!!!) of the original inflated scene version in this more streamlined and yet remarkable ineffective version, moving along with no idea what it is. don't know what's going on, or why do we look what goes. What kind of spy is Lili? How powerful is she? Was she ever responsible for someone's death? Instead, we look at a thoroughly bored look "Hud Hudson is trying to get a really bored look at Julie Andrews. Things are not much helped by the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love. Why does Julie fall for Hudson? Why is he and not other men involved?" have been parents, to win her back or to decipher her secret, which would be of great help to us I had in contrast to the confused action. This would also give us the sluggish procedures. There is no catalyst in this story. <br /> <br /> You just have to look at the cutting scenes to see clearly that Edwards and the author only have ideas inspired by Andrew's (and Edwards) past successes. The best (or worst) example is the scene when Andrews and Hudson follow a group of kids in the middle of a forest. Edwards Channel SOUND OF MUSIC. It's no wonder he removed it from the DVD. Back in 1970, that scene might have worked at some level, but today, that moment's set of despair. There are other album elements inspired directly by Andrews / Edwards's other films. The endless scenes of dogfights are inspired by the much better MODERN MILLION. The musical moment: "I will guess your three" has just been created to make Julie's MARY POPPINS persona, changing "raunchy" with July doing a striptease in the act. The finite, bird flight of July running to Hudson's plane is another wink at SOUND OF MUSIC. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is confusing. Julie plays a singer, born from a German father and British mother who lives in England, but sings her (English) songs in Paris. You never know exactly where the story takes place. Some moments are only badly edited. Like when Julie and her "uncle" are on horseback. They talk and talk and then July suddenly shoots in the middle of the sentence. I'm like "what happened here?" <br /> <br /> The comedy pieces are rude and unrelenting. Every scene with the French police is pathetic. Where is Peter Sellers when you really need him. The action is silly relentless. When Julie and her "uncle" are heading for Germany on the train, Hudson's squadron shoots laps dots at the train, and Lili is almost killed in the process. Brilliant. What is also funny about the scene is the two in the middle of the night on the train, but Hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly the next morning. It's a slow train there. <br /> <br /> The musical moments. The beginning is the best part of the whole movie (and the reason I gave this movie 3 stars), but its effect is significantly reduced because it is repeated at the end. We really need to have a look to see, Crepe Suzette stripping scene and July strip? The "Girl in no man's land" is OK, even though it is obvious, but that moment makes no sense, because Lili sends it to a group of injured soldiers at a French hospital and asks me : How many soldiers were indirectly injured by her espionage? <br /> <br /> The whole project is listless and without energy. The romance is 100% incredible. Rock Hudson is far too old and tired to watch (watch the museum scene). Julie looks dazed, as she is on Valium. But what really kills this unfortunate project is July playing a German spy. Edwards wanted the Mary Poppins syndrome to drive out desperately, believing a traitor was a good career decision. As much as I like from July, she is no Greta Garbo, who drew it so beautifully in MATA HARI. Strangely enough, even if July is playing a German spy, she still comes across as stocking and cute. <br /> <br /> How bad is DARLING LILI? Even after 37 years since his release, Blake felt Edwards still had to work for his DVD release.
