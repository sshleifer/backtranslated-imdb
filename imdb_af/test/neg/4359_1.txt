Suburban children meet the forest. Killjoy is better in this part. He is also more angry and stronger. However, most of the play is also bad, as in the first one. Sometimes the characters say things to each other that are not meaningful and not convincing. I made a mistake to see this one sober. You will probably enjoy it more if you don't ;-). If you have not been loved after the first movie, you will definitely come to the second ..... ;-) <br /> <br /> Problem children and their viewers are heading for a bush camp. . And what a coincidence, their car broke right in the middle of a forest and ... at night? It's just their luck. They find a house and one is shot, one of the viewers stays behind (why I don't know) and the rest eventually find another home. In that house a voodoo priestess lives ..... but she is not responsible for the resurrection of Killjoy. Who is this? Well, you look better at the movie and find out for yourself ....
