Now I know that many black humor makes fun of typical black things, such as golden teeth. But that doesn't mean they're always funny. Don't be a threat, that's an example of this. The urban film certainly lends itself to satire. The problem is that Wayans and consorts are not only trying to satirize the typical 'ghetto' culture, but also the valid statements made in urban movies, such as Boyz's Hood of Menace II Society. Personally, I think the makers of this movie should move their heads away from the gut movements of their white masters. In addition, the movie itself is terrible. It is absolutely not funny. The jokes are racist. Instead of satirizing the urban film genre, filmmakers show their views of the 'ignorant' urban (ghetto) blacks. Now there are some other jokes in this movie, but I believe it's the main prize. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie shit and the makers need to use their talents to make a constructive comedy / satire movie. They have examples in men with black hats (made before this movie) and Friday.
