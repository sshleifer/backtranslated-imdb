this movie is so bad it forced me to create an account with IMDb just to warn others about it. <br /> <br /> I used IMDb for a long time and many movies came close to letting me register to praise or bash them, but no one was ever so worthy. Until now! <br /> <br /> I'm a great Matt Dillon fan. All I could ask myself for the movie is, "How did Dillon choose this script?" really. I mean there are holes in it bigger than Vredefort. <br /> <br /> I mean it's a contemporary movie, not one in the seventies. To cry out loud, even a child knows that armored trucks have GPS tracking and that kind. make you wonder what it takes to get a script in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> I can go for centuries, but I won't. believe me when I say it. save yourself the time and give it a ship. <br /> <br /> Sorry Matt, I'm still a fan, but this movie sucked.
