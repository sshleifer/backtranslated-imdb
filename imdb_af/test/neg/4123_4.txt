I just requested this movie and I must say it was a good movie, I loved the good guy and I loved the killer robot, but the movie had a little hole in it. <br /> <br /> The name of the people in it was kind of .. stupid .. I think people should be sued by the creator of this movie for how lamb it was at the end. The first half hour was good, but then it just dragged and then I was happy. I was over ... but still had the killer robot and the movie's good guy in it. <br /> <br /> I think it was the best two money I've ever spent because I do like stupid b-movie like this one and come on .. it's a b-movie all.
