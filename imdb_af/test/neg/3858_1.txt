There is a well-known short story about a man who becomes the prey of a safari hunter who has lost interest in hunting nothing but the people. It's pretty good, and it has been done and re-discovered in film and TV many times. Some are striking, but this urbanized version that injects the tired old racist themes, just flat, stink. Leguizamo's slapstick is almost as weak as the unfunny script. Chaplin, this man is not. There must be people who get a dwarf who can't stop joking, I think it's funny in a pathetic, freakish way, but it's not enough to carry a movie. You make the ordinary Nazi ruler or neo-Nazi, whatever we have to think, villain, whose son is of course gay, German accent ... get the picture?
