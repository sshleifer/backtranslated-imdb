A trio sits at a restaurant table and stares wordlessly in space. Later they leaned on a track and stared across the Channel in England. A man works repeatedly in his garden, just his head and upper body on the screen. A man and a woman look at another man picking up a stone wall. Each of these silent shots lasts about one full minute. Absolutely no information was provided that we couldn't find in about a quarter of us. The editor should have been half asleep. I know I was. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with a spectacular shot of the raw vagina of a naturally dead body. The gorge rises. But then the policeman (Schotte) exchanges a few words with a neighboring couple and begins afterwards and the case is forgotten for the next half hour while Schotte and his friends are trading unwise with each other and with strangers. Eventually, the thread of the case is picked up again, but moves slowly, almost aimlessly, to the stylistic pattern already established. <br /> <br /> Sometimes in movies like this the location shooting offers a kind of atmosphere that compensates for the boredom of the story, but not here. The houses of the French village are connected in long rows. The house fronts sit directly on the pavement, without steps. The objects show virtually no decoration and are quite indistinguishable. The flat agricultural land is impeccable. What has been one of the more interesting episodes - a visit to a rocky fort on the coast - leads the trio until they start acting like a snout. <br /> <br /> The acting is minimal. No one seems particularly anxious to say anything. No jokes are made. Nothing amusing happens. The policeman has a face almost as interesting as Randy Quaid. The baby, a long sturdy blonde, looks like the kind of shooting putter on steroids used by the East Germans at the Olympics. <br /> <br /> I sat there for over an hour before giving up. . Maybe I'll take it a little again. Unless I missed something or it didn't lead to the end of the Monty Python routine, I don't think you'll get much from renting it.
