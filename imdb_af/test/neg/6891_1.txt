This movie was so predictable and poorly performed. I really can't recommend it to anyone, not even to unintentional laughter. It's just bad. It's pure TV movie hell, the role play doesn't look that bad, but they do terribly. Just stay far away from this movie and rent something more intellectual, like porn.
