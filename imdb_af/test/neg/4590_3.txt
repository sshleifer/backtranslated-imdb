Give me a chance. How can anyone say it's a good hockey movie? I know that movies tend to do a beautiful p *** - poor work to portray the hockey to the general public. And yes, it was returned when the US did not embrace our sport, as far as it is today, but really. I played my whole hockey and watched even more, and that's my friends, pure lunacy. The screens on the ice were devastating bizzare ... the specific case I was referring to was the "sword fight". I mean the "stick fight" at the end of the movie ... during which everyone just watches, not with fascination that it actually happens, but in wonder what the game between Youngblood and his nemesis Rakkie will win. Yes, the ice story is a little better, I stress LITTLE. <br /> <br /> I don't know, maybe there's no point going on. I mean, let's see it: the movie is right. Hockey is just one big battle on ice ... yeah with a little bit of vulcanized rubber moving around - occasionally called a "target". Youngblood is either terrible or hysterical, I can't figure out which ... maybe someone else would have more luck.
