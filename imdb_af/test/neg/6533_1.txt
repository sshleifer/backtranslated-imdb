This movie is ridiculous. It is trying to be a comedy, but the script is terrible. The whole movie is done in low light and you can't understand it's a comedy. Actually, bad cinematography is. You really have to sit there and look to realize there are a few jokes here and there, but either they are all inside jokes. It's more like a wannabe drama movie that has gone bad. It's really a very senseless movie. Their expressions show nothing but dismay and disaster that anyway comes that way. Unless you want to get bored of your ass, I suggest you stay away from this movie of a movie.
