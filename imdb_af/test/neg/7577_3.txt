I have seen many Japanese horror movies and I have to say that some of them are really interesting, but they are all pretty much the same. this one is no exception. The ghost is a black-haired girl who fears it is victims by doing nothing but walking and dying. The difference is just the motive for the ghost. The rest is the same as every time: black-haired girl, strange things happening to some media (photos), creepy acting. While watching this movie, I was constantly asking myself to ask why I was wasting my time seeing things someone else has done so much better. some scenes where quite nice though, I'll give it 3 out of 10
