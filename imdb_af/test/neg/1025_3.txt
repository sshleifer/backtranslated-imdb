Although I am not a great Coen brother lover, I am a fan of their dark humor films like "Fargo" and "Miller's Crossing." I'm much less impressed with their other comic mode, goofy-camp (or is it Camp Goofy?) Unfortunately, oh brother, where are you? falls into the latter category and is not even as good as 'The Big Lebowski' or 'The Hudsucker Proxy'. <br /> <br /> 'O Brother' is basically an episodic series of jokes without lots of points, and not so much humor or cunning. As most reviewers have noticed, the movie's plot is very loose? and, as far as I can say, randomly ?? based on The Odyssey. His main character, Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), is an "adventurer" like his homosexual reference mate and, as his "real" goal, returns home to prevent his wife Penny's marriage. Of course, we do not discover that it really wants the Clooney / Ulysses character until long after we stopped caring. And what has Homer to do with 'Cool Hand Luke' chain gangs, Ku Klux Klan meets a low "Indiana Jones" cultural event, a vocabulary of an uncivilized lawyer, a talent for blue grass country music, an association with Baby Face Nelson, a Clark Gable look-alike hairstyle, and other random and diverse traits and encounters? I leave it for others to discern. <br /> <br /> The reference to Preston Sturges' 'Sullivan's Travels' in' O Brother's' title is equally senseless. Yes, viewers familiar with the Sturges screw-ball comedy classic can find it a bit rewarding to recognize the title of the socially-conscious depression film. Sullivan leaves Hollywood and comedy that hopes to make. And they can even be slightly amused by a few shooting / acting riffs (eg, freighters, and the chain gang swinging in a movie). But what? The Coen brothers seem to add nothing to the art-for-art affairs versus moral high-serious critical debate on the function of art. Of course, they fall into the previous school, but the reference does not seem to be motivated in the slightest. Is it a tribute? If so, why make it? I like postmodern pop culture reference and textual play as much as the next person, but it's much nicer if at least something is tonic, if not thematically consistent? and not just an arbitrary conspiracy. <br /> <br /> This script is simply a fool's mess. The only consistent and consistent pleasing element is the folk / country music soundtrack. It doesn't have much to do with Homer or Preston Sturges, but with the rest of the movie it's probably a good thing. On the other hand, I recommend using the price of admission on the soundtrack CD.
