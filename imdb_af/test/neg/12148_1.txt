The horrific production does not qualify as a "movie." It was clearly shot at videotape, and very bad about it! There is a constant sound for the sound (sounds like a bad microphone), which is so annoying that you sometimes cannot understand what the characters say. Poorly connected music will suddenly appear in a scene, and the whole editing of this thing is a NEW! <br /> <br /> The plot is confronted and ridiculous. A last 20-year-old man trying to hide his life-in-love from parents? PLEASE! And the reaction the mother has when she gets a picture of her son kissing his boy-frolic is beyond melodramatic and rides right in silly. Talk about a stereotypical view of gay life! The play is worse than a porn movie, and the direction is very poor! <br /> <br /> As far as production goes, there isn't! <br /> <br /> This title is simply a lame video attempt to call itself a "movie". There is no heart and soul to give it even the least. <br /> <br /> It's just a stupid waste, so avoid it at all costs! BAD WAAK! BAT WRITING! BAD DIRECTOR, and the title of "producer" is vanity as this trash probably cost them the price of the video tape they shot. <br /> <br /> This amethyst filling has no business to be released on a DVD as it is deceptive. to the cunsomer. I can't stress how terrible this SUGARPLUM crap is! <br /> <br />
