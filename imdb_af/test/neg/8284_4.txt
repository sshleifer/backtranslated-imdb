After their star cross-country runner dies after a race, a team team member is captured and murdered by a mysterious masked murderer. He seeks revenge for the girl's death. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of this movie it is clear that it will not be very good (at least as far as true quality goes). The 'dramatic' run at the end of the introduction context was one of the least credible sports events I have ever seen in a movie. It seems that the winner of the race has never before gone through her whole life. Not just running. . . but don't run at all. Ever. From there we get a terribly unrealistic female naval member who breaks various appearance rules with her jewelry and makeup, not to mention the fact that her hair is loose in her collar while in uniform. Ridiculously awkward camera angles, pathetically executed gore effects and acting that turned from frighteningly over-the-top to being annoyingly over (all in one actor, you think) help everyone around this movie one of the most unintended hilarious horror movies to make ever made. On the other hand, the writing was not so terrible and the story was really good. But the direction was terrible, got worse with very bad cinematography. The actor ranged from acceptable to just uncomfortable. Regardless of all the embarrassing elements, there is something here, whether it's cheese or something else I can't figure out, it makes the movie very enjoyable and very worthy. Maybe it was just Vanna White. <br /> <br /> Compulsory Slasher elements: <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: Death scene was fun enough but the gore was just awful: blood stems from impossible corners, no real gashes or wounds from knives, etc. But this movie has the first 'death by football' scene I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: There was a little nudity (I mean, Linnea Quigley is in it) and a little horny high school, but nothing too much. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer (s): If you think leather gloves, stop watches, track suits and fence masks are cool, this one is for you. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Suspense: Not really any. There was one moment in the girls' dressing room that I had prepared myself to be scared. . . but it just led to a typical stupidity and ruined me. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: A little, but if you can't figure out the killer's identity in the movie in 20 minutes, I'm "I'm not sure about your deduction funding. <br /> <br /> - Indifferent Dance Show: There is a wonderful jazz session ("Graduation Day Blues") with a guitar and accordion that leads to some fantastic 80's. It will soon be followed by a kind of strange blend of 70-year-old disco and 80s break dancing that was probably the cruel part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 4/10. Don't take it too seriously and you'll enjoy it (just like most other Troma touches). <br /> <br /> -AP3-
