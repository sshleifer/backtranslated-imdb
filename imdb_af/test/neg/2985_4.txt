Sometimes you have patients when you look in horror. If you can just type through the slow early scenes, there will sometimes be a real gem. Unfortunately, this was not the case with 'Satan's Whip'. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Jason Maran, "Satan's Whip" is trying to get us together on a boring movie festival, with no real end to end. I suspect that the black-and-white (and blue) cinematography should be a reason, but it is never explained why the majority of the blood is blue, and I found it more and more annoying when the movie was running . The story in itself is not that bad, and actually has originality and decent content, but the play is simply pathetic. This, combined with the slow pace and lack of real (red) gore, made a "Satan's Whip" to forget a little soon. I would give it a "4" rating for some witty dialogue that made me visit, but unfortunately, that couldn't save this boring waste of time.
