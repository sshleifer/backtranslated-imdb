"Congo" is based on Michael Crichton's bestselling story, which I thought was missing Crichton's usual charm, clever characters and punch. Well, sorry to say, but that also applies to the movie. <br /> <br /> Here's the plot: <br /> <br /> Greed is bad, this simple morality recovers warnings. A meganomaniac C.E.O. (Joe Don Baker) sends his son in the dangerous African Congo a search for a source of diamonds big enough and pure enough to function as a powerful laser communication transmitter (or is it laser weapons?). When contact with his son and team is lost, his daughter-in-law (Laura Linney), a former CIA operator and computer freak, is sent to them. On her quest, she is accompanied by gadgetry and some eccentric characters (including a mercenary (Ernie Hudson), a research gorilla researcher (Dylan Walsh), and a fresh Indiana-Jones-type search engine to King Solomon's Mines (Tim Curry) After a few narrow escapes from surface-to-air missiles and some African wildlife, they all discover that it's often the best of our downfall. <br /> <br /> The actors in this movie were not talented, Dylan Walsh acting like a pathetic crybaby, especially at the end, Ernie Hudson is unconvincing (is it not a miracle that he stared in TV movies?) and Laura Linney is Nothing special, say safe that the only talented actors in this movie had very little roles: Joe Don Baker and Tim Curry, an ever-pleasing actor (although sometimes touching life by constantly being reminded of his "Rocky"). Horror Picture Days. <br /> <br /> This movie also had other issues, including nd dreadful style, cheesy dialogue and a just boring plot, which was quite similar to Crichton's novel. <br /> <br /> Not even Stan Winston's creature effects can save this movie because it's a disaster. I'm very disappointed in this movie; There was not even a camp quality to save himself. It was just awful, cute, boring and ridiculous, and apparently one of the worst Crichton book-to-movie productions. <br /> <br /> 2/5 stars - <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
