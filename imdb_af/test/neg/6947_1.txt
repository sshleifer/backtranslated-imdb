I could not believe it. This movie was a total piece of time out of my life. The title is appropriate. Love didn't hit hell out of me, this movie did. I kept looking and watching and waiting and waiting for something, anything to happen. And nothing ever happened! Nothing !! Terrence Howard couldn't even save this lame piece of work called a movie. It was dark and confused and I didn't get who eventually killed the girl. The scene and pacing of the film was supposed to build to a dramatic climatic end. It just thought to confuse the audience, because the movie just went by, didn't go true. If you want pure torture, look at this movie.
