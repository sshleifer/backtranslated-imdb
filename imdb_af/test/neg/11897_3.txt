One would think that someone who followed up on the groundbreaking Nabla government official from 30-plus-years ago, at least tries to honor the original with a kind of inspired vision, but no. Here we have a kind of biopsy of one of the most beautiful people of the late 20th century who has no style themselves. In fact, the filmmakers met some outstanding actors - and they got a chopped cup of horror to work with. Everything in the infrastructure of this movie is wrong, starting with the writing, which is yet another of the TV movie condensations of good life, in which every other line is a famous quote by the subject and every other scene is a your introduction to the next turning point in the subject's life. We get Swoozie Kurtz as a PR stomach that promotes Crisp as a stately entertainer; Denis O'Hare, editor of a gay magazine using Crisp as film reviewer, becomes a bit alienated from him when he looks careless for the passions of 80's AIDS activists and then returns to the fold as a compassionate friend of the dying okogenic; Jonathan Tucker (in a good performance) as a shy, unsafe painter of gay-themed canvases befriended by Crisp; and finally Cynthia Nixon as performing artist and Woman-About-Bohemia Penny Arcade, inspired by Crisp's persona, offers him a place in her travel cabaret game. Nixon is a persuasive and gifted artist, but is not provided by the screenplay. Crisp spent the past 20 years living in a one-room apartment in an old home in Manhattan's eastern village. He announced that he had never cleaned, because "after a few years the substance will not get worse," or something. But looking at the depiction of the apartment in this movie, you never get the taste of that substance. He regularly visited a local coffee shop on a busy lane and will be seen pretty much every day of the week and watch tea and watch the world. In this movie we get a dinner that looks like something on 12th Avenue at the Hudson River. Most of the streets of New York's scenes have a sterile, unreal appearance with no sense of time. <br /> <br /> The soul of this movie is the great John Hurt in the title role. After nearly 35 years, he can still understand the essence of this peculiar post-Edwardian Englishman and turn it into third millennia. Its every line, every gesture is beautiful. In the later scene, he even modulated his vocal projection to suit a person's life leading to death. Crisp wrote briefly before he left this kingdom that when one grows very old, the skin takes on the character of a stinky coat that cannot be removed and longs for death. One feels the feeling in Hurt's performance. So, for him and him alone, this film is worth a look.
