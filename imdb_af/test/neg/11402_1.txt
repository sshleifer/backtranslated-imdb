One of the movies I just didn't want to see. I did it in the sneak preview, but damn, the acting was very bad! At the end of the movie (I'm still amazed to have watched the whole movie.) I wondered why I watched the movie. <br /> <br /> Also here in the Netherlands, the author of this movie (it is filmed by a book by Giphart) thought it was very bad, and was disappointed that his movie came out so. Next time he wants to play a role in choosing people for the cast.
