people, get a clue! I mean, the authors don't have one, so I'll expect you to ... this show is such a pale imitation of the '60s show you can laugh at it! and the sixties show is the one with the cheap special effects, and is in B & W fer Chrissakes! Still, the mood and writing on the old show is MILES for this drive. Get HiP kids! If 98 degrees or Brittany told you to see it, you'll do it! You know it! Just bypass them and tell all your friends that you were "IN" with the "scene" before it got too cool!
