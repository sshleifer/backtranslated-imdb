Spirit-boring boring, completely predictable and in the end just ridiculous. It almost summed up the catastrophe that was innocent. Starting with a decent condition, the whole thing just unfolds and becomes a complete mess. Basically the story comes to the question: "Do you want your wife to sleep one million dollars with another man?" Of course, here's the answer yes, because otherwise we wouldn't have a movie. Frankly, we would have been better if we didn't have a movie. <br /> <br /> Our married (and financially distressed) couple are played by Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore. They go to Vegas to get rich. Yes, it will work. Anyway, a billionaire, played by Robert Redford, loves the woman and makes the million dollar offer. For one night with the woman he will give them financial security. The aftermath of that one night is what the movie really is about. Unfortunately, nothing in the aftermath is the least entertaining. The script is so predictable that you can say the characters' lines before they do. The performances leave much to be desired. Harrelson would be better off sticking to comedies, as this attempt to act seriously misses the point. Anguish is not something that enables him to portray. And it's pretty safe to say that Demi Moore will never get space in her home for any academy awards. Why is she a movie star again? In a part full of emotion, she carries nothing. Only Redford escapes mostly intact. He is pretty clever, but is the best actor of the bunch. But he can't save this movie. Awful script, mean acting, plodding tempo, zero entertainment ... Unfinished Proposal is really awful.
