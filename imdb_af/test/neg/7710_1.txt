o man, where to even start ..... <br /> <br /> let your gun fall hand in hand with a zombie while holding a teeth soldier to argue to shoot him b4 he turns then turns and bites the person holding him, turns your back on a "fallen" zombie, constantly shoots the chest and sees that it does not work, so they shoot the chest more, with the idea that a child on a desk bag With blood coming out of his mouth, it is still good to walk on a soccer field, as nothing is wrong, then suddenly it is noticed that the zombie soccer team is all in the middle of the field do, as they could not be seen until then. .... <br /> <br /> I can go one more hour, but you get the point ..... childish writing and dialogue, bad direction, terrific special effects, really sad and undeveloped storyline (zombie infected campus, must get the viral host, lose it twice.), the only plus I can find is that this one does not include clips of the real game ring the "action scenes" .... <br /> <br /> id says don't waste your money but id is more upset about wasting time, i saw it on the cable and wanted to return the 2 hours of my life
