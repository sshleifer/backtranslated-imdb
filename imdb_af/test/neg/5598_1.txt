It was made in 2004 for godsake, what happened to our latest special effects? What happened to our rough around the edges, but still good actors? The actors in this movie were incredibly terrible, there were one or two that weren't bad, but the rest, biggg thumbs down. Can't keep listening to the badly written dialogue, I mean, who wrote the script? Please never write again! Special effects? Don't even start with the special effects. SORRY, they could get better and then completely fake with green balls in the eyepieces. It looks so old and .. make honest. Even the easiest thing to look like is actually the teeth, they looked so fake and stupid that I would almost wipe out a tear from my eye. Come on, I can't believe it's even been shown to the public!
