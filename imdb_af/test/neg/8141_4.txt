Certainly not a bad, low budget film, this "Bride of the Gorilla", but nothing special, and not memorable enough to stand under the meaningful scientific efforts of his time. Director Curt Siodmak was a leading screenwriter in the 1930s and 1940s and delivered stories to some true genre-goers ("I ran with a zombie", "The Wolf Man"), but as a director he lacked the required powers. "The Gorilla's Bride" is similar to the aforementioned "The Wolf Man" in story and atmosphere, but the film looks much more amateurish and sad. Both deal with cursed men who become large animals at night, but the titular gorilla does not look half as threatening as the werewolf, although the film was released a whole decade later. During a cute opening speech, actor Lon Chaney tries to convince us that the jungle is an ominous place and hides many riddles, but actually there is no real riddle in the plot. It's just handles about a plantation manager who's jealous of his older colleague because he has such a beautiful young woman and he kills him. An indigenous woman testifies to his crime and makes a play on Barney who turns him into a devastating gorilla by night. Or maybe she just wants him to believe he becomes an incredibly big gorilla? Lon Chaney himself plays the police commissioner charged with the murder investigation while Raymond Burr (who died in about a thousand Perry Mason TV movies) portrays the prying plantation manager / night gorilla. Siodmak aims to make the movie look like a supernatural thriller ?? is it or does it not just happen in Barney's head? ?? Failure failed and it caused too much talk and too little jungle action. Several of the jungle institutions have been nicely suggested, but the rest of the "special" effects are tough and poor. Still, the play is pretty good, Barbara Payton looks pretty and ?? although very predictable ?? the story is strange to the end. Weird movie, it probably cursed me voodoo?
