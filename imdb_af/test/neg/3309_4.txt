Like many people, I heard of "more" and I wanted to see it because of the music Pink Floyd made. I have to say I was really disappointed, not because of the music, but the movie itself. it is a boring, unceasing movie that lacks rhythm. Where does this disappointment come from? According to me, from different things. First, the film's subject, the drug connects badly with the idle sunny atmosphere of the film. This one had to have taken place in the poor areas of Paris and had, for example, given a dark and helpless climate. In addition, it's supposed to tell a descent in hell, but this descent is soft and scarcely sketched. Barbet Schroeder does not insist on the dramatic side of the story. You could have been a little more crazy, cut. On another hand, Schroeder does not succeed in getting the audience's emotion and maintenance ahead of the two main characters' need. You look indifferently to their drug trials. While the two main actors, they are perfectly unexpressive and scarce developed during the movie, especially Mimsy Farmer. In the end, you only retain the beauty of the Mediterranean landscape bathed in sunlight. The film created a great sensation when it was released in 1969. Today it looks like <br /> <br />. The hippie culture is nothing less than a distant memory.
