Talk about junk! I can't think of one good thing in this movie. The screenplay was poor, the acting was terrible and the effects, well, there were no effects. I can't believe the author of this movie did Identity. Everything in this movie made me sick to start. <br /> <br /> The front of the video box shows a showman with sharks like teeth and terrible eyes. I look like a villain villain, but as the old saying "never judges a book," the whole villain looks like a cardboard cut out. One part in the movie is killing a girl by a snake. The area was bad enough, as they could put the whole thing in Lapland, but no, a tropical island. <br /> <br /> I took this movie as a spoof, which I think they wanted it to be, but the only thing that made me laugh badly was the tough effects. You could argue that I didn't look the first one, but to see it I would be safe if I didn't try. <br /> <br /> The biggest joke in this movie is the effects, the snowballs looked like they were homemade, and the root was a total embarrassment. If I would guess the budget for this movie would probably be between 8 to 9 pounds fifty. The producer in a last minute panic must have grabbed the actors for the street, gave them the writing, they have 6 minutes to practice these lines and shoot on an island. Lastly, the play in the film was painful, as if the actors had forgotten their usual lines and had gone through them. <br /> <br /> Finally, I give this movie: 0 stars out of 5
