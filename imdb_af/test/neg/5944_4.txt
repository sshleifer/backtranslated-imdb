Summary: A band of five young American men, all that remained of a platoon that hit hard during the Ardennes offensive during World War II, was commissioned as a leading outpost and looking at hostile activities. They are in a very bad condition, both physically and mentally, and think they have hit gold if their outpost is in a deserted state, but once the beautiful home is full of food. But after a while there are some enemy activities, and it's very strange. Not hostile, but strange. There seems to be a German team there, in the same bad condition, who wants nothing more than to surrender. <br /> <br /> Comment: Based on a novel and I guess the novel is much better, but the story doesn't look very well translated to the big screen. Indeed, this is another war film, much more about the spiritual pressure during the war than fighting and fighting. But I can almost feel those scenes full of tension, full of uncertainties and unknown elements, just falling flat into the movie. It's not exciting, just different and in many ways absurd. Many times people just do insane, and the reasons are unclear or in the best way. <br /> <br /> So when this spiritual pressure fails to come through, the main story of the whole story has thought the story has fallen. by. It wasn't good, it wasn't interesting, it didn't keep me on the brink and it didn't really send a message. Actually, it didn't do anything. <br /> <br /> The role play is interesting, very young actors who changed stars in the beginning of their careers. The acting is good, but not star, and some characters also entered the absurd zone. Much of it I also feel is because of this story, these characters need the time, space and fitting in a novel, which they cannot be given here. And halfway is definitely not good enough. <br /> <br /> 4/10
