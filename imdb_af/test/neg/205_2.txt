What a bad movie, the starting point was all there, the actors were all there. And yet, a credible plot, good dialogue, characters related to, is a bit lacking. <br /> <br /> Typical whore has gone wrong against the backdrop of every person being shot by the system. The main character Tye and his little brother had no luck and their home will be taken back. Along the grandfather Matt Dillon (who doesn't look much older than Times, it's not exactly sure how it happened) to the rescue with a plan to steal money from an armored wagon they are working as security guards. Times have a short flirt with a conscience, but decide to go with it. And so start a really horrible hole that drove 30 minutes of incredible rubbish. I will not list all the ways in which this movie was unrealistic, but let me point out the great: <br /> <br /> Due to Times who decided to be a good guy because a homeless man collateral all his good friends including his godfather died. His godfather allegedly family and the man who brought him into the captain at the last moment to help him die due to Times. Times in the process of hiding his friends and godfather destroy all the money. The money came from the same bank that seized his home. And yet he chose it over the supposed family of Matt Dillon. <br /> <br /> There is much more, it is unnecessary to say that this movie was once and I seriously hope that no one else is going to see it.
