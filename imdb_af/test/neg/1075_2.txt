This movie did well at the box office, and the manufacturers of this mess thought the stars had such a good chemistry in this that they cast them into the much darker screw-ball farce, The Gazebo. Frankly, I'm shocked to see all the positive comments on this ridiculous, unfair comedy. Both main characters have the maturity of seven-year-olds and are much less interesting to spend time with. A veteran support throw including Fred Clark, Harry Morgan, and Eva Gabor lend excellent support. And the beautiful cinematography makes sure that the rich countryside of Spain is lush. And there are four or five really funny scenes to go with two-way plays and a whole bunch of recycled and intact junk. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend it. It starts with a kiss.
