Oh my God ... where to start? "Chupacabra Terror" is one of the worst B-Horror movies ever made. This crap makes "Demon Slayer" like "The Exorcist". Special note: A Horror B movie must have at least one sex scene. Don't even expect a hot girl in this one. With that unforgivable mistake, I have to start with the full bash. <br /> <br /> First of all, if you are going to make a Horror monster movie, you should spend a lot of the budget for a "cool" monster outfit. The monster in this movie looks like a $ 10 Halloween Costume There is no way the Chupacabras (yes, this is how it is spelled) seems threatening in the movie - this is an actor in a Halloween outfit please! evil. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the gore effects are the spinal cord of any direct-to-video sample horror movie, yet the producers have decided not to spend proper gore effects. blood looks doomed, look at the man who was hewed in two, probably the best scene in the movie and it lasts about ten seconds. The end is a very poor scene that will not please you. <br /> <br /> The acting is the last thing you should expect to have quality in these types of movies, but in this movie it's pretty awful. With no acting experience, the fool himself is about 85 minutes. Special mention deserves a blonde man with curly hair trying to convince SWAT members that he is sick. The cough he is false is rather ridiculous. He's probably the worst actor ever in a B-Horror movie, no joke. Captain Pe√±a also delivers a terrible performance in the first ten minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> The TRUE story behind the Chupacabras is not even told. All you need to know is that the monster sucks the goat's blood. Why bother with this piece of crap? Pleasure, don't even look if you have the chance. Not even when flying on the cable. <br /> <br /> I usually support low budget Horror movies because the people involved with them at least try to do something different from Hollywood, but that doesn't mean Horror fans like me should accept this kind of rubbish no.
