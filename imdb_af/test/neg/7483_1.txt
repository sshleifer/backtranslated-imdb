I don't think I've ever given a 1/10 score, but this one easily gets the denomination. I find it hard to just put one of his jokes. It's not just that the jokes are so bad, but it combines with the fact that Carson Daily has no charisma, can't set up or complete a punchline, and you have a late-comedy recipe that will really make your stomach change. <br /> <br /> I watched the show, never at all, but many more. It just crawls me to Conan. I usually look at a minute or two just to see if Carson is still the worst talk show host daily. <br /> <br /> If you ever see him questioning, it's just an interview. I feel so sorry every time he has a guest and their confused smile tries to mask their body language, shouting: "Make me hell away from this freak!" I recommend watching the show, not for a laugh, but thinking, how he is on the air and what he is still doing there. Look as much as you can, I think you will find its complete discomfort ... interesting.
