I don't know if this kind of movie was as a clich√© than it now seems. <br /> <br /> However, much of the "Bad News Bears" movies released by 1980, I think This kind of movie was already a tired idea. <br /> <br /> A former soccer player is partially paralyzed in Vietnam and is restricted to a wheelchair. The Chicago Bears offers him a PR job, but he wants to coach. At the same time, his minor cousin is being picked up for armed robbery. We are told that he has already been arrested a dozen times before and now he has to serve some hard times ... which seems to be less than a year! <br /> <br /> Of course, the kid is really a good kid who just needs a tough male role model in his life. The same goes for all the children in the detention facility. Yes ... even one locked up for attempted murder! I'm sure you already know what's happening, so I'll try to keep the rest of this letter. <br /> <br /> Our protagonist becomes the children's soccer team coach. He overcame the criminals' cynicism and deserves their respect. His team is facing a local high school team (yes right!) And they are kicking their kicks. Now, more than ever, deciding to prove himself a worthy coach, he calls for a repeat. Will these underprivileged, skurppy children with hearts of gold be able to improve enough to win the rematch? Strange execution of the soccer order ruins any possibility of excitement in this movie. "Coach of the Year" should be penalized for the spine of my brain. 10/01
