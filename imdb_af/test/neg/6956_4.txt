On paper it looks like a good movie. Michael Caine plays a tough and relentless boxing promoter, whose son is for a title eliminator. It is a pity that when the story of paper is transferred to my television screen, it loses a certain thing. I was hoping we'd be seen as his decisive role in GET CARTER and as the film progresses, it looks like it's the features of a tough raging revenge ranger, but the whole scene of the movie is so full of confusion. about what genre it suits. For example, Caine (who you can't believe if Billy "Shiner" Simpson isn't, he's simply Michael Caine) has a laugh in line as he refers to someone like Hattie Jacques, and then in a so-called humorous moment his henchmen broken his arm. . Oh how I laughed. I mean it's supposed to provoke a laugh how it plays on the screen, isn't it? But it seems to be inconsistent with the way the rest of the movie speaks. <br /> <br /> Clearly, director John Irvin doesn't know what approach to take with Scott Cherry's screenplay. Irvin is not a bad director and is well regarded for his war films such as the DOGS OF WAR and HAMBURGER HILL, but he is badly suited to this kind of violent drama. One can't help but feel that he might be a bit intimidated by a living legend like Caine. Caine gives the impression that he is just doing it for the money and the familiar faces in supporting roles like Landua and Cranham are basically just comos that can be played by someone.
