In this movie everything was possible wrong and I don't know why I bother it to the end. It would be more fun to keep paint dry. To cry out loud, I even kept D-Tox and it was much better than that. Here's the basic plot for you: A redhead is bitten by snakes that contain the evil of 13 killers and is a murderous killing machine that kills teens who kill zero personality. During the film I lost hope when it didn't scare me at all, when the murder was bad and there was BAD CGI blood and CGI snakes. It got worse with the cardboard thin characters who murdered their friend by keeping her off her legs and not letting go, so she was hit by a tree and moving the bad man under the water like the shark in Jaws has. I'm still upset why I'm even bothering it. I think, because I'm a horror movie fan.
