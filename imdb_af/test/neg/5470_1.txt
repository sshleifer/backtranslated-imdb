Low budget wastage on bloodthirsty cysts in Greece led by Peter Cushing. It's up to Donald Pleasance to stop them. Crown International released this crap in 1978, and it was "dog-of-the-week" on one of Sneak Preview's episodes with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. I forgot what the two "dogged" it, but I see the point. Crappy movie has the worst Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance performances I've ever seen. There is a sample on the video box. There is no such animal in the movie. Instead, you get a statue, but at least it is atom correct. (Woo hoo!) <br /> <br /> The cults look like the Klu Klux Klowns ... as a group can exist. Skip it.
