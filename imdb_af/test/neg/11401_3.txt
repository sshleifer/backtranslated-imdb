It's one of the worst movies I've seen for a while. The acting was just as bad. Anthonie Kamerling is usually a pretty good actor, but in this film he sounded that he was reading his text from a piece of paper. Especially his voice was very wood. Beau van Erven Dorens was quite over the top like Frat's boy Fraser, although it probably had more to do with the crappy dialogue. "I too of you" is an adaptation of a book, and it seems that the creators of the film have forgotten that film dialogue follows different rules than the literary dialogue. It all sounded like books. <br /> <br /> Some of the situations were very poorly visualized. For example, somewhere at the beginning of the movie there is a scene where a canoe is quickly left. This bit is just too incredible to be true. You see a natural, shallow, shallow river, with lots of rocks right under the surface (so fast). We hear some exciting music to warn us that there is danger ahead. A canoe with girls goes over in that fairly level fast. Our hero then dives a few meters below the surface to save one of the girls. Girl beats in his arms and speaks the words: "You saved me ..." Vomit! <br /> <br /> It was so bad it got funny. It's sad because it wasn't really meant. At the break I heard a guy behind me, "Oh god, there's another part!" My feelings exactly. What scares me is that the end credits of "I too of you" were in English. Does this mean that it will be released abroad? Just when the Netherlands started to get a good reputation after films like Antonia (Antonia's line) and "Character" (Character) ...
