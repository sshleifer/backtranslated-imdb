This sickly sweet and laborious 5-reel is definitely not under Harold Lloyd's better movies. Gags are sparsely and mostly not inspired. Saccharine melodrama is plentiful. The set-up lasts forever, such as Lloyd, the unconventional but impossible-friendly country doctor, making his rounds and bringing some sunshine to the lives of children, the elderly and puppies. It's like a 1922 version of Patch Adams. Ugh. 10/04.
