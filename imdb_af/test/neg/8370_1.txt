It's a big bummer that makes people easy to make movies because of cheap digital video cameras these days. I usually appreciate this possibility, but if you see movies like this, it's just a great shame. and it is also very shy as people like hp. Lovecraft is being abused by this. I hired this "movie" cuz from the drop "hp lovecraft". And I am a huge fan of many of his adaptations, especially those made by Brian Yuzna & Stuart Gordon. this movie has nothing to deliver! a cheap scenery on a beach and in an old wine cellar. digi-cam effect "red light" throughout the movie. no actors, just a few stupid low-grade models who probably have no idea what they are doing, stiff like wood. and so must the director. Obviously he was trying to create an atmosphere. but if the whole thing is so hard, it just doesn't work. and no gore effects, just a little blood in a river (you drink = you become devil) and fall here and there. Oh, the story: thousands of years ago some "big parents" colonized the world and adopted people as slaves. then man became independent, so that the "old" tried to destroy them. And now there are some survivors in a post-apocalyptic world. The only way to save humanity is to find the NECRONOMICON, that's where it comes to LOVECRAFT. So the soldiers fight some undead and demons on their beach and in their wine cellar. incredible - the whole thing! but as it is called (the German title "Armee des Jenseits") and you can find it in most commercial video stores, it seems you can make money with such things. I find this fact impressive.
