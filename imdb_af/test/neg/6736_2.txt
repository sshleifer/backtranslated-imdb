I saw "The Foreigner" in the "Bottom 100" movie lists arranged here on IMDb, so I didn't expect much when I was back on the US channel a week, but I had hope. "Belly Of The Beast" (which was broadcast a month ago) was a mess, but it had fantastic scenery and photography and a few nice moments spread everywhere. I thought this movie might be the same. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie fails to meet the standards of basic viewing capabilities in almost every respect. The script comes down as the bastard progeny of a John LeCarre novel and a Richard Ludlum movie, but done by people with none of the worthy writers' plot and character talent. Instead, we have a glum, temperate, nihilistic, cryptic mare's nest of confused motives, confused alliances, and shootings. And chest shooting. And bombs. And eviscerations. It transfers to the direct style, which relies on chopped "grain / slow motion" shots every 10 seconds, along with wiring and hyperactive jumping cuts. These cinematic devices that were obsolete 10 years ago when MTV directors used them for Whitesnake videos, and the director works them like a punch, hoping to inject some weird art-techno-thriller cool into the proceedings . <br /> <br /> Segal itself is just awful in this. He spends the whole movie in a hurry, throat, and alternates between two expressions: looks as if he is sucking on a lemon while someone is burning a small jar under his nose or looks stubborn. And he is so chunky (and in vain about it) that he never actually takes his knee length down on camera. I understand it's difficult to keep the perimeter under control as a male actor age (although Denzel Washington and Paul Newman never had the problem). But you deal with it by being honest about it and by growing as an actor, not by concealing it with carefully selected camera angles and floor-length clothing. <br /> <br /> So, I can't really tell what's going on, and the movie doesn't give me a reason to worry about what's going on, and the protagonist is quite one dimensional and visually unattractive. Not a recipe for a good movie experience. <br /> <br /> Strange, most of the set designs and scenery are atmospheric and striking; In fact, if you freeze the movie on virtually a given scene that is not close to Seagal, you will get the care and professionalism of the lighting, colors and composition and how beautiful the Eastern European institutions are. However, if you can dress a rotten egg as a Faberge egg, it cannot be edible. And the proceedings are rotten of heart. <br /> <br /> There are cool movies (like "Versus"), and there are visually striking but emotionally cold movies (such as "Underworld") and there are paranoia conspiracy bets (such as "The Bourne Identity" and his remake with Matt Damon). And then there is this thing that cannot prevent what it wants to be, pretend to be all these things and fail because it has no bowels or souls. <br /> <br /> This is a movie made by professionals with a real budget, so you can't really put it in the same class as "Manos", "Killer Shrews" or "Hobgoblins". But I'd rather watch all three of those movies back a few times, than look at Watch The Foreigner again.
