Based on the comments made so far, everyone seems to hate or love this movie. I think it's fair to point out that although it's not a BIG movie, it has interesting interesting moments. For one thing, it was filmed on location in Colorado (was it Breckinridge or Telluride? I can't remember, but it's in the credits). The location is absolutely stunning and spectacular. It's beautiful, even for me who lived in Colorado for a few years. <br /> <br /> Next, it is Disney's penchant for great character characters. Harry Morgan has never been in a better shape than playing in a Disney movie. He is literally hysterical. Also remember the wonderful Mary Wickes? Although she has a "little bit" in this movie, she's big, as always. If you don't know who she is, think of the animated Disney version of Hunchback by Notre Dame (she was one of the gargoyles), and she was also the most interesting nun in "Sister Act" as well as the best nun in "The Trouble With Angels." She has always been a wonderful actress and most character players never receive the recognition they deserve. <br /> <br /> In addition to character characters and all-star casts, Disney did not have the "best" movies in the 1960s and 1970s, but if you really look at some of them from start to finish, you'll notice that every movie has a very funny or hysterical moment in it. The whole movie may not be funny, but there is always a cartoon (at least 1 or 2) in every "live action" movie Disney ever made. Whether it's Harry Morgan in one of his bulging tones, or Tim Conway running around, or Joe Flynn gives one of his precious horror looks, that's all right. The whole movie may not be good, but there are ALWAYS hysterical moments in every Disney movie of this time I have ever seen. Disney in this period has always managed to make a person smile, despite the folly of the movie. <br /> <br /> Realizing this comment, I disagree with viewers who say every Disney movie in this period is terrible. That statement is not entirely accurate. Rather, I'm easier to give credit to the funny moments and ignore the weaknesses in the plots. <br /> <br /> Some live action Disney movies are true classics (Old Yeller, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Mary Poppins), but for those who don't, I appreciate them for what they were - good clean family fun in a time when movies became vulgar, rough and offensive.
