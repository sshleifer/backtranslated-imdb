Two years after leaving the village of Grover's Bend due to the Krites, Brad Brown returned to spend time with his grandmother at Easter time. Meanwhile, the Cretaceous eggs start to hatch. As they cause trouble in the village, Brown and the townspeople, as well as the alien bounty hunters who have returned to end the creatures, must fight the bloodthirsty furballs before they erase the village. <br /> <br /> The original Critters were a small attempt to snatch the family horror movie "Gremlins". It became a cult favorite on the video shelves and was successful enough to justify a sequel. This sequel plays the horror and makes his entire focus comedy instead. Unfortunately, the comedy is extremely clumsy as well as childish. The acting is equivalent to the rest of the movie. It's just that the film suffers from a poor writing. The visual effects were fairly well done. <br /> <br /> Degree: D + Overview by M. K. Geist.
