Twenty years ago, Dr Chopper (yes, he is driving a helicopter and also hitting people) disappeared when police found bodies at his clinic. Since then, people have disappeared around the Tanoka lake (or something) and bodies / body parts are found all over the world. Turned out Dr Chopper needs body parts to stay alive and take them from strangers, like a few lesbians and 5 girls on their initiation (you get the picture) that moves through the Tanoka lake. When a lot of teenagers decide to go camping, they are bound to clash with the doctor ... <br /> <br /> Well, if you want to waste time, it's the right choice. Acting ranges from really bad to mediocre with the girls who fall and fall all the time without terrible reason. Every chance to show skin is taken, but without showing anything at all. The same goes for the special effects that are beautifully pathetic with every corner-filmed slide, so you can't see it, but there are many body parts in the film that is soaked in blood (probably to cover how sad they are) really looks). The plot is rather faulty and dialogue rather sad. Just the time I laughed was when Dr Chopper said, "How much!" when i try to be scary. Don't watch this one if you're not a hack'n'slash freak. Even then, I would recommend looking at something better.
