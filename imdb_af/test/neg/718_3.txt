This movie was recommended to me by some academics. From their comments I had some pretty high expectations. But this movie was nothing but disappointing. The purpose of the director is obvious - to use an interweaving of speeches / poems as a way of arguing against the Bush doctrine. But the director failed. I also seriously questioned the director's choice of main character. It's a bum that's definitely not worth hearing. The rise of corporate power, so what? Most importantly, this movie gets a failed score in its persuasive power; this is clearly meant for those who have already formed their opinions. It is true that the film's aesthetics are very pleasant. But pretty much everything sucks in the movie.
