This movie looks good, and more efforts need to be made to promote movies by women. In addition, this film is also very disturbing because it justifies the manipulative and psychotic operations of a deeply disturbed character. If you've seen any of the promotional material, think it's a pleasant movie about a relationship that has reached its end, but nothing suggests how the central premise is really disturbed: <br /> <br /> " A woman threatens suicide unless she is quick to be ex-is to relive the most valuable memories of their relationship here. Then told how unfairly (so little) such a threat is, suggests Tessa (the alleged protagonist) that "life is not fair." <br /> <br /> Huh ??? This character also uses tears to hold her former lover to keep him and ensure him sexual orientation (which she initially denies as a motive) while assuring him "it's not sex." <br /> <br /> Turn back the sexes, play the prospects of Tracey Gold and Brian Austin-Green. It can fly in the length of time with a title like "Hostage to Obsession". There is no medically acceptable definition of healthy mental and emotional stability that will include Tessa's behavior in this movie. <br /> <br /> Props to Kristen Thomson for playing a borderline psychotic, manipulative ex to a T, perhaps too good. because there is not a well-adapted person, male or female, who can see it, and not the chills have sustained their spine.
