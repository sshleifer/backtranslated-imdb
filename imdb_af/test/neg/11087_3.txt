Let me start by saying that I love Japanese theater, literature and culture in general. I saw a lot of Japanese movies and enjoyed it, but "Portrait of Hell" (aka Jigokuhen) makes him ridiculous. The two characters that dominate the action - the "evil gentleman" in his privileged bubble and the "stubborn, crazy artist" are pure types with zero subtlety or nuance, and all their actions come from cartoon-like extremes. The movie wants to show horrible scenes of violence and raw emotion, but many of these scenes are so over they are actually laughing and the overall feeling is that of a TV movie that is off the rails. If this rarely selected movie falls into your hands or comes to your town, save yourself and pass it on.
