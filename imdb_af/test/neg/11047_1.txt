Some viewers seem to assume that the only thing the viewer can keep is not this movie is the graphic violence. In fact, violence, both disturbing and cartoon, is the last of the "Oldboy" deepest mistakes. The characters are unidimensional, underdeveloped, primitive. The "intensity", an obsession and a goal in itself with this director are served with the cheapest of the means. Let's not confuse a sensible shot of adrenaline with artistic value. By the end of the movie, it looks as if all the cards have been exhausted, so the writing almost accidentally becomes strange in its attempts to find new levels of horror, to continue to shock an audience already by abundance of stupid soap opera "revelations" has already served in great clusters. It will be difficult to imagine someone who is even vaguely familiar with the masterpieces of the fifty years of the Asian theater that is enchanted by this pompous piece of garbage. Imagine Homer Simpson hesitant at the theater: "Should I go or should I buy five cones of ice cream for the same money?" Be smart Homer, go for the ice cream.
