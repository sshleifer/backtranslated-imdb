Ineffective, molly-coddled, self-pitying, lousy provider Jimmy Stewart is a bad marriage to Carole Lombard. After falling into difficult times, he endured a humiliating job, an error finding, a passive aggressive, transferable, live-in-mother with an epic smackdown, and an endless crying baby. The movie marries failure and villain until no observable end. Do you want to see his mother for ninety minutes? Many scenes have a screaming baby. The movie fails to explain why we want to endure the mother of hell or why Jimmy Stewart can't grow a few. Who wanted to see it? Who wanted to see Stewart and Lombard without laughter or charm? <br /> <br /> It is absolutely sad and irreparable.
