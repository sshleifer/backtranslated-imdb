This film proves that a good actor is not without a good direction. Ed Harris is terrible. How can you build an actor like Rambo to play the "Maestro"? He shows no credibility and shows Beethoven. Most of the long hair doesn't look good on his head. The main actress misses all the subtleties needed for his character. The camera shots are cheesy and too conventional. The lights should be close to the characters feelings. Badly decisive and cheap direction. Sorry! The only scene worth the movie is when Beeth (I hope you don't care that I call him by his nickname). It makes the girl's song joke. In any way, I hope Harris can find his way back to real movie where he can really show his hairless talent.
