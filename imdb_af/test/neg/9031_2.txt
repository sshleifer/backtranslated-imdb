"Escape from hell" is not made with enough artworks to hide what it is: crass exploitation. The direction and writing are both sloppy: for example, the camera work during the battle between Cintia Lodetti and Ajita Wilson is so bad you can hardly figure out what's happening; Also, if the doctor of the alcoholic but sweet heart did not kill the officer, the guards would never have followed him and the girls after their escape - the plan for the false plague has worked well so far, but he had to just ruin it. I would have given this movie a 4 out of 10 (the sweat lesbian scene is not bad and Christina Lai has an amazingly beautiful face and body), but a particularly disgusting scene of abuse forced me to cut another 2 points . Of course, some sickos will take it as a recommendation. One thing that is even more disturbing than this film is that some people have given it a positive note!
