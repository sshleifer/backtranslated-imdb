I've never expected too much from a movie by busty B-movie director Jim Wynorski: a stupid representation, some cheap effects and a little nudity of busty babes. I'm usually pretty happy. <br /> <br /> Well, Cheerleader Massacre delivers on the former and definitely the latter, but unfortunately it is a little light when it comes to the squatter. And if a movie has the word 'massacre' in the title, and screws at stake, then Houston, we have a problem. <br /> <br /> Wynorski's movie centers on a group of cheerleaders stranded with their teacher, minibus driver and a few guys during a snowstorm in the mountains. They make their way on foot to a deserted mountain access where they get food and shelter. And a crazy killer who wants them all dead! From the start, the good old Jim cares that his movie has many scenes loaded with T&A. It includes the compulsory landfill, as well as many other moments in which tasty women get necklaces (including a place of fast, soft-sexy sex and a very free three-babies-in-a-hot-tub scene). Not one of the women looks young enough to be cheerleaders (and has never been seen in their outfits), but who cares about such details to see when they are all prepared to slip into the name of art? <br /> <br /> I care about the movie's many dull deaths. With such an extremely lazy title, I was hoping for some ingenious blood loss to go with all the bombs, bushes and boobs; Instead, virtually all the murders outside the screen or phenomenon occur next to no gore. Just a silly na-decay scene (achieved with cheap-as-slides CGI) comes close anywhere to deliver the goods. <br /> <br /> Yet, if you feel in the mood for a little titillation or a bit of slasher silliness minus the horror, then, at 82 minutes, at least Cheerleader Massacre won't waste too much of your time no.
