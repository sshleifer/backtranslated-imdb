8 days no script telling the DVD how the movie was made. It's shot in a vague video that is used from time to time, but it's really partially naked women who sit most of the time in a room. It performed very well and it helped a lot. But the killer appears only once and the girls / women sit and mop they're not trying to escape or make anything interesting, so the whole thing becomes silent for about 20 minutes. Maybe a good short might even have been powerful. They do very little even for eight days. Why? Because they had no writing. How many movies were made without scripts. Not too much. I wonder why this is? How many good movies are made from bad scripts. Not too much. Why is it? Work against this big problem, try the direction and do interesting things, but with what is essentially nothing. Topless girls sitting in dark, grainy, colorless video will be kept going for a while, but not for the short but too long feature length. Actors deserve praise, even though there was only one script. <br /> <br /> Also, the video quality, or the lack thereof, is really low end, they try to use it and sometimes they seem to be shots. Miami Vice, the recent movie that is. But it's not meant to compliment Miami Vice or this failed business.
