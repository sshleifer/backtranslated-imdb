The storyline was good, the actors looked good, the movie would have been <br /> <br /> good. But it certainly wasn't - it didn't lead us anywhere, the <br /> <br /> scenes were strange. Maybe it's meant to create something new, to <br /> <br /> make us think. At least this did: Where's the rest of this movie? For me it was <br /> <br /> wasting money, time and talent. Someone may want to see it for curiosity <br /> <br /> to see if they can figure it out. Other I personally <br /> <br /> would not recommend it to anyone.
