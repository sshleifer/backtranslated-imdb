Friday night With Jonathan Ross, those in charge of Ross should rub with their sweaty little palms. They know the BBC doesn't have imagination when it comes to talk shows, so when they have Jonathan Ross at their disposal, they are fairly settled to just sit back and give a half-white. of the show greeted his ego and smiled at how much the BBC paid him. The show is a complete copy of many American talk shows - Leno, Letterman, Conan O Brian. The list goes on - but he and his team have clearly seen what is working on the masses that can also be done for the Duma in the UK. . <br /> <br /> The unfortunate situation - he has no competition? Parkinson's gone with reality, he was never really too much except a celebs ego. Can't we have someone harder and slicker on British screens instead of Jonathan Ross? As soon as Ross has built up his ego, he continues with the very boring concept of the stiff acquaintances in the green room - so try to get along. If an A-Lister is present (which is so often the case - since there are no other talk shows, they can go to their new movie). He will spend the next hour or thrive with them or try to be their best friend in the universe. Sqeamish when he had Ringo Starr - a man who doesn't care about the ass. Ross really begged for his cellphone number. (As the common policy on this show is, Jonathan Ross is getting each one's number so he can be seen in the right company when it doesn't work). Of course, Ringo said how it was - and simply said no, I didn't like you. Deadpan is serious. <br /> <br /> Ross has to be fetched from all awards and TV shows - the masses will come over it.
