Yes, long ago it became a tourist attraction. Now it's a prison again. Kind of. Well, it's more like an airport mixed with a junior high school, but there are many guys walking around wearing orange jumpsuits, so I think it's like a prison. Not really. When Sasha, Steven Seagal's character, is taken into jail, he is in line and crosses over to another line so he can talk to his friend as he is in line with the airport security test. Then he and his friend had beaten before and beat some security guards. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you something. You strike a patron in a federal prison, they'll shoot you in the spot. Yes Rule would have been shot about 30 times before throwing his second punch. Oh, and there are guys who wear friends and bandanas and what not. In prison. Federal prison. <br /> <br /> You can't dress at most high schools in America. <br /> <br /> Talking of Ja Rule, I have to say that the person who probably enjoyed his performance More than anyone else on earth, including Yes Rule himself, had to be 50 Cent. Just before I watched this movie, I have ever seen one of those shows on TV about the biggest celebrity feuds ever, and like number 7 or 8, this rivalry between 50 Cent, which has lived for real life, and Yes rule. Who doesn't. Every time I saw Ja Rule on the screen, the only thing I could see was 50 Cent's ass laughing. Yes Rule looks like a rough 9 year old every time he appears on the screen. <br /> <br /> Anyway, come back to the plot. It's funny. Sasha is an undercover FBI agent and he agrees to allow himself to be jailed so he can get behind the criminal organization. He is sentenced to five years, and the old line between determination and stupidity disappears immediately. Nothing else in the movie comes down to it, it becomes a meaningless series of action verbs, most of which are not even well choreographed. Oh, how about this "New Alcatraz" rooftop helicopter at one point, accidentally freeing all the prisoners, and what are they doing? They all run out of their cells and play basketball in the middle of the cell block. Without as much as a basket, they had a ball, but it doesn't matter. The scene is so stupid that they can play hopscotch as well as possible. <br /> <br /> Such a guy is sentenced Being the first person ever to be run in Alcatraz's best-known room, apparently not stealing $ 200 million in gold, but not telling where it was hidden when he was caught. <br /> <br / > Hey, good thinking, people. If you can't get information from someone, they'll kill. It's a great way to learn the truth, so a gang breaks into prison planning to stop execution and get it $ 200m place for themselves. <br /> <br /> Yes, the $ 200m is in goldstone, I doubt they thought how hard it would be change it into exchangeable currency. <br /> <br /> There is also the prisoner's issue. He's a tough talk guy who thinks he's a hardcore chore of the barrio, who reminds me of a joke. I have seen this comedian speak once about people in California who are all talking loudly to talking to each other and homes and all sorts of such nonsense. These people go to Mexico, the comedian says, and they are like, "Oh my God! People live there? It's like a whole hut!" <br /> <br /> The best thing is when the United States High Court comes to justice and this man tells her that her men can't carry their guns in his prison. "I don't care if she's an American Supreme Court!" <br /> <br /> This woman can pick him up Like a grape and he thinks he's in control. Ha. <br /> <br /> And, incidentally, the Supreme Justice, which is taken hostage in the movie, tells the bad guy she's 53. It's a year younger than Steven Seagal. I just thought it was funny. <br /> <br /> The only good scene in the movie is the one in prison where Ja Rule is being overturned around this prison like a cotton ball bag by this little Asian woman. It was the funniest thing I've seen in a movie long ago. <br /> <br /> You know I'm working for the company that made this movie (which I why I watched it) and I haven't got a single positive thing to say about it except of course, because that one scene with Ja Rule is spared by that Asian woman. <br /> <br /> Read my review of Malena and you'll see how strongly I sometimes disagree with professional film critics like Roger Ebert, but in his review of this movie Ebert wrote something that I agreed with so much else : <br /> <br /> "I think the flywheels at the MPAA congratulate on a good day's work as they rated 'Half Past Dead' PG-13 after taking the anti-gun movie 'Bowling for Columbine' "gave an R.. <br /> <br /> Get away guys.
