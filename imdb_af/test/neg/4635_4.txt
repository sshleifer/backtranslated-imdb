Not bad shows. Whoopi plays the wise / warm role very well. Still, the storyline and situations cannot be believed (forced PC stereotypes). Sometimes they are good Jews and blacks against the evil White Christians (ho-hum). A typical Hollywood fantasy. The movie has its moments, but it's not one I would recommend to go out to see.
