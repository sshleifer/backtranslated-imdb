Three young college women, Simona (Iva Krajnc), Alja (Tanja Potocnik) and Zana (Pia Zemljic) go on an adventure in the Kolpa River, which divides their Slovenia from neighboring Croatia, into this Slovenian film by Maya Weiss in 2002. What an Eastern European version of the well-known and exciting 1972 "Liberation" could have been, was totally uninspiring to me with flat character depictions that deny sympathetic identification with the characters. <br /> <br /> Alja and Zana are not convincing as students, although Alja is a desire to be a writer and both use what was an excessive language for me. Alja is bored with her boyfriend and seems to be just alive. Zana, even less scientifically, is a self-absorbed adventure seeker with an appeal to other women. I had sympathy with relatively innocent Simona, Conservative and Star Wars. The idea of ​​these three that go with them just doesn't work for me. The contempt that Zana and Alja point to Simona doesn't make sense - why would they choose her as a traveling companion to start knowing her attitude and attitudes? <br /> <br /> The three begin a carefree journey The river on two canoes, indifferent by a news story of a woman's disappearance along the river. Things become more bleak with the mysterious appearance, sometimes really and sometimes also hallucinating, of a racist conservative fisherman politician (Jonas Znidarsic). <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the trio visits along the river and from the small towns. This may be due to a lack of cultural understanding, but the film did not move me differently. I was surprised to see that the film won a few awards.
