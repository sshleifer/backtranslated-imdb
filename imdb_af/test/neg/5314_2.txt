I laughed twice to watch this movie and if you were wondering, I didn't have a bad day, and I wasn't subject to anything else that would distort my opinion when I watched this movie movement. This movie is bad. I wanted to enjoy it and I just couldn't. With all this talent, would you think it would be at least waiting, right? Wrong. <br /> <br /> Let's play suck and don't suck! John Travolta- Very nice. Although I was buried too much, I found him enjoyable. Didn't suck. <br /> <br /> Uma Thurman-After Kill Bill 1 and 2, the girl earns more than this horrible written character. This character's great moment showed someone how to run a T-Mobile Sidekick. Sucked. <br /> <br /> Vince Vaughn- The shot-down role of white man who thinks he's black goes to Vince "Money" Vaughn. Is this character template still considered funny? I love the man, but I want to see him in something better than that. It feels like he's slum. Sucked. <br /> <br /> Cedric the Entertainer- This guy is fine. He made a great monologue after calling a racial play (you can probably guess what it is) which was probably the best part of the movie. He was funny and really raised the material he just gave with his presence. Didn't suck. <br /> <br /> Due to a call display, Harvey Keitel- Sucked. <br /> <br /> James Woods Sucked but not his fault. Actually, yes it was. Remind me of his role in Casino for some reason. I don't like manic James Woods, I like slow burn James Woods. Victim of bad writing, maybe? André 3000- Sucked but he went down swinging. I think he has potential, as long as he is not targeted by a hack. <br /> <br /> Christina Milian- She's absolutely beautiful and of course talented, but this movie won't make her a star. Didn't suck, but needed a better vehicle for her talents that aren't run by a hack. <br /> <br /> The Rock- It must have been the role that put it on the film site, but as indicated by F. Gary Gray, is being furiously disrupted. In this film, the Rock produces this charisma that makes it so enjoyable that I feel unfortunate. He tries very hard and while he doesn't quite succeed, he gets an A + for trouble from me. This man is not afraid to give himself and go completely against the type, with a gay bodyguard with his eyes on the stars. I really want to see him make it big. He has what it takes as long as he is not targeted by a hack. <br /> <br /> What brings me is what I feel, the poor link in this production. I can only come out and say, right? F. Gary Gray's direction was about as solid as really bad diarrhea. Wow, it was bad. Who had the brilliant idea of ​​leading this man? The negotiator was good, but what still convinced people that he was the man for the job? Between his direction and the horrible writing, I am prepared to chop down both culprits to get a delicious salad on their knees. Want to see John and Uma dance? I might think of another movie with the two I could recommend to watch instead. The ten dollars and fifty cents were not worth getting into the theater. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been good and it wasn't even "just okay". <br /> <br /> RATING: * Off *****. <br /> <br /> PS Fergie from Black Eyed Peas is worth mentioning. Hot!
