In 1976 a mother named Norma Lewis (Cameron Diaz) lives with her son Walter and her husband Arthur (James Marsden). One night, a box was placed on the house of their house and the next morning they opened the box to reveal a button device that had to be opened with a key. By late afternoon a man with terrible scars was coming to his face at the door and offering Norma an offer. This man is Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) and he announces that if they hit the button someone in the world who doesn't know the family, they will die and receive a million dollars in cash. If they do not print, nothing will happen and the offer will be transferred to someone else. Norma and Arthur should not tell anyone, including their son about this transaction. The incentive for the family to press the button is increased by their financial difficulties. Arthur, who is currently working for NASA, is not accepted into a new job he is applying for. Norma, a teacher, learns that her faculty funding is being cut. <br /> <br /> A delight for this bizarre sci-fi thriller, based on the short story "Button Button" by Richard Matheson, will determine how far they are willing to take this ridiculous outlook. The opening of the film is particularly problematic to bury him in the sense of realism with the household. Richard Kelly's previous movie Donnie Darko used the condition of schizophrenia cleverly to justify his outing in paranormal activity and parallel universe. Without the dreamy state of the far superior movie, The Box and the idea of ​​a device that can kill someone in the world, is absolutely unquestionable. That Norma also accepts someone in her home who has almost the same scar as Two-Face by The Dark Knight, and believes this offer looks the same. <br /> <br /> If unlikely so far, what follows is even more absurd, with a conspiracy over someone who was struck by lightning, the possibility of alien life, or another divine affecting these situations. Scenes that include gateways opened in public libraries, random nosebleed and senseless drones bumping the Lewis family are almost unconsciously comical in their absurdity. To date, the film can be called pure to see where it goes. Kelly is sometimes smart in his ability to keep our attention through many of the movies. In one scene, Norma teaches a class and is then asked by a strange boy about her foot. He touched her because she missed four of her toes. Later, on a rehearsal dinner for a wedding that Norma and Arthur attend, the same student appears as a waiter and looks stalking. Yet, the ultimate justification for these all these peculiarities is wrapped in a highly-configured scientific revelation that will be very careless and difficult to swallow. <br /> <br /> What is most disappointing about the movie is that once the button is pressed surprisingly early, many of the moral implications initially promised are being reduced for very expensive images. The end, which will not be spoiled here, revives these moral questions again in the hope of equating it with a Greek tragedy. While the agreements can be seen, at this point, given the likelihood of so much of the film and the uneven actions, there is little reason to care. Cameron Diaz's southern accent may be unnecessary, but it is surprisingly Langella who is the most disappointing in the film, with a very unpaid written role, as the mysterious eagles who hide a military base that dr. Evil would make pride. It's really just a shadow of his high performance in Frost / Nixon. There isn't much to do for many of the other actors in the movie; In particular, both Norma and Arthur could not be regarded as characters, but mouthpieces for Kelly's ideas. Underdeveloped and short conversations, such as where Norma sympathizes with Arlington about their malformations, and also when Norma and Arthur question whether they really know each other when the button somehow kills them. <br /> <br /> Since 2001, Richard Kelly has failed to make a movie that lived up to the quality and imagination of Donnie Darko. Although this film may be interesting for a while, it is too absurd and unreasonable to fully enjoy it, and it will certainly be no more fair than the film's illogical revelations. Science fiction fans can appreciate it any more and make their own conclusions, but what Kelly really tries to say beneath the surface remains cryptic. This box is one movie this year.
