TWINS EFFECT is a poor film in so many respects. The only good element is that it doesn't take itself seriously. Unlike that, it's not really a movie, but rather a commodity for the film's two star, popular pop idols in Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was poorly built and acted. The direction offers bad martial arts, which is odd because the action director (and presumably co-director) is Donnie Yen. Like many Hong Kong teenager-equipped films, the big fanbases of "actors" like the Twins (the two girls in these movie stars) and Ekin Cheng, are so much bad music to obey certain scenes. funny, smart, etc. <br /> <br /> The final conclusion: It's all for nothing. Even as a fan of Hong Kong movies, it's a poor movie. Not funny enough, not serious enough, and just generally bubble gum fake for his own good. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> For a more in-depth overview of this movie and other foreign films, go to http://www.nixflix.com
