What a great disappointment. Forget this scary movie and get the TV show instead. What on earth were they doing to make the US president relatively healthy? ALL the politicians had to be buffalo (Peter Cook is good as the British PM). It lacks the biting satire of the original, instead of the "lowest common denominator" slapstick. 1 out of 10 if I'm generous! Unfortunately, this is another example of a remake that completely misses the original, the difference with this one is that they are both written by the same people.
