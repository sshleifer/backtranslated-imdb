I will give it a two because it has a lot of music, otherwise it would be one. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time tonight and it's the first "Road" image I've seen. I expected waaaaay better. Robert Osborn says it's the best of the Road movies. If that's true, I don't have to see the others. The best thing about this movie is that it has many songs in the first half, but it is balanced by only one production number with dance in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't like the movie. . Neither Hope nor Crosby got everything so good, their characters were not very charming, the movie was not funny at all, most of the dialogue was just a flapper, there wasn't much action, there wasn't much spectacle . br /> <br /> The movie wasn't what I expected. I expected more "Road", but not much. They quickly make it to the palace and then most of the movie finds it to the end. I also expected much more from the famous "road" style to break the fourth wall, in which the characters speak directly to the audience or comment on the plot. There were only about 4 cases. One of these is an example of the funny humor of this writing: <br /> <br /> (Hope repeats the plot so far at Crosby) Crosby: I know everything! Hope: Yes, but the people who came halfway through the picture don't. Crosby: You mean they missed my song? <br /> <br /> These are two poor punchlines, but they're actually jokes. Many of the rest of the script doesn't even have jokes. An example is: <br /> <br /> Crosby: Remind me to throw you a piece of cheese in the morning. (Indirect calls Hope a rat). <br /> <br /> It's not funny at all, but it does qualify as a joke, but it's the kind of non-joke dialogue that carries most of the movie. Many of the screens aren't even so close to a joke, just using a generic uninteresting dialogue like: <br /> <br /> Crosby: Hey, whadda ya, take me? You think you can just throw me to the dogs? Hope: Well, why not, you did it for me, didn't you? Crosby: Yes, but that's because I'm looking out for us. You don't look out for anyone. Hope: Oh yes? Well, why did I pay the check? <br /> <br /> (The above is just from my memory. It is not exactly, but it illustrates what I mean). <br /> <br /> And so on .... just a generic dialogue with no jokes. <br /> <br /> My grade: a waste of time.
