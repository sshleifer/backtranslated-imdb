All in all, this is a movie for kids. We saw it tonight and my child loved it. At one point my child's excitement was so great that the meeting was impossible. However, I am a big fan of A.A. Milne's books are very subtle and hide a brutal intelligence behind the childlike quality of his leading characters. This movie wasn't subtle. It is a pity that Disney cannot make the benefits of making more stories in the pages, although it may not have the permission to use them. I found myself playing the theater again "Winnie-the-Pooh and Tigger". The characters voices were very good. I'm just very much offended by Kanga. However, the music was twice as much in parts as the dialogue, and ominous for the film. <br /> <br /> As far as the story is concerned, it was a bit beautiful and militant. Overall, I was disappointed, but I would go again just to see the same excitement on my child's face. <br /> <br /> I looked Lumpy's laugh.
