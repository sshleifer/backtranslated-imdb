Oh, man, they probably knew how to close them. Hollywood has forgotten the basics of bad filmmaking: cardboard steel and the godly scientific action hero! <br /> <br /> This movie was so close to a masterpiece because it wasn't to be, as it couldn't recognize the ray of guns and invaders. The MST3K version tried to fix it by adding a pilot of a show called Captain Cody, where a man with a rocket-powered jacket was fighting the bad makeup of the Moon, but that didn't really add. <br /> <br /> Also, the comments of the guys in the theater were not nearly as funny as I expected. All in all, a great disappointment.
