The filmmaker stayed true to the most accurate version of the story published in 1894. It contains an 1846 manuscript by Richard Williams Bell (son of John and Lucy Bell and younger brother of Betsy Bell) entitled "Our Family Trouble". To know this is the only eyewitness account ever written. The filmmaker must be credited for accuracy, but there is little to say about production and acting quality. The acting was theatrical and the sound and picture quality was extremely poor. It appears that the filmmaker just shot screens of the reported events without inserting it into a flowing plot or story line. If you need to know the story, read about it, its much more gripping and conclusive.
