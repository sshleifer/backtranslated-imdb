I'm a kind of between the gushy review and the hate review. I was a fan of Lovecraft (and a Lovecraft purist) for a long time, and while this little amateur movie was of poor quality, it had a number of redeeming qualities. I looked at the worst thing I have ever seen, wondering if Lovecraft would turn into it in his grave, but I was shocked to find that I really liked it. <br /> <br /> I don't do I don't want to catalog the movie's mistakes, so I just mention a few who like this movie of a 'star amateur attempt'. <br /> <br /> It is very low budget and shot on a video camera, so it seems like some soap operas, but once you get used to the idea, it ceases to be a big problem. The direction is nice amateur and the lap frame and the use of distance in the shots is rather clumsy. STANAN, this movie was actually creepy and it was more true to Lovecraftian's intention than almost all Stuart Gordan and Brian Yuzna traverses (my main exception to those movies, Re-Animator and Dagon). The idea of ​​being an Old Parent is reminiscent of Dunwich Horror and Shadow about Innsmouth (it's not to say this movie is as good as those stories!), So the overall plot is pretty true to Lovecraft's ideas . One thing that irritated me was that the words from the Bible upset and scare a zombie prisoner. I'm not sure if it was meant to indicate that "God's words" upset the Old or just this particular zombie. There was no real answer to that. The rest of the Christian symbolism reminds me of August Derleth's actions on mythos. In a way it was a Derleth style that goes on the mythos. <br /> <br /> I would only recommend this movie as a curiosity. It shows how a fairly atmospheric film can be made with almost zero budget. I love the surroundings of the wineries. However, the outdoor shots were sad. Using the same piece of beach and trees (and almost the same damn shot) to transfer 3 characters was very sad. The director must be on the head for that. The play was standard for an amateur movie, with the blonde zombie girl receiving a personal award for "Best Gollum Impersonation by an Italian actress." Actually, I think this movie was done before the Lord of the Rings movies. Maybe Andy Sedaris looked at her and thought, "Dang, she'll make a good Gollum!" <br /> <br /> One small kudo to the director, though. The makeup on the zombies was like bad goth kids. I was upset to see it and almost stopped watching. I was like "Oh, that's how we know she's angry and possessed", but later in the movie you see a girl painting such a makeup on the face of an older woman (both alive) . So it was not an attempt to say 'goth make-up' zombie, but 'goth makeup was left on zombie'. But the possession / zombie is equal to 'blue contact lenses' ... he has. <br /> <br /> In general, I liked this movie even better than the Yuzna and Gordan movies (excluding the aforementioned exceptions). Yuzna and Gordan had much better budgets, but this movie did a better job of filming a Lovecraft story than they did, and on a small budget. <br /> <br /> One quick word to the makeup artist: I know you wanted 'claws' or something on Zariah's fingers, but long, black nails look really stupid. <br /> <br /> A quick word to the author of the score: I know you can't resist, and apparently not the director who overcame it, but the two characters with a gun for a 'duel' was square, the little whistle of "The Good, the bad and the lly" killed the mood that had accumulated in the scene. . It was cute, but cute wasn't appropriate. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers of this movie read Lovecraft and had a lot of respect for him. I enjoy the knees here and there: the character Carter with the bad dreams, and the character Pickman who becomes a ghoulish zombie.
