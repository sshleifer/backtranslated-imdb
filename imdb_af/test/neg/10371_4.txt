*** SLIGHT SPOILERS *** This installment of the Full Moon franchise changes the storyline a bit and implements some new elements. First, a new puppet master is established. Secondly, the dolls are doing well in this successor. Finally, it also introduces some scifi / fantasy elements. <br /> <br /> A new tenant from the infamous bay, his girlfriend, her psychologist, and the psychic boyfriend stumble upon Andre Toulon's puppet. They also learn from another demon from another dimension who holds Toulon responsible for stealing the secret to animate the motion. So Sutekh (the devil) sends the totems, a bunch of little little creatures that look like excessive gremlins. Then it is the puppetry to take care of the interdimensional threat that new friends are trying to kill. <br /> <br /> Like most low-budget movies, this movie is full of continuity issues. How did the dolls sit in the suitcase? How does anyone remember the last races of killing in the hotel? Who bought the hotel? Why would a contractor pass through a building with a mass murder history? All this and many more questions will not be answered. <br /> <br /> The real surprise of this movie is the play. This is pretty good. The actors take it with an unusual enthusiasm, especially for a lot of full-moon nonames. Teresa Hill was particularly impressive as the shy, nervous, psychic Lauren. Chandra-Wes (Susie) was also a pleasant surprise. Gordon Hill was a tolerant protagonist. But Cameron was too boring to stomach. Thank the Norwegian god, he dies halfway. <br /> <br /> The dolls are usually animated themselves. With some improvements too. There are emotions (especially Jester's) much more human because of the sounds they have been given. Blade's lifts, Pinhead's grunts, and Six-Shooter's snicker are all improved and sound much better. The stop-motion animation is at best just average, especially the totems. They do not look as fluid as the previous installment in the series. Also the Sutekh costume is absolutely awesome. How we should be afraid of a creature that looks so humorous. <br /> <br /> The story looks a little juvinile for the series. I think Charlie Band wanted to focus on a younger demographic. The violence shown in this movie also looks the same. Gore fans will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think the above is the main problem, this movie can't hold much to many people. It does not have the violence for gorewhores. The language is a little cleaner. Yet it is too violent and hard for ourselves. Therefore, the film gets low ratings. I have to say that the general reviews are mostly fair.
