It is said that there are some people there who are actually ADMIRE monogram's movies. Well - and why not? Monogram Studios stayed on a sort of cost base; Cost, plus enough to pay the rent and buy a pizza and a bottle of robust muscat every once in a while. Sure, they're cheap. But let's see it: they are rough, fast, Philistine, vulgar, but exciting. They have no pretensions at all. They are designed to derive the audience for an hour or so below the double bill. So, if John Wayne gallops through the Wild West along a telephone pole road? It's not art, it's entertainment. <br /> <br /> Take this movie, "Flight to Mars." Initially, when we first meet the characters, a man can suddenly introduce his female companion, avoiding any boring subtlety: "Professor, it's my fiancee and assistant, who is a rocket scientist and a beautiful woman. She loves but I grow impatiently with me because I'm always wrapped up in my scientific work, maybe you can steal her from me, marry her, give her the babies and the huts they want, travel to see how her dreams come true. Also, she likes it a bit rough. "It saves a lot of writing and shooting time, right? That's what people mean when they say a story is "fast". (This one was shot in five days.) Why do we have to hint this stuff? I mean, what's hell, a cheap science film or Henry James? Actually, it's a particularly well-funded example of a Monogram movie. It's in color, for one thing. "Cinecolor" to be precise. (You can say it's not any other "color" you want to recognize.) And look at the cast. The female lead is inadmissible, as usual with Monogram, but the male leaders are definitely there on the B List. Cameron Mitchell as the reporter, but he strives like a male head, thinking about it, he never really did. And Arthur Franz as the pipe-smoking chief scientist, the pride of Perth Amboy, New Jersey. And - for science fiction fans - how about these few aces: both Morris Ankrum and John Litel! There is not much interest in describing the plot in detail. The five crew members land on Mars where they find an underground civilization inhabited by organisms whose evolution is isomorphic with ours, until they have five digits and wild babies in short skirts. And they picked up English to listen to our broadcasts. American broadcasts, this is the assessment of their speech. They are led by a sinister cabal that tries to chop the spaceship, build many mimics, and colonize the earth. They do not succeed in this. <br /> <br /> The special effects aren't very special. The men walk around a couple of savings, wearing black costumes with stylized lightning bolts knocked down on their coffins and scarlet hoods. Their names consist exclusively of English phonemes - Alzar, Terris, Ikron. The in love Martian who falls to Arthur Franz is called Alita, with an Indo-European diminutive attachment, and she already knows what to kiss. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found it so funny as it was meant to be, but boring. The story is that of any Buck Rogers 1930 series. Once the Earth dwellers and the Martians have met and found that they have a common language, and that the Martians have a sinister agenda, it is. In two hours, even an indifferent scriptwriter may turn it into a story of Nazi spies in World War II. The plot is done by the numbers, the dialogue has no glitter, the acting is pedestrian. <br /> <br /> But dedicated aficionados of Monogram productions should enjoy it. In fact, Jean-Luc Goddard, the contrasting French egghead, dedicated "A Bout de Souffle" to Monogram, so they could not have been so bad.
