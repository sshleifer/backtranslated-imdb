Now infamous Western it was (at the time) the biggest budgeted disaster in Hollywood's history. I was fortunate enough to see the full 220 minute version at a theater in 1990. It was really amazing how BAD was the movie! <br /> <br /> They played a good role, a story based on a true incident (a battle between foreigners and Americans in the 1800s), beautiful scenery ... so what went wrong? Three words - director Michael Cimino. He was so full of himself to "The Deer Hunter". He went out and made this god cruel. He is not completely to blame. His previous film "The Deer Hunter" was considered a masterpiece and United Artists gave him free government to do anything. They let him go alone ... and everything went wrong. The cost was out of control and Cimino once again demanded series until they were perfect. <br /> <br /> First, the sound is terrible. The whole series goes through and you can't make out a word the characters say. For example, Jeff Bridges's character is introduced during a dance series, but I have no idea who he was! The dialogue in his introductory scene is incomprehensible! This is the director's fault - he had to make sure that the dialogue could be heard. Some scenes are shot with so much dust flying around, you can hardly figure out what's going on. The story line doesn't make much sense and Cimino had great facts with the facts - in the true story only one person was killed - Cimino turned it into a massacre. There are some welcome beautiful rows here completely destroyed by lack of story and incomprehensible dialogue. Also the bad sound was not the theater's fault. All the pressure sounds like that. <br /> <br /> This garbage effectively shut down United Artists and was the end of Cimino's career. A handbook example of a director so full of himself does not realize what he is doing. Jeff Bridges said it was the worst movie he ever did. It is from a man who made Tron! A special must-miss. <br /> <br /> There is a nice book called "The Final Cut" that indicates the whole disaster. It gets a 1. I wish IMDb had negative numbers - it deserves it!
