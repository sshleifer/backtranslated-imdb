When I first watched in the 80's, I loved it. I was completely fascinated by the music, the dance ... everything. However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was totally hit by the extremely silly storyline - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of shit - and how awful the dance was. I mean, in a realistic world, she would never have entered the ballet repertoire. The whole thing was quite pathetic. The character developments also remained in depth. I think it was a lot, a product of the 80's: the movie doesn't stop!
