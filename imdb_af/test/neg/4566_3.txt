I see it as an "alternative reality" teenage movie ... More precisely, a Ferris Bueller-type character as the leader of a dishonest ring. Yes, I know it's not meant to compare with Ferris Bueller, at least not in an "orange-to-orange" way, but it won't be any less. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: These are galaxies away from even a minor classic. It is vigilant, but only if you don't expect much. That said, the main character has a bit of charm, but the prescription carries thin because the writing just isn't smart. The movie just didn't have enough laughs, twists or tensions to keep my interest. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I continued to look ... hoping to see if anything suddenly came out. It didn't. So, stylish as it is, I won't recommend this movie. BTW, it seems odd to see Mary Tyler Moore as the principal. She is really scared, I hope the payroll is extremely large.
