Perhaps we are too much attached to big glasses when we hear of the antiquity brought on the screen. Maybe we expect too many of these movies. However, if we are presented too much for viewers, what happens? <br /> <br /> That's what I thought after seeing IMPERIUM - NERONE by Paul Marcus, part of the production series on the Roman Empire. AUGUST by Roger Young, the first IMPERIUM film, included at least Peter O'Toole, but what does this movie include? <br /> <br /> Little anything accurate. The historical flaws are so serious that the movie changes facts and rather forms a distorted image of the Roman Empire as true history. Throughout the film we see Nero young: young man during the allegedly long reign of Caligula, young man during Claudius' rule and ultimately during his own (historically 14 years) rule. And ... he died the same. According to the film, Nero, who was born during the reign of Tiberius, has been living for over 40 years, but appears to be in his late twenties when he dies. Continuity combined with history is the biggest problem of the movie making It is hardly logical, not to say reliably. Nero lost his father, was raised by slaves. At that time his mother, Agrippina, was banned by Caligula. Later, however, she suddenly marries emperor Claudius who has had big children with fresh Messalina. At these moments of the movie we see Acte (Rich Schmid), Nero's mistress. Well, it's historically "accurate"; Yet, no source proves that she played such a decisive role in the rise of Christianity in Rome. In the film she is not only a dedicated Christian, but even a witness to St Paul's miracle (he brings back a young girl Marzia). In addition, there was historically nothing like Nero seen in the Caligula court, since Nero was born in Caligula's 4-year-old government (37-41). I understand that movies can change, but such a mistake makes the writing absolutely unreliable! And many, many other shortcomings about content that are difficult to summarize, but after 30 minutes watching this movie, I doubted whether I was watching a historical movie or a total fantasy. <br /> <br /> As far as its artistic features are concerned, we provide entertainment, they are as lamb as history is here. The performances are artificial, the role players have only pretty faces, but poor acting abilities. Maybe I'm too much attached to Peter Ustinov or Charles Laughton in the lead, but Hans Matheson doesn't suit Nero at all. He can be of the good moments as an actor, but never as the notorious Roman emperor. Is he an artist who burns Rome for a song? Is he a cynic who disguises love for his family? Is he a cruel ruler who sacrifices the lives of thousands of innocent people for the sake of "alleged righteousness"? None of these. He is just a young man who does not know how to govern and in the long run begins to fire in himself ... John Simm is not in this movie as Caligula and totally inferior to other portraits of the character. Elisa Tovati is just sexy like Poppaea; yet she could have been much better. The costumes are inaccurate and the sets are not surprised. Low budget results in low effects and consequently low entertainment. <br /> <br /> But what made me most angry in this movie and consequently I give it 1/10 a few moments that are absolutely unacceptable: <br /> <br /> - Poppaea's death and St Paul's talking to Nero at her dead body, <br /> <br /> - Claudius's mention of Britain's current conquest at the festival and soon his death (he overcame Britannia while Messalina was his wife many before his death ), <br /> <br /> - Tigellinus killing Agrippina (Laura Morante), Nero's mother. <br /> <br /> - Nero's arguments in the speech to the senators, <br /> <br /> - finally, Nero's death - a tranquil day at the lake and a careless suicide leading to A moral by Acte said: "Let us forgive him" <br /> <br /> All in All this movie is a waste of time and is absolutely unnecessary as another production of the Roman Empire. It is better to make a good movie in 30 years than ten minor young ones. 1/10 - should not be made at all.
