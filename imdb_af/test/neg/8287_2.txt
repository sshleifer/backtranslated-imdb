A high school star dies after winning a race; Soon after, her older sister (Patch Mackenzie) returned in time to see all her sister's tracks disappear. Who can be the killer? You can't care enough to find out. <br /> <br /> Rough, inexpensive, amateur shooting shooters are only worthless, though Christopher George (like the nasty, trainer) gives it an elevator with an intense performance. Not even the gore is worth mentioning. The whole thing is from start to finish from the beginning, starting with the opening of the movie after a song gathering montage placed on music discussion, and the decisive E.J. Peaker, once a co-star of the movie "Hello, Dolly" as a character named "Blondie"! That's right, "Blondie". This may mean we shouldn't take the film seriously, but anyway it's a shambles. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of routine slasher junk that looks like the "Friday the 13th" like work of art in comparison. <br /> <br /> The only point of interest may be an early movie appearance of Vanna White, of all people. <br /> <br /> 2/10
