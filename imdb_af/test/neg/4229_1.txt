Just had the misfortune to see this wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> Think of the scene in Magnolia at the end with the slow pan in that woman. Now, remove the pan, add breathing and unshaved men, and you've got what was 2 and a half hours of humanity. <br /> <br /> The Inspector is a real hidden, not even a hidden, just a dull witted, slow moving simpleton. How they ever solved a crime is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Compulsory sex scenes are terrible and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Any bad guy (he raped and killed an 11-year-old girl) was marked earlier and not surprisingly, unless you were invented in the same way. <br /> <br /> Uninspiring camera works. <br /> <br /> The director was there to say that it's up to the audience to provide their own Explanation of the proceedings. I suppose he also meant to give their own dialogue (there is a bugger everyone who adds to his level of boredom), inventive camera work (just static shots that completely capture the obvious beauty of the landscape shot by the movie break down) br /> <br /> Actually terrible. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10.
