My roommate and I have another friend working at a local Blockbuster Video. He really finds terrible movies for us and tells us about them. One of them was a Christmas Horror film with former professional wrestler Bill Goldberg as a killer Satna Claus. We didn't look at it immediately, but we didn't think anything could be worse. Apparently we were wrong. We are shown this slasher movie "starring" Ken Shamrock versus a murderous scarecrow. Initially we thought Ken would actually be the killer scarecrow, and so we wanted to look, but he wasn't, and that made the movie even worse. What was absolutely the movie was the teenage drama. If you want to save your brain cells to try to escape from your head, DO NOT NEED THIS MOVIE.
