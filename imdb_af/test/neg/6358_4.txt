* Spoilers - sorry! * The first word devised while watching the movie is 'Gremlins'. It's the only movie I saw of the four movies, but I enjoyed it. It wasn't too complicated, because I didn't see the last two, but I thought it was quite a good movie. / girl meets a boy (played by Leo DiCaprio) and they go out into a nearby forest. They meet this strange guy who tells them to be careful and do things because of the wanderers. He looked a little psychotic and if I was in that situation, I didn't want to talk to him. The riders steal a ride from the girl and boy's car and end up in their flat thing. They hide in the basement and end up killing this lazy push. They then kill this fat woman and the girl's father. They are chased higher and higher on the apartment until they reach the attic. The beef eaters eat stuff in the kitchen (Spoof of the gremlins kitchen scene ???) And I can't remember (not a good thing), but I'm sure they should come back for something / someone. Anyway, they come out and save. The psychotic man comes back, and before he kills the last two bulls, he is told he can't because they are threatened and therefore sends them home. <br /> <br /> The end was disappointing and I was annoyed that only the lazy guy died because there were quite a few annoying characters that I personally would have killed. It's an exciting, exciting movie worth a watch. But if you're looking for a better version of this genre, I recommend the movie clips. Sorry!
