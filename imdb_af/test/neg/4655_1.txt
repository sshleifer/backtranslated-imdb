A Lassie movie that had to be "slept" .... FOR ONLY. So I describe this painful arid time warmer of a movie. So mediocre in every aspect, it's just a dull, uninteresting mess, it's one of the most forgotten movies I've seen. It's not even an achievement as a "so-bad-it-good" or "bad-it-memorable" movie. The thought that Lassie is getting bad is intriguing, but so little happens and so slowly you feel your life is moving away while you watch the non-actors read their lines from their cards and wait for their virgin salaries. <br /> <br /> It's an empty, hollow shell of a movie. Seriously, it's not worth wasting your or your child's time. Unless both are heavy medications. That's all I have to say. <br /> <br /> Avoid, avoid, avoid! It will bark you, mad! Hahahah, get it? Barking! Haha Haha Hahaha! <br /> <br /> Sorry, I had a rough week.
