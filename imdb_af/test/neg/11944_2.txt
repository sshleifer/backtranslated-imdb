I was reluctant to see this movie because I enjoyed the original, Mostly Martha. What a disappointment. Catherine Zeta Jones is a good actress, but it wasn't her movie. The original has pleasant moments, perfectly played with an incredible soundtrack. No discussions felt it was never linked. The food, the characters - nothing felt passionate about. In mostly Martha the food became alive - each scene was so filmed that you could taste it with your eyes - the smells, the textures. The food in 'No Reservations' was in the background - rarely did we get a close-up of the preparation; The characters weren't really enough to carry the movie without it. It was difficult to finish the movie - many of the screens felt uncomfortable. See the original - it's an enjoyable movie; the soundtrack incredible.
