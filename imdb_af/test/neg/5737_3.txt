Definitely not your typical Polizia, Redneck just worked for me. The movie tells the story of a jewel dog that went wrong and a young boy who was unintentionally kidnapped. In their attempt to get away, the robbers leave a bloody trail of death as they unpack a plan to release the boy. The plan is never taken away because the robbers are planning to come to France and the boy is planning to stay with them. While I could mention a number of issues I had with the movie, I would focus on the most obvious ?? the character Memphis played by Telly Savalas. From his work in The Dirty Dozen and Kelley's Heroes to other Italian films such as Crime Boss to his most memorable role as Kojak, Savalas was a winner. I've always thought of him as one cute client. Unfortunately, Savalas is almost incompatible in Redneck. Did the director turn on the camera and instruct him to act as psychologically as possible? It might not have been bad if his actions were done in the context of a plot I cared for, but here it seems to be bizarre to be bizarre. It seems to be random. And what is the accent? Savalas may have been a lot, but Southern is not one of them. He sounds completely ridiculous, even the accent. In addition, I didn't find much interest in the rest of the movie. As I indicated, the plot never moved me. I just didn't care what was going on. And the idea that the boy is so attracted to the criminal lifestyle is not true. As for the other actors, Mark Lester is almost as bad as Savalas and the usually reliable Franco Nero is not much better. Three "name" actors and not a good performance between them. To make matters worse, I believe the director filmed many of the night scenes with nothing more than the glow of his watch to light the shots. I couldn't tell what was going on. Characters I hate, a plot I don't care about, and a production values ​​that failed? little wonder I gave Redneck a 3/10.
