I don't understand the people here. The movie is not as good as bad as some people say here. Apart from De Kok, the play is OK. The problem with the movie is mainly the script. The characters are not credible. The sex is well done, but the psychology behind the people makes very little sense. The movie doesn't look good, but what do you expect? The movie was shot for very little money on video. Of course it doesn't look as good as a normal movie, duh! The one thing I agree on is that the music is bad. Sounds like a cheap soft erotic movie from the 80's. The movie is not good, okay, but you have to give credit to draw it without any money.
