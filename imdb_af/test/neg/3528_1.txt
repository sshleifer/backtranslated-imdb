I don't know who financed it, or why, but this "want to be" vampire movie is really awful. It is trying to be hip, and appeals to the young MTV generation heard, but it is just plain laughable. The acting is terrible, and the direction is terrible. I heard the budget was $ 600,000. I want to know where all the money goes?
