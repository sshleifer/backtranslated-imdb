Kate is a young young woman who has trouble meeting and dating guys. During the movie you get several of her looser boyfriends. And throughout the movie you are exposed to Kate's cynical negative outlook on love and relationships. This negative standpoint is continually pursued and presented as Ultimate Truth. I had a real problem with this. Why should someone be taught about love, life, and teaching of someone who is obviously so messed up? It will work if it was the joke, but it is not. For the jokes in the movie (which is not funny or original) to work, you must believe what Kate says: that all relationships inevitably end up with bad or no sex, that the highest level at which a relationship can develop is when you can sniff in front of your partner ... You get the idea. <br /> <br /> There is no movie in recent memory that comes close to the stomach as much as love and sex. Why did the filmmakers waste their time on such a trash? Every joke in love and sex is something I've experienced in another movie or in my own life. There is nothing original or creative about the story, the production or the style. It's cynical, stupid and useless. Spirit numb!
