A gruesome violation of the memory and genius of Welles, this senseless compilation of self-pervasive improvisation on a large theme, had to be locked in as well as a number of other unfinished Welles projects that no one has ever seen. Now we know why! To add additional insult to previous injuries, the spectacular English language dubbing by amateur America gambling actors and even the big man himself just raises all the messy mistakes in storytelling and construction. It is as if every weekend a good sad Spanish soul left Orson a few pesos, a 35mm camera and some short-term negative film left of another production and told Welles to drive out to the Spanish countryside and just to shoot anything until the movie inventory ran out. It is true that Orson really formed this film himself instead of the infamous Jesus Franco, but he would have poured out 85% of what he had shot, but we would never know. Like Welles never took the time to change his own work here, and somewhere along the way he or his heirs fined someone else to do so, he is not completely blameless for the debacle. Those who wanted to prove it in his early days were that Welles was the happiest young man because he surrounded himself like John Houseman, Herman Mankewiecz, Greg Toland, Bernard Hermann and Robert Wise, no better proof of his adult inadequacies than this mess no. of a movie. In his sad age, Welles was able to do something when he needed a few dollars or pesos, including selling his artistic soul. The devil certainly had his excuse with this one!
