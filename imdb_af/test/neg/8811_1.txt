There were so many things wrong with this movie, I have trouble keeping them straight. But one thing that really bother me is that if Jigsaw was on the ground in the bathroom, what if Zep never arrived? What if Zep was killed by Danny Gloover before making it in the bathroom? Is Jigsaw just getting up and running out? Can't the man in the middle of the bathroom be jigsaw, but another part of Jigsaw's game? What happens if Zep murdered the wife and child, how does Jigsaw oppose the poison when he is in the middle of the bathroom? Why does the doctor wait until the last minute to finally cut off his foot? It was too late, it was after six and as far as he knew his wife and child had already been shot dead, it was not the best time for heroics. These are just a few questions I had about the movie, but I can miss something or everything, because I only saw the movie once. Please help!
