So this guy goes into a psychiatrist's office for his first appointment. After the paperwork was done, the psychiatrist said, "I'm going to show you inkblots. Tell me what you see in them." "Well, the patient says," look at the first one, "I see a man and a woman having sex." When he saw the second one, he said, "I see two women having sex." When he saw the third, he said, "I see two men have sex." When he sees the next one, he says, "I see two men and two women having sex." The psychiatrist puts the inkblots down. "So," he says, "we will start discussing your monomania." "My monomania?" said the man. "And you with all those dirty photos!" That's how this movie hits me.
