Think you've seen the worst movie in the world? Think again. The person who designed the cover of this box should be accused of false advertising. The cover makes it look like a good, scary horror suspense thriller. But no. What we have before is NIGHTSCREAM. A movie that is a "sweeeoooowww !!" make noise every time a credit flashes over the screen. The biggest name in the entire movie is probably Casper Van Dien, who hardly plays a role. <br /> <br /> I voted only one for this one because I couldn't vote lower. If I could vote for something like negative five thousand, trust me, I would have it. So, for now, I'm going to give NIGHTSCREAM 1/2 * out of 5 just because it ended.
