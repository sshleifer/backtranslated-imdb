Big (and we mean big size) Baddie Sebastian Cabot tries to run salt from the country's farmers out of their country to get the oil rights. When killing Sterling Haden's doll, how will Haden put an end to TERROR IN A Texas CITY, armed only with a harpoon? <br /> <br /> First, it's not a B-western. There is no singing cake boat, no daring stunts, no interesting action sequences. It's just an independent movie - you know those who use unimportant actors to say important things and to cover the overall low budget quality of the speed, with interesting camera angles. <br /> <br /> Second, this movie, to avoid compromises (which is expected) that will eliminate the elimination of Trumbo's key statements on justice in America, and the sick relationship between the chief and his girlfriend, are many low budget. The biggest problem caused is that the act really is bad. Sterling Hades is decent enough in difficult roles, but he is the last man you want to play a sensitive Swedish sailor to find his fortune in the West. Sebastian Cabot tries to do a Sydney Greenstreet as (very) bloated plutocrat. It's not a bad idea, but Cabot doesn't have the acting links for it. The man who plays the hired gun with the missing arm and soul (Johnny Crale) has the best role in the film. He does nothing about it. <br /> <br /> Third, the script isn't really all that. Trumbo gets a few digs over the immigrant will not get a fair shake of the sheriff in a corrupt town, and the people, when they oppose actual oppression, tend to return. This is a pretty boring movie message by 1958. High noon, Bad day at Black Rock, Devil's Doorway - are all Westerns who deal with the evils of Western society with a view to the evils of Fifty America. Trumbo, in59, definitely had every personal reason to vote with those sentiments, but he does nothing new or interesting with them. <br /> <br /> Given all the negatives, why does this movie get a 4? Mostly because there are interesting attacks throughout the film. (The relationship between Crale and his girlfriend is fascinating.) And Trumbo, as a mediocre writer when pursuing his political affection, is very good at creating both interesting characters and intelligent interactions between them. Just when you are ready to go out of India movie boredom, an exchange of dialogue or a simple excitement will come that one will realize that the man writing the script is not just a hack. <br /> <br /> If you don't like Trumbo or Westerns, give this one a miss. Otherwise, try it. You might love it more than I did.
