Mr. Bean is just a lot of infallible slapstick humor. This is the most level of humor TV series ever made in history. The screens are often disgusting and the horrible canned layer sends cold fever through the spine. Mr. Bean is a selfish and rude character and one can only sympathize with how pathetic he is. It's amazing that such a low-quality TV series can be sustained for 5 years. It is a total waste of time to watch even one episode and it can only be a disgrace and a pity why Rowen portrays himself as such a two-dimensional, indecent and ridiculous character. Or sorry why you even watched an episode. To see this is an aggravating experience.
