I write it over with 10 minutes before the movie is finished. I feel comfortable writing it now, because unfortunately I know exactly how this movie will end. <br /> <br /> The premise is simple enough, rabid in the small town, killing people. Great - simple plot for a nice fun 80's horror. <br /> <br /> Uhh .. no. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is that it is based on a book (Stephen King) and you can tell that it doesn't really have to be adapted to movie, at least not with the same plot. Why? Cuz it's boring! The first 45 minutes try to build depth to his main characters and create tension. However, it takes too long (half of the movie!) - the characters are unlikely and we never care about it, and it just makes zero strain. The easiest movie (by plot and time) to compare it to the classic Jaws. Everything Jaws do right, Cujo does wrong. Jaws created good characters and a real sense of fear. Cujo does not. Jaws effectively create a scary, creepy villain in his shark. Cujo has a dirty st. Bernard runs and jumps, and not much more. Jaws are exciting and unpredictable. Cujo is a tireless drill that is predictable to the end. <br /> <br /> Also, the abundance of subplots that play just like boring red herring on the main plot of the movies is also confusing. <br /> <br /> If this movie is rewritten for the big screen and has a better director. It could have been good. But it wasn't. It was a waste of 90 minutes of my life. People here say it's one of the best King adjustments. I'm sorry you couldn't be wrong anymore. The Mist is a hundred times better, Thinner is 10 times better and even one with the cats is twice as good! It is, in my opinion, one of the worst! The only good thing was the action scenes where the dog really looks, even if it was boring. <br /> <br /> Movies have ended and it didn't get any better. Avoid.
