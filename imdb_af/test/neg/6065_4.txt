According to Lucien Rebatet in his "Histoire de la Musique" (Robert Lafont, BOUQUINS 1973 page 338), Beethoven's character was not very compatible with women. He had a number of "platonic passions" with female members of the "Viennese Aristocracy" to whom he dedicated a few "sonatas". But musicians, even composers do not qualify for men of "Fine Ladies". Haydn was a "servant" of Prinz Von Esterhazy, Mozart died of liquor or poison and Bethoven was, according to Rebatet, a regular client of "street prostitute" in Vienna. A British biographer, Newman, said Beethoven had contracted syphilis before being 40. Being deaf is possible, but not sure. <br /> <br /> The ninth symphony was premiered on May 7, 1824. the Kärntnertorth Theater in Vienna, along with the inauguration of the House Overture and the first three parts of the Missa Solemnis. It was the composer's first on-stage appearance in twelve years; The hall is packed. Although the performance was directed by Michael Umlauf, the theater's Kapellmeister, Beethoven silenced the stage with him. <br /> <br /> So what's left of this "Female Fantasy". Ed Harris's interpretation and characterization is pretty good, but too linear, based on the painting by Ferninand Waldmüller date 1823. I have it before me. It shows a man who despises the world (perhaps hate). For good reason.
