An Almodovar movie sends around my spine every time. The capitalized pressure that opens the latest feature of the Spanish author instantly causes memories of capricious nuns, soft necrophils, wisecracking transsexuals, and I didn't even come as far as the baby's critical early work crumbled. And after a beautiful opening construction, with the camera moving over a wind-torn cemetery, animated by a lot of widows who grow feverish tombstones, I thought Pedro had me under his wickedness again. <br /> <br /> Once again my nostalgia dropped, there was very little to fill its place. For a director who brings humanity to murderers and rapists, he does a very poor job finding his emotional depth or engaging quality in his wife. Penelope Cruz is Raimunda, a head housewife whose life is complicated by her daughter's accidental murder of her abused husband. Luckily, she lives in Almodovar's Spain where your friends will help sell a round of cocktails. Add the ghost of Raimunda's mother and an army of other eccentric warm-hearted matrices to the crucible. "Fuller" literally means returning, and Pedro seems to be retrieving old material. The sub-plot of incest seems to be tackled as the mandatory "taboo". Instead of responding or undermining the issue, as with his treatment of pedophilia in poor education, it feels forced and unconvincing in the midst of the film's chick power. I suggest Almodovar calls his next movie Salir (to continue).
