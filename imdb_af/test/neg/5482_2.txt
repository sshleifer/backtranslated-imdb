It's just 2 stars because they do a lot of work to make this game look good. I played very good and bad games and I think this game has the dull story I ever forced to listen to. The best thing they could have done is to let you talk (but no, you should listen for 10 minutes) and continue to do the same things over and over. Climb the building, except the citizen, will be killed. THIS IS THE SAME! Ubisoft should hire someone with any imagination. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Prince of Persia series (first 3). The story was good and you wanted to know what happened all the time. I don't even hate Prince of Persia 4. But I think anyone who was in charge of developing the story for Assassin's Creed should be banned from writing another thing for the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> Boring story and the same missions over and over! If only one of these two things was good, the game would be worth playing.
