I was in a movie club at my school and I had to be forced to see this completely ugly movie. The film's story isn't jealous, but the whole movie itself is extremely slim. The acting was absolutely terrible. The children were excessively clever. A metal pole could have done a better job. I wanted to fall asleep desperately, but because the television was so hard, I kept the peace. The monkey is not cute, nor funny. The drama is laudable. I can't remember when I saw a more horrible movie. The story is weak, thin, predictable and completely false. The adults are trying to be good actors, but they just can't break through stereotypes. The girl even seems to drop the movie by dropping off a hill during the film to leave it, I do not owe her. Micheal Anderson must apologize publicly for this movie. Not just for me, but for everyone who was forced to sit through this horrible movie. In fact, I'm sorry for you. Even if I didn't have anything to do with this project, I apologize for this movie because it means at least someone wants to. This film even surpasses the folly of movies by Rob Schneider and the Cheetah Girls. I will even go so far as to say that it is even worse that Hilary Duff's collection of films pushes it. Please do not see this movie, otherwise you will be printed to write a review similar to this about how terrible this movie is. I am very sorry.
