Taran Adarsh ​​an alleged critic praised such a dubba movie. <br /> <br /> The movie has a strange story in which a lover sells his love to a brothel, because he wants money to save his mother and then get forgiveness for it. LOL <<br /> <br /> The movie is crazy. <br /> <br /> The entire first half focused on romance, comedy that failed to work. The twist shocks, but the entire second half is a mess and the climax is clichéd <br /> <br /> Direction by Aditya Datt is bad Music is typical Himesh <br /> <br /> Emran has his serious role but his wardrobe, his way of walking through songs. is similar to his previous films. Geeta Bhasra annoys Ashmith Patel fails to convince that this actor was just fine in MURDER so far and then a downhill Mithun some screen time and he is okay, but his break down into a song is forced Ranjeet is okay
