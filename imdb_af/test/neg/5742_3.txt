Slayer starts in the South American rainforest where Captain Hawk (Casper Van Dien) and his men are attacked by a lot of vampires, they barely succeed in escaping their lives. Jump forward six months later, and Hawk is called to see Colonel Weaver (Lynda Carter) informing him that there are other reports from Vampiere and that his ex-wife and daughter, Dr. Laurie Williams (Jennifer O'Dell), went out. there on an expedition to study beetles, she worried she would ask the Hawk to take a group of soldiers back to South America and officially give back to Captain Grieves (Kevin Grevioux) and his men while at the same time also not looking for Laurie unofficially and not being killed by the vampires who decided to get out of the caves and into the civilized world ... <br/> <br /> Edited, written and directed by Kevin VanHook, this is another poorly made Sci-Fi channel original that just isn't. It's not very good in any way. The humorless script has nothing as far as I could see. This is one of those modern Vampire films that decides to choose the 'traditional' Vampire film lore rules they want to use as these Vampires can be killed with the game by heart and hair, but at the same time freely roam in sunlight and sleep not in coffins. The movie moves at a reasonable pace, but it is all very boring, slim and lifeless. The story is poor and just rather stupid, the character is terrible, the dialogue is forgotten and there is very little to recommend here. Slayer is also trying to have a kind of ecological message, as the main Vampire claims to first kill people because of their systematic destruction of the rainforest where they have been secretly kept for centuries. Unfortunately, there is no conviction and is more like a throw away line to fill the time than a serious statement. There is not enough exploitation content and is a fairly unsatisfactory way to spend 90 minutes of your time. The makers don't even do something about the jungle environment, hell I didn't expect from Predator (1987), but I was hoping for a little more than that. <br /> <br /> Director VanHook has made several horror movies I've seen are equally poor, I'm sorry, but he doesn't do anything here and turns into a transparent, forgotten look and feel movie. There is no atmosphere or tension and, as for true scares, it is forgotten. The gore is stuck, there is a little cut necks and a little blood spray, but it's not something we haven't seen before or has a lot of impact. There is also a great Vampire monster creature at the end, but it doesn't look so impressive and it gets itself very easy. <br /> <br /> With a so-called budget of about $ 2,000,000, it actually spent a decent amount of money, but it's still a garbage film, it's pretty well made, but nothing special or memorable . The play sucks, I'm sorry, but that's the way I saw it. <br /> <br /> Slayer is another poor, stupid and boring Sci-Fi Channel waste that I simply can't recommend. . Not to be confused with the rather fine once-off British 'Video Nasty' gore movie The Slayer (1982) that is 100 times better than that, watch it and watch it instead.
