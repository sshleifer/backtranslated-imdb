I went to suspect I would hate it, I did it. Everything about it was wrong; It was as if they had filmed another book. The locations and homes were very nice (if not a little disappointed - yes, even the house was wrong for their parts). Keira was too modern, boring and frankly I find it unpleasant to see her. Was everyone else Darcy as a sex god, the author of this saw him as sexually frustrated and inadequate. Bingley was stupid and stupid (he wasn't meant to be) and the Bennett's were innocent and for some unknown reason farmers were wrong and ridiculous. The idea that Mr. Bennett would have answered the door in his night gear with the rest of the family in the middle of the night in their underwear, is dumb. They had servants. Mr. Collins was not repulsive and greasy, just stupid and unpleasant, Georgina Darcy was ugly and old and me. Bingley wore a sleek dress, what! As if! It is historically inaccurate and even the end is unsatisfactory. I can go on for days. I hate it a lot because it wasn't just like the book, but I fear it will be their fist experience for this great novel for many and it will give them the worst possible idea. The BBC version is so better it's not even funny and everything about this version is an insult to its memory. In short, if you have to see it, be sure to read the book first or see the BBC version. Otherwise, you will be the deceived way it is, and it is not!
