Alien was excellent. Many writers have tried to copy it. They all did a bad job (or almost). But Dead Space is the worst Alien copy. Due to the bad actors, the bad special effects, the BAD scenario and other bad things (it will take about 3 pages to tell everything that's bad in this movie. The movie wasn't very long and it's a very good thing (you can't laugh because it's too serious. It's a bad thing, because you can smile almost every B series sci-fi movie all the time. It can sometimes be great, but rather about watch this stupidity, just look at Alien or Event Horizon ... it's much better !!!
