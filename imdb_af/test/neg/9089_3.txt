It's strict for Pryor fans. Just because he was a big, funny man, it doesn't mean a B movie anymore. The script is terrible but just cares to mock the crime and prisoners of war all the time. It balances between comedy and melodrama and also keeps on its face and doesn't make it right. <br /> <br /> First, there are 30 minutes of rather unrealistic, uninspired Vietnam war prisoner ?? That man playing basketball at a stage. The more you can pander to your audience? ... The prison time is boring, unconvincing and can easily sleep. <br /> <br /> Back in the US, the man is not considered a "war hero" for any real reason. Yet, of course, he is quickly forgotten by the public and seems to stumble in all sorts of brutal accidents. Or are they really? We'll find out soon. To yawn. There are annoying clich√©s: his sick mother, his little girl he never met, a chicken ear that fell in love with the hero, etc. It is very strange how this movie is constantly changing the tragedy to hit at once. Don't work at all. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is just a bad comedy and makes discomfort for prisoners of war. Just because this man was a good uprising competition, played and died in a few good movies, MS is no reason not to be upset by this stupid, unconvincing, unfunny comedy. But if you like Richard Pryor, you'll probably be excited by reading 3 hours of Dadaistic poetry.
