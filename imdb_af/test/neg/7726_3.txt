I was on a mission to watch your Boll movies to see if they were really as bad as that. The first one I saw, BloodRayne, was not a complete loss. I like it more than most people, and actually got a 4 out of 10. Next was the first House of the Dead movie. Now it was terribly bad. I could stand on it for 10 minutes and move fast, and that was it. I could see where it was going and I no longer needed to see it, but only 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> But I also have access to the successor (which is not Uwe Boll, but mysterious, written by the same guys who were the first one so incompetent), and having a higher rating at IMDb than the original, I thought I'd give it a chance. And I actually managed to see it all. It started with some funny references and cool lines (like how the president got his Vice-President's orders!), And at the scene, it's lighter than the first. Here we have a powerful draw such as the ultra-warm Emmanuelle Vaugier, whose coolness is in league with Carrie-Anne Moss, Claudia Black and Evangeline Lilly. Man, I hope a Matrix style movie comes with her. And the always delightful, super-aerobicized Victoria Pratt. I love athletic women. And there was also Nadine Velazquez (Catalina on "My Name Is Earl"), who did well. <br /> <br /> The story wasn't much, and the action wasn't nice either, and The End was a disappointment as they didn't succeed in their mission. Oh well, at least the two main corridors survived. Guess it is also a small victory. <br /> <br /> Good throwing, but a little bad movie. The actors wake it up, but there is no real substance. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
