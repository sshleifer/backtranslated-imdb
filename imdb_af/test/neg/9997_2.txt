Terrible, terrible, terrible times, a hundred more, do not begin to describe how scary "Greatest Redeemer" is. Suggest it: Take two fat couples with nothing interesting to say, humiliate them, and let them work to lose weight, all on top television. Am I the only one who thinks it's not something people want with IK in the 3-digit area? Everything goes on forever, with the lumps of lemongrasses on how to lose weight, will mean so much to them and their lives. Does anyone care? Do they think we care? Do they care if we care? Probably not. I think I will make myself videos and sell them to a big television corporation. If it is for television, then my practice sessions too!
