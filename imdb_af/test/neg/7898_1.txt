Hmph. Soul Plane is supposed to be a "black comedy" spoof of a well-known movie, airplane. This movie is black comedy done at its worst. Stereotypes can be funny, and many times they are. But in this picture it is disgusting. Okay, you have clubs, sex, drugs, everything we associate with an urban culture today. <br /> <br /> Tom Arnold's appearance in this movie is the movie's saving grace if it ever had any. DL Hughley had never accepted the writing. Kevin Hart makes a poor leading figure here ... his appearance in this movie is likely to be annoying to many people. Method Man and Snoop's appearance was by far the worst. <br /> <br /> I'm just glad I didn't pay to see this movie ...
