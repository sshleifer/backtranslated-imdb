I had a good exception at Man of the Year, a few girls at my work said it was a good movie, and my mom said she liked it. So I waited for the rent and watched last night. I must honestly say that this movie was a great disappointment. I barely touched it, because to be honest the start was pretty good and played very well, but then it became too dark and not in the movie I saw from the trailer. It looked like it was a good comedy, and it turned into a very dark drama. It wasn't even that interesting, considering how many of these stories we had about government conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Tom Dobbs is a very popular comedian with a top rank and has an act where many people want him to get involved in politics just because he looks good got hold of what needs to be improved. So he does, he runs for presidency, but many people doubt he can win because he is a comedian, but he wins! But Elenore Green who makes sure all the voices are accounted for, tries to solve a computer disorder, but when the government tells her not to fix it, they try to get rid of her, and Tom soon realizes that It might not be the job it wanted. <br /> <br /> The acting was good, the direction was OK, it was just the story that didn't work in my opinion. As I said, it just turned into a dramatic change of genres, because if you see the trailer, you think it was a comedy, and if you start watching, it's what you get, but then it just becomes " a very dark and somewhat scary drama. I would not really recommend this movie, it was one of the biggest disappointments I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> 2/10
