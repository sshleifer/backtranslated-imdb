I must first mention that as a group of friends we often find entertainment in watch movies that are known for the comedy value, so we rent from Camp Blood. <br /> <br /> Camp Blood was the first movie we've hired to shoot what a camcorder looks like, and it was so dirty it wasn't even funny. <br /> <br /> The DVD has been returned and a refund has been requested, with the additional suggestion of quality control being implemented to prevent such a complete garbage being filled. <br /> <br /> Don't do what I did, and let curiosity make you better, it's so bad, it's not even funny.
