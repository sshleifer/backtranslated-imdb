Jeff Morrow is Leslie Gaskell, Barbara Laurence is Vera Hunter, and John Emory is Hubbel Eliot. Along with some complementary air force personnel and a comic geek, they are in charge of a super secret underground lab on the West Coast. Morrow is excited when he discovers a meteor through the atmosphere, but does not fall into the air when the meteorite decides to take a dip in the Pacific Ocean and emerges as a fantastic machine on the Mexican coast. No one knows what this colossal, blocklike structure is. Obviously, this is a kind of armored artefact because it's all rectangular with a kind of bare bulb half-visible at the top. <br /> <br /> It appears that the machine, called Kronos, is a distant planet and has been sent here to rob the earth of energy. You see, here on earth, we learned how to turn matter into energy, but on Kronos's planet they invented the other half of the equation - how to turn energy into matter. And now they're on the other planet out of energy. Take your notes on this? Good. <br /> <br /> Perhaps you could fill me up with some of the scientific questions raised by Kronos's mission. For example, if Kronos builders can convert energy into matter and vice versa, why not just convert some of their own savings into energy instead of sending massive machines to the earth to extinguish LA's lights? But it is doubtful that the authors can explain it too. The reversal of the polarities of two antennas is described as an "anthropic conversion", meaning a "human change", which does not make sense. But it doesn't seem like any of the science makes sense. The diagram drawn by Morrow on the board goes in the wrong direction, from positive to negative. <br /> <br /> There is also a problem with Kronos's locomotion. It marches along the coast and threatens "populated areas" (read Southern California), but it has no joints in its two or three legs. These stumps slow up and down and push some people. The movie doesn't make many of these people. They are shown as Mexican farmers, so maybe they don't count too much. The USAF also drops a hydrogen bomb on Kronos - while in Mexico, you think. No one raises an eyebrow. <br /> <br /> Not many plays are mentioned and not much is given. Jeff Morrow has a clear and resonant voice, ideal for radio or TV voice books. His face is less expressive. He has only one expression, no matter what the situation - a stiff smile, as if he took his photo at the Universal Studios Tour. Barbara Laurence had a good gold quality when she made Street With No Name a few years earlier. She was a slender seventeen year old as Richard Widmark's wife. Here, her care and attitude reduces her to the level of the B-movie actress, though she is still beautiful. It's always good to see Morris Ankrum in one of these movies. He's made so much, I get them mixed up. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie comes across as flat, I'm afraid. (However, there are good shots from a B-47 in flight.) The sets show a low-budget venture. It is not necessarily bad in itself, but there is nothing to make up for the barren institutions. Few tensions in the screenplay, no live show and little effort are put into the performances. <br /> <br /> You might get a kick - a relaxed high - as it is clearly inconspicuous. It's just that there are so much better movies from the genre out there.
