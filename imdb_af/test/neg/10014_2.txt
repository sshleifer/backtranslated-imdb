At the bottom of the apocalypse film scale, this piece of the name is called The Final Executioner. At least where I come from. A block is being trained by an ex-cop to take revenge on those who killed his wife and friends in cold blood ... and that's about it. Many fake explosions and repetitive shootings occur. Has one of the strangest costumes I've seen in a movie for a while, and a massive fortress apparently run by only 7 people. Great work on dubbing to guys (!) Best moment: if our hero loses a sword fight and is about to crouch through the neck, he'll just get his gun and BANG! Why don't you do it earlier? It's a mystery. And that's why someone wants to put it in the first place. I'm still riddled with that one myself. 2/10
