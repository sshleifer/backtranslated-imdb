This movie clearly has an agenda that can be summarized as follows: Never cross the border (physically or metaphorically). Let's avoid everything on the other side with a wall or fence or something else, let's pretend that all gringos are angry, satanic or drug dealers. All that is outside the country's border (and especially the American borders) is dangerous, malicious and people there will hate you, or envy you or try to steal you or something else. The "true-to-life" is just a perverse tag that can be captured on anything to give it an aura of credibility, or in this case, just to help the ideology of the movie to get a few naive throat there to push outside. The perversity of the film lies in the fact that it reduces countries, people and everything in very black and white stereotype categories: Mexicans in disgusting people, Mexican police in a lot of corrupt police, republicans in the right morons, democrats in almost hippy humanists and so on. Is there anything good about the movie? I think so scarce, but may you think differently.
