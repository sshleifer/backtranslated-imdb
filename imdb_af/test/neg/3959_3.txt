The word honor must be erased from the vocabulary of all nations. It exacerbates male stupidity and is responsible for killing millions of innocent people. Anyone who disagrees shouldn't mind reading these comments. <br /> <br /> As expected with these screenwriters, Yakuza is an engaging crime thriller with a lot of respect for the ethnic background against which it has acted. Gore and violence friends will also not be disappointed, but especially at the end, violence becomes a bit senseless, superfluous and straightforward. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find Robert Mitchum's performance very good. It is an actor who certainly has not improved with age. He looks like a steward (it's not too good at the part) and his air of debauchery that made him such an impressive screen presence in the past comes through as confusion or lack of interest. Ken Takakura and Richard Jordan are very good at being honorable and young, intelligent, respectively. The best way to stand this movie is as a tragic comedy. Things are being implemented by the Mitchum character who asks the Takakura character a false assumption based favor. The error is quickly visible, but the sense of honor requires them not to return. So they start wandering around, shooting in all directions, swinging sword and destroying their friend's art apartment (although the guy pleads with them, stop it, please by the corresponding battle). Bodies start to accumulate and the story ends with Mitchum character makes his point: if you give him your little finger, I'll give you mine. Well, that's the least he can do, can't he? So he pulled out a knife, took a thank you breath and started sawing out of the mentioned limb (outside the frame, fortunately). It was a moment that was probably solemn. It just made me laugh. <br /> <br /> Using this movie is great in this movie. I especially filmed the scenes In and around the International Conference Hall on Lake Takaragaike, an interesting futuristic building was built by architect Sachio Otani (the Kyoto Protocol signed there). For me, the presentation of architecture looks better here than in Sydney Pollack's more recent documentary sketches of Frank O. Gehry which is about architecture and nothing else.
