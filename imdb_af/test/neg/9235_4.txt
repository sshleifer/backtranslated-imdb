Overwhelmed by the 7.0 points in IMDb, which is pretty good, I decided to watch this movie. However, I found this movie boring boring (about 2 hours) and full of clichés, a little girl who gets more personalities after childhood trauma, etc. Tamer KAradagli is quiet, funny in this movie, dialogue movements, etc. You will have to see it, he is the difficult cop you see on American movies, maybe copied too much. I will describe this movie as an ordinary American thriller with a small Turkish touch. Unfortunately, I am convinced that comedies and plays are the only genres worth watching in the Turkish theater. Anyway, I gave this movie a 4, it's too boring and full of clichés
