I can't believe anyone is giving this movie a good score. In addition to the horrific acting, thin (non-existent) plot line and slooooooooow pass, it would be the movie to see if you were really trying to sleep. The authors and directors' brains had to be fried eggs to ever realize something as horrible as that. Based on the plot summary on the DVD case, the foreground sounded really promising. But within the first ten minutes I knew it was a lost cause. If you want to see a BIG crawl, you need the Area 51 idea, look at the remake of "The Hills Have Eyes". Dreamland will soon disappear like all pathetic films of his ilk. NEXT !!!
