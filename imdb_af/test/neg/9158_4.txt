It is a below average "whodunit" with the cliche all in the lounge routine. Charlie Chan is a secret service agent doing government work, and he has to find out who killed a scientist working on a bomb to defeat German U-boats in World War II. There is little recommendation with this movie as it doesn't have much to do with the plot or the scientist or the war. Charlie Chan fans will probably find this movie disappointing. Who thin? Who cares?
