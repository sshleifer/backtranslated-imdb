Awful! I'm a teenager and I don't care about teenage movies, but it's terrible! Aaron Carter plays this pop star named JD McQueen and to keep up his grades or something, he works with the 'nerd', Jane whateverherlastnameis. But the 'average girls' are too predictable and so the clothes that most girls wear in the film are not realistic. How will any of those girls get away with no bra, tubes and shirts that uncover the stomach? IN HIGH SCHOOL? At my school we will be sent home for something. <br /> <br /> And part of the movie where JD Jane writes, she says, "Drag tight? He must think I'm an idiot! I didn't know SMS is so stressful!" How is SMS stressful "And how obsessed Jane is with JD and how he falls in love with her is very stupid. The dialogue is cheesy and stupid, the acting is terrible. The music is a bit nice and the plot is not for nothing. <br /> <br /> For tweeny-boppers who still love Aaron Carter, you'll enjoy it.If you are a casual viewer like me, it's NOT the movie for you
