I only saw this movie on TNT, and I told you, this movie was straight corny and cheezy. But after some point I started to drop off my socks and tell the truth. They should classify this movie as comedy rather than action / adventure. The most hilarious scene comes when the Delon and Kennedy make the loop 360 to avoid the French missiles that Wagner ordered to destroy the Concorde. Our intrepid leader, Kennedy, decides to shoot torches from the window to find the heat missiles ????? Stupid still funny --- the kicker has come here --- after one shot, the flare gun malfunctions and Kennedy tries to fix it in the cabin and well ... if you want to know what's happening, get a hold of this movie. The dumb parts of this movie include the total lack of plot - yes, we can act as ground in Paris for 25 minutes and spend an hour with love stories with prostitutes and flight scientists. Now we can switch ten minutes to the saboteur, then a wasted rest of the movie and a plane that falls apart visually and the PASSENGERS THEN SEE IT, it's right in front of their eyes !!!! --- final rating for this move --- (1/10) out of 4 stars if it was action 2 out of 4 stars if it was a comedy
