The DVD sleeve explains the premise: "Three problem teenagers were thrown in jail," and "set time to do until Captain Greer offers them a deal to work for him - shelter." The movie opens with definitions of the words "Mod" and "Squad", so you don't have to look it up in the dictionary. For a visual definition of "Cool", look for photos of the original tri-chamber: Michael Cole (as Pete Cochran), Clarence Williams III (like Linc Hayes) and Peggy Lipton (like Julie Barnes). <br /> <br /> A black one. One white. A blonde. The three that make up Scott Silver's version of Aaron Spelling's "The Mod Squad" are twenties: Claire Danes (like Julie Barnes), Giovanni Ribisi (as Pete Cochran) and Omar. Epps (like Linc Hayes). They can't do much with the given material. Mr. Ribisi's depiction is the most "far out", which means he deviates most of the original characterization. Me. Danes romance Josh Brolin (like Billy Waites), who seems to be in a repetition of "Marcus Welby, MD". You won't believe Michael Lerner with Mr. Epps "Linc" doesn't dance. He explains: "I'm not a fairy tale, I just want to dance!" and requests, "Spin me!" <br /> <br /> *** Die Mod Squad (1999) Scott Silver ~ Claire Danes, Giovanni Ribisi, Omar Epps
