I saw this movie last night and I almost cried. No, it wasn't because it totally amazed me, no. It was absolutely HORRENDOUS! Sometimes you see movies that make you wonder what the human race will be in the near future. This movie is one of those. It is as if the writer, actors, directors, etc. have come together and put copied scenes of their favorite horror flicks, put it all together and said "Hey, here's Satan's whip !!!" Having seen this movie, I couldn't help but be tormented by the eyes of people who call themselves actors; rolling like they are some talented artistic interpreters ... don't be fooled, they suck! Don't waste your time or money!
