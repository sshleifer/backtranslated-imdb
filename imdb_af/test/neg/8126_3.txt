Realty television crew has been assigned to cover a small town high school hockey team that is worn in a serial killer with a black mask and hoody. Many interviews where the members of the crew (and some of the locals living in the town of White Plains where most of this movie was determined) speak to each other in the camera, those who meet them in the White Plains town, their current situations, and the showbiz side of their lives. The screenplay is often acidic, cynical and bizarre, and Killer Movie makes great fun on television exhibits, with role-playing characters that one can find at The Real World. If this plot is attractive to you, knock yourself out. I tiring the characters and the satire is an old hat. Paul Wesley, the director who needs a big break, has more than he possibly can negotiate, Jake Tanner, a good guy, who is very good and tolerant of the shit he has to fight, taking the prime into account. donnas and immature people in his environment that cause nothing but migraines. Particularly irritating is his manufacturer Lee (Cyia Batten), a tyrant who is constantly giving orders to everyone, her poisonous attitude that causes a lot of tension. She is the type of producer who wants to make a small town outburst with the murderer, with the hockey team as a forefront to exploit the tragedy in white plains. Those who are familiar with Kaley Cuoco know she has made the glorious princess perfect now, because it is the only role we have ever seen. Like Blanca, she polarizes the way his attention demands, with what little fairy state she is at the dimple, producing a lot of friction, as she becomes a source of frustration, and she has the potjie (Cuoco has taken the part just so she can escape her usual television sitcom roles, be allowed to spray spotting without restriction) Cuoco, along with the entire cast, serves Killer Movie as an eyeball, but it's hard to find any character you don't want to see . Cleaver. Jason London is the audio / equipment guy, a real crawl with an acidic attitude, often tormenting the others with his dirty comments uncalled for. We see lots of personality clashes and watch this self-absorbed Hollywood tap into one another. The murderer's identity should not surprise anyone, it is quite blatantly obvious. A slight glance, but most of the violence is shot on the screen. Despite a rather lesbianism, it is not even satisfactory. Leighton Master appears in the film as a cute victim. Director / writer Jeff Fisher meets quite an attractive role, but I cannot distinguish it from the countless slides that have filled the horror shelves over the past ten or so years. While I have never liked any of Cuoco's characters, I have never been tired of looking at her, but eventually she has to find a role that does not consist of her preening, with blemish arrogance, always complain and complain.
