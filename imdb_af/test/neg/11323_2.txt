Tired and tiring, the one-liners almost made me cry. My 4 year old left the room and finally made a puzzle. I don't know which age group it was written, but the author didn't even want credit. As for the song, it's almost amusing. At least it was a decade ago. There are many Christmas movies to watch. Although I've seen much more than this, they're still nice. When it comes, I try to encourage my child to see something else. One positive note, which allowed a vote of 2 instead of 1, is that it encourages good moral values. It would be encouraging to see someone.
