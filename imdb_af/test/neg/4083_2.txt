Oh my Mr. Carell! How far you fell! After a glowing moment in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, Steve Carell's selection of films began to strongly contrast with what has come since then. Although the 40-year-old virgin was entertaining, it was obscured by his "Sunshine" character. I hope to find something that lets me pop popcorn out of my nose, and I decided to rent EVAN ALMIGHTY and see what possible guffaws can wait for me here. Not much ... <br /> <br /> Given the trite and clichéd script, the whole movie forced and felt unemotional. Evan Almighty also tries to put a deeply biblical moment in humorous terms, but fails. <br /> <br /> Almost every person on earth knows a bit of fun relieving the family's values ​​and tackling the current American administration's environment. the story of Noah and the Ark. God's wrath was transmitted by 30 days and nights of the rain that flooded the entire planet, while Noah, his family, and two of each of His creatures on Earth drove the gopher into tranquility in relative comfort. wood sheet. It was a great moment in human history (if you believe the Biblical text). Why would God appear to one man and ask him to build an ark that would carry the world's animals just for a few minutes after a dam breaks? The simple answer is that He would never want to. Too much emphasis has been placed on US government policy and not on world events, and make Evan Almighty a terrible myopic and American-centric movie. Although designed as a comedy, it never reaches anything that comes to the stomach. Maybe a few grunts and a smile, but little else. <br /> <br /> John Goodman (CARS) features another compulsive performance as the horrible congressman, Chuck Long, whose only goals are to create protected national land ownership opportunities. Even the strong presence of Morgan Freeman (10 ITEMS OF LESS), like God, can't help watching this wet disaster movie. <br /> <br /> The only funny moments are between Carell and the animals. especially when Evan learns how animal magnetism really is. Birds literally fall to him. Sheep flock around him. Lions are proud to be close to him (please forgive the words). <br /> <br /> The special effects were nice to watch, but were short (with good reason). The "flood" was interesting in that the Ark obviously led through his hand and was moved in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Unlike you, more than an insult to common sense and intellect.
