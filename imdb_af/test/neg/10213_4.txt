Hulk Hogan stars as a champion winner (a real play ...) named Rip, who is forced to defend his honor, title and friend of a greedy corporation who wanted him to sign for their network (Because wrestling sell!) But when Rip falls, the network gets a cycle championship called (and I'm quite serious). Battle of the tough guys, whose champion Zeus (played by Tiny Lister Jr.) may be the deadliest man living. Rip refuses to fight until his brother is attacked and hospitalized. No Holds Barred is pretty much what I expected from the production of Vince McMahon who is the least versatile actor in the action genre (Hogan). It's basically very unintentional humor, tons of uncomfortable rows, some good action sequences and tons of stupidity. In other words, it is only to struggle itself, so I give it a fair rating mainly because everyone who leases it knows what they are getting. The movie is cheap but good enough for what it is and really wrestling fans will probably enjoy it. I found myself finally hilarious. They are moments of such an absurdity that you just struggle with yourself. (Like the way Hogan jumps 20 feet in the air after he stuck in a limo, forcing a man to shit himself and of course the way Hogan recites his cuecard. (IE: "I'm not going around Don't be when this check cleans!) No Holds Barred is fun, but it's mainly because of how ridiculous it is. Campers really need to enjoy this smart vowel. <br /> <br /> * * Out of 4- (Fair )
