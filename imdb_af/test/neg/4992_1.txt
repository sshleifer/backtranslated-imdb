It's the worst movie I've ever seen. Drilling, illogical, terrible. Don't waste a moment in your life watching this shit! I hope the directors will not make any other movie, as this movie breaks them. The movie looks like a couple of friends with the directors after one or two days (if we can use this word for these two guys). They only use camera in hand. Many scenes are in the dark and nothing can be seen. Many scenes (80% of the movie) are just in conversation. ! There are movies like Vampire vs Zombies that you can laugh at, but this one is just bad, no point to make such movies. Please, stop Jason Horton and Shannon Hubbel. Don't make more movies!
