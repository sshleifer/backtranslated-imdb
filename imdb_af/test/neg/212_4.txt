Disappointingly raising the movie indeed, I actually expected a pretty cool cat and mouse stuff going through the movie and it didn't have a couple of that cat and mouse stuff going on, but it was just pretty stupid. And it basically showed all the good scenes in the trailer, and if you saw the trailer on it, you basically saw the whole movie because it's just predictable. So the plot is about a few armored workers trying to steal the 42 million dollars they were supposed to transport, until one of the members developed conscience. I thought the movie would be better with its well-known role-players, but I went wrong. I mean it's not necessarily a bad movie, but it just wasn't as good or has any depth. It's definitely a rental, but it's not really worth seeing in theaters. hoist <br /> <br /> 4.8 / 10
