I'm not sure what the point of making this movie was. It seemed to have been made by a historical society to be shown in your local 'Pistol Pete' museum. Initially, it appears that this can be the start of a Mad TV or SNL sketch. But then the joke is on you when there is no punchline and you realize someone is taking it seriously. The story was not bad, but the inclusion of the SASS members was a ploy (who worked) to see me the movie. I swear, the trailer put every character in the movie into "dead cowboy # 5". The reason why the Westerners are so nice is the atmosphere and the characters it brings. I just had the feeling that I watched the Civil War actors as cowboys. Not even worth the digital video it was recorded on.
