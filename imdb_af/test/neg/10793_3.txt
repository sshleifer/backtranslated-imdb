Suspicious pulp adventure exploitation in the jungle woman genre. Lousy sound happily obscures the dumb dialogue. And it's terribly talky for a movie about people who don't speak English. There is no adventure to be found here; It is a jungle adventure with cliff hangers and one wild animal attack that occurs in the backstage. <br /> <br /> Three lightweight shell bays wander the African desert and stop the warring man-hungry tribes of Amazons. These wild women have only progressed far from the Stone Age with the make-up of makeup, shoes and forearm hair removal technology. Despite their despair for "hus-bahnd", the ladies insist that they will fight the men and burn the weaker ones. <br /> <br /> The only interest, as if any question is, is the variety of young women wearing animal skins, cleverly designed like the bathing suits of 1951. Many wrestling and bad dancing mixed with stripless 1950's stripper moves . No nudity or substantial violence. On the other hand, you can spend days watching the striking native song of lobster.
