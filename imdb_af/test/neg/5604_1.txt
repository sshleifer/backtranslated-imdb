What a production, which is a waste of screen time and money. Here's what some European so-called producer thinks of a scifi movie. Take the former model, Alexandra Kamp, with an American c-class actor and get one of the film operations, the most notorious producer Harry A. Towers. Towers then find some obscure munich-based products. home, Tandem communication, Rola Bauer, and do not mix it with any script whatsoever and you will get "Sumuru" - a valuable gemstone among the worst movies ever done! Get live people, and do something else, whatever you do, no movies please! To combat everything, producers went to South Africa for filming. What you see on the screen is a huge sand hole, where action takes place, between extremely bad actors and extremely bad, as any movie student would do better.
