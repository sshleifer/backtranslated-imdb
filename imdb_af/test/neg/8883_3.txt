Maybe I missed something, but I found GOYA'S GHOSTS to be a boring melodrama costume. Regarding the story that tried to tell it, I found a confusing mish-mash going in all directions. And maybe it should be done by a Spanish director with the appropriate subtitle languages ​​rather than in English. I can't judge the historical truth of the story, but it seems to move along with a similar "artist's tragic fate" plot as a GIRL WITH A PERSON. Was the movie a comment on the religious injustices of the Inquisition, false piety, torture then and now, or what ???? I never seemed to be the one I could make. Natalie Portman's different characters were also ridiculously stereotypical. And finally, the movie was crowned with the closing melodrama of a destroyed Bardem's head and body hanging on the edge of the car and going to the sunset. Ines and Goya follow suit? Can't Milos Forman do better? than this?
