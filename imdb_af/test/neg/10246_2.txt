I haven't watched STARCRASH (1979) - those infamous Italian Italian take STAR WARS (1977) - but it can't be much worse than this wrong piece of garbage that, adequately, says Mel Brooks so SPACEBALLS (1987 ) Looks like a real work of art! In fact, the main reason GALAXINA is completely remembered today is because of the tragic fate that its leading lady - the Playboy centerfold Dorothy Stratten, who was killed by her madly jealously estranged man - had even had his official premiere before the movie! <br /> <br /> Although Statten (who later made two biopies about her depicting Jamie Lee Curtis and Mariel Hemingway) she plays the title role, she is lowered for the first half of the film. in a chair that apparently manages a spaceship on a 27-year trip to a planet or other; In fact, Galaxina is an all-purpose Android that also serves the wacky crew, getting them all hot under the collar and even looking for the Blue Star (cue choral music) as soon as they land!
