Begrudgingly gave it a 3-point score each for Fonda, Stanwyck, and the supporting role. <br /> <br /> Never seen this one before - I look at it now and it has just arrived in the section where Henry Fonda is wearing Babs over the threshold. If I keep watching, it will just be to see if Fonda and Stanwyck can pull this one out of the dump. <br /> <br /> But after reading the other viewer's comments, I'm not very optimistic. <br /> <br /> The opening skis were enough to put out my lunch. The voices were of course done in a sound studio, and the editing between the outside and the nearby was terrible. I don't know much about the technology of that era, but I can't believe there was nothing they could do to make it more credible. <br /> <br /> My second disbelief was when Fonda wiped out. Out and I think of the extreme speed of the journey. He is first in the snow to his upper body. Stanwyck pulls him out with a clear increase in trouble. And I think she's such an experienced doctor. Does not respond at all to his seemingly unconscious state and slack attitude. <br /> <br /> Look, I'm completely capable of suspending my unbelief, but I couldn't believe the fact that she was just a man with a possible head injury and that he was paralyzed for life . Not my idea of ​​great yuks. <br /> <br /> So, as I finished this comment, we only saw Kirk's first jealous outburst, and Dr. Hunt is out to run an appendectomy! I'm not sure what I hate anymore - the writing, the background music or the story !! Argghhhh! I am finished. Game over. Click.
