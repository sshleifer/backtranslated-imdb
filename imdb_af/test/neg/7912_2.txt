Having seen all the episodes of the Star Trek TV series many times since the 1960s, most of which are pretty good, and only a few people are mediocre, I think this one is the worst of all. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think it was so poorly executed as an embarrassment to the series. It's not that the story is so bad, although it is by no means outstanding, but the play is just unpleasant on the part of the two main characters, which means the other than the ordinary people in this case. Barbara Anderson gives her worst performance ever as the daughter of a mass murderer, and who is on a mission. She practically calls in the role of a mobile phone and shows no real emotional abilities here. Although she is usually never used more than a pretty face in most of her movie or TV roles, she has usually done very small parts. Arnold Moss as her father gives new meaning to the term 'Ham' and is the only actor ever on a 1960s Star Trek episode that William Shatner left in this area, and actually makes Shatner excellent in comparison. And he gets a Shakespearian actor, no less, which gives him more impetus to persuade, and he does it. <br /> <br /> Unlike these two leads, the story is such that anyone can tell anyone who the killer is within the first 15 minutes. I say this because I told my brother the whole plot ended at the first commercial break when we watched the original 1966 broadcast as pre-teens. His answer was: Yes, you are right. <br /> <br /> Skip this one and look at the much better Menagerie episodes originally broadcast.
