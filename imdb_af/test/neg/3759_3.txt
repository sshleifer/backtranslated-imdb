I fully understand the historical significance of Rocketship X-M, but it doesn't make it a good movie. To start, the plot (or whatever) is dull and lifeless. Five astronauts explode for the moon ?? of course they get beat and end on Mars (huh?) ?? cavemen seek Martians throwing stones at them ?? they return to earth and meet a fiery death ?? The end. Believe it or not, but this spicy plot description makes it much more interesting than it really is. To make matters worse, John Emery's feel, dr. Karl Eckstrom, it is necessary to give long-term speeches about everything the nature of man is to the dangers of nuclear weapons. It's just an excitement minute (sarcasm meant). <br /> <br /> Back to Rocketship X-M almost 60 years later, I would call the portrayal of women funny if it wasn't so sad and wrong. There are a number of examples I can mention, but there is an exchange of dialogue just after the end of the male chauvinist pilot Floyd (played by the annoying plastic hair Lloyd Bridges) and dr. Lisa Van Horn (the only female crew member and the constant object of Floyd's often awful attention) suggesting the film's attitude towards women pretty pretty: <br /> <br /> ?? Floyd: "I wondered, how did a girl like you in the first place mix in a thing like this." <br /> <br /> ?? Dr. Van Horn: "I suppose you think women should just cook and fuck and carry children." <br /> <br /> ?? Floyd: "Isn't that enough?" <br /> <br /> I think Floyd had to stay with the cavemen!
