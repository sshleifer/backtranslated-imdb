I AM NOT LINE ASSETS MY NAMES ARE RITICIAL BUT LINES ARE MY MUM I USE ITS ACCOUNT! Barney and Friends (or Barney, as mentioned here in England) is the best ever. I never really liked it. It was about 3 or 4 years old when I was born. So it was nothing new. However, my friend loved this dildo of a show. I was about 6, and I was at his house once, playing a Barney VHS band on the TV. I turned off the power, and he burst into tears. GROW YOU A DINOSAUR DATE FOR CHRISTIANS! Anyway, I caught the Barney movie on TV later that year, and I loved it. I have the VHS of it a few months later, and I carry out the band, I loved it so much! I swept away the tape a few years ago, but I loved it at the time. But the show! My God, the show was bad! Several children have become victims of pedophiles because of this stub of so-called entertainment! Never again, never again! It's not just me who hates Barney! 85% of all comments on this show are bad, and just watch the amount of You Tube Poops and videos that make up Barney's rubble on You Tube! And don't start me on Blow Job BJ! Why the hell would the producers dare to give a character such a sexual name! Another subliminal message in a children's show! And that Baby Bop is the worst thing since Osama Bin Laden! All in all, I give Barney and Friends MINUS 1000 OUT OF 10!
