I was hoping it would be the caliber of Das Boot and the strong realism made by the well-known German director Leni RiefenStahl in her documentary documents, I will unfortunately be disappointed. The storyline is undeniable and doubted credibility. An RAF airplane was shot down and somehow made its way to a hospital in Dresden. Anna, a nurse whose father runs the hospital and is about to get involved with a doctor, works with the pilot and falls in love. The next night at an exuberant engagement party, the pilot appears as a German officer and dances with Anna. Although well directed and acted, it is the lowest order soap opera.
