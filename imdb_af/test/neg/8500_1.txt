I didn't understand the people who judged it about 5. I think it's a terrible movie from any point of view. Plots, plays, arts, dialogue, music, no matter what! I don't care about a low budget. But you gotta get a point. Wandering, wondering. Two boys started to sleep in bed. terribly, not terrible. I love indie movies, don't care, it's slow. However, this movie disappointed me from any perspective. Even the Graffito, not artistic. <br /> <br /> I wondered what kind of people would want it. I am a woman in my 30's. Is it for teens who have some kind of loneliness over life or just don't get it? What did I get then? Wasting time! Please go to others.
