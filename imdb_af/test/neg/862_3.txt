Opening with some blatantly reused footage from 'Kit for Cat', 'Tweety's S.O.S' fails to become the classic cartoon. Instead, we get an example of Friz Freleng's Tweety and Sylvester range in its most common way. Unlike Chuck Jones' Road Runner series, which strived to propose new jokes in the same environment, Freleng's series was fortunate enough to regain jokes as long as the characters were in a different place. 'Tweety's S.O.S', then basically amounts to "this time we come to put them on a boat". It's not a completely bad cartoon. There are some good jokes, which mostly involve Granny's glasses, but they are raised by gags you can see down a mile (the six-disease routine) and it all builds to another of those ends where someone else if Tweety says: "a joke tat", a joke that worked well once, but has declining returns. "Tweety's SOS" will probably please children who enjoy almost any cartoon, but for big kids like me looking for More than the same tired gags, it's definitely one to avoid.
