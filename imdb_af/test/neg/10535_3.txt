I saw this movie yesterday and as most allrdy wrote, I also expected a Steven movie. God, I love this man just because his fighting style is unique and very hummer. I have a little doubt because I read that "Yes Rule" was playing in it, but hopefully I thought they gave him a small role, so I didn't get any irritation from watching him. And make the opposite happens, goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Steven was broken and the cash needed? bah = (which is a great dissapointment. If you want a Steven movie, please, skip this one's pure drama, but you'll only get some special effects that made me vote 3/10. But the "acting" "Yes, yes, the whole movie does rule for his girlfriend, with his annoying chatter talk. <br /> <br /> My beer took some fresh water from the tasting where we had the dishes. The story didn't have a" good about it. feel like a 3 year old produced it. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, Steven makes me happy in a future movie. People are not even worth renting just like that . <br /> <br /> Too bad and pitty :-)
