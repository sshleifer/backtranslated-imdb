When I sat down to watch this movie, I thought it might be a little good. but no. It was an OK movie, not good, but not bad for most, but then you end up and lose all credibility. they just had to be dead. they didn't leave the last bit, it didn't make sense. if they had anything, they started a plane crash, but we didn't work that way. the first bit is OK and I give them credit for it, but the rest is just airplane bad and unnecessary when you think about going and watching this movie. DON. It's terrible. Rent something that is really worth looking at. I give it 10/02
