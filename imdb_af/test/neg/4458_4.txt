Being too young to experience the Hammer movies when they were fresh and new, I discover their sacred horror movies as I get it on DVD. I know it was almost a decade and a half between them, but it's hard to see much of the magic in the original Hammer Dracula in this late entry into the Christopher Lee series. The original Hammer vampire story had a lot of atmosphere and a great story to get involved. Lee was a wonderful Dracula, a lively vampire, if possible, early in the outing, but here he is nothing but a cardboard character that usually stands and seems threatening. The fashionable youngsters speak like cartoon characters (although my aunt lived in England in the 1970s and she says people actually talked to the terrible cliches.) I had no interest in who lived or died among the younger crowd. In any case, they were quite terrible characters. I enjoyed seeing a young and charismatic Caroline Munro; but she leaves the story too early. Lee and his historical nemesis Peter Cushing add a sense of authenticity to the film, but they can't draw blood from this blank movie. This is D.O.A.
