OUCH, No real need to say anything else. This movie actually considered me suicide. As a big fan of the wonderful genre that is zombie movies, I found it to be the worst attempt I ever made. The movie never really looked! What was the point, I felt I was feeling hopeless and lost. Hell, it was so bad, I can't justify it anymore. I'm just going to hang in the closet. OK now, I tried to submit my comments, but the server only accepts comments that are ten lines or more. So here it goes ... Bad, terrible, not close enough. NO TITS !!!!!! How to have a Zombie movie without tits. In fact, the female head had one hell of a rack and the only reason I watched the movie was to get a look. Nope! Of course, there was one line that deserves to be called, a line that I look forward to using myself one day (when I just need to slap my face) "This pig won't smoke itself." This movie is bad, so bad.
