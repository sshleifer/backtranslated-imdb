It's not just that the movie is low. That's more than that. This movie is just unnecessary. Do we need another Western? How about Western with African Americans in the title roles? Sounds stupid, indisputable and a lame effort to modernize the genre? It is. Incredibly lame and simple mindset. It's like this lam Baz Luhrman movie "Romeo and Juliet" where he put it in modern times to attract young people and create a hype with the excitement of a classic story. Well, Baz Luhrman failed and so did the mess. The story is not bad, but the whole idea of ​​removing racism from a racist genre by throwing an African-American role is racist in itself. It's also puerile and simple mindset (like Baz Luhrman man he is a bad director). Hey (I hear you say) it was directed by Mario Van Peebles! He's also in the movie! How can it be racist? It's not. I said the idea was to throw all African Americans instead of Caucasians. The film is not racist, it's just pointless, stupid and very boring.
