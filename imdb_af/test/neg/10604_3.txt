It's an amazingly bad action movie. I want to say his primary mistake is that it USES. Arghh! Funky cabinets, retro-styled design and decent cinematography cannot prevent this movie from becoming a snoozer. Mod Squad's second (big) mistake is his lack of character development - underlined by the actors' lack of talent. I love Claire Danes' work, so I was rather surprised at her non-existent performance in this movie. Giovanni Ribisi is badly mistaken: how can his cotton-like, bumbling-acting style fit into an action movie? As for Omar Epps, he has to take a few plays to learn how to emulate. The man had the same facial expression for the whole movie! My suggestion is to save yourself a few bucks and wait to see this turkey on cable.
