Let me tell you a story. <br /> <br /> One day on the streets of Athens, a film director knocked in a male prostitute and decided that the world should only know his story, because ... you know ... he was deprived of .. And he took off his shirt a lot and ... so on. <br /> <br /> This film is the result of his revelation. Repulsive, depraved, homophobic, misogynist ... but of course filled with nice guys with their coffins showing. If it is your idea of ​​a good movie, enjoy it if it doesn't look like the pest. <br /> <br /> It has ever kicked me off.
