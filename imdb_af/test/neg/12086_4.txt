Despite strong performances by Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson, this film fails to explode the viewer's imagination. <br /> <br /> By the way, what about me. Driver? She had such a potential in the film industry. <br /> <br /> It seemed to me almost like an 1850 version of Yentl without the musical fanfare. With the death of her father, a position as a governor takes on a Christian family, hiding her Jewish identity. <br /> <br /> As I realized it was a time of peace, it was very boring even for 1850 England and Scotland. <br /> <br /> The house wife is very annoying with the singing song voice of her. I expected her to refer to Driver as anytime. What kind of name is Mary Blackchurch? I know the driver is trying to make herself a Christian, but does this name mean all the way? <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Mary finds love with the young cargo's father (Wilkinson) and his emotionally unbalanced son. <br /> <br /> In the end, the only thing we see is that Mary has found a way to cater for her family photography. Should we really be subject to what happened in the movie? <br /> <br /> The early scenes of Judaism practiced England in the 19th century and the cholera epidemic could eventually be played more. There is a definite underlying sense of anti-Semitism by the Wilkinson family, but it should never come out.
