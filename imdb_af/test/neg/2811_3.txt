I have not seen any other Antonioni films and the people who have seen this one have agreed to share the rest of his works with themes and images. Perhaps if I saw other things from him, I would have enjoyed this one and know what to expect. <br /> <br /> I saw it as an almost complete failure for so many reasons. First, the film suggests interesting, deepest issues about social relationships, feelings, the nature of reality versus fiction, but it is often done in the clumsy ways the characters speak as if they are speeches, get started, the lead of statements rather than having a dialogue. The scriptwriters seem so worried that we won't get the point they prefer to tell rather than show. <br /> <br /> Second, the film has no rhythm, especially in the first half. It's not just that it's slow. Some slow movies are made with an excellent sense of pace and rhythm (El Sur by Victor Erice Of Scorsese's The Age of Innocence are examples I would like), but to be successful we need the characters so tempting or moving the story so that we can meet it. It doesn't happen in Beyond the Clouds, and the relationship between John Malkovich's "reality" and the love stories "fiction" is sometimes greasy, others suddenly and others confusing.
