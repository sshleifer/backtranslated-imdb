I like dark humor and non-computer stuff, but not if it is without any purpose, but to elevate yourself. A group of people without a trace of self-irony are crazy. <br /> <br /> There are people who can make joke jokes funny, but whoever made the movie has unfortunately even failed in the very easy job of having fun. about Turks in Germany. This is a very easy task, but if you are the German equivalent of an innate redneck (= inbred south of a town where virgin is often lost to farm animals), you will definitely fail here and there on life. I have heard and seen so many funny things about minorities in Germany, but this "movie" (this piece of crap listed here is an insult to the next worst movie) sucks like the calf the creators of this movie a met a few years ago.
