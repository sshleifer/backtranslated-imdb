The Kindred opens up for shots of a Porsche race along a highway, it comes up with an old bakkie and is stopped. As it is faster past the driveway, the driver calls (Benjamin J.Perry as Ben Perry) obscenities and sharps his horn. Withdrawn, he did not see an obstruction ahead and his Porsche collapsed. He is quickly freed from the wreck and taken to hospital. In the way Paramedic (Randy Harrington) tries to save him, suggest that he probably won't. Then the ambulance is attacked and forced by a bus off the road. The driver of the bus, Jackson (Jim Books as James F. Books) stores the paramedic and steals the patient. The ambulance driver, Harry (Charles Grueber), makes no attempt to stop him. As soon as the injured man was placed in the Van Jackson, his attention became to Harry knowing each other. Harry asks Jackson not to hit him because he broke his jaw's last time. Jackson hit Harry on the floor and threw a bundle of money with him. The movie makes it clear that we are in San Fransisco, by showing a shot of the Golden Gate Bridge. Sharon Raymond is woken up by her friend, Dr. John Hollins (David Allen Brooks), to let him know that his mother, Amanda (Kim Hunter) recently had a heart attack, regained consciousness. Hollins works for a company called the Geneticell Corporation and is delighted with the news and headlines to see her. Once there she asked him to go back to his old orphanage in a small town, Shelter Cove, and destroyed all her notes and experiments, especially the 'Anthony magazines' after which Hollins had never heard. She also claims to have a brother. named Anthony. Back at Geneticell, Hollins talks to a doctor Phillip Lloyd (Rod Steiger) about his mother, since they both worked together before they fell apart and asked him about her research and if he knew about someone called Anthony. He claims he doesn't know anything. When Amanda dies after a visit by the sinister Dr. Lloyd, decides Hollins to make his Mothers request and try to find out who Anthony is. While paying his final respect at the funeral, a woman named Melissa Leftridge (Amanda Pays) introduced herself to Hollins and said she was a great fan of his mother's work and research after helping her. Because Melissa knows so much about his mother's work, he invites her to the house, as she may be able to help find answers to various questions he has. Hollins, Sharon, Melissa and three laboratory assistants, Brad Baxter (Peter Frechette), Hart Phillips (Timothy Gibbs) and Cindy Russell (Julia Montgomery) plus a girl with a watermelon (!) Named Nell Valentine (Bunki Z, big name was her parents thinking!?). They get business right away, but get little interest. For some reason, no one at this point in the basement, who is just as good, thinks there's something out there, something big, smart and has many tentacles. First, it kills Duke, the dog. Then it moves to bigger prey. When Hart is attacked by something in a barn, Hollins decides that he must destroy all traces of his mothers' work and everything that Anthony is. Jointly co-written and directed by Stepehn Carpenter and Jeffery Obrow, Carpenter also acted as a kinographer and Obrow as producer. I think it's a pretty poor movie. The author is credited with five (!) Authors, Carpenter, Obrow, Earl Ghaffari, John Penny and Joseph Stefano. With five people working on it, I think they can do something better and more coherent than this. Nothing is so well explained, why did Amanda make these monsters marine / human hybrids? What is dr. Lloyd's interest and motives? Why does he steal bodies from the back of the ambulance? Why does he have a cellar full of mutants? Why not consider one of these so-called genetic scientists to investigate the basement? Can Melissa act more suspiciously even if she tried? Why isn't one of the characters given any background? Why do people still call a substance found in the sea, called Hemocynine, when 99.9% of the audience do not intend to know what they are about? There is also a serious lack of blood and gore, only one person dies on the screen, just one! And all the scientists survive in a vomit-invading 'happy ending'. It's a horror movie guys, all we want to see is to kill the slimy monsters and eat people in different gory ways. The one on the screen is actually pretty cool, someone has slender tentacles under their skin, in their ear and on their nose in the movies, just decent horror sequence. To try the gore quote, there is a scene where dr. Lloyd is experimenting on a rail animal, but it only takes a few seconds, and in the context of the rest of the movie it doesn't matter. Melissa also changes in a fish, don't ask. There is also no nudity, it is not a surprise. The film looks professional enough with decent production values, but is just as dull and flat at a snail's pace. We don't even get the huge monster in the basement up to 15 minutes before the end, which is too late, when it looks, the effects are OK, and it makes it even more regrettable that it is no longer used. Overall, I was very disappointed and I expected much better. A horror movie with only one on screen dead and only three in total, what is the world as well?
