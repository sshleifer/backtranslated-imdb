This movie had such a good starting point to start. Suspense, slashers, a secret society, and you really couldn't figure out who the bad guys were until the last quarter of the movie. <br /> <br /> But it contains so many stupid clichés of the worst of old American slasher / horror movies. Now, I love slasher / horror movies, but there are all the old clichés that have long since disappeared from American cinema. For example, the old "I hear sounds in the basement and I'm alone at home and the basement does not work, so I'm going to investigate" cliché ". <br /> <br /> Three examples of these clichés have me really does not really bother at all: <br /> <br /> 1) When Potente finds out that there can be a secret community at work at the medical school that sharpened living bodies, she continues to ask questions and everyone - many public, in essence she says: "I found out. Come kill me, because I tell everyone your secret. "And then she wondered why his blood stained her bed and brought her roommate's cut finger into a towel. <br /> <br /> 2) Even after one He met the dissection table two weeks ago and finds out about this secret society that disrupts living people, and goes to the lab where all corpses are stored 2-3 times more by HERSELF AT NIGHT to investigate. <br /> <br /> 3) Her roommate is killed, pursued by the murderer, who she knows, does not report to the university or police, then leaves school to visit her parents. she comes back to school and thinks believing that this man who is trying to kill her will run and not try to kill her, even though she knows his secret, of course she was wrong. <br /> <br /> For someone who had to be so clever (she was working as a doctor in the best school in Germany), she acted like the cliché bimbo in horror. movie. <br /> <br /> These things just made a potentially good movie very frustrating, and made me decide that the end would come sooner. Halfway through the movie, I stopped caressing her and she also wanted to come to the dissection table.
