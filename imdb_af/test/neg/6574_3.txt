I think that after Leonard Nimoy succeeded in directing "the search for Spock" and "the Voyage Home", William Shatner thought he could also register. Although he is a skilled actor, he shows here that he is just not a good director. <br /> <br /> In fact, this movie is difficult to support the arguments of Trekkies who say that William Shatner is an arrogant egoism. Because although his character, Captain James Kirk, was always the most important role in the original Star Trek, it seems in this movie that he is at the heart of the movie, the two other main characters, Captain Spock and Doctor Leonard McCoy, are just there. to support him, and the other characters are just there to give real relief. <br /> <br /> The plot is that some emotional Vulcan outcasts, namely, Mohair, are an understanding of people and the pain that is bottled inside releases them from the traumatic event early in life they care for. always changed. Thankfully, they come to him in his quest to free the whole world from pain and therefore to peace. Sybok and his followers recommend the building where a peace conference between a human, klingon and romulan diplomat takes place. It lures the operating business there, since none of Starfleet's other ships have "experienced commanders" (honestly, with the way Star Fleet is run, the Klingons and Romulans had to overcome them years ago). Sybok adds the Enterprise's crew, except Spock (which is revealed as secret brothers with Sybok), McCoy and Kirk. Sybok recommends that the enterprise go to "the center of the universe" to meet God, which apparently has every word for it. However, it seems that it is only a small entity when he asks for the use of the Enterprise and Kirk, "what does God need with a star ship." The entity has been destroyed, but not before Sybok, realizes he has been lied to for years, sacrificed his life and earned Spock's respect in the dead after the Enterprises photon torpedoes destroyed the entity and inexplicable moose. <br /> <br /> OK, science fiction movies are not known for realism, but at one stage rationality must be applied. Why do people follow Sybok just because they release their pain? Why are all humanoids defined by a single traumatic event? I definitely led a trauma-free life. Why doesn't Kirk try to mutter and betray his crew after joining Zook? What was the point of Zook who sacrificed himself when the torpedoes would kill the entity anyway? <br /> <br /> So the plot is weak. Another problem is that Sybok, although well played by Lawrence Luckinbill, is poorly portrayed. Just because he is an emotional Vulcan doesn't mean he has to act exactly like a human religious fanatic. Shatner (who was co-authored as well as the director) could at least develop dialogue fit for an emotional Vulcan. I think he feels like any emotional being like us. Giving, I think that means Klingons should say "is not" and "not" more often than "not" and "not". And the Cardassians should not extend their sentences because they like to talk (yes, I know it's sad that I know). Please ... every ST race uses unique dialogue. Why is Zuck the exception. <br /> <br /> The only thing not to complain about is the play. I've always known "Star Trek" to have good actors, and this movie is no exception. Cudos also goes to Leonard Nimoy because it had to be difficult to play the indifferent Spock at his age. <br /> <br /> Some other things I didn't like: <br /> <br /> Shatner and Let DeForrest Kelly twice show how bad singers they are by singing "Row, Row, Row your Boat "in this movie. I think Shatner wanted to silence his opponents of his singing ability. What he did was prove their point. <br /> <br /> Uhura does a fan while wearing nothing but a tree bark to pull some men into a boobie. The dreams of all of us are immediately filled with images of middle-aged plump ladies who are naked. <br /> <br /> Everything is good and good as long as it doesn't affect the nature of "Star Trek". Too much, but if Scotty collides with the Enterprise and KOs, it's a little overboard. <br /> <br /> Kirk is the only crew member who can reject Sybok's offer to release and see their inner pain. the god cheats his fraud Not even Spock can manage any of this? Maybe these screens were valentines from Shatner to his character, so many suspects. <br /> <br /> The concept of an entity pretending to be God was used more than once in the Star Trek before this movie. Be creative, Shatner. <br /> <br /> When I speak of unconsciousness, I did not purely finish the music of Star Trek: The Next Generation. <br /> <br /> Everything in All, very bad "Pull" movie. If you are a Trekkie, watch it once because it is Star Trek. Otherwise, see "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan." It's better.
