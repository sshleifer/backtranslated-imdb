The Play Macbeth was written by William Shakespeare between 1604 and 1606. Since then, many other versions of the play have been produced, including remakes completed in 1948, 1971 and 2006. Akira Kurosawa even published a Japanese version of Macbeth in 1957, "Kumonosu j√¥." The play begins with King Duncan who hears about the success of two of his generals, Macbeth and Banquo, in a recent battle with the Irish and Norwegian. After a quick advancement of Duncan, Macbeth immediately gets an uncomfortable feel for lust, greed and strength and does everything he can to gain access to the crown: even if it includes murder. <br /> <br /> Geoffrey Wright tried to create his own version of the famous play in 2006 by placing it in the modern Melbourne underworld. Imagine a low Macbeth killing hundreds of AK-47 soldiers and defeating its own "Low" version simultaneously. Just joking about the latter, but one thing he does is the traditional Shakespeare. And he keeps it all over the movie. That's right! Shakespeare meets ghetto. That's all you can ever hope for! Not ?? The latest Macbeth is rough and violent enough to fit into any other contemporary action movie, but it doesn't have proper acting, real lingo and a good camera working technique. <br /> <br /> The modernized movie starts with Macbeth (Sam Worthington) who works as a hit / drug dealer for Duncan (Gary Sweet), a drug host from Melbourne, Australia. After advancing to the Thane or Glamis by Duncan (as the three witches predicted), aspiration Macbeth began to take his eyes on the throne. After advancing Macbeth, Duncan invites him to Macbeth's home for an evening of drugs and alcohol. Before the festivals begin, Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hall) speaks to Macbeth to kill Duncan to take power over the throne. After the bodyguards are drunk and all sleep, Macbeth sneaks into Duncan's room and kills him. After his murder, Macbeth takes over all the possessions of Duncan, including the hidden title and crown. Just as soon as he thinks he wants what he wants, he finds it more than bribery and runs away to solve his problems. <br /> <br /> One big mistake of the movie was the play. A once seemingly flamboyant and empowered Macbeth suddenly becomes sissy. And he looks like a sad puppy in the whole movie. I don't really know if it was Worthington's whether Wright's fault was, but one of the two had to realize Macbeth was a king, not a knot on a log that had everything his wife had to say literally. As I said earlier, Macbeth had to be rude, arrogant, and indifferent. But if his character changes to a drug master, he also changes personalities. On the other hand, Lady Macbeth, really knew how to pinch it when it came to recognizing and personalizing her character. She didn't seem to be in the play or the 1971 version, but she remembers Macbeth that compared to murder, anything else he could possibly do couldn't really match. <br /> <br /> Another thing I found unpleasant was all the nudity. These flies had to be Wright's fault. The witches did not do a bit of acting unless you act in your birthday pack to call. At one point in the movie I started to wonder if I was watching Macbeth or Unique Positions Vol. 2. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong if I say I find the Shakespeare dialogue out of place. It is spoken flawlessly, but when it is spoken by an Australian gangster, it's just weird. When Macbeth starts killing people, he first lets them know by talking to them in Ye Olde English. Macbeth has lots of action, blood, gore and nudity to keep someone alive. You've forgotten all the positive facts even though you start thinking about yourself, "Well, what did he say in the last sentence?" At some points in the movie, I don't even think the actors themselves knew what they were saying. The new age of the movie could easily be subtracted. It wasn't for the "You's" and "Thee's". <br /> <br /> The camera work was just fair to me. One thing I couldn't stand was the continuous pacing between characters. The used camera technique gave away that Blair Witch type vibe and threw me in my mouth a little. Matt Reeves tried to try the same concept of camera work in Clover, but it just doesn't work. It made me come out of my chair and looked around for the little bags they had planted on each seat in the planes. <br /> <br /> Back to everything, the gangsta 'Macbeth holds one positive: lots of action. Unlike this, the film contains nothing more than uninspiring acting, correct English use, and stomach-twisting camera work. The sound track holds one or two of the same songs, but each song is changed or re-bound for each scene. Never use a variety of interesting or engaging media. From now on, directors must leave the dangerous drug underworld to Al Pacino and Robert Deniro. Future versions of Macbeth should be created, just as Shakespeare intended to play 400 years ago. I would recommend medieval clothing, Ye Olde English, swords and shields and a soundtrack prepared by Enya. But anyway, modern Macbeth makes you crave a good ole folk music, a campfire and a bustier.
