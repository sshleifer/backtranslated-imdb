This movie would probably have been good if they didn't use CGI (computer-generated images) for the weather wolves. It made the creatures fake and the werewolves look cartoon. CGI is ideal for certain effects such as dinosaurs in Jurassic Park or Twister. But when we see a movie where the creature really has to look, CGI is not the way to go. Look at an American werewolf in London. No CGI. Just makeup and a mechanical being and what you came up with were more realistic. as shown in the successor. This movie featured a few gags that were fun to watch and the humor in this movie pulled me out, but it's nothing more than a movie I thought, and that's not good enough. According to me, an American Werewolf in Paris is not the original.
