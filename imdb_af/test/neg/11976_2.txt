Overlooking the entire movie adaptation of a video game, it's another horrible movie by Mr. Boll. How he's still hired to make movies is a constant surprise to me and of course most of the movie community. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would say that this effort was fractionally better than many of its previous efforts. Some of the dialogue was even half-way in Far Cry, although he still misused certain phrases and in some cases he didn't use the phrases correctly. <br /> <br /> Now, except that Jack Carver is supposed to be American and not German, Til was still entertaining in this role. One exception is the low lame lines he uses to get into bed with the girl. And we're supposed to believe she's ready to have sex with him with such a minimal dialogue? Emile? Simply there for comic relief, I'm sure and still paralyzed. Jack's character seems old and tired, but is still capable of the extreme acrobatics needed to avoid one of the changing super soldiers in the lab. <br /> <br /> Don't see this one for the Far Cry customization. But you can only waste an hour and a half to see it if you have nothing better to do.
