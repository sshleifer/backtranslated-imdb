In my opinion, the end that completely destroyed the whole thing. The initial idea that someone suddenly realized that they were the son of God and the second coming was a bit clever. People began to believe him and his friends became the new disciples. People got tired, demons were having people, all kinds of fun. Of course it all went wrong. It was bad enough that they had to take up the impossible task of finding a large number of writings to find the "third will" in five days, but then it eventually became this ridiculous humanistic fantasy. I won't spoil it, but I'll just say it comes down to being written by a teen with a very limited knowledge of theology. I hear they make an American version of this story, I just hope they change the eye-catching end.
