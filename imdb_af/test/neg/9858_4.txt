This documentary document has not been made professional or objective. The whole thing played like a conspiracy theory by IBM to win that match just to make money. Garry Kasparov has an ego problem. He was blown up before the match and when he lost, he didn't keep it. I remember playing chess against computers in the 80's and it wasn't too hard to win. As time went on, I started losing and didn't like it. Today I simply don't play computers anymore, because they're just too good. Not only that, the games are uninteresting and do not have the appeal of human games, where both sides have the chance to track down the game. This documentary still keeps us images of The Turk, which is an old chess machine that is really controlled by one. From the beginning to the end, we have led to believe that IBM has literally hidden from a human GM literally in the back of their cache size computer. I'm a computer scientist and offended by the idea that IBM just got because Garry lost. I know how computers play chess. It's not magic and it's no secret. They can be trained, have large amounts of chess knowledge and they definitely see positions and possibilities in unprecedented detail compared to humans. It's really no surprise that Deep Blue has won. Maybe it was then. If it happened today, given the increasing processing power of machines; people will hardly cut. If a machine could not at least sign with a GM today, people would think the program was poor.
