I can't give it less than a star, I tried. At the moment I'm not sure if I'm halfway through or not, but I no longer actively paid attention, as it was a dream. Or not. Or maybe it was. I think viewers who have posted a comment that does not "deserve" the descriptions "terrible" or "terrible" or "let me swallow a bullet" are probably nice because it is an indie movie. Don't listen to them, listen to me - there's no nudity in the movie, skip it. I need ten lines to submit this warning, so I'll say the goth girl who described some users as "hot" is fat. She has thick elephant legs.
