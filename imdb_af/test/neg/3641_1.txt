Right, where do I start? I can't even imagine understanding this preteen pathetic excuse for a show. Imagine: a boarding school, where children whose parents roll in money just stitch them together to radiate the world themselves. If you have taught these children, they will not even upgrade the term teenagers because they hardly even act like healthy homosapiens, self-centered, think again. About 23 minutes have the so-called problems, boys, etc. Drowning. <br /> <br /> The heroine of the show, of course, Mademoiselle Zoey, played by Britney's Polly Pocket Little Miss, I'm all That sister, Jamie Lynn Spears, obviously has a lot to learn about acting. However, I will give her face, because her superficial, one-dimensional character does not allow much space for depth. She plays the Pacific Academy's sun, moon and stars, crusader fighting for the fate of all women, equality of all generations. <br /> <br /> Perfect in every one, always with her two loyal sidekicks, Nicole, the daffy bimbo, who obviously has too much of Daddy's cash and tough chick, Dana, proving a tough nut to crack . Both left the show in seasons 2 and 1, not that I was guilty of it. But horror of horrors, in Lola, who herself has seen herself since Natalie Wood, comes in with green feathers in her hair and fake brown. She is even more rude than Zoey herself, if it is even possible, and even thicker than Nicole, and hell knows we can't do it. <br /> <br /> This show, like all sorry excuses for television programs Nickelodeon has been launching since 2000, is a leading victim of stereotyping. Get a girl next door and close to her best friend's feelings for her Zoey, a good although best friend, Chase, a cool, arrogant ladies man, Logan, a boy and a mad girl, who is not very bright not, Nicole, the one everyone thinks is strange, just because she is very clever, the nerd, Quinn, the exaggeratedly dramatic, annoying, but super-thin, Malibu photo-perfect model, Lola, and the tough, but gentle inside woman , Dana. Now, where did I hear all these characters before? I'm sorry, but what's so wrong with having a personality? Just because Quinn is passionate about Science and actually cares for her future and does well in the academic aspect, which the rest are also worried about, is she "strange" and a "nerd"? Lola at the start of the series was a potentially big character with her bad ways and different prospects in life. Zoey just had to go, get out of your fork, burn her at stake, she went back to Weird Town and all that jazz. So much for women's rights. Unfortunately, Lola just got nothing more from another OC clone, in all its anorexic glory. Probably, not to surprise her mistress. <br /> <br /> But the 2000 generation of MySpace whores looks like that with the Chase / Zoey typical fairy tale romance, the tension between persistent, "hot" Logan and "kick-ass" Zoey or Dana, depending on you and the beautiful people. This show is to remind us that people do not like realism, they prefer a pretentious, level and dull lifestyle. Sorry to love it for you, it won't happen unless you have a big trust fund and parents to visit you.
