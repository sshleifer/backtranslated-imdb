I wanted to see ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE for a long time. I've always been inspired by the title, star and desert, but for some (now fairly clear) reason, this movie is never shown on television, or I missed it if ever shown. Well, after watching the DVD, I now know why the movie is rarely shown: it's because it's not that good. In fact, I say it's a lot of a mess. <br /> <br /> ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE was created by first director and show. The movie is mainly a series of vignettes with absolutely nothing that holds it together. More like a collection of short movies that are randomly joined together. The movie can then be cooked: intro (murder); cop and girlfriend together; intro credits; police are going to work; crazy man telling story; policeman looks dead; cop and head and girl at the bar; chase scene; etc. The scenes just don't flow together. They are very independent of each other and therefore the characterization is poor, border amateur. The scene at the bar with the girl, the scene at the farm with the hippies, the scene with Big John and the head shouting at each other was worthy. I almost stopped the movie during those (terrible) moments. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker's lack of experience is in evidence throughout the film. The style, like the 1970s, is across the map. The intro credit scene makes the movie look like a commercial for law enforcement. Then try to be a buddy movie (Big John and Zipper), then a murder mystery; then a melodramatic love story; etc. A movie does not have to have one particular style to succeed, but I'm afraid the style in ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE is confused. You can clearly see that the director had no idea what he was doing or where he was going. <br /> <br /> The movie is not a complete disaster. While the content of ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE is almost amateurish, its appearance is extremely (and deceptively) professional. The cinematography is amazing. Each frame is worthy of an exhibition at an art gallery. Or because the first (and last) time director was involved in the music business, worthy of an album cover. The beautiful appearance of the film gives more faith to the end product than it really deserves. And thanks to Robert Blake's play (of a very poorly written character), the film holds a certain level of realism, though nothing else makes sense. What is noteworthy about the appearance and composition of the film is that it has been copied and duplicated a million times. The intro credits reminded me of something like TOP GUN, which was made 13 years later. Johnny's dressing sites, with his clothes on the bed, reminded me of the American Gigolo. Oddly enough, ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE has a very contemporary feel, due to the beautiful visuals, even though the story and philosophy behind it are hopelessly outdated. <br /> <br /> So, ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE is, on the one hand, a remarkably underrated and obscured film, as it obviously affected many future filmmakers out there in terms of appearance and composition. Very few films claim that this and legendary filmographer Conrad Hall should get full credit. On the other hand, EGIB is also deservedly forgotten because the poor characters, confusing story and confused direction, of which nothing is worth remembering.
