I came about halfway through this movie and was very disappointed. It was just plain boring and totally unrealistic. In many movies I can become unrealistic, but not when it is supposed to be a crime drama. The evidence collection and maintenance processes were one day only strange. I quickly started to see how it ended. And then bored and just turned it off and returned. The main character, played by Ellen Barkin, was not credible at all. Peta Wilson performed very well in this film, but her character was out there and there was no one for her acting talents to play off what made it work.
