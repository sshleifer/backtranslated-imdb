It's a good show to watch, it's not the best or the worst. I watched it for a long time and I don't like any of the new things. This show has turned into a bit of teenage waste and is very different. I don't like that crap. I have no IQ, why they completely changed the theme of this show. The first season was great to watch and was partly amusing. The 2nd season is just outside this world. I don't really know why the authors / directors have changed this behavior. many more people love the 1st season better than the 2nd and 3rd. I will only watch the first season of this show from now on, when I see a new episode, I will change the f * ckin channel ... you heard me! It gets a 3/10 because I enjoyed a bit of the 1st season but hated the 2nd and 3rd
