This movie is right, pretty stupid and taken lightly. But what I can't stand is the numerous heroes and boy's illegal comments near the end: "Look, they all look the same". Isn't it beyond the good taste standards? I thought it was rebellious, just like the heroic, unselfish acts of some of the people in this movie. I'm not saying it won't happen like that, but all the bravery is zooming in, so make my stomach ache.
