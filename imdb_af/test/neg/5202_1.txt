It's a horrible movie from about every point of view. As many have already been pointed out in previous reviews, let me focus only on the "Serbs" and "Delta Force" boys in this movie. <br /> <br /> 1) The uniforms wearing "Serbs" are not Serbian. And helmets are also wrong. <br /> <br /> 2) The actors playing Serbs do not speak Serbian, not even a language near Serbian, other than in "behind hostile lines" where Czech actors best speak the language and at least add some credibility to the movie. <br /> <br /> 3) The greyish "Serbian general" looks and acts like a moron, his gun shoots when American soldiers name his: <br /> <br /> - American soldier: "Gravic! ! " <br /> <br /> - Gray beard moronic general: (burns his AK47) <br /> <br /> - American soldier: "Gravic! Come out!" <br /> <br /> - GBMG: (burns its AK47) <br /> <br /> - US soldier: "Gravic! You're surrounded" <br /> <br /> - GBMG: (Fire his AK47 ) <br /> <br /> - Prop man: "Excuse me, Grey-bearded moronic general, see, we're out of space and I've sent the boy to buy even more, but he's not back yet. .. "<br /> <br /> - GBMG: (click) <br /> <br /> 4) Since when has the army released AK47s to the Delta Force? I think they can't find enough working M4s in Bulgaria, but there were many old AK47s and exercise spaces;) Maybe they should have been for some airsofts, they are cheaper and would not hurt the credibility of the movie anyway do not have. .. <br /> <br /> 5) In the scene where a DF officer hangs on a rope while talking to a rocket scientist, he always holds the finger on the trigger. No healthy person with any weapon training or just plain common sense will ever do it. I think the actor thought his coolness would take the longer, then he kept the gun that way. <br /> <br /> This movie is such an insult to common sense.
