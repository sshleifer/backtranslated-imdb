I own a vacation more home not far from Plainfield, WI. Ten minutes from the Gein property to be exact. I saw his land, the cemetery where he was buried and where he did his digging, and I sold at the hardware store previously owned by the Worden family. While visiting our family in California, we decided to rent this movie. It was disgusting. The real story of Ed Gein is so disturbing and creepy, why the creators of this piece of trash have decided to make their own story is beyond me. The actor who plays Ed is a very big man, Ed was a very small, gentle and shy man. It's part of what makes his story so scary. He didn't have a helper to dig the graves and anyone who owns land in the area knows it's mostly sand with a little dirt in it. You won't break much of a sweat digging a hole. They don't have to hire an actor with the body of a wrestler, just do your research. And if the writing wasn't bad enough, there are NO mountains in Wisconsin, and I'm pretty sure 911 wasn't available in 1957.
