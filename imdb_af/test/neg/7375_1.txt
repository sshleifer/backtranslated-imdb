I absolutely couldn't believe the levels of uncertainty displayed in this production. I honestly thought gay men had better taste than it had. I know I do. <br /> <br /> Most of the debt doesn't matter, but let's get them out of the way ... the only one with real talent was Joe Souza (plus he's got the best bid in it) had the cast). He had a nice, clear play. Okay, and Jaymes Hodges's voice was like that, but he had a vacancy in every number. The rest couldn't hold a note in a bucket, although the music sounded of course. Must be really horrible to hear them live. They were also all girly boys except maybe three. If I wanted to see naked women on stage, I could go to the titty bars. Not sure why anyone would choose to roll L.A. instead of New York. I think NY has more readily available singing talent, although one in L.A. would think they could find better-LOOKING guys. Apparently not. <br /> <br /> But I split ... the real blame here lies with the creators and producers. This score was the most banal, indifferent trip I ever heard. It sounded like some theater queens had taken their musical CDs, threw them into a blender and threw the goo on a page. Unfortunately, I'm sure there are many who can't tell the difference between good theater writing and whatever it is. I mean seriously, I laughed my ass through the whole thing, but not on the lame jokes. I think the morbid 'my-lover's death-of-Aids song' entitled 'Kris, Look What You Missed' was the most hysterical thing in the whole show. Genius writes ... Crisis / Miss ... wow ... they all rhyme ... must be a good lyric. And Jesus ... the END of that song ... "Oh Kris, Ohhh Kris, OHHHH Kris ..." ABOUT AND ABOUT !!! My other favorite was: "You must be a Pumpy Junkie Boy to be a Humpie Hunkie Boy" ... WTF ??? The whole show was full of the most arbitrary lyrics just because they rhyme. Where did these people learn to write songs? Apparently they listened to Sondheim and said, "He's not that good, I can do it ..." as evidenced by the delayed "Bobby, Bobby, Bobby" reference of COMPANY in one song. Another irk: why are 20-somethings singing about Robert Mitchum and Tab Hunter? Of course it comes from the mouth of the lyricists and not the actors ... again, writes bad. <br /> <br /> If you love torture and pain, and I know many of you, do strange fetishes, go and see. But you're warned.
