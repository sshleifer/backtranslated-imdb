I couldn't wait for the end. It's absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen. If you thought that almost everyone can make a viewable movie, these people prove that a minimum skill set is needed. It's a movie with no stand-alone features at all. It counts a zero in each section. It's more than just "amateur", because the audience is not considered or considered at all. There is no serious attempt to act or entertain. The storyline is aimless, useless and pointless. The cast looks very uncomfortable and totally lacking in direction. The technical aspects of the film are poor. <br /> <br /> As a DVD it makes a good cool drink.
