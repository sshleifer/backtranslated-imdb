OK, get one thing straight, I love dinosaur movies, even the bad ones. So with this in mind we can continue. "Raptor" is a really horrible movie, actually it's not even a movie in its own right, as it is merged with bits of "Carnosaur", "Carnosaur 2" & "Primal Species - Carnosaur 3". There are some new footage with Eric Roberts as a sheriff and his busty sidekick running to look confused, scared or trying to (badly) convey on the emotional scale, but how can they respond to something filmed a few years earlier? . The producers (yes Roger Corman, I'm talking about you!) Even went to hire 2 people from Carnosaur to play some parts, so that creepy deadlocks can be reused! So this movie is the cheapest of the cheapest. Watch the 3 original movies, there are no Oscar winners, but they have some merit and entertainment, but avoid "Raptor". Oh, it also has the most sensible sex scene that runs for almost 10 minutes! Do you think they were trying to run?
