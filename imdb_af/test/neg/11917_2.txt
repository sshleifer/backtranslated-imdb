Not really worth a review, but I think it's my duty to warn you all - especially since there are some good reviews of the Canadian bomb moving around there. Poor acting and a slow move, absolutely horrible boring. A story in which 3 boys live is turned upside down when a man appears on the way in their clubhouse in the bush. In boys, the boys do well with the intruder and he even sees him as some role model. But all these things change ... and you won't mind. You will recognize Chris Penn, whose biggest movie impact is Corky Romano, and a young Devon Sawa, whose career at Casper played. I was hoping for a '12 and Holding ',' The War 'or' Lie 'and all I got was a waste of time. This movie struggles to keep the audience's attention and never impacts or notes anything remotely interesting.
