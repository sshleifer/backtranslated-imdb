I saw this movie on a public service channel yesterday. They advertised it as a terrible movie, and so I drew it to see it, and I didn't let go. <br /> <br /> A group of 18-19 years old goes to an excavation site at an old viking castle in Denmark, trying to uncover the myth of the Berserker Vikings. Strange things happen: something is in the forest, and people are beginning to disappear. <br /> <br /> The main thing about this movie that really bother me is that the story is supposed to be in Denmark, where I live. There were so many places in the movie where the Hollywood style overlaps the Danish reality. It really made the play and drama in my eyes ridiculous. <br /> <br /> You never see the characters interacting with any of their environment. It feels like a mini Hollywood in Denmark, and it takes away the credibility of the movie. When you hear at one point that someone is talking "old Danish", it sounds exactly like today's Swedish. Really bad research, taking into account the director, comes from Denmark. <br /> <br /> The characters in the movie use GPS and maps, and it's really funny as Denmark is about the size of your backyard. Nominate where you are, there is never more than 50km to the sea and 500m to civilization. And if you're at a castle, there will be tourists everywhere. We see many reviews of forests in the movie, and sometimes we see what North American vegetation appears to be? The story didn't really address me, maybe because the play was so bad. When the characters see the sheep for the first time, they are not even scared. I think their acting skills were insufficient to show realistic emotions. At the end there was an unexpected turn, but it didn't impress me, because I didn't really care. <br /> <br /> The beef is cheap, but they have the possibility of being scary. Unfortunately, they fail because we see a good look at them in the forest when the characters arrive at the castle. Also, there aren't many scary scenes, as the Shocks are mostly just around. <br /> <br /> Anyway, conclusion: The fact that the facts are not taken into account is the movie that is your typical B horror movie. I think people from other countries can enjoy it more. As long as you are not aware of reality, it does not matter. Just as I think of the USA as one big action movie, everyone else can think of Denmark as a forest with a castle .. and some living dead in a swamp ..
