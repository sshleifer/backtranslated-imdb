This movie was ridiculous from the start. Let me save you all the time from the movie. A woman selling maize liquor to locals takes her cousin or cousin and he convinces her to open a cafe from her home. She does and she and the cousin get close. There is later a scene where his lips close with him. Later, the woman finds an old boyfriend coming back from prison and his time between them, leading to an occasional fist fight in the cafe. The woman's cousin is captivated by the man. The end was terrible, the story was terrible, and if I could waste the time on this movie, I would appreciate it. A certain ship.
