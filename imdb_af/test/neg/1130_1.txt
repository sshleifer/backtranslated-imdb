I watched this movie last night, and let me say, it's the worst thing I've ever seen. The whole movie is a train wreck, and it's not the actors. This is the terrible writing. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ** Well, Eddie loses her job to a monkey. His nerdy son was disappointed. The bathroom is crazy. <br /> <br /> He gets a free holiday. He joins Uncle Nick and the original Audry. Collapse their boats. They live on an island. They are stupid and do not even look at the nearby hotel. <br /> <br /> OK, so it is. What makes this movie pathetic is the humor. It's so terrible, hillybillyish and stupid, you can't even laugh. And it's not funny funny humor either. I couldn't laugh at the whole thing.
