This is an adaptation of an Edith Wharton work, whose writing is incredible. Unfortunately, this film never shoots the feeling that these 20th-century filmmakers do not understand the 19th century repression and despair. Wharton's work portrays it. Ward and Dalton are not that bad, but Alicia Witt's timber performance made me win. She had to play the restless element of the story, but she had stood the whole movie like a stick, and I never believed a word from her mouth. When she asks Sela Ward, "Why can't I move you?" By the end of the movie I couldn't help but replied, "That's what I've been wondering for the last hour and a half !!!"
