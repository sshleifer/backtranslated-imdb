More from a character study than a movie, COMMITTED is yet another relationship skirt with the pruning specifically made for a young target audience. The direction seems very basic, with obvious dramatic irony and a classic case of the lost loser to the clueless committed. Contracted is sometimes looked at and there is a small sense of originality from Lisa Krueger. <br /> <br /> COMMUNITY is completely aimless for the first twenty minutes. We learn Joline, but the movie comes up when her husband disappears. Joline sat down to get him. <br /> <br /> Some parts are strange. Other times the movie is dragging. The second half is more humorous as we see that Joline's spiritual antiquity is making the stronger turn. The annoying guitar music is terrible, but perhaps an essential evil, since GEVRA offers very little anyway. An average movie hampered by some totally useless moments, COMMITTED's only asset is Heather Graham and Patricia Velazquez.
