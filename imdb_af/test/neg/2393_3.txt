Oddball Black-Comedy romance with a big role and a less than star script. Brenda Blethyn ("Lovely & Amazing") is the title character 'Betty', a woman trapped in a loveless marriage to a man who apparently has a relationship with his beautiful blonde secretary. Guess who plays this little role, yup! Naomi Watts ("Mulholland Drive") must be plugged into this project before her superstar status with the solid thriller "The Ring." Be sure. <br /> <br /> On the masculine side of the roll list, the abused Alfred Molina ("Frida") is an old-fashioned entrepreneur who suddenly decides to reveal his desires for "Betty", which has been dormant for decades. . Perhaps Miramax will hope Molina's innings will be a bit of interest in this little trinket on the DVD rental board in the upcoming "Spider-Man 2". <br /> <br /> But the wildest ungrateful achievement award goes to Christopher Walken ("Catch me if you can"), which goes all the way over as a modern entrepreneur with his Las Vegas funerals in a small provincial town. His character must have picked up in the town because there is little reason for him to exist in this scripture. <br /> <br /> That said, if you'd like to see some top-notch actors, then with a low-hint humor you should be this one for you, and if it's not your cup of tea Then try "renting Harold and Maude", the ultimate funeral movie that is still funny until today.
