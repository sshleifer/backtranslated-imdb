I was an extra on this movie but wish I wasn't because she was junk. The worst thing about this movie is the music, but the acting, mini-dissertation, editing, directing and story is also terrible. The main reason it is bad is that the budget is so low and the only way to make good film on a low budget is to have a good writing. The writing that had to be done before the film was not funny, I didn't even laugh. What made me laugh is how makers probably think the most important thing is to make the film, which cares about its total junk. the movie needs about a million pounds more budget and a better writer. The only reason I didn't give the movie one out of ten is because I've been sorry for the man who's going to lose a few hundred adults. If you're going to look, make sure you were drunk. ha ha
