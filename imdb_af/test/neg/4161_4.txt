We are in a not so distant future, globalization seems to reach a high point, languages ​​mix with each other (although English dominates the rest), races have merged, human cloning is a fact and the whole area is divided into two zones: one for the valid and one for the non-valid ... a brave new world (in Aldous Huxley's style) in which people are genetically filed and blood relations strictly prohibited (for health reasons - this is the code 46 of the title). In such an environment, two souls who are not destined to meet fall in love with each other. <br /> <br /> Winterbottom had an important story, with quite a lot of potential. A nice recipe he ruins, gives it such a slow rhythm, tells it so tired, removes any emotions ... Cold, that's all Code 46 transmit. Coldness and boredom. Not even the presence of Samantha Morton and Tim Robbins (they both play their roles wonderfully), and the visual and sound of some rows can also do nothing to save the movie. What a pity. <br /> <br /> Code 46: what could have been and never was. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 4/10
