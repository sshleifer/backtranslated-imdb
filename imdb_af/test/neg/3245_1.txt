If you've seen this movie, you'll know it's one of the worst Bollywood movies ever made. Bollywood is known to copy Hollywood movies. Who will be aware that they will copy Terminator 2. The difference between both film industries is Hollywood spending millions and Bollywood spending 100 thousand (on average). That's the problem with this movie, if you want to make a T2 style movie, do it properly. The director added a fake fantasy story about a reincarnated snake that killed his long-lost girl (in the previous birth) with 2 guys, but blamed up to 10 people. She suddenly reincarnated in a ghost and together they want to kill the 10 people who are guilty of her death. However, the Reincarnation snake or cork has a kind of superpower. He can turn into anything, he can fly, disappear, fire, wind, call it, he has it. He even gets bazooked and survives the T1000 style. You probably wonder how he survived. its best not to ask, and its best not to waste time and money on this movie. His best just to forget this movie even came out. I think it's a shame to use big stars for this outrageous movie with a nonsense story.
