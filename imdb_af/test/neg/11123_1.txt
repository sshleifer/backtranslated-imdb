Chupacabra: Dark Waters must be one of the most undisputed moronic films ever made. I expected at least some entertaining entertainment because John Rhys Davies was involved, and after I watched this movie, I can honestly say that I greatly reduced my opinion of Mr Davies. <br /> <br /> Why? The acting is incredibly poor. An excellent actor such as Davies had asked more about the cast and the director. It was painfully clear that Mr. Davies just watched and hoped the check would not refuse. To say he just showed up would be an understatement. But at least he turned up. The rest of the movie looks like they have submitted it from their respective posts at the various Los Angeles restaurants, where they work as waiters. Talk about a cast of unknowns! This is the kind of cast that never appears in movies again. They act as if they had auditioned while waiting at the unemployment office. <br /> <br /> What about the special effects? Shop bought fireworks, Styrofoam, a cheap rubber suit and CGI effects that look like they come from my 1980 Atari Game. I saw some terrific special effects used on Sci-Fi Channel movies, but these things look like cut and paste made by someone's child at the nursery school. I expected Mr. Crabs and Sponge Bob would appear at the end of the Chupacabra. Not to mention that all the accounts of the creature describe it as a small gremlin-like critter. It would be a good movie for a Leprechaun-like character. Instead, we get a gigantic contingent that is shown to run with ridiculous stop-action effects. The chupacabra is in one place and then it moves at super speed in the hall and it's worth a few laughing just to see it.
