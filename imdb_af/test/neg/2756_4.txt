I've seen the MST3K version of this movie and it's a bad movie - but it's not as bad as the low IMDB score (currently 1.8 out of 10). At least the movie has some production values ​​and it apparently has a competent editor (as opposed to the movies that are really awful). The primary problem with this movie is that it has no attractive characters at all. The main character, Marv, is so pathetic in common, that he almost asks for all the bad things that happen to him. And he's not very clever either, or he'd come out to stay away from the girl Betty. And even more pathetic than Marv is his father, who is nothing but a drunk loser. The highlight of the movie is the heist series at the end, but even it is so poorly executed, any excitement it added to the movie is completely lacking. At least this movie made for a very funny MST3K episode, as Mike and the 'Bots make a good job of enjoying it.
