Let's look. This movie is a lot of things for different people. For Finns, as shown by the comment, it can be OK or awful or boring. For others, this may be something else. First, if you don't speak Finnish, you will understand half what is going on, since captions are terrible and even the title is incorrectly translated ("Paha maa" will probably be translated idiomatically as Badlands in English). <br /> <br /> Why didn't I like it? Being a Tarantino style, it only takes a very hard reality and throws it back as brutally as possible. However, I'm not American, so I'm not very fond of this process, because all that means is that the director can't really say anything new. Technical skill (camera work is brilliant), writing (not so original) saves this movie from the bottom where it belongs. If you want to see a Finnish movie, go to any of the Kaurism√§ki brothers' movie that fits talent and live skills, with many good actresses and actors. <br /> <br /> This director should review his intention and priorities: no one was understandable and so this movie failed. Not looking at it, you won't miss much.
