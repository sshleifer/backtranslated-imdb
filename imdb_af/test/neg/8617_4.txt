There is a good story that is well hidden and never really used! <br /> <br /> The film is short and overly dependent on action and thematic photography; somehow, character and story development is forgotten. What remains is clogged and superficial. Switch off your brain and look? You will probably find that time is fast enough, but unless you are the kind of person who finds sails deep and meaningful, you will not get any real satisfaction from this movie. <br /> <br /> Just look if you have nothing better to do and then pay only for someone else for the video rental.
