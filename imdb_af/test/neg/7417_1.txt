It definitely looks like an amateur hour. How this piece has ever been released is beyond me: the play, the story, the characters, the so-called special effects, etc. This is ALL wrong. Why Lance Henriksen accepted it remains one of the great mysteries of the theater. Perhaps he had an urgent need for money, or perhaps it was under the influence of an illegal drug. <br /> <br /> Explaining this movie is senseless. It's about the great legend, but done in the worst possible way. In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs! 0 * out of 10 *
