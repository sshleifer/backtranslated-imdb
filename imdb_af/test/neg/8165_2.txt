Maybe it's getting better. I will not know. I did it through the first twenty minutes before I cut it down and entered a mourning. It was clear that the plot itself was a celebrity. A man, Paul LeMatt, a professor of entymology in Columbia, drives his dog to a small town in Ohio looking for his former wife, Diana Scarwid. There he meets people who also ignore or are hostile to him. Oh, they may smile, but there's something at the bottom. <br /> <br /> This kind of arrangement is home to movie makers and viewers, and it is pregnant with possibilities. You can point out a neatly signed commercial success like 'Bad Day at Black Rock'. Or it would have made a good "Twilight Zone" section, and probably make it. <br /> <br /> The movie also includes some seasoned artists, as well as some previously prominent names. Kenneth Toby, a veteran of science fiction, is the superficially lovely motel driver. Princess Scarwid can deliver an impressive performance, as she said, "Silkwood." For some, their size is limited. <br /> <br /> But it is poorly targeted and sharply written. <br /> <br /> Example of loose direction. The dog of LeMatt's is not neglected by Kenneth Toby, just outside the bat. So when LeMatt walks to the street, Toby sneaks up the window of his room, looks at the dog, and some juice. Cut to LeMatt in the street. He heard his dog cry. Then a POV shot of presumably the dog that drowned at LeMatt, then passed him while the wind was blowing and LeMatt gaws at the camera. Cut to an identical shot - come from the other side! Whatever the camera represents, regardless of what LeMatt is staring at, is never shown. Maybe it was nothing, because suddenly the wind stops and LeMatt is alone in the street and looks a little confused. "You never had to bring the dog in the first place," says a smiling Toby from the stoep. Question: What is hell in that scene? <br /> <br /> Example of loose writing. Well, TWO examples. (1) If you sit down and write a stereotypical waitress in a small village, without any work of any craft, you will sit down with a gum, under the tables, with an expressionless babe with her hair on her head. Right. (2) Anything similar to credibility is thrown out of the window in favor of special effects. LeMatt's car is quiet, then explodes while waiting at the garage. Pull to a halt: credible. Explode: Supernatural. Not even Edgar Allan Poe will endorse such an event. <br /> <br /> And the invaders themselves? Think of a modest masterpiece such as "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." Something goes wrong in dr. Kevin McCarthy's small town, and it takes half the movie for the mystery to be unraveled, and builds all the time span and doubts grow. Here, twenty minutes in the movie, a stranger walks in a motel room and tears off his plastic face, revealing a pulsating, shiny, naked brain. The pregnancy is stopped. <br /> <br /> I won't tell you the end, because I don't know what it is, and I don't care either. I think it has something to do with insects, because why would Paul LeMatt be an enthusiast? (Incidentally, who's going to handle his classes?) But I'm not even sure insects were involved. It is quite possible that the error business was unconditional. The authors might have made him an insect specialist and then forget about it all. It won't surprise me.
