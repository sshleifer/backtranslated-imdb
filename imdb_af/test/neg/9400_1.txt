Yes, I really found this movie unpleasant. <br /> <br /> I didn't like the Sandra Oh character, she really irritated me. It is unlikely that she will be accepted into rural Italian life because she is non-white. It was a bit of PC nonsense. <br /> <br /> The film is also offensive to Italian men. For example, one man she (Diane Lane) has a relationship seems to be a caddish cheat. But guess what: in the end, your typical plastic American brick, all the white and white smiles and browns, finally finds what she wants: a real American man, and now she has another part of the world. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film is quite racist in the portrayal of Italians and the way it subjects them to smarmy lotharios or backward farmers. <br /> <br /> Photography was good, but the movie and its attitude were trash.
