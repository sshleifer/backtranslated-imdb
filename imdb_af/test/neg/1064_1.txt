There is nothing original, human or insightful in this movie. The acting is average, images are amateurish, the writing is subtle and the scenes are very basic ... something close to a soap. <br /> <br /> In 2:37 a suicide is used to turn the movie into a thrill drama. We look partly because we want to know who is dying. The different characters each have a problem, and the movie shows how bad each problem is to them, but only a way to get them to a place where you think they can kill themselves. Despite the different views the camera offers on key events, there is NO other way to see the events themselves. So in 2:37 is the asshole ass, the angels are angels. These are simple things. <br /> <br /> Without this complexity, the film emerges as a voyeuristic story of youth sex and violence. You know the children as little as the breasts, bodies and limps that the filmmaker runs as characterization. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you know something about film in the last 5 years, 2:37 is just an immature ripe of Elephant - not a meditation, not a progression. Although the filmmaker and distributor use the alleged suicide of a friend to give the film a legitimacy, they never talk about Gus Van Sant or Elephant. The positive posts on IMDb remarkably do not avoid it, or simply do not appreciate originality. If you want something with heart and voice - avoid this exploitation of the youth. I was surprised by the filmmaker's age when I found out after I saw this movie - I assumed that a 13-year-old made it. The Twenty Somethings I have always known are too busy pushing something into them to lift the work of an old man.
