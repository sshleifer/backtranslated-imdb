C.H.O.M.P.S. is much like a number of cute late 70's Disney family comedys-The Cat of Outer Space or Unidentified Flying Oddball, for example. Completely without something creative, the same cliches beat to death, but vaguely entertaining in a sensible way. The actors will not win awards, including the director, writer or FX crew, but in his inadvertent nest and mere predictability, there are some vague entertainment. The idea of ​​the robot dog as a security system is as full of holes as you can use it as a radiator. The incredibly repetitive disco soundtrack will stay in your head, so beware.
