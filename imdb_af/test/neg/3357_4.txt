Sheba Shayne (Pam Grier) receives a telegram informing her that her father may be in trouble. Sheba, a private investigator and former police spokesperson, goes to her father's help. But somebody won't stop running her father out of pocket. An attempt to show their muscles goes wrong and Saba's father is shot in cold blood. These guys messed up the wrong woman. <br /> <br /> If I had to describe Sheba Baby, Pam Grier Lite is the best I can do with a very bad play. For a Pam Grier movie, Sheba Baby is incredibly tame. It's not as violent anywhere as some of her previous films. Going on the overnight images of Pam that puts a tiny revolver or razor blades in her afro. Pilot (D'Urville Martin) and his crew can't keep up with some of the real villains Pam confronted in her previous movies. It's strictly at-the-numbers and has almost a TV feel. As for the bad plays, the bad things that Pam faces are as unnatural as in my delivery, as I have seen. As a result, characters like Pilot don't come across as threatening as they should or need for the movie to work. <br /> <br /> That's not to say there are no moments or elements in the Sheba Baby that I didn't enjoy (Pam in a law pack and Pam that turns a spear weapon on), that's exactly when Compared to Pam's other films such as Coffy, Foxy Brown, and even Friday. Foster that the movie failed. <br /> <br /> One final observation - maybe I'm just more sensitive to these things after 9/11, but I don't even remember a time, even in the 70s security slot, if you're wearing a canon bag on a plane. When Saba flies to her father's help, she packed an arsenal into her luggage!
