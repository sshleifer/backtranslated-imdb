If you're not a fan of the 80's and you have to lead a particularly strong fan or one of the two, there's nothing about this movie to recommend. <br /> <br /> The story, as others said, is boring, almost an afterthought about the basic idea of ​​the characters and the idea of ​​making a slightly manic comedy. I watched it for about an hour, hoping it would turn a corner, a bend would occur or it would somehow kick in the gear, but no ... It's not incompatible, it's not boring. It continues. It continues with bits that rotate, angry shots in strange corners, scabby bits, but I didn't have a real sense of energy or manic fun, it just as forced. Needless to say, there was nothing to laugh at. A little light entertainment here or there, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the mention of feminism by the way, though in this case virtually all the headdresses are feminine. If it's something, it's actually working. Two females are doing well, excellent, the drug dealer is female, okay, their landlord is a landlady, okay, their friends are female, okay, the only other person we particularly see who lives. the same building, oh woman ... I was not on the lookout, but after a while it felt like a conscious decision was made to throw the movie that way and it felt a little forced again. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, if you're a fan of 80's fashions and culture, there's plenty to see. If you're a fan of Helen Slater, it's fun and fun to watch. There is also some screen time for Carol Kane, who is wonderful but not enough. <br /> <br /> Overall: 3/10. If you are a big fan of the 80's, Helen Slater and Carol Kane, you might be able to stretch it for a 5 because it is still a comedy that is not funny, which greatly hinders it. If you're not a fan of things, you might as well make 0 because there is nothing else to enjoy here.
