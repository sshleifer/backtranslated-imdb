My husband brought this home to the video store so I could see something while I was sick. The kind of sick one you could never concentrate on a book, but a kind of foolish, light, romantic movie just sounds right (it and a bowl of chicken soup). Well, he means well. <br /> <br /> My first thought (as some others also post here) was that the house should be false ... it's not just isolated on the beach, loose sand, and so close to the sea that the Fire waves go directly under the house! It seems so dangerous (in hurricane land, in the case), so potentially disastrous that I was sure movie makers just had CGI'd the whole thing (or use movie magic to pick a cute B&B in the surf). <br /> <br /> But I have to say to you, thanks to "inter-webs", I can say that the house, Serendipity, is very real, is indeed near Rodanthe, except for some window decoration and shrubs it mostly like it does in the movie. You can rent it yourself, out of season, for $ 1710 per week (or about $ 3850 in summer)! Go for it! But ... interesting, the house has serious problems. The second thing that struck me after washing was "What about the plumbing / electrical? In that surf?" And sure enough, "Serendipity" was condemned for a break in sanitation caused by oceanic storms. (They were rebuilt.) <br /> <br /> And the house is not of the "Civil War". Not to mention that Viola Davis, who plays the "cliché black best friend" (ungrateful role for a good actress, was last seen in "Doubt"), is not old enough that her grandmother could have built something in the Civil War! Hello! It was 150 years ago! Try Fantastic-BIG! (In fact, "Serendipity" was built in 1988.) The basic film was built on a typical Nicholas Sparks weeper, which means very coincidental and predictable event. It is also aimed at a very pandering way for women. You know us, women who love B & B's, fiery antique and knick-knacks. They dream of romance and guys who look like Richard Gere and in the moonlight dance. Don't give us plot, or thoughtful character development; Just set up a few mechanisms and introduce love scenes! <br /> <br /> Gere plays a plastic surgeon who lost a female patient during a routine operation for a benign cyst on her cheek. Of course she died of an overdose of ANESTHESIA, so you are immediately wondering why the surgeon was convicted and not the anesthetist! Hello! where is the man? Why did the wrong doctor feel guilty? <br /> <br /> Gears have come to pout and confront the woman's husband, and stay at the remote B & B ... who should be there, why the ANY OTHER PERSON IN THE INN ... Diane Lane! She is a lonely divorce, with rotten children, and an ex-husband who wants her back. As she decides to decide, the cliché's best black friend has her experience as a hostess at the B&B. <br /> <br /> Now, in the real world, if this setup ever happened, the doctor will Looks like Ernest Borgnine ... and the lonely divorce, like Rosie O'Donnell. He spent his holidays on the beach at the 22-year-old girls while she was choking and thinking of going on a diet. But this is not the real world; I'm leaving. <br /> <br /> The couple confess everyone, fall in love, a hurricane hits ... they make love, fall in love, he has to get away, he dies and she cries a lot about it. The end. <br /> <br /> There I saved you from it; Now you don't have to torture yourself or any male acquaintances (men, boys, boyfriends) to sit through these trips. Very tired. <br /> <br /> Someone else asked why Diane Lane, a perfect little woman (who seems to love filmmakers to throw, because she's just pretty and thin enough that most women want to look after her but she's 45ish and not top-of-the-line, so she's not threatening) is constantly covered in big sailing shawls. It would make sense if she was chubby, but she wasn't. <br /> <br /> Anyway, somebody throws a nice paisley shawl over this movie. So we don't have to look at it. Conclusion: Read a book unless you are too sick. If it is too sick, go to bed.
