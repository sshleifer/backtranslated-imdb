I have never had the need to add a review to this site, but I just sat by the movie. I found it necessary to warn parents who might think of their children. Please do not! It's not a Disney movie. This movie tells us "life is cruel" and if you show it to your children, you are, in my opinion, too. <br /> <br /> The video box describes the movie as a "pleasure for all ages" and the IMDb plot sketch describes it as a "family movie". I just had to find a definition of "family movie" and found the following: "It usually comes from comedies or adventures. These films are often based on children's literature and can include any number of helpful animals, friendly supernatural creatures and fantasy worlds. which is set to stimulate and address the imagination. Whatever the situation, there is little or no offensive material and generally a lesson is learned. "Not an appropriate description of Tarka The Otter, which contains quite a few unpleasant scenes, totally inappropriate for young children, and an end that qualifies the film as a bad movie. The lesson learned? As I said, life is cruel. Family entertainment? I do not think so. Unless you hate your family, it is. <br /> <br /> Another review, more revealing than this, but worth reading, can be found by following the "external reviews" link.
