It was so USED! No plot at all! Actually, a watered down version of the Lion King is mixed with Animal Farm. Again, no plot. Awful! Bad hours and a half of my life! Oh my gosh! I had to walk out of the theater for a few minutes to get some relief! I visited twice. All the semi-funny parts are in the forefront. I hate movies like that. Yes, the movie sucked. I don't know how it got such good ratings and reviews. THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE !! If you are going to watch this movie, bring a pillow or a girl / boyfriend to keep you busy. Awful. I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and had it so little. It was good that the tickets cost just five dollars, because I would be angry if I paid $ 7.50 to see this shit.
