Egads. <br /> <br /> I thought Keannu Reeves was the worst actor in Hollywood. I'm not so sure, Willy gives Keannu some solid competition with his "I'm made of plaster" performance in this movie. <br /> <br /> Mix it with the fact that there is virtually no plot, and not a Natasha tries her best, but even Julia Roberts could not save this movie from ambiguity. <br /> <br /> Avoid it unless it's not so. it is very late and there is nothing else. -Oh hey, just read a book in that case.
