this movie is not that good, but it is good if you just want to laugh because it's pretty ridiculous :) there are many mistakes and it's cheesy. I did this movie for Christmas like 5 years ago, but for some reason I never gave it up. I think I just like it for a rainy day, although I only see it once a year. It's a 90-year-old movie, so it's really funny to see how everyone is dressing and acting. this movie is good for someone young ... although i think about it, i didn't even like it when i was like 12, but it's just my personal opinion. the movie was really predictable. I wish it had some strange twists, but I think it was an appropriate movie that everyone should enjoy. I think it was suitable for the whole family, but Hallie's dress was a bit uncomfortable, but definitely enough for family material.
