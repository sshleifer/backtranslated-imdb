Was a college acting class filmed and released as a movie? The formal attitude and styling of a "horror" soap opera for people who do not want horror movies, but would like to tell the friends, yes, they have seen a horror movie. It even contains soap opera music. <br /> <br /> Don't scare books falling from library shelf? Do the doors save your doors? Then this movie is for you. Have you ever been kidnapped? Yes, most of us have. When raped, was it simply ignored because the rapist was the cool kid? What is scary is not this movie, but this filmmaker's view of the world. <br /> <br /> And then the little bends aren't even original. This is a movie for people who have never seen a horror movie, who do not want to see one now and want to see another movie about everyone who merges with the strange child.
