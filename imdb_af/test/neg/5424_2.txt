There isn't really that much wrong with Crash of the Moons. Actually, it's a few episodes of Rocky Jones, Space Ranger merged into a movie. However, it is extremely dated. Winky's treatment of Vena is a good example of this. One should remember that it had to be shown to children in the 1950s. In this respect it succeeds. If you like children's sci-fi's from the 1950s, go ahead and watch. You will see John Banner in a pre-sgt. Schultz role. He does a good job in it. All in all, I give it a 6 out of 10. Not great, but not bad.
