Mostly forgetful monster film from the fifties contains really terrible special effects. The particular claw is a giant puppet that would make Jim Henson kill himself. I only saw the movie last Thursday and I can't even tell you who was in it. This is a bad sign. I was told that when the film premieres were audible, it was laughing off the screen .... and it was in the 50's when special effects standards were much lower. Actually, I had to walk out of the theater as soon as the words "produced by Sam Katzman" got on the screen when I knew what was good for me, but then I sat through "Harum Scarum". So I think I deserve it.
