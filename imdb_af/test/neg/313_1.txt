I can't believe I even wasted a NetFlix rental on this full piece of CRAP. How long did it take to make this movie? 15 minutes? On a budget of what? Fifteen dollars? I can spend a few hours with my Sony Camcorder and build something better than this treacherous bunch of bells, and it's even available on DVD !? !! A very sad thing to think of classics like The Stepfather is not yet released on DVD, but this piece of steaming mist makes it the format. Here is the hope that my rating of ONE ONE ONE will make the overall (overall) pathetic rating of 2.5 AF.
