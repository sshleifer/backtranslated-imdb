I'm too drained to write this review - bad movies always do it for me - but I feel compelled to warn someone who might consider this godly debris of a picture, as if it were my social duty. Please, please, just take my word: this is one you want to stay away from. It is so boring and boring, so unsatisfactory and uninspired, such a poor excuse to collect any famous talent. Burt Reynolds? Thrown (despite his best efforts). Ice-T is scarce in the film, and when he appears on the screen, his performance is held in such a way that it becomes clear that the director, perhaps intimidated by Ice's intense stare, did not know what to do with him. . Rob Lowe, as the title character, has never shown little charisma on the screen. Mario Van Peebles must be ashamed of himself; His performance is, in the worst sense possible, a joke. Certainly, Satan himself signed Mario's check for this movie. The plot is as weak, half-baked and annoying as all the music in question (the completely boring club song literally seems to continue for the first third of the movie). The movie's appearance will seriously wonder if the Director of Photography is also forced, like one of the film's forgotten female characters, to crack from a pipe channel to his mouth. And at least looking for stylized, shooting-an-up violence, you get nothing here. This movie, I assure you, I promise you, has absolutely no redeeming qualities! Please, I beg you, Avoid this movie! Don't put it in and struggle to believe its pace will pick up, it'll get better and develop into a decent denial. It won't. It doesn't. It can't! It sucks! Now you're warned, and I can go to bed now. (It's 3:00 - please forgive any errors this admonition may contain). Know that my conscience is clear, because I have done my civil duty for my fellow man!
