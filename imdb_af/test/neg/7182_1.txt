Another example we have to stay away from doing spectacular action movies in Sweden does not work, except for Widerbergs' yet unsurpassed MEN ON TAKET. Stormers do the best he can, I think, and some scenes are slightly effective, but the plot is full of holes. Why does Hamilton continue the attack on the base, knowing that his wife is being held hostage? It was nice to see Mark Hamill, but his Bad Guy part was very much endorsed. I am constantly surprised that relatively large Swedish films like this are made without a meaningful, functional script. 1 out of 5.
