What about mathematical geniuses that make the critics' juices flow? A BEAUTIFUL MIND was not too much in my opinion (FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING earned the Oscar that year), while GOOD WILJAG made several awards for it. <br /> <br /> First, the script is. When I attended film school, I said GOOD WILL BE A VERY GOOD Sample of not starting a script and the tutor was right. This movie has no opening shake type and is usually very slow. If you wrote an unsolicited script like this, the writer would have given it on page 15. <br /> <br /> Structure apart from the idea of ​​a member of the American subclass, a kind of intellectual god is not really true. Ask yourself: If he is the smartest character in the movie, does he come through his short life without anyone noticing his abilities? Not a single teacher of his childhood noticed his gift? Highly unlikely, such as the fact that he read so read to extend the literate. And if Will come so smart, is he so unaware of what happens to young, beautiful guys in US prisons? <br /> <br /> But that's the deciding factor that leaves much to the film. You want to get some actors to play rough, tough Irish gangsters? Let's get Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, who are like playing Russell Crowe a pacifist or Charles Bronson to play a liberal yolk. I didn't convince myself of the dirty mouth Damon and Affleck, because they struggled to get people in the paddles and couldn't help thinking that although they wrote the script, the parts had to be allocated to different actors. Finally, Billy Bob Thornton has written screens for movies he hasn't entered and the same criteria should be applied here <br /> <br /> There are some good points to the movie. Robin Williams is excellent as the man trying to show. Will its potential and also be very good, Stellan Skarsgard, which is just one of the biggest character players who went outside Europe and despite my previous criticism of the script, there is quite a bit of dialogue at the park like the Williams character states that he wants what he has seen in life <br /> <br /> But I have to repeat that there are fewer points than negative for this movie and I have to agree with the people who said they WANT GOOD I am boring and unconvincing
