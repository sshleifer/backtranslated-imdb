I accidentally overcame this movie and wish I didn't. <br /> <br /> Why make a sexually rude successor (and a bit of a man being beheaded) from a well-known children's movie. <br /> <br /> Don't take young children to see it, the title misleads you, it has nothing to do with the original Snow White except to steal it. Better still, don't bother yourself, it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> I couldn't see it all, the poor (compared to Disney) cartoon graphics, and no plot, except on how to completely solve it a classic movie made me stop and leave .
