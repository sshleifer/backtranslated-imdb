My grandfather gave me this DVD. With friends like this. The cover looks rather scary, I'll see it. What a bloody mistake. <br /> <br /> Basically, the movie follows three people on a bus and what happens to them with friends. <br /> <br /> The first one is about a man who buys a car talking to him. The second is about a man waking up to find a checkout clone in his fridge. And the third is about a woman who does online dating, but it seems he has a robotic arm. <br /> <br /> The DVD case evaluated this movie 18 but even a 5 year old can see it and not frighten or entertain. The film should be 12 for light scare stories and the swear word bloody. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is absolutely not near.
