Although my preference is usually not for romantic plays, this film left me a little short. <br /> <br /> It had promise, the characters and relationships could be explored much deeper than they did, but the story didn't seem <br /> <br /> The comparisons and parallels in the story Especially the three generations of women in the family had much potential, but somehow did not fully expand. It could make the movie much easier to endure and attach to the purpose of a movie about lost love and life. <br /> I think the movie had a lack of direction in The Writing, although Harry Connick Jnr and Sandra Bullock were trying to desperately try to create some life in otherwise flat character lines. <br /> <br /> It's not that it's a bad movie, some parts make you understand the reasons for various plot developments, it's just that this movie is subdued, and a bit flat overall .
