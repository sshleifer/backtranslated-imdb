In the ring it was a videotape; a site was the problem in Feardotcom; the danger in wrist comes from computers; and phone and a missed call featured? you consulted it ?? deadly phones. In Stay Alive, the piece of technology that causes all sorts of problems, is an online game: those who play it die soon. How smart! <br /> <br /> Targeted by William Brent Bell (who?), and with an insignificant role of twenty somethings you may have seen before, but probably can't remember where or what hell is their name is , it is a highly derivative piece of film making aimed at the PG-13 horror set square; seasoned scary movie watchers will undoubtedly find Alive very boring, highly predictable and not least scary. <br /> <br /> The poorly-developed plot follows a group of gamers with extremely daily names (October, Loomis, Phineus, Hutch and Swink!) who are trying to unravel the mystery behind the deadly game before they become victims as well. . Eventually they discover that it is the evil spirit of legendary Countess Elizabeth Bathory who is killing all who dare to play and that their only hope of survival can continue with the game. <br /> <br /> With a story as stupid as that, viewers should expect a movie with a loose ending aplenty, not one iota of logic (which made the game, how and why it is never explained) , very little in the way of scared or gore, and a stupid closing scene to open the door to God? Prevent a successor.
