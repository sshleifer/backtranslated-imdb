Well, people, this is another stereotypical portrayal of Gay life, but the added downside is a poor acting, horrible writing, no budget, terrible sound and let's not forget the impossible story. <br /> <br /> It is Christmas in New York City and our story immediately "focuses on" two male individuals, apparently lovers for some time. One of them did not allow his parents (the right wing, religious eternal types) to know that he was gay (add to the inexplicability of the story because this guy is equally important as gay guys come) and his parents come to reflect him . They will stay in his New York apartment where he and his lover just decorated Christmas. <br /> <br /> The story continues to evolve around the arrival of the parents, who no one will like anyway and - by just plain and predictable ways - they come there to learn, boy is gay. Tears are rinsed off as it was my interest in this movie. <br /> <br /> The role players were like an intro-active course at the local community theater. The lovers in this movie are not matched, and there does not seem to be any unity for their union. <br /> <br /> The landlord is flat and her attempt to be humanistic in the situation is undercooked and certainly doesn't help the plot further. <br /> <br /> The dragqueen friend who, in his "time of need," after the help of one of the loved ones, is stereotypical and gives a bad name to the unique drama. <br /> <br /> Although some guys find one loved one to have a beautiful body (again stereotypical images), it doesn't help this story. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie, especially if you're considering a purchase. You will shoot yourself if you do it!
