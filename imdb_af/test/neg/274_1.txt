I didn't plan to watch O12, because I didn't like O11 so much. I thought O11 was a nice but slightly boring little bank robbery with a sensational arsenal of stars. Anyway, I was talking to watch O12 one night and I regret it. The plot is not only boring but also pointless. I honestly don't even know what it's all about. I left the movie after three quarters and got coffee with another girl who didn't like it. Much more fun, I can tell you. But even the guys who stayed to the end later reported that the plot was still terrible and useless. My advice: Don't look. Look at Team America (hilarious btw ;-)) and forget about Ocean's Twelve. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the most tedious and senseless peace of the crap has been on the screen for years.
