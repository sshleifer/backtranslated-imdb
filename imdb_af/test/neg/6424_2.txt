I know a few people who look like the main actress in this movie (or at least like the character she portrays.) They all give me the creep and I'll be the last person to ever lend one of them a gun or even a sharp knife. She has one meaningful and ugly expression. If you can explain a little sympathy to her, let me know. <br /> <br /> Of course I can have the same expressions of concern and fear if I had an imaginary friend who killed my real thing friends and acquaintances for the past 15 years. <br /> <br /> And for our European friends on the IMDb, I'm sad to say that, yes, some colleges and universities in the US learn paranormal phenomena, relying on the pathetic defense it represents "academic freedom "and open investigation. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth it. You will have no sympathy for any of the characters (except Aunt Lydia, who starts early) and the plot doesn't make sense.
