I don't usually like to react to the play in a movie because it's the one thing people who have agenda against a movie will go after. In this movie I will make an exception. The acting in this movie is below average around the world. I mean halfway into the movie, I wonder how hell got the producer and / or the director to cast out such an ensemble of non-performing people. Although the production value was good, the badly written story just put on top of the bad performance of the actors, and there is even a half-hearted attempt to make a turn to the end of the movie, which eventually becomes confusing. Are all the Spanish horror movies this disappointing?
