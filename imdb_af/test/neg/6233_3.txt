I have never heard of "The Clearing" until one day I was really bored with some friends in the local Blockbuster and it caught our attention. The description on the DVD jacket grabbed our interest, but as soon as we packed it into the DVD player, the boredom only started. <br /> <br /> The story has been dragged too long. It seems to follow the same summary as other movies that include a kidnapping. However, the most exciting parts were in the beginning of the movie. Then the exposition was followed exactly and it did not make "The Clearing" original. The flashbacks were too much in number and the sadness of the victim's family made nothing interesting or improved the nature of the film. And I also found that I didn't have the end of the end, so it probably meant I didn't like the movie at all. <br /> <br /> The acting wasn't terrible. However, this was not the greatest. Robert Redford has done much better. Willem Dafoe's tragic character was the only one I really saw through the storyline and the viewer saw the change in the last ten minutes or so in the movie. Helen Mirren's depiction as Robert Redford's wife was flat and followed the same kind of generic form as other movies. This includes a tragic and heartbreaking event. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "The Clearing" is nothing to rave about. Use your movie rental on something else ... like "Garden State", maybe?
