You just have to see it as a poorly executed anti-abortion propaganda and you will realize how bad it is. The main message of this movie is that even the sickest of people cannot commit an abortion. If you ask, it's not far from the emergence of abortion clinics. So this man wants to kill a poor girl, but he must convince her to do an abortion first. What a little shit. And the worst thing is that he has a convincing argument (a child in a loveless environment), but it's supposed to be dismissed because he's a freak anyway. And sharing with the Bible printers ... first they throw this girl out just because she explains that someone stole her money (that rule should be somewhere in the Bible) and then they are in the end a kind of angel like Deus Ex Machina who delivers the killer of evil by harassing him on his front. Come on. Other deviations include a very confusing scenario (and I don't mean in a good way) ... so this guy is just a few psycho why? Because his mother fed his liver once? And I don't know about the rest of you, but he looked like the most beautiful person in the world through the whole move! even though he was a dress-up, money stole and tied girls in his car. If you've forgotten the idiot story, this movie has a very good movie and Bob Hoskins was really great and it has one of those funny English cars in it. If it were actually a psycho-killer, I'd give it at least a 7.
