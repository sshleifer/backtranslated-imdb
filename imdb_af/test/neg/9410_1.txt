This movie was totally and unambiguously horrible. The plot was so predictable and boring and the writing so grim and pretentious that I finally wanted to put my eyes on the nearest pen. <br /> <br /> Normally, I don't write reviews, but I was surprised at the number of positive reviews it received. While acknowledging that the acting was good in some parts, the shortcomings of the deficit have wiped out more than decent action. The only reason I watched it was because some of my friends watched it and suggested it as probably the worst movie ever made. We were not least disappointed. The only saving grace is that it contains my new favorite bakkie line: <br /> <br /> BRANDON: I just want to get to know you. <br /> <br /> GIRL: You just want to get in my pants. <br /> <br /> BRANDON: I want in your mind, your heart, your soul. I don't see you pants in this comparison. <br /> Overall, I would rate this movie as the worst movie I've ever seen that took it seriously.
