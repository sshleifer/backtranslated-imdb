Let's get right into the heart of the matter ... It's a terrible movie. The story is confusing, the supporting role is laughing and the lead actors seem to be forced to be in it. The story asks us to believe there is an underground lesbian sex cult where members of their psychiatrist are murdered who are just a transvestite. Ellen Barkin investigates the crimes and develops a loved one on Peta Wilson whose work seems to be the cult recruiter. The sex scenes are similar to bad porn and when Barkin and Wilson kiss, Poor Ellen looks as though she has pain. Barkin's Talent is completely messed up in this B-grade sex ploy piece junk and I hope she gave her agent the pink slip after she landed her in this movie.
