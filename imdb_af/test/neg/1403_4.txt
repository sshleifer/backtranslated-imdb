This miserable psychodrama uses every broken device in the book to give us attention and sympathy for his characters, who are by no means worthy of anything, let alone two precious hours of moviegoers. <br /> <br /> As in Robert Redford's "Ordinary People" (a beautiful movie comparing the heroes of "Heroes" clearly), a late teenager died, and his family in the lap of robbery left. In this case, death was a suicide, an event that almost always poisoned the emotional stuff of the survivors in a particularly poignant way. We follow these people over the next 8 or 9 months. <br /> <br /> Father (Jeff Daniels) is a withdrawal, virtually dumb, usually drunk stiff secretly leaving his work, instead of a park bench all day long, and insists to place a full plate of food on the deceased's son for each meal. He treats everyone in the family with indifferent nastiness. He often sees his doctor, but the problem of therapeutic intervention in his obvious dysfunctional condition never arises. <br /> <br /> The mother (Sigourney Weaver) screams to the neighbor, among other things, is snapped when she foolishly tries to buy "marijuana" (her term) at a head shop (which adult will in fact ever be so) try a stupid stunt?), and near the end, sleep in a coma with a lung condition that everyone in the theater takes is cancer (she's a heavy smoker). Me. Weaver has a few flip-flops, but generally behaves too foolishly to earn much empathy. <br /> <br /> It's not that there aren't people who act in these stupid ways when stressful stressful circumstances arise. But why make a movie of such bravery? What can someone learn from this couple's behavior? <br /> <br /> The deceased's older sister (Michelle Williams) is away at college and is too happy to leave herself from the family zoo. The younger brother (played by Emile Hirsch) is the only credible member of the family. His suffering is real, it causes multiple, and his behavior is coherent within the circumstances. But Hirsch's character was spoken too softly, too morose and beaten, to wear the movie. The other little players help, subtext and wink, help in the unreal dialogue. <br /> <br /> In the case of two other minor characters, the suicide theme is recognized almost nonchalantly. So what is the writer-director, Dan Harris, trying to say about this subject? That this is not a serious matter? Why Jeff Daniels agreed to play a father's juice as written in this script is something his therapist can possibly answer. Avoid this dog. Instead, Redford's classic rents. My rating: 4/10 (C-).
