I went to see "Passion of thought" because I usually get a kick from the genre of alternative reality romance, ie "Sliding Doors", "I, Myself, I," etc. <br /> <br /> But this was the worst I have ever seen! I had to force myself to sit through it. I didn't even have the credits that were unprecedented for me. <br /> <br /> The magic realism was completely lacking because Demi Moore was grim and the loved ones she was two-timed were guys who usually play villains, although each one was sexy and attractive. <br /> <br /> There was actually a psychological explanation for the dual life, with an unpleasant frisson from The Elektra Complex; Perhaps the magic should not be explained to this genre. <br /> <br /> (originally written 5/28/2000)
