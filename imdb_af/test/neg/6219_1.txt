This movie is pathetic, not because it is poorly directed, acted, sung, danced, filmed, etc. But because it's really hard to ruin a movie with an ABBA soundtrack - unfortunately it's unfortunately the only thing the movie manages to do. . The music presentations in the film, SouthPark, were much better than in Mama Mia. The director of Mama Mia is proof that you don't need talent to be a director. All you need is ABBA songs. <br /> <br /> Just to give an example of the horror: An aging Meryl Streep is shot with close ups in the harsh sunlight singing and smelling the song with all the distracting wrinkles on her face. Why is this one of the most talented actresses out there?
