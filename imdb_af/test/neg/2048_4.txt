I just watched this movie just because Sarah and I also give these 4 stars just because of her, on the other hand. This movie was easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Theater was terrible. The writing was oninspired. It was a movie that contradicted itself. The film was sloppy and inexorable. It's not like I expected a good movie. Just something to give me a jump or two. It didn't even do that. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is, the more I think about the overall plot, the less sense it makes and the more holes we find. I'm really sorry, because I'm pretty sure there is a good idea somewhere to be there ... <br /> <br /> I might be a little hard giving the movie a 4/10, But the actors involved and again SARA obviously write talent, this film had to deliver much more. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a little bit, I can't help it. From the beginning we know it's crazy. <br /> <br /> The story, dialogue, acting, special effects, makeup, pretty much, everything sucks. I like vampire movies and I know they will never be Oscar movies, but this one is not even worth seeing, I can't believe anyone produced this thing. <br /> <br /> It's not even about vampires, it's more about a dream / reality experience. The film's development is incoherent, the motivation of the characters is ... Not exist, everything looks like a big joke. Maybe that's what they're trying to do, but I really doubt it. I wish I knew what they were trying to do, but it just fell back. It's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life (and I've seen a lot of bad movies, but nothing compared to it) Please make yourself a favor and don't look at it. <br /> <br /> PS This is also full of clich√©s! P.S. 2 Bad Scriptures, Bad Direction, Bad Cinematography. P.S. 3 I have been bothered to comment on this as a favor to everyone.
