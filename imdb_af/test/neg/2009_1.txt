Hmmm! is this the worst movie ever? Well, for some of the role players it is a pity to see them in such a movie, but hey if it pays the bills why not, as for the movie. OK and effects not too bad for such a cheap movie, music is just about OK again for a cheap movie, final credits are OK lol <br /> <br /> BAD for many to list but to throw, acting , sets, writing, ending .. what the hell, Drac .......... worst Drac EVER!, much more, but can't be bothered to put them all down. <br /> <br /> Idea was OK but needed ten times the budget and more thoughts and much better lighting and style and changed all bad points, however, I say to see this movie so you can say, "What the FU% $ it was all over "if the credits run. Also its kind of a must just see to see how bad it is.
