I'll give it: it tried. It tried to make it good and even involved Luke Wilson. Luke Wilson is good, but he can do just that. He can't make the fact that the story was very flawed and the characters were underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> The running "gag" with the bully was asinine. He was never funny and I got very tired. And the barefoot kid was also weak. He ran to Florida? Yes OK. <br /> <br /> The movie sometimes felt like an average kiddie movie with this underlined mantra: adults stupid, kids smart. And that little bit becomes laborious. <br /> <br /> But the only moments that were funny were the police car driving Wilson when he lost his team car. I loved that guy, especially when Wilson turned on the sirens. But otherwise, nothing else was worth my time. "D"
