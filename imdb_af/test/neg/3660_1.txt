I know if I was a low-budget film maker. I will probably check this page to find out what people are saying about it. So I really hope the creators of the movie really read it! I think you should find a way to pay me for the hour and a half of the life I just wasted to watch this garbage. Please stop filming about something you're probably fantasizing about. Just stop making movies all together ... you are one of the reasons why it is so difficult for India filmmakers to raise it. Do the world a favor and get a job a McDonalds or something so you can do something productive with your life! I feel like a caller to complain that they actually wore this movie in their store.
