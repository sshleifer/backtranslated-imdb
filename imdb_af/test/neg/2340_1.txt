If you are a predictive person, it will sound like a good idea to brag about your intellectuality and say that you really like this movie. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, don't bother to see anything good. <Br /> <br /> This is the stereotypical movie for snobs. The plot line will be very stupid if you can see it from start to finish. It's just being messed up as an attempt to make it difficult to understand and intellectually make the film look. <br /> <br /> Mullholland Drive is not nice to watch. You will understand much anything the first time you see it. And if you do, you'll probably be disappointed because it's not a big problem.
