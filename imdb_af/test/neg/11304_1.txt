Don't "Mr. Magoo doesn't see '. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Leslie Nielson wasn't funny in it. He's not funny since the Naked Gun movies. Well, it won't take long to find out that it's not a Naked Gun movie! The movie's plot is ridiculously foolish. Nothing in the whole movie was funny. The first few minutes of the movie are animated to watch the old Magoo cartoons. I wish the movie would have stayed that way.
