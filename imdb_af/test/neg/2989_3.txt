I have seen comments from Turkish people (which I do not) say that this movie is fantastic and accurately portrays Turkish life. All I have to say is ... Turkey has to be one of the most boring and depressing places in the world, because that is exactly what this movie was for me. If I were Turkish, I think it would have had a bigger impact. But if you are not from Turkey, I would recommend not wasting two hours of your life on this. <br /> <br /> "Far" seems to be delaying forever. Many scenes are long lasting with little or no purpose. I do not understand the director's goals in even, but also many of the screens. It is pointed out that the director used his own car, apartment and friends to make the movie. Well, guess what? It shows. It looks like a low budget. The acting is poor. If it is a cultural thing then it is. I just don't understand the purpose of basing a movie on this story. It's incredibly boring.
