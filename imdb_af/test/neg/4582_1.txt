Greyfriars Bobby was not a Westie - Bobby was a shooting terrier. A highlight of my childhood excursions to Edinburgh was to go to Bobby's monument. I grew up with the story of the brave and loyal puppy, as every child did in my generation, and I remember being with my mother outside the theater - with many, many other Dundee children and their mothers - for the wonderful Disney to watch movie. How can a movie based on such a wonderful story be made using a Westie for the sake of heaven. It's like making a movie about the life of Robert Burns, and portraying him as an Englishman. I say, Bobby returns his race!
