AKA <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 3 x 1.78: 1 within 2.39: 1 window (Triptych) <br /> <br /> Sound format: Dolby Digital <br /> <br /> 1978: a working class teen (Matthew Leitch) accepts a false identity and disturbs the high society, where he teaches hard lessons on the divisions between rich and poor. <br /> <br /> Autobiographical feature by director Duncan Roy (JACKSON: MY LIFE ... YOUR ERROR), an outline of the pre-Thatcherite aristocracy, as seen through the eyes of a lower rent "general" whose world view is changed by his adventures among the upper classes. Unfortunately, Roy's script says very little that we didn't already know about the excessive wealth, and the story is only briefly ignited by Leitch's relationship with an attractive but self-destructive tenure (Peter Youngblood Hills) that seems to be no less hypocritical than the people he wants to follow. Also starring Princess Quick (like an outrageous snob who believes that working class people believe, they are ashamed to be alive!), Bill Nighy as the wealthy black sheep of a wealthy family, Lindsay Coulson ("East Enders"), Blake Ritson (DIFFERENT FOR GIRLS) and Georgina Hale in a typical flamboyant komo, flashing her boobs all the way, without caring in the world! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, much of the film's impact is diluted by Roy's insistence on using a Triptych effect (three separate 1.78: 1 images are letterboxed within the 2.39: 1 frame, each one being different view of individual scenes), which reduces the image and distances screen shots from events. A long, senseless film, too personal for wide appeal, and obstructed throughout by a filming process that fails to reconcile the story at hand. A single-image version is also available (in theater-shaped at 1.85: 1), with the screen title AKA: LIES ARE LIKE WISHES.
