There is a lot of error with this movie. It can be said that a sequel to "Halloween" was, in the first place, a bad idea, and we must feel happy that previous entries, even at their lowest, were still visible. But even more, "Halloween: The curse of Michael Myers" - even today - is so bad, it's shocking. Poor movie at the worst, indeed. There is so much debt to go around. But where to start? On whose shoulders rest this guilt? <br /> <br /> Was it director Joe Chapelle's style-over-dust director? Well, at least, the sixth installment is fresh on the visual front. And as far as the visual effects go, you see Michael's death in some very horrific ways, even though it doesn't quite fit the overall tone of the series. <br /> <br /> So can Daniel Ferrands' Difficult writing be the culprit? Well, to be honest, he did the best he could. By the time you reach the sixth entry in any series, you walk out of places to go. Finding a drive for Michael's reason is not a bad concept because it is an uninteresting one, especially the way it is handled. And it really doesn't help that the movie is chopped into pieces and so many times so much that the story has been completely lost. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Dimension / Miramax has kept the whole thing going. Then it was the first studio movie in the "Halloween" series and we all know what happens if there are too many cooks in the kitchen. Heck, look at the incredible lows that their "Hellraiser" dragged on? I think everyone is to blame because apart from the actors and the visual effects guys, no one seems to be delivering a decent movie. <br /> <br /> However, the bottom line is that it doesn't matter you cut it, cut it, gamble it or explode until it explodes, "Halloween: The curse of Michael Myers" was never a good movie no. An all-time low for the series that nearly killed the credibility of Michael Myers, the curse, is just that: cursed. The thorn corner was never interesting, and it probably wasn't extended. The unnecessary gore is so out of place and replaces the tension that is the trademark of the "Halloween" name. At the end, the movie stops, stops trying to hit a plot, and tries to find a way to kill the characters and end the movie before anything else is lost. It's sad that Donald Pleasence's final performance in this movie is immortal, even though the man did the best he could under the worst possible circumstances. And for the most part, there are other strong role players in this movie. Paul Rudd, of course, plays the strange, anti-social adult Tommy Doyle, of course, while Marianne Hagan provides a fair work to portray the sympathetic female head. On the other side of the coin, Jamie Lloyd's throwback was a pity, and thanks Devin Gardner no longer makes movies. As the child in the movie is being pursued by the "Man in Black", Danny is the anti-Jamie by being annoying, shining and absolutely incredible in his role. It's sad when you can't even feel sympathy for a child in a horror movie. But I think it's Halloween 6 in a nutshell. In essence, it's the anti-Halloween, made by a director who didn't know what he did and a studio that had their own agenda. Hell, even the music is bad. Many will try to paint it as the edgy - "Halloween" because of its sci-fi turns, but really, it's just stupid. Hit some good visual and decent characters, "The Curse Of Michael Myers" is just as bad as it gets. And it comes from a fan!
