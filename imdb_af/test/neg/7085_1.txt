This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. Everything about it - acting, directing, mini-dissertation, cinematography - is terrible. The alien (one in a spooky suit) claims to be from a nearby universe; One assumes that the scriptwriter meant "galaxy", but didn't bother to get a dictionary to check its terms. A better title for the movie would be: "It comes from the planet of plot controversy." The plot is overly stupid and almost inconsistent. The people are all given magical MacGuffins that match a bad series of unlikely restrictions just to move the mere plot. Any thought over time is ignored. Now it's a few days after meeting the stranger, then BAM! Suddenly there are only a few hours to zero hours. Do yourself a favor and miss this movie. You will make you brave because you watched it. The end is especially stupid, and had to be accompanied by someone "Ta-Da !!!!" go. as the scriptwriter just pulls something random from his butt. I think the real alien plot is that this movie sucks so badly that you get cancer it sees. If you can watch the last 10 minutes without scratching yourself ("fears of freedom" - honestly), you are delayed.
