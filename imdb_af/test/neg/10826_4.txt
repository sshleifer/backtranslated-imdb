I went to see this movie to kill time. I remember Cole Hauser in "Tigerland", and although his acting is wood, he shows a tough "leader" character. Same here. This movie was about a bunch of young, hot scientists and divers investigating a cave in Romania that should dive to see. The beginning scene was very interesting, with a bunch of Roem Ense or Russian men investigating the cave in search of booty. Flash ahead 30 years, and we have a team of divers called in by some scientists and his crew to explore some cave for some unknown scientific purposes. <br /> <br /> There are many clich√©, useless talks. The women are too hot for their work, let's see. I hate to watch the lips of these women talking about the guys while drinking beer at the pre-cave exploration party. I think it's like we were at a bar, with frat and girls talking about the opposite sex - not a group of scientists and divers. Each character had ZERO personality, with perhaps the exception of the scientist, who was at least not one of the young and beautiful people. So, the acting, though manly, was not inspiring. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was pretty bad. At one point in the film, Cole Hauser ("Jack"), the main diver - his irises morph in the Cingular wireless symbol, and so remains. We are led to believe it, as he was scratched by one of these monsters, that he was changing into one of them. Fair enough. But in the first place, nobody says the obvious thing to him: "What about you EYES, man?" No. Everyone just talked about how he was "changed" and that he should no longer be the leader of the group. And then this guy says, "You see how he is not human". Huh? If they really believed he was a friggin monster, then why not? Instead, the group split into two - those who go with Jack, and those who go their separate ways, I think he is a monster. It does not make sense. <br /> <br /> The best scene in the movie was this blonde diver woman crawling a cave wall and was attacked by this goblin. Her scream really sucked - but she fought like hell to send the goblin. <br /> <br /> The photo was fine when the camera was still quiet. But any action, the director found, is useful to confuse hell by blowing bubbles, flashing, dark space, God knows what. I wish they'd just show us a scene straight away. Just because you move the camera all over the place, the movie doesn't make SCARIER, people. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been much better if the following changes were made: <br /> <br /> 1. Every actor has been replaced by someone who really looks. Let Cole Hauser be the head, it's good to be the beautiful one. I'm getting tired of seeing 20-something supermodel scientists. Give me a break, people! <br /> <br /> 2. The cinematographer was fired and replaced by one that showed the camera and sat still. It can be the director's fault, I don't know. Jumpy camera (like in Constant Gardener) gets old, people. <br /> <br /> 3. We've seen the gnomes actually digest people. How about a little? There is not much more in this movie. We barely saw the creatures - I tore a bit about it. <br /> <br /> 4. The end was pretty lame. During the unbundling, the sexy British scientist has a secret ... guess what it is? It's a bit canned. The end would have been better if they all died instead of the black man (Morris Chestnut), who had a little sympathy for his character just by his worried expressions. All the other actors had NO expression. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 4 out of 10 because the play was without noticeable errors and the concept was pretty original. I'd like to see Cole do more military roles - he's good at it.
