- Contains 1 spoiler, marketed with: ***** - <br /> <br /> Not to imagine another remake of "The Interview", Five Fingers is actually. Unfortunately, except perhaps the hardship of physical torture, it never adds to the predecessor's performance in terms of tension, plot or performance. In fact, Five Fingers never get anywhere near its level. <br /> <br /> What I was particularly painful to watch was not the torture itself, but the way Martijn (Ryan Philippe) acted. For me it seems as if Philippe was trying too hard to get his accent right and it made his performance a slippery amateur who in turn even dragged the show of an otherwise great Colm Meaney. Phillipe's accent VAT, far from anything near the Dutch, sounded more like Eastern European. <br /> <br /> In addition to the actions of Philippi (which to my surprise has become poor until actually decent to the end) there is the setback of the cracked Dutch landscape. (If these scenes were set up in Switzerland, they would have had the cast food cheese on mountain tops with endless pastures with pasture cows, took expensive hours). Landscape aside, The way these flashbacks pressed the plot didn't work for me at all. It made it look like a French fries at an intervention and caused the build up of tension to platinum. <br /> <br /> Although the movie has become more enjoyable, Phillipe's play has improved, but I couldn't help I occasionally get annoyed with scenes that were just too unreliable. For example: <br /> <br /> ************ Launch spoiler <br /> <br /> At some point (after days), Philippe is almost washed out by the female terrorist. This is only followed by the gross split of another finger. Why does the man give a wash if he's in a torture? And the separation of that last finger just served the title of this movie anyway, I mean, he almost begged to cut it out. Didn't make sense? <br /> <br /> ************ End spoiler <br /> <br /> What finally made me look was the show of Fishburn which again proved to be a brilliant actor, but who also had the best part of the script to work with. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's just better to see the "Maintenance" with the other Matrix icon: Hugo weave. And when you do, I'm confident you won't find this review satisfactory. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> "The Maintenance", 1998 www.imdb.com/ title / tt0120714 /
