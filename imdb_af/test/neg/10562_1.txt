I've been an avid Jane Austen fan for many years. I have never seen this adjustment, so when I heard it, I came here and read all the great reviews. On that basis I ordered it from Netflix. What a cruel disappointment! They took one of the most subtle and bright comic novels and made it boring. Each character looks like a single facial expression, a single tone on which their flat characters are based. Although this adaptation seems to have used every word Jane Austen wrote, they seem to be randomly transferred to characters. Although done as a miniature, this adaptation can confuse and feel as soon as it has been done as a movie of the week. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bennett too hard, ma'am. Bennet, just a dimple, Mr. Darcy, as lifeless as a nutcracker, the Bennett girls immediately became indistinguishable and mr. Wickham, a man who wouldn't see anyone twice - almost the attractive cad! I'm completely eliminated!
