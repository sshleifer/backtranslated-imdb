Fame did something strange. Not only was it a musical screen created for the screen (most of which is based on Broadway musicals), but it has a TV show and a Broadway musical. Let me correct that sentence. Celebrity is not a musical. Musicals have songs to promote the plot or to show characters' feelings. The song in this music was also not used; In fact, there is nothing at all. People just sing randomly to fit into the plot. And that's not the kind of music I know. <br /> <br /> The so-called Fame plot has an attack of characters (all set up simultaneously - the last time I saw it in a movie [Gosford Park], it had disastrous results), who is auditioning for and in New York High School for the performing arts. All of them are for different reasons, viz. acting, etc. Quote-unquote drama unfolds as those middle-aged who pretend to be teens go through their four years. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is that the high school should be selective. After all, it's a free university, and they can't allow everyone. So how is it that some people who are really bad come to college? Obviously, such a drama can occur between all these different people. And why is the person not even in the movie after the end of the picture, for no reason except to make us feel uncomfortable? There are many disturbing situations that these undoubted people come in, but you can't feel bad for them, because you don't know who they are! These relationships occur between people whose names you do not know. And these characters realize everything about themselves through the movie, but you don't realize it because you don't know what they were in the first place. <br /> <br /> As for the song, It appears randomly (and is supposed to be humorous) and does nothing. When the title song is sung, it is played in the middle of a street and before you can say Ferris Bueller is all in the middle of the street a lot of game and reports. The song itself is good, but the whole scene, like the whole movie, is unnecessary. Fame is an unpleasant movie, to say the least. I'll say more, but most of the movie went out happily. Just don't see it. You will do yourself a favor. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R for language.
