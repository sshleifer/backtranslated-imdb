I think it would be a more appropriate title for this movie, as it is filled with hell and stock with various insects and animals. I recently found The Prey in its original VHS Big Box form and was very excited. I love finding old treasure movies on VHS because the cover art is fantastic. Usually, it seems that the movie itself is less than fantastic. The Prey is one of those movies. <br /> <br /> To be fair, it started, with the killer who has the cliché teenagers in the forest. The heart rate sounds used are a good effect that makes you look as you watch. This movie is basically a big fat cliché, and when the "campfire stories" section rolls in, the film takes a new direction and spends nearly half of the running time on the story of the killer. I actually thought it was quite an original idea. However, the story ends suddenly and shows us some footage of a burning bushveld (the lack of budget really starts now). Then we return to the dumb teenagers who are taken off in the bush. The killer himself is not shown to the end, it is a pity that he is actually an effective search killer. Kind of like Cropsy of the burning, but better. As far as it goes, there is not too much, although at the end there is an OK sight-catching moment. <br /> <br /> Overall, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone other than slasher completists - it's really a big mess.
