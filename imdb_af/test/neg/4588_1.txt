The game of hockey I play and watch has something called "speed", which never comes to the real hockey screens in this slack movie. Add a storyline that is clich√©, predictable, and stupid to stupid with some of the lamb's' 80s music that despises your senses in every scene and you have 'Youngblood'. Oh, Keanu as a French Canadian, yes, whatever. Gimme Dunlop, Braden and the Hansons anytime ... ONE from TEN.
