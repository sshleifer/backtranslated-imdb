I've seen this movie about 6 or 7 times, and it gets judged every time. Perhaps what I enjoy most is the tired character paradigms that the film offers us: the gloomy all-American male protagonist, his blonde girl, the theater with glasses, a brunette girl, the antagonistic jock and the brunette girl # 2. however, it is hosted by two wizards martial artists with mullets who manage a convertible driver. If anyone can explain it, please contact me. Amongst other highlights are Bobby Johnston's portrayal of the jock character, Dell, and his trademark line, "That's why I keep her around." In looking at Johnston's performance, it is not surprising that his career has descended rapidly into the kingdom of softcore pornography. (SPOILER) Also, after several views, I have absolutely no idea what that great devil at the end says at any point; It's just electronically muted sounds. Oh yes, it's probably for the better. And lastly, why are all the demons so smooth? Is night well scarcer? It certainly didn't help in this movie.
