Greetings from Lithuania. <br /> <br /> This is the first question to come out after watching this "movie". <br /> <br /> You know, I've seen a lot of bad movies in my life, but after watching this one, I only had two questions: 1) Is it just a spoof <br / > 2) How can people create such a thing? <br /> <br /> If you've never seen this "movie", if you really don't know what a VERY bad "movie" is. I mean BAD. The script - do you joke? Acting is so terrible that I do "the actors" where only fun in this movie is. I know, it's a B movie, but come on? Is this a reason to be such a rubbish? <br /> <br /> Oh! And what an end !!! A mission must be missed! Just when you're the thing that's the worst thing you've ever seen, wait until the end - because the kind of end you've never seen (and I hope you'll never see). <br /> <br /> Analyze this "movie" at any price, and don't say I didn't warn you ...
