All the great horror movies of the 70's, 80's, and even the early 90's of Psycho, to Texas Chainsaw Masacre (The original not warmed by WB crap), to the quiet of the lambs. The characters in these movies were based on Ed Gein's crimes. The authors and directors have drawn the true story for the inspiration to create some of the greatest * fictional * film killers of all time. <br /> <br /> The old horror movies were great because, although the crimes were loosely based on the facts of Ed Gein's case, they were truly fictitious and far removed from the true story. <br /> <br /> In the case of this movie, they created a fictitious horror movie trying to capitalize on the real story of selling a cheap, poor-acting, love story between two characters that no one really cares about no. In fact, in a * good * horror movie, these two characters would have been excellent victims. <br /> <br /> End Reading ... <br /> <br /> In short, this movie was like a damp underwear on a cold afternoon that rinses on a nice cup of chilled vomit.
