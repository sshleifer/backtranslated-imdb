This movie is one of the worse examples of hype. People who read IMDb comments may be tempted to see this total waste of time, as I was, through fake taglines like a throw back to the 80's horror and what's not. This movie sucks, from acting to directing to the story. Terrible, across the board. And I like lots of good horror movies, I'm not a snob at all. It sucked. In memory, I loved The Grudge 1 and 2, Black Sheep, Planet Terror, Texas Chaisaw Massacre. The Beginning, The Other, The Ring, Jason X, Slither, Planet Terror. And The Hat 2, Texas Chainsaw Massacre makes Wolf Creek, the hills have eyes (make again) Hostel 1 and 2, and this movie. Gore does not trump fun or originality.
