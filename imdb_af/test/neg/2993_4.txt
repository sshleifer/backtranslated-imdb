This film is about a depressed and emotionally complicated man with a distant family member living with him in his flat in Istanbul. As time goes by, their relationship becomes more and more tense until eventually they start screaming at their house guests - who is out of work and does not look everyone who is keen to get a job. This is most of the movie. The problem is that although emotionally complex and depressed people withdraw and are non-communicative, they do not make for a very satisfying movie. That's because most of the time he (and his room) just stares into space and says nothing. I think all these flat moments could be shortened to make a 30 minute movie - I would definitely not have thought.
