The worst Wrestlemania ever. <br /> <br /> It had nothing, and there were many crazy. It happened in Las Vegas and WWE made its employees dress like Egyptian gods! They even changed Howard Finkel's name to Finkus Maximus, which probably means nothing. The face to see Jim Ross in that terrible gown gives me even more nightmares to this day and I'm 21 years old, so you can imagine it if I was 7 years old! Bobby Heenan was funny though. <br /> <br /> Matches The Undertaker vs Giant Gonzales in a weak game, The Headshrinkers vs. The Steiner Brothers in a useless game, Doink vs Crush in a comedy game and a boring game. with Razor Ramon vs Bob Backlund. Hulk Hogan founded Brutus Beefcake to fight Money. You can clearly see that Hogan had a black eye. In the story, Ted DiBiase and IRS defeated Hogan while playing poker or something in the casino. It's a bad storyline, but in fact Macho Man hit Randy Savage Hogan because Savage thinks he's like The Hulk. No, not the wrestler, but the movie character. <br /> <br /> The main event consisted of Bret 'Hitman' Hart who challenged Yokozuna in a very boring main event match. Mr. Fuji won salt in the face of Hart and Yoko, but did not come down to Hogan and complicated Yoko in 21 seconds. <br /> <br /> Overall Grade - E
