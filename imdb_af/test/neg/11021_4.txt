... BREAKER MORANT and ROMPER STOMPS. This also gave us watchable movies like BOOTMEN and THE ODD ANGRY SHOT. Unfortunately for anyone involved in this debacle, the WOG BOY will not appear in the list. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to seeing this movie, simply because of the politically wrong title, so politically untrue that when it was broadcast late in the evening on BBC 2, and the announcer didn't even name of the movie, so I expected something so offensive that my jaw would fall into disbelief. It has fallen into disbelief, I found myself unable to believe that the financiers thought it would be a big international hit. <br /> <br /> The problem lies with the cast and the script. I do know that Australia, with its small population, does not have a large number of actors, so I will forgive most, but it ceases to criticize Nick Giannopoulos as Steve. For this kind of comedy to work on, you have to be impressed with the comedian skills of the main actor and I'm sorry to say, but Nick G doesn't just have the skills. I have never heard of him and seen nothing else, he may be so, he is much better at other performances. Here, however, he is just annoying, unconvincing and I lost the score on the number of times he made the camera. The jokes themselves are very flat and predictable and coming back to the script seems very underdeveloped. I mean, who was a running gag about a female Minster or Work, who has it in the back of a limousine, was funny to start with? You get the feeling that someone in the production had to be more honest and said, "Watch partner, this script isn't nearly good enough. Make it subtler and structured." <br /> <br /> I was hard and in this review hardness was asked. I gave the movie four out of ten and it would only have three if it wasn't for the one really funny ride where Steve looks at a current business show, just for himself flashing on the screen and calling a Dole bloodgirl. It shows that the authors of the magazine and social commentary were aware. So sorry they didn't come with a much better written movie
