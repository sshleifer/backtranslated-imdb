I am a little spooked by some of these reviews praise A.K.A. Not only does it sound like they were written by the same person, but they contain all kinds of insider information that you can surely find by reading the cover book. Please do not tell me that the director is writing his own reviews because it would be too sad to think. <br /> <br /> Afraid I'm still one of those who hated the movie and was amazed at its unapologetic amateurism. Great idea, ashamed of the execution. And it was very disturbing to watch so many good actors (as well as some very bad people, including the leader). They all believe that they appear in a series of many different movies. <br /> <br /> I wish AKA was diligent, innovative or simply interesting. Unfortunately, it was like an unintended hysterical home video with artistic aspirations. A missed opportunity.
