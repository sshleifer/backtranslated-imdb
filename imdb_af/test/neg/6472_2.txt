This remake is titled "That Darn Cat", but D.C. the cat is more of a margin than the main character. Patti Randall was not at all in this remake at all. She reminded me of one of those high school Goths who you read about who had been hurt since the day they were born, so that one day they started school. The federal policeman, Kelso, was good, but not as good as the one in the original. I think Disney is trying to make Christina Ricci and Doug Doug (or whatever the goofy name he has) in stars, but they do not hold a candle for Hayley Mills and Dean Jones in the original. I am an animal lover and a cat lover and I do not blame D.C. because the remake is so inferior to the original movie. After all, they almost cut him out of the whole movie. All in all, a very poor remake.
