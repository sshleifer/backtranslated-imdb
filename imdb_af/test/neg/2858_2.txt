I was very disappointed after watching the Pinocchio's Revenge the night. I had a good tendency to be a bad one, but I didn't think it would be that bad as it turned out. A wooden doll of a murdered son falls into the hands of a lawyer's eight-year-old daughter. From there, it's a murderous road for anyone who gets between the puppet and the girl. We have previously seen films such as the Child's Play series, which are far superior. However, it was good to see actors such as James W. Quinn and Todd Allen. Both previously worked under Kevin Tenney. Anyway, I encourage viewers to check out "Night of The Demons" and the original "Witchboard". These are titles that bring out the best in Kevin S. Tenney.
