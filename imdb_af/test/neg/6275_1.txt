After watching the Steven Spielberg version of the World War in theaters, I was addicted to the subject. I can think back to my favorite parts in the movie, people are evaporating, people panicking, fire, explosions, it was so nice ... <br /> <br /> So a few weeks later I will shop my video , and I see David Michael Latt's version of the world war on the shelf. "It couldn't have come on DVD, so fast, could it?" I told myself. I read the back of the case and see C. Thomas Howell. "Oh, I remember him from the outsiders!" So I thought it might be a three. <br /> <br /> I was wrong, dead wrong. As soon as I looked at the opening credits, they looked forever, I knew something was wrong. Something disappointed me in this movie and it did. The whole movie stinks like a cheese sauce that has been left in the fridge for 10 years. From the acting, the special effects (stupid looking tripod things, when people evaporate, they become orange skeletons) and most of all, it didn't even come close to being as interesting as the Spielberg version, in fact the plot was boring. and there were only 3 scenes of destruction! What is the crap? I eventually got so bored that I had to progress through the movie until I found something that looked even interesting at a distance. And nothing really was. <br /> <br /> My advice: Don't even touch this movie, stay 100 feet away. The Spielberg version comes near the end of this month, buy that one! But please, please, I beg you! Stay away from this turd before it all throngs us!
