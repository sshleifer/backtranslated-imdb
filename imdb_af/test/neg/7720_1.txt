How bad can you make a movie. A good question that House of the Dead 2 manages to answer. I couldn't believe it was possible to get anything worse than the first House of Death, but unbelievably the director succeeded. The only feeling you get from the movie is that it's bad, just bad. What about overworking, bad FX and a stupid story. It is this kind of movie that gives Z-Movies a bad name in general. Why can't they learn the lesson of the first House of the Dead movie? Anyway, I think you will now understand that you shouldn't see this movie. It's just a waste of time. See "Bad Taste" or "Dawn of the Dead" if you want to see some good zombies.
