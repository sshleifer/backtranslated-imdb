A full zero out of four. A worst summary Ajooba: terrible. In fact, more words come to mind: ridiculous, second-rate and terrible. It's one of Amitabh's worst movies ever, he kicks in a cheap leather jacket and equally inexpensive tin film Zorro style mask. It looks like there are wings on the sides. <br /> <br /> The movie is in ancient Persia or Arabia and is typically unknown to an Indian movie. As mentioned above, a K-Mart leather jacket with Velcro does not exist 400 years ago, unless all my skilled teachers were wrong. <br /> <br /> Rishi also does his patented cross decoration in this movie. Far from being funny, it is very embarrassing to look. What can the son of the legendary Raj Kapoor possess to capture the memory of his home like this on the screen? <br /> <br /> On the plus side, if you want a real laugh, go ahead and watch this movie. The striking contradictions in the plot and costumes are not a match for the terrible dialogues and crooks.
