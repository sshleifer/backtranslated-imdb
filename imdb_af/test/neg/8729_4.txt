"The apartment complex" is a camping comedy full of cookie characters created instead of a true story that tells a young soul student (Lowe) who is managing a work that manages an apartment complex and in a murder story. you can call it that way. This low cal clock has no tension, no excitement, no drama, no action, precious few funny moments, a little nudity and almost no romance. "The apartment complex" is sensible, forgetful junk food for just the most needy bank potatoes.
