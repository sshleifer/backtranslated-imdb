Do people rate this movie highly because it is a strange war movie? <br /> <br /> To me this is nothing more than a bad Hollywood war movie in German. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad on so many levels. To call it even with Platoon or Full Metal Jacket is absurd. The battle order is pathetic, the dialogue and frightening. <br /> <br /> This so-called group of "storm troops" is frequent in the Wermacht. Not SS troops. There's so much wrong with this movie, it's sad. Bad editing, bad acting. It has everything. <br /> <br /> The movie goes on and on and on as if the audience had to be made as much as the soldiers did. <br /> <br /> I read in a review that the movie had a $ 20 million budget. <br /> <br /> Actually? Where was it spent? In the fake train cars? In the pathetic "special effects"? Ugh. <br /> <br /> As a World War II history buff, and World War II movie fan, I considered this movie a serious disappointment. <br /> <br /> For an excellent alternative war movie, check out The Beast "(Not a WWII movie but still outstanding) <br /> <br /> Don't save this one .
