KANNIBALE FEROX (1+ out of 5 stars) Miserable excuse for a movie ... you might enjoy if you really enjoy boring, unconscious jungle movies, with a scene of graphic violence. A few drug dealers in the run of the gang travel to Paraguay's jungles to search for emerald and cocaine. They meet each other with another young traveler and his two hot babe sidekicks, one of whom is an anthropologist who definitely wants to prove that cannibalism has never existed. One of the two traders seems to be a bit of a psychopath, and he tortures and kills some natives to tell them where they hide their jewels. (And how can they even tell him if he doesn't look their language in the first place?) Well, the natives are not too proud of white people in their jungle and they all stuck to some sort of retribution. Poor acting, poor plot and poor direction. Not a decent moment of tension in the whole sad 90 minutes. Even the special effects aren't particularly convincing (though some shots will still make most viewers). The only good scene in the whole movie is when the two women are trapped in a mud hut and apparently touch the hearts of the natives with their version of the "Red River Valley". The following is a quote from the movie, but I will not be surprised if many viewers did not say exactly the same thing: "Oh God, let her die soon. Oh, let her die. Also, please, please."
