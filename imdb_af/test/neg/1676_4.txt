A childish puppeteer, for a public childcare course, is about to end when he discovers children who are entertained at a hospital and are victims of terrible abuse. This movie has some of the worst indescribably brave parents you could ever overcome. Not a mining film as much as a post-school special on the dangers of child abuse. It seems to be harmless, Mr. Rabby takes matters into his own hands when the police seem to be forced by lack of evidence to persuade parents of their terrible abuse to their children. The children are emotional and zombie-like (because of the amount of abuse they have inflicted), the parents out loud, unthinkable loud, disrespectful and warlike. The mothers, in particular, are so obscene, you will root for their execution. They are essentially miserable people who exercise their frustrations on the children. Our detectives are a tired lot, frustrated with the whole legal process, how the police procedure often cannot prosecute those who beat their children in submission. While the crimes themselves are abominable, the film does not extend the creepy activity on the screen. I will say the reason to see it is for Tom Basham's performance as the unbalanced man-child who slips into psychosis. There is quite a strange dining table between Basham's mr. Rabbey and his guardian shortly after he held the parents responsible for the death of their child, how he lived in a fantasy and how he had done an indelible point. .notice the changes in behavior, pretty impressive work, going from innocent to creepy). Peter Renaday is Lt. Hayes, the detective in charge of the murder cases, which on his face constitutes the tension it pays on him. There is an early performance by John Ashton as detective Matthews, who always raises Hayes' hair because of his inability to follow directions, not to mention how opinion he is about parents who abuse their children. Uncomfortable relaxed blues score that seems to be inappropriate for a movie like this. Controversial conclusion to establish that even children can tolerate as much. A bit too slow for my taste, but there is an effective use, of opinion, of Basham's eyes before he cares for business, and waits patiently as he prepares to strike.
