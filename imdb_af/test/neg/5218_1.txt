If you look at making this DVD - they tell you what is being attempted here - they tell the Bible story of good to evil and try to hear it heard at a mainstream movie. In a modern society like ours, this is where the film fails. There are too many sheep depicted in this movie. People are also empowered for this type of preaching today. <br /> <br /> As far as acting, directing and technical features are concerned, they are well done. Chuck Norris is actually OK as an angel as the unpredictable appearance of Norris as an angel is no longer absurd as Tommy Smothers was in the 1960s.
