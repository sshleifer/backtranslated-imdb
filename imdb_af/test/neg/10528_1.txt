This movie is sometimes a wild 80-year-old sex comedy, others are a lovely romantic one. Then it has moments of serious drama and then sprinkled in areas of science fiction. It's so uneven, it's almost ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But I'll never be one of the worst movies I've ever seen except of course for throwing Peter O'Toole. It is absolutely nothing for him to do. work with here. Poor dialogue, poor performance to finish, poor everything ... And yet he is fantastic ... There is not one good thing about his part and yet he does it if it is not pure charm. <br /> <br /> The fact that he was able to achieve so much with so little sketched a spotlight on how big everyone in this movie failed, and it looks even worse than I think it is ... < br /> <br /> If any other actor was in O'Toole's role, I would have forgotten this movie and never thought it again, but a good performance by Peter O'Toole despite all the chances that sure I will remember this movie for a long time. time to come ... If like a movie that might have been good if someone was involved, it was almost half as good as Peter O'Toole.
