Code 46 is one of those scifi movies where the government controls who you may love and will punish you if you try to reproduce with the wrong person. The haves and the hacks nots live in completely separate areas, the powers it can do, your memories, etc. Remove. We've seen these things before, but it's OK. No movie is 100% original. This kind of point of departure is always fun to consider. Unfortunately, you can just imagine a future than looking at Code 46. The characters are boring and seldom say anything interesting. Maybe it's commenting on an inhumane future, but it's still dull to look at. It's sloooow. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the imagery is nice, but usually (along with its "exciting" soundtrack) it looks like a decorated perfume commercially. Code 46 also sometimes uses the kind of television camera work I find annoying. You know, two characters speak as if the camera on one side unconsciously "floats". Two seconds later, on the other hand, it is swinging in vain to keep your attention. <br /> <br /> My friends love this movie. If they try to see me again, I probably won't do it unless they agreed to pay me $ 50.
