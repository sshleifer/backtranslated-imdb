Note, I've only seen about the last half of this movie, so feel free to take my review with any grain of salt you consider appropriate, as what I saw was more than enough to convince me that A one-strong score for this is enough. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a spanking of the wonderful predecessor (NL Christmas holiday) with Chevy Chase, but it doesn't have Chevy Chase in it, and it takes place in a generic tropical island, essentially with no connection with Christmas. <br /> <br /> Ol 'Chevy probably didn't want it because the plot has it without real fun, but they got the mad cousin. Eddie, who was good in the original again, but here he is just at the top and a very poor base for any movie considering the plot and acting. The attempts at humor are generic to an extent where even contemporary television comedy dips it, and in the light of its comedy, I doubt I should say more. <br /> <br /> It's not for his attributes because it has nothing but it's failures and again, how Hollywood wastes it is the blood of the past in pursuit of a quick buck. <br /> <br /> I think I'll look the original before the upcoming Christmas season, just to try and regain my childhood innocence, from a lost time when the movies were just a high budget, but careless, rubbish .
