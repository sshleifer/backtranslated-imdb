What is Fox's fascination with dysfunctional families, consisting of average, unpleasant, spoiled children, and parents who are determined to be cool, as opposed to parents? I'm sorry, I don't get it. The one episode I was almost able to watch was one of the kids who demanded a Bar Mitzvah, with the purpose of getting thousands of dollars in gift money. Of course, the idiot mother decides that her precious little junior should have the biggest and irrigation party of all and has no problem dropping 20 grand on the big event. The bitter, brain-like, crazy teenage girl jumps back and forth between Jewish and then Catholics, when she sees the "cute" religious tutors. <br /> <br /> The one border "heart-warming" moment in the whole episode was when a father's father was convinced all the time that the Bar Mitzvah was just a money-making scheme. Look, the boy is studying his Hebrew lessons and is briefly thought to think his begetting descendants might be. be sincere about the right of transition to masculinity. This hot, unclear feeling is immediately torn from his chest when he informs junior, as he has not yet had a breeze, a certain procedure should be performed. The Bar Mitzvah is called, and the mother is out of several thousands of dollars when the child refuses to comply. <br /> <br /> This show is garbage and I'm sad that I'll never be back in the 23 minutes. I wasted my life watching this piece of shit, because nothing else was on TV.
