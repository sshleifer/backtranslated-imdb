Some of the films produced by Roger Corman's New World movie company in the 1970s represent the best kind of B movie, where genre limitations actually act as a kind of free influence on the authors and directors? such classic films as Deathrace 2000, Hollywood Boulevard, Grand Theft Auto and Caged Heat come from this area. Unfortunately, his former allies at the American International Photos in the 1970s came out of the steam, especially in the absence of Jim Nicholson, and they often made a second course of Corman's films, sometimes with his self-made stars. "Black Mama, White Mama" is one of those movies. It's basically a cheaper imitation of 'The Big Doll House' with some of the same stars doing the same things. Yes, it's a John Ashley co-production (yes, the same John Ashley who wants to be the hilarious Elvis in "How to make a monster" and with Debbie Walley in "Beach Blanket Bingo") with all the signatures of his productions ?? women's prisons where everyone except maybe 2 or 3 main characters including the prisoners and the guards are Filipino actors in mostly non-speaking roles, where we see women of the supermodel type, take on the roles of revolutionary militants, and where the primary joy from the film by rudimentary S&M exploitation. <br /> <br /> The pressure I saw most recently was severely damaged (good ole, Will Viharo described it as "Yellow Mama, Yellow Mama"), but I even think in the best of circumstances is photography and do a lot of routine. There is also very little visual value here? Corman Don't have much to do with the movie itself because he was always enough to give his films at least an extra production value by filming in free public spaces that would make the movie look more impressive. This movie doesn't look impressive, it doesn't have an impressive soundtrack, and you just feel ashamed of anyone showing a lot of talent. The only remotely interesting performances come from Pam Grier as a festive whore to escape life, Filipino actor Dindo Fernando, as her grotesquely self-indulgent pimp, and Sid Haig as a cowboy styled mercenary. The story places Grier and co-star Margaret Markov in a low-budget female version of "The Defiant Ones", but does very little with the melodramatic possibilities given by the premise. It's basically an excuse to ensure that the two protagonists can still stop for a good mud wrestling match while trying to escape the prison. This is all in the spirit of good fun, but the movie eventually fails even as exploitation, because there is a certain edge and richness that must be in such scenes, which is replaced instead by this director's hand with a kind. of predictability. <Br /> <br /> The movie will therefore have little value for fans of hard core exploitation value ?? At least in the version I saw, it's no more explicit than "Faster Pussycat, Kill! Kill!" of more than a decade earlier, and much less interesting visually and thematically. For those who just enjoy getting a laugh from the "so bad it is good" movies, this can make one or another fun, but it's not in the top level. People will be more advised to seek out "Caged Heat" or some of the others who generate in their own brutality to the point of being camped; this one looks more like less ambitious efforts like Cirio Santiago's "The Muthers". Unfortunately, the best aspect of this particular movie is the title and presence of Pam Grier, who was in other movies at the same time (especially Jack Hill's "Coffy"). This movie may illustrate a centerpiece in Miss Grier's journey from the Corman secretary to the B-movie Queen-For-A-Day, but unlike his historical "meaning" as such, it will have little for Grier's great supporters. have value because she is given. very little to work with here. <br /> <br /> It is true to jump, unless of course you see it in a kiosk with lots of friends and lots of beer as I did. And even then its value is questionable.
