In an unsuccessful attempt to be taken seriously and to move into 'adult' movies, Hughes this movie about a young married couple. True, it has every click in the book in it, foolish fantasy stuff and everything, but more importantly, it's Elizabeth McGovern. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the best actress ever appeared in a John Hughes movie, giving weight to the sometimes stupid stuff. Kevin Bacon (and his hair) is pretty good as her husband, but McGovern steals the movie with her silent, true moments of honesty. The 'teen movie' fun that worked so well in other Hughes movies fell flat here like a favorite uncle whose jokes made you laugh when you were 9, but keep telling them when you're 15 and you wish he would get new material. . But I continue to go back to McGovern's performance because it's really moving. Mr. Hughes' most interesting films have real actors in them (Some Kind of Wonderful, Breakfast Club) and when his material bumps into a real talent, some wonderful things can happen. If he just trusts that it shouldn't be tackled with the stupid fantasy opportunities.
