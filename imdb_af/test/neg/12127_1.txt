This movie was terrible. The play was lame, but it is difficult to see if anyone has performed well since the writing was so bad. It's one of Johnny Depp's worst movies. I discourage anyone from viewing it. <br /> <br /> If you need to see Cry-Baby, I recommend mumbling it and mr. Depp for an hour and a half.
