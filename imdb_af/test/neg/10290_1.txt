I'm not sure what my Surveillance recommended, but I think I have an idea: one of the "Fat Guys At the Movies." The person said they were amazed at how big it was and said it was one of the prettiest / disturbing movies. (I paraphrase and do it only by memory, so forgive me if I'm wrong.) Anyway, I decided to see it. So I blame myself for my own wrong calculation in looking at one of the most horrible, predictable and STUPID movies I've ever seen. Strangely, I doubt I ever mentioned a movie "stupid," but it was the first word that came to mind about one-third and remained in my mind until now. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Incredible premise and reactions, amazing brain-dead characters (can blame the writing or the actors, or I'll just blame) and very bad acting. I'd rather believe Bill Pullman as US president as an FBI agent here. (Of course there is a reason for that, and I'm partly going in.) And if you can't find the so-called shocking "twist" in the first 5 minutes, come late to the theater or get into the room around it. late to see. Don't worry, they'll tell the "twist" every five minutes. <br /> <br /> There were a few serial killers in the most depressed town in the country or world. But there's more to the story! Some dumbass and corrupt police would like to breathe out for their own entertainment. Could there be more? Oh yes, there is a family, maybe, but there are four people, one boy, one girl and one adult couple. The girl says she sees things with far less conviction than Cole sees deadly people in The Sixth Sense. There must be more to this than I mentioned! It makes a movie interesting! Adding so many subplots that may / may not be developed is the way to go! All right, then I continue. We have some FBI agents that made me laugh. A few giggling druggs that were first shocked by their OD dealers, but then inundated by the robbery. A gosh-topping cute policeman who has to be set up for funny relief, always fighting a malicious / suspicious police. And finally (arm and arm) Michael Ironside, who not only calls his show, he writes it almost. <br /> <br /> None of this work. They are all told in different forms of presence or flashbacks, and believe me, you will lose all sense of caring after the first of many subplots has started. In addition, the response of some of these characters is the most shocking of all. I think I refer mostly to the police, but mainly the girl who lost her or lost her family and barely shines. <br /> <br /> This stupid, stupid movie stinks. It is hardly gory if the person who advised it was, unless his exposure was limited to Goosebumps stories. And what is the title? Supervision? Oh, I get it; This is because it was used in 1/50 subplots to just film interviews. As it is so random, it can be just as well called COP CAR, BULLET or COFFEE. Just keep away from this terrible mess.
