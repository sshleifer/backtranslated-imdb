I just watched this movie and think it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was so boring that I selected myself at the X2 speed and completed it in less than 30 minutes. I was not only disappointed, but angry that I had wasted my money to rent it. It's in the top five of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen thousands of movies! The plot was very confusing. If I didn't even read the DVD cover, I would have lost the whole movie completely. I wouldn't have thought that Tim Robbins, after making such good films as "Shawshank Redemption", agreed to appear in this movie.
