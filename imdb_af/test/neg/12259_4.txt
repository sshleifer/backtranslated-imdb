As a fan of ZaSu Pitts comedies, I thought this one seemed to be worth it. I was rather disappointed. <br /> <br /> (The version I saw was on TCM but only consisted of the Niagara Falls movie, the Miss Polly movie was absent.) The talents of the actors showing good performances deliver, was wasted on one of the stupid stories I ever had the accident to go through. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown (Tom Wilson) surprised me by being the strongest actor in the show, but the spotlight was hit by Slim Summerville (Sam Sawyer), who, if he has any talent, has not shown here. <br /> <br /> ZaSu Pitts (Elly Sawyer) is great, but not close enough. The biggest laugh in the movie is when she ends under a table under Sam. <br /> <br /> The only thing in the movie at all is Tom Wilson. Margie (Marjorie Woodworth) is unreasonable in general. While physically attractive, her personality and attitudes make her completely undesirable. Elly, Sam and the hotel desk clerk are just foolish. <br /> <br /> Sam and Elly offer their honeymoon suite in the busy hotel for Tom and Margie. But then they take it back. Sam ends Tom and Margie in their room. Most of the movies are trying to break out, but Sam, with a gun, always puts them back. <br /> <br /> By the end comes the worst part. Tom, who ultimately wants to make his escape, runs into a minister on a lower floor of the hotel. Now the man who, as I said, the only one in the whole movie with a head on his shoulders, suddenly, for absolutely no reason, decides to marry Margie! <br /> <br /> He dragged the pastor to the room where he just escaped, but Margie didn't want to marry him. He gave her a kiss, and now, after one kiss, she felt compelled to marry him. <br /> <br /> Lastly, Sam had the nose to tell Tom, "You misled me," when it was almost the only line. Tom had Sam earlier, "We're not married," and Sam replied, "You think I believe it?" <br /> <br /> Idiotic.
