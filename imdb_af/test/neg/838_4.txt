Lately, I have looked very Western from the 1930s to the present. There are some good low budget spaghetti westerns from the late 1960s and early 1970s. This movie has all the elements of a decent western: a good story with talented actors and all others. Though, this is a spoof of this genre, and for me it was just done and didn't do it for a disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> This movie can easily be divided into two parts. <Br /> <br /> The first part is wonderful; It has a good opening scene and an interesting story developed from a bounty hunter (including the stranger) who goes to a bandit, who goes to a big bank ship, partly by a banker. In the course of the film, these three characters form the change of alliances in an effort to get the money. There are subtle comics for the imagination of previous films from this genre, but the comedy does not disturb the overall story. <br /> <br /> The second half of the movie is where the comedy goes over and destroys the movie essentially. The turning point is to the right where the grandmother ceases to cause the dwarf to shoot the clients while waiting for other customers who seem to be unaware of the four dead who are going over the place. From this point the movie of a decent spaghetti western moves with comic undertones to a stupid silly spoof. <br /> <br /> There are three terrible fist battles (one at the river, one in the market and one at the baths) that follow quickly, as if one wasn't bad enough. The battles are so fake, it's ridiculous, and since the sound is out of the way, it makes it even worse. In the market battle scene, the banker jumps over the spot on the hidden trampolines and turns around on poles as he is in the circus; this is clownish. Although, the worst part of these scenes is the music; It's this bright, delicate blend that's more suited to a square dance or a cheesy episode of 'Hee-Haw'. These screens practically save the main story. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was disappointing as it had a lot of potential as a decent western one, but the comic turns just wasted it. If you want to see a good western spoof, see 'Blazing Saddles'. If you want to see a good spaghetti western, then avoid this movie.
