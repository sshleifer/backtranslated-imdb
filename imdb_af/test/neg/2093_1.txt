I can't believe anyone would have a green light, let alone volunteer. I will never be able to get those 90 minutes of my life back. <br /> <br /> It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Some movies are so bad they are good. It went so far that it was somehow, it's so bad, it's terrible. I didn't expect much, it was a low budget, a bandwagon jump, rehashed with a B Movie, but it still came under my expectation levels. Even TV movies have higher production values. <br /> <br /> There were (very) bad special effects, shocking dialogue, horrible acting and a completely unexplained plot. Who cursed her and why, why did the 6-inch snakes change in 15-foot hose, has anyone ever heard of highly poisonous snakes or pythons? 100 passengers? 3,000 snakes? So many promises, no one delivered. <br /> <br /> Some comments will believe that this movie is worth the last five minutes. It's not even worth a rent. Stay in and watch a low budget TV movie, you will enjoy it much more. <br /> <br /> Why was it made? Oh yes, shamelessly paid into the internet phenomenon that is SOAP. Shame on you, Mallachi Brothers, ashamed of you
