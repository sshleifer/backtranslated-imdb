The Camals Coming is a disappointing British comedy from 1934. I bought it because I love desert adventures and say it's a drama. This is definitely not. <br /> <br /> It's about a couple going to Egypt to catch a number of desert drug traffickers. <br /> <br /> It would have been much better if it was done as a drama rather than a comedy that dropped it. It's pretty stupid in parts. Deploy this, there are some good action and place scenes. <br /> <br /> The film is led by Jack Hulbert with Anna Lee as the love interest. <br /> <br /> One viewing is enough for this movie. . Overall, a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 stars out of 5.
