I hated this movie. Simply put, this movie is so bad I almost want to ignore it to ever watch it and never mention it again. But on the other hand, I can't resist a good bashing. And if there is one thing that Evan Almighty is doing for the audience, it's that it's the best criticism. <br /> <br /> The movie (a sequel to the much stranger Bruce Almighty) begins by setting the audience back to Evan. Baxter, a mere supporting best character in the original movie. That's right. This movie does not show Jim Carrey or Jennifer Anisten. Not even a small como look. You know your movie is bad when the guy who agreed to do Ace Venture: When Nature Calls won't even play a short role. But somehow they keep Morgan Freeman as God. While bored in the almost empty scene, I had a lack of comedy, but I couldn't help wondering how much money it took to secure Freeman for this movie. Then it hit me an hour ago. It's just a discarded roll that has been taking in the 100 minute movie for 20 minutes. God just appears between the scenes to tell Evan to build the ark. Certainly I know Morgan Freeman will not look at this film after a year and think it's as good as his roles in The Shawshank Redemption and Million Dollar Baby, but it's easy money. Where was I? Oh yes, the plot. Sometimes it is so difficult to stay focused on the plot when you realize that you have thought more about the plot than the author of the script did. Anyway, Evan (Steve Carell) apparently left his job as a news forum for a congressional member. Yes ... with no transition in between. He never turns to his wife and says, "I think I want to be a congressman." It only happens within the first five minutes and you are forced to handle the big transition. Well as a congressman, he is a partner for a bill proposed by John Goodman's character. Suddenly God seems to have to build Evan an ark. No "Hey, how are you? How's the weather?" bit. Just "I want you to build an ark." Evidence of Bad Writing: Evan states that God gives him clues to build an ark after seeing an admirer, signing a sign that says Genesis 6:14. He walks past his son and watches a television baseball game. <br /> <br /> It's basically the plot of Evan Almighty. There are some randomly supporting role players who are doing their best to create comedy, but they are not doing very well, as they hardly get a screen-time. It's just your basic run of the flour family that builds an ark film. Oh, and there is also the compulsory scene where a father has to cancel his walking plans with his children and wife because he is working. They run out of disappointment, but they understand, just like all the other times in the film, it happened. Only once would I like to see the youngest child turn to his father and kick him in the chicks and say to him: "You are a real bastard to cancel your plans with us. There is also the drama you will expect from his father when he realizes (the woman, actually ... the three children have no problem building dad) that he became crazy and he claims God wants him to build . a big boat. But do not worry. His family decided to stay with him. Oops, I just spoiled the drama. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this movie is that there is almost no good comedy. I know the decision was made to determine, it's a PG movie to get a bigger crowd response, but I don't think I'm in the minority if I think family humor is more than just guys in the nuts and animals are kicked. crapping. Maybe I'm wrong and that's how quality family humor is reduced. And if it is, please bring me more adult comedies, so I will no longer have to go through this crap (word not intended). <br /> <br /> The end is extra cheesy. Suddenly, the film takes a dramatic CGI-filled turn that lets me think about how terrible it is CGI. I bet it was expensive too. Finally, we are told why God wanted Evan to build an ark. And son, son, I have the reason why hated. I will save the details, but it was like watching or reading a murder mystery and being the killer, the one who walked behind the main character one second and had no lines. <br /> <br /> Oh and then there is a good touch at the end. The song "Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)" is about the credits and we are then subjected to the "dance" of the role. I don't get it. They spend 100 minutes unsuccessfully and make a comedy and then turn it up with a thriller. I swear I wasn't afraid to watch Steve Carell dance. There you have people. Evan Almighty is the scariest movie of all time. <br /> <br /> All in all, I thought it was a wasted experience. I am amazed by all the talented actors (Carell, Freeman and Goodman) who appear with Lauren Graham, the wife of Gilmore Girls who has proven to work out her from a paper bag. But most of all, I'm amazed at my willpower to actually go through the whole movie without going out. <br /> <br /> Rating: * from ****
