I really look forward to watching this movie. It had all the ingredients of a great tongue in the governor, but it didn't come together. Kevin Spacey's accent was tolerant, except that he sometimes forgot to use it and I'd rather not have Linda Fiorentino's light effort. She and Helen Baxendale were completely lacking in charm and personality, grateful, their screen children had a lot, so you could find at least some members of his 2 families who could find satisfactory. You can have spaghetti with the plot tension and I'm sure the writing was written by an adolescent schoolboy in an English high school competition. That said, when I didn't cut it, I was smirking so it wasn't completely wasted for 90 minutes. I found the remains of Kevin's face on the painting very clever and pretty funny. Maybe I'm a little difficult, but I expected some quality viewing and it just never came.
