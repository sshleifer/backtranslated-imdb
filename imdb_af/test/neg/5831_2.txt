Everyone in a while brings 4kids new shows for his company. For the past few years, they've brought pure gold like Kirby: Right Back at Ya! or Mrs Mew Power. But again, 4kids is off. CatDog is one of the examples. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to write a negative comment without basing the performance, but in fact Weekenders is pure refuse. It's all about a group that has an over active brain. However, the catch is anything he thinks is bad. It may sound good on paper, but after watching it, you'll realize how far away from this show. <br /> <br /> The Pizza Guy is a very stupid character. He is very one-dimensional, there really is not much to him. He is hyperactive, ending story. Although many people feel all the character is a rip of the South Park, I just think the opposite. Mechazawa from Cromartie High School is an interesting character, and he can make me laugh. Tino fails to do either. <br /> <br /> The cast for the show is no better. Like Tino's mother, they suffer from a lack of character. They just stick to one feature and that's it. The only redeeming quality is the fact that the display can melt you. Whether it's the scene may be funny or you can just grind, because it's stupid. <br /> <br /> Thje Weekenders is a very crappy Disney / 4kids show. Although it seems that some fans love it, it should really be left to the children.
