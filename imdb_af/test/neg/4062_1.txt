The plane is a 747 Jumbo. The cabin is at 747 on the top deck. In the movie the pilots do not climb the stairs in the 1st class cabin to reach the cabin. They walk to the front of the 1st class cabin and through doors in the cabin. What a gaff !!! The front of the first class cabin has a dressing room for jackets and a TV screen. In addition, the radar dome. Before the take-off a 747 is shown to start the taxi to the runway. At the end, the aircraft is shown to have only two engines. Area 747 has four engines. Who was in charge of continuity on this movie? During the early part of the flight, the front of the plane suddenly closes toilets - another fiery fork !!! Thereafter, the front of the aircraft becomes the back and vice versa. At this point I stopped looking. Absolute litter !!!
