I am also an SF buff, among other genres, and I especially like those 60's and 70's movies with their effects on effects, which have put so many intelligent and fun stories on display. In a nutshell, I totally agree with Scott's 886 review of this movie. I heard about this movie and I got a great expectation, and my expectations were raised with reviews that arrange the effects. from this movie "second best" to Kubrick's "2001 Space Odyssey". What a fraud. "Travel to the far side of the sun", was ordinary, winding, half-baked, crazy movie, with low amateur special effects (and remember I love movies of that era and despise CGI), and it can be fully compared to 60's SF disasters like "Marooned", which "Travel" reminds me a lot. The idea behind it all is not so bad, but the plot on a story of a twin planet to the Earth, on which the same world is inverted, asked a master like Kubrick to direct. Needles to say Robert Parish is nothing like that, so he produced boring and silly film. It looks and feels like a TV series of those days. Not worth wasting your time, even if you are an absolute fan of the genre.
