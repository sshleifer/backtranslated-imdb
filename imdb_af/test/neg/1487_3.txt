The Presentation is VERY Shabby. (to my mind) is often documentary documents. Michael Moore's "documenatry" - Farenheit 911 is far more convincing, but has too much media and political influence. Can't wait until Saturday when I see the docudrama "The Game of Their Life". IFC goes to the right of the center. I started a collection of IFC movies from the internet because of "TGOTL" *** from ********** on "Decade". Do you want to see good documentaries? Stick to the History channel. Or try docudrama. You can't go with them my friend. Can't go wrong. The seventies were ten years of revival. Or so, the old times will have to believe you. Disco died and it is gone forever. When Elvis died, yes, we all grieved
