Perhaps it was the fact that I saw the Spider man the day before I saw Duces Wild, but I don't think there can be any excuse for this movie that is so bad. The role-play was there to do it, but they seemed to have gotten themselves with a decent throw, they had to try to fit them into the movie. The only problem was that they didn't fit. I didn't like the characters and the story was at its best. I left why I spent my money on this movie.
