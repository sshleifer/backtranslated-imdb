This film is about a young man's painful journey to discover his sexuality. <br /> <br /> The movie is raw and unpretentious. It doesn't rely on steamy sex scenes to attract the viewers. Although the plot may sometimes seem disjointed and disconnected, some events are not properly explained. However, I understand this because this movie is a collection of memories that are very personal to the director. The sub-plot of about his sister and mother may not be in the movie, but I can certainly imagine that it is very important in his life. <br /> <br /> The low budget of the film is clearly distinguishable. It is a pity that the sound effects were poorly done. The narrative and some dialogues (especially the classroom in the French teacher) echoed so much, making it difficult to pronounce what is being said. The surrounding noise, notable traffic noise, is also captured throughout the film. When a scene cuts in another, the level of traffic noise changes. <br /> <br /> This movie is probably not entertaining, but it definitely serves as an informative diary of a young man's journey to embrace his sexuality.
