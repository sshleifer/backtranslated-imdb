I didn't read a time to death by John Grisham, and maybe it would have helped to understand the movie better. But maybe not. I hear this is the most faithful Grisham adaptation yet, and if that is true, I can see why so many publishers turned off the novel when Grisham launched it as his first job. <br /> <br /> A time to kill "is one of those movies that is seriously confused and wants to do too many things at once. It wants to be an exciting crowd-pleasing thriller and at the same time a film dedicated To some social and moral questions, let's see, the two types of movies don't go together in Hollywood, so "Dead Man Walking" needs to be made independent. <br /> <br /> The story involves a young lawyer named Jake (Matthew McConaughy) out to defend a black man named Carl (Samuel L. Jackson) to kill two hills that his young daughter raped, and the day before the rape trial, Carl was in a cupboard hiding in the court building and when the rapists were brought by the building, he charged them and both shot dead. film was completely unnecessary and only in the film for marketing purposes t. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, one of the rapist's infant brother (Kiefer Sutherland) was angry that a black man killed his brother and decided to retaliate. All these things lead to a shooting before the court building, a kidnapping, a brutal knock and a riot. I will admit that everything in the film gets a lot of attention, in addition to courtrooms. What I later objected to was the film's handling of ethical questions and the use of formulas in the plot. <br /> <br /> The main question the film is constantly asking is over and over again whether a black man is a fair trial of a white jury. Surely they can, but that does not mean that the man must be acquitted so that the trial can be fair. However, this movie doesn't look like that. In addition, there are several gaping holes in the plot used for amenities. For example, there is an unknown character called Mickey Mouse, who is a member of the Clan, and for unknown reasons, members of the defense team help get rid of serious dangers from the other Clan members. After Bullock was kidnapped by Sutherland and his company and died in the desert, this unknown person comes and saves her --- and we never find who he is and why he helps the people he has to terrorize. /> And about the Sutherland character's terrorist government, it's incredible how rude the police and the Bullock character stop him during the film. There is a scene when Sutherland is an assassin of a building across the street from the court building and is trying to shoot Jake as he comes out and instead shoots one of the guards. Now you think, since there are dozens of police, it will be easy to surround and catch the sniper. No such luck. From what we could see, no one seemed to be a sniper who was still going. Even after Bullock, Mickey Mouse rescued, she never mentioned who her kidnapper was, nor was it questioned. Why was it? Simple. The Sutherland character was needed throughout the film to add continuous tension, though logically, he had to be out of the picture. <br /> <br /> Besides Bullock's character, there is still an ungrateful character. He is Jake's assistant played by Oliver Platt. There seems to be one reason for his character to be in the movie - to provide a number of one-liners for the audience. In my opinion, one-liners show a great weakness in "serious" movies when used. It shows that the filmmakers are not convinced that the story and the dialogue alone is enough to keep the audience's attention, and use them to make the audience laugh to make sure they watch an entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> Enough of the movie's very small problems. What about the movie's message here? Clearly Carl is indeed guilty of murder. We saw how he planned for hours to kill the men raped by his daughter. The lawyers argue that it was temporary madness, etc. That caused him to kill. In despair, Jake asks the jury to close their eyes, as he fully argues the rape as part of his closure. After describing everything that happened, he added on one final line ... "The girl is white". We then see the members of the jury with tears in their eyes. <br /> <br /> In the next scene a girl comes out and shouts: "He's free! He's free!". Wait a minute! Are juries standing up to their emotions or facts? Most of all, why were there not scenes that the jury had deliberated and what they really thought after their emotions. I'll tell you why. They couldn't show the delibertie, because NO JURY can release a man from such a crime, no matter how much the defense's closures affect their hearts. What is the message? That someone is justified in killing if it is a form of revenge for a previous crime done to them? <br /> <br /> This film had the courage to say that murder is NOT OK in this situation, because in fact, there would be no acquittal. But since the dollar was at stake, the filmmakers were more concerned about enhancing the audience's feelings than they were about presenting a responsible message. If people start killing as a form of revenge, the makers of this movie should be held accountable. What a socially irresponsible movie it is!
