One of the worse surfing movies I've ever seen. This movie is so bad, I don't know where to start. Okay, let's start with the premise - a few mainland men who hardly know how to travel to Hawaii and enter a huge wave game that he expects to win more or less. A good analogy for those who do not navigate is that of an overweight chain smoker who hits a few running shoes and enters the LA Marathon with expectations of winning. Not at all! And the game is held at The North Shore which confronts images of 15+ footwaves, but match day is perhaps the 6 foot waves. The acting? What happens? If you have to see this woof, watch it on TV, don't waste your money to rent it. If you want to see a pretty good surfing movie, it's wrong, but it's another story - rent Big Wednesday.
