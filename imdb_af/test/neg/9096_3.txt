Gordon is on top in typical Full Moon fashion, but it can be expected. Combinations are surprisingly low key, keeping its performance at a more realistic level than we are accustomed to seeing. The usual Stuart Gordon's black-humor-in-the-cheek heart has also disappeared. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty effective at breaking down Combs and his final heroic act to save his wife and daughter. You actually feel sympathy for his character, despite his shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Personally, I was more surprised at the nudity and boundaries of the porn sex scene than I was shocked by the graphic violence and gore. /> <br /> Not classic Gordon, but definitely something you can enjoy when you see her more famous movies.
