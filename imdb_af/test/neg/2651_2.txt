Harrison Ford plays sergeant Dutch Van Den Broeck of the Police Service of the District of Columbia. He tries to get the bad guys, but doesn't do a very good job. When we meet him, he tries to find a corrupt undercover officer. Kristin Scott Thomas plays a New Hampshire Senator, Kay Chandler, who is trying to be re-elected. She runs against a candidate who has a lot of money. The last thing she needs is the death of her husband. She's a politician - she can't be beaten by feelings. <br /> <br /> This story moves slowly and painfully. I watch my watch every five minutes and wonder if it would be over! The story is lost in details that the director, Sydney Pollack, did not need to enter. We do not want to know about Dutch police investigations. They give some insight to politicians and the spin control they do for campaigns. After I watched the movie, I still wonder why they got involved romantically. Doesn't anyone mourn? Don't you need more than two weeks to even consider going with someone else? <br /> <br /> It was good to see actress, comedian, Chicago resident and Second City Alumni Bonnie Hunt. Her role is not necessarily comic relief, but she was the only one I wanted to see more. Do yourself a favor, wait for it on video if you don't want to see it at all.
