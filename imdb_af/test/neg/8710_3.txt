I watched this series of curiosity, to see if they could and could do with ALL modern technology, making Cecil B. DeMille's classic 1956 epic, featuring Charleton Heston, Yul Brenner and Sir Cedric Hardwicke. Of course, I was lowered. Yes, they did all the biblical characters, but they did not give us one of the spectacular scenes, which kept your interest in the first movie. If you are going to have a mini-series, you should have some "rocky" scenes, the "Burning Bush", which builds the "RED Sea", drowning "Pharohs Armies", "Sethi's Pyramids" could have been with today's technology on the scale of solid films such as "Lord of the Rings" or the Matrix. It was clear that they did not want a LAST impression of "faith and sacrifice", which is very much needed in these difficult times.
