The film is in Newcastle, Tyne, in East England, the town where I was born and raised. The film is also fundamentally dishonest - the way it represents the town, the children, but especially the men of the village. In this movie they are all stupid, violent, deceitful, thugs. <br /> <br /> I think I could comment on the plot (predictable), the performances (skillfully unattractive), the direction (lazy and imaginative), but for me this is all irrelevant to the director's insult for the town and its people. <br /> <br /> So the invitation in my summary to the director and writer, Mark Herman, to leave the northeast.
