This TVM has polarized views among the commentators on this page. Maybe I can fix everything by saying it's a very stupid, not very well-made television movie. How bad is that? It's a phone call that can't even decide what its name is, because while everyone in the United States calls it LINDA, it's known in Britain as LUST FOR MURDER and it's usually a bad sign when a movie needs to change its name . And I can also point out that it is not a tongue in cheek like someone else has claimed. I will be honest and say the plot is pretty good. Linda and Paul Cowley meet another couple the Jeffries, who get them very well together. They come together so well that they go together with each other. (Make your own mind if there is a woman to exchange) and Paul sees his wife murdering the Jeffries. Then the plot takes a shockwrite. <br /> <br /> To write the above paragraph, I suddenly realized the great potential the story had and I would say nothing to prevent you. It's just when the story goes on to the events I described, things are becoming unlikely and weird. Not only that, but the production values ​​are pretty unimaginable with the actor playing Paul Cowley, with a very woody voice that irritates, while most of the screens - outside and inside - look like they are filmed on a misty day
