Honestly, I'm not that impressed, it's not a bad movie, but it's not a big one either. There is a story to tell, but it is told in a very incoherent way, which makes it loose, it is full of meaning and ability to intrigue. This movie can be made differently with an outstanding result, the story is just as interesting, but somehow, I'm not intrigued when I look at it. <br /> <br /> It's definitely not an amateur movie, rather the opposite and some of the screens are really emotional. The actors and actresses do quite a good job and so the director does, but there is just as unfinished the whole movie I can't finger. Perhaps, if you got to know the characters better, all the "messiness" of the movie could be better explained and more "action" throughout, as it was slightly slow from time to time.
