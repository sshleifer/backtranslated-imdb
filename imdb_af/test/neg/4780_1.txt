The frightening thing about the new movie by The Newman Carter Smith's new horror movie "The Ruins" is the closing credit that comedian Ben Stiller calls as one of the executive producers. What did Stiller think of sinking his money into the colder over cursed carnivorous undergrowth that creeps on his victims and swallows them. Simple plan Oscar-nominated writer Scott B. Smith, adjusting his own bestselling novel, adheres to the standard clichés and conventions of all twenty bad sages, where reckless youths do everything but the sins of the evil ones beg them to eat. . Cretan characters were not enough to fight in this nihilistic nonsense, we are being treated to another movie where American tourists are in danger of being Americans. Furthermore, unlike really good horror movies explaining why the monsters have a need to feed, the Ruins give no explanation for the supernatural shenanigans of his villains. <br /> <br /> The set-up for "The Ruins" looks like the 2006 horror movie "Turistas" where clever South Americans trapped mindless American backpackers and harvested them for their internal organs. Indeed, "Turistas" generate some legitimate excitement and cold fever. "The Ruins" create nothing in the way of excitement or chills. A malicious mastiff who suddenly sits on the camera to sniff our heroes is as close as it gets. <br /> <br /> The rest of "The Ruins" borrows from another movie: "The Descent", a great 2006 fever on a bunch of babies in a nightmare experience when they have been lost in caves inhabited by albino mutants with a blood loss for murder. A few other films that are deliberately or unintentionally served also occur. They are the straight 1968 Hammer horror classic "The Lost Continent" on murderous vegetation that grows innocent bystanders in a sea of ​​abandoned ships and the Roger Corman cult class "The Little Shop of Horrors" (1961) on a New York Florist that unfolds the ruins in the picturesque, sunny Mexico where four American American colleagues, Eric (Shawn Ashmore of the X-Men movies), Stacy (Laura Ramsey of "The Covenant"), Jeff (Jonathan Tucker of Sleepers) and Amy (Jena Malone of "Pride & Prejudice") decorate their tequila-soaked spring break, Stacy loses a precious earring in a motel pool, but a useful Teutonic, twenty-something tourist, Mathias (Joe Anderson van Beethoven Copy) restore it, and the group embraces him as the newest best friend, these people live to party, and they have already made friends with a trio of Greek tourists, and Mathias tells them about his friendly brother who is a cute female archaeologist requires a remote Mayan pyramid donkey that is not listed in any travel books. He offers to take them along and accept them. <br /> <br /> First line of horror movies: If no one knows about the place you go, it's advisable to avoid it. Since they were only one day left and they didn't do anything adventure, we decided to join two of their Spanish-speaking Greek friend Dimtri (newcomer Dimitri Baveas) to follow Mathias and explore the pyramid. They take a bus inside Mexico and look for a taxi to take them on the next leg of their journey. A Cabbie looks at their card and warns them to stay away. Second line of horror movies: when the natives warn you to be clear, you hide. A sharp twenty dollar bill helps him change his mind, and he pulls them down to their destination and then hits a heartbeat. <br /> <br /> Soon our heroes covered the mysterious Mayan pyramid with undergrowth that looks suspiciously like a variation of Mississippi kudzu in the jungle as superstitious natives appear. They know that the pyramid is being pursued, and they murder Dimtri without a blast when trying to drive their fears. The remaining protagonists gather security on the pyramid while the paranoid natives surround them to prevent them from escaping. Eventually the vineyards glide out to greet our heroes and eat them. At this point, "The Ruins" is being turned into "Bug," the recent and ridiculous Ashley Judd skisoid film about your skin. For a long time, our heroes are in a useless attempt to extract the vines from their skin. One particularly horrific scene shows that the Americans are wiping out the German man's legs to save his life. In comparison, it makes the torture of the Spanish Inquisition blue. <br /> <br /> "The Ruins" rank as just another vineyard wasteland with nothing to release.
