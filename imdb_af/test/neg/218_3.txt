Incredibly disappointed. The pass was slow. The characters incredible and throughout the film as a whole, just let me feel bored and unfinished. There was no real plot that could turn you around the movie and interest you. The heist himself never got excited and didn't think well. <br /> <br /> There was not enough depth or background of any character and Laurance Fishbourne's character was one I was waiting for. Unfortunately, Laurance has no idea how to play the deaf brut and is much preferred as a lovely character. Columbus shortened one of my favorite actors (bumping the yard), leaving me with his performance, his character was dark and you could barely see what his reasoning was. <br /> <br /> The only character I think offers anything The movie was Milo Ventimiglia (Peter Petrelli in Heroes). Although his character is very small and insignificant, I think his touch has been added to a dim film. <br /> <br /> In the slot buy the DVD if you find a new way to waste your time.
