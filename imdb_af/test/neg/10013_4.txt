Here is a definite average Italian post-apocalyptic attack on hunting / killing people for sports theme ala The Dangerous Game, Turkey Shoot, Gymkata and the Running Man. Definitely the movie being reviewed here is nowhere near fun like the other listed entries and is further dragged by poor voice over work, generally mere action verbs, a number of completely tasteless scenes such as a long rape sequence and a few really stupid and illogical points throughout. <br /> <br /> For example, after the end of the movie, when our hero manages to infiltrate the villains. He initially kills a keeper and leaves him in his jeep. When discovering the said looks, do the villains react? (Considering the fact that our hero murdered them all brutally)? They decide to wait until the next morning to look for the guilty (!!!!!!!!!!) <br /> <br /> But I'm supposed to be fair, but the film remains vigilant as you can suspend Your unbelief during such stupid scene and benefit greatly from the presence of the always excellent Woody Strode (even though its screen time is very limited) <br /> <br /> Not a classic with any imagination, but still just about Worthy for a watch for Italian B-Movie enthusiasts.
