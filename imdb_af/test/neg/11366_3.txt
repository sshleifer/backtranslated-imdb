Not much to say except enough of Wire-fu and supposed Sholin monks who are about Kung-fu and caricature Japanese plot to take over China. All these things won't be as bad as they do for the totally fake Japanese sword. If you watched a Samurai movie or two, you can say that the "Japanese" fight in the movie is just the same "Kung-fu" (Really circus acrobats) stunt men who do the same things except with a Japanese sword. However, there are some fun moments, such as when a Japanese woman, Ninja, breaks down her tears in the middle of the flight to disarm a monk and catch him with a fishing net. Storywise, there seems to be a bit of schizophrenia as far as the Japanese is supposed to be completely despicable or if there are exceptions. The "Japanese" protagonist is considered to be largely reverent, but not beyond unjustified cruelty as when killing a sedated monk, so he can have his duel. Completely disappointing with a very stupid end. Don't even shout for a moment to shine the idea of ​​an epic battle.
