Perhaps the director is trying for another PIRATE (Good Garland and Kelly musical) - but this lame musical era is getting flat. Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson's voices do not mix well - and their chemistry together does not spark. The point of departure of Sinatra as a lovely man trying to personalize his old "bandito" dad is good, but he seems uncomfortable in the role. What is wonderful and wonderful here is how Sinatra can take a rather careless song and make it look special. His phrasing and eloquence as a singer make you want to hear it again. When Grayson sings the same songs, it's hard to believe she doesn't sing something completely different and not that interesting. She has her great moment with "love where you find it" that fits her perfectly and shows off her abilities. Photography is fun and both stars look attractive like costumes and sets. Co-stars Mildred Natwick and J. Carroll Nash have made a lot of energy in the impossible work. Apart from Sinatra's singing, there is a strange menage-a-tois dance with Ricardo Montalban, Cyd Charisse and Ann Miller. This is fascinating and strange. Montalban and Charisse were a wonderful dance team and this number is a real stranger.
