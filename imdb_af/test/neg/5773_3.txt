Oh, dear, dear. It really touches my nerves when a low budget, useless horrendous matter in the credits looks interesting by letting a lot of good names appear in the film, just to involve everyone in the smallest and most useless possible roles. In this movie we have Richard Lynch in one scene, an instant appearance of Martin Kove, a short spot for Vernon Welles, a little more time on the screen for John Philip Law and a little time for Karen Black. This bunch of random cameos doesn't really come up, though Richard Lynch and Karen Black make some of the little smiles of this movie appear, and it's quite painful as none of the lead roles is very good. I can't help but think that if more scenes are filmed with one of the b-movie veterans above, the movie will be much better, but as it is, there are only a few exciting smiles of good entertainment without the movie really really reaches entertainment value. Among the lead roles were the only charismatic or benevolent performances in my opinion, Steve Wastell, such as Axel and his girlfriend whom I believe was played by Elina Madison (never heard of her, but she has some screen presence and is' good viewer). The plot in this one is simple, and the evil, unpolluted miner goes to those who want to steal their gold and it has to make a good victim, especially as it is directed by John Carl Buechler. He did special effects for many of these things. kind of movies, including the fact that they worked all three major treasury groups (Halloween, Elmstraat and Friday 13) and such small jewels as Mausoleum. Unfortunately, the film unfortunately lacks in tension, likability and satisfying gore. There are one or two light greedy moments, but nothing is worth watching the movie, I won't say. In fact, apart from the above-mentioned comos, this whole movie is really quite silent and annoying with characters who couldn't get fast enough for my taste and an unfortunate lack of real interest. I didn't even find it fun in a laughing bad movie, because I'm very rare for me because I love very nice crummy movies. I want to say, avoid.
