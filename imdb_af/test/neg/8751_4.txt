As he pours out for water, a young psychic woman named Jessica Burns (Carolyn Kearney) pushes something else completely. She discovered a breast that had been buried on her aunt's farm for centuries. Instead of the treasure that her aunt hopes for, the chest is headed by Gideon Drew, a devil-maker who was beheaded by Sir Francis Drake. Telegatic control of the hired hand that opened the chest, will Drew's head be on a murderous spree in search of the rest of his body? Also buried on Jessica's aunt's farm. While Jessica is sure she feels the presence of evil, can she stop Drew's plans and will she be on time to prevent him from becoming completely? <br /> <br /> I thought I was previously familiar with most of Universal's horror outputs before 1960, but this is one of the 50's Universal movies that is definitely not mentioned very much. While the thing that can't die is not what I would call a "good" movie, it does have a few things to do with it. First, the movie has some interesting ideas and is actually quite ambitious. Director Will Cowan, or with luck or intent, can give the movie a nice atmosphere from time to time. And the special effects of the head are definitely gruesome. But the entire project is undone by the acting. I'm shocked to learn that some of the alleged "actors" in this thing have ever appeared in something else. You would think that for most of those involved it was a "one and a kind" movie. Kearney is the worst offender. She's terrible. Also, the thing that couldn't die might have been a bit too ambitious for its own good. Given the budget and other constraints, there was no way the movie could strive for its more lofty ideas. Finally, the movie ends quite suddenly. Just as things start to get interesting, The End. What is it about?
