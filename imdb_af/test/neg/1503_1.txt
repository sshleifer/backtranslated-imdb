I love low budget movies. Including those who are intentional or unconsciously funny, excessive false gore, violence, etc. <br /> <br /> It is beyond foolish however. Once you see the end, you will say what hell was the point of all the deadly scenes with no one to (except in a few) testify to them. AND how did the end really happen (I will not tell the whole story to those who are stupid to really watch it) Granny is like a psychic Jason. First she was outside the window with a corpse and 15 seconds later she was broken in the lounge. The whole thing is a set up for a newcomer. They pull out graphic screens, the brainchildren in the eyes, that only Chris Angel Mind Freak can pull. And again, the end was pre-posterous. 56 mins waste of time. I saw one of the directors other movies and it was almost as bad. Give me 20 big and I can do better. It really gets a big fat.
