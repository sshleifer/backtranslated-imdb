Terrible, Terrible, Terrible ... <br /> <br /> I loved the original movie. It was funny, charming and warm. This piece of junk has NO of those things. <br /> <br /> Reusable jokes from the original movie, stupid sites, bad animations, different voices (with the exception of Kronk and Yzma) that sound like nothing in the original (especially Pacha ... * shudder *) . <br /> <br /> The characters are off, the animation is flat and boring, it's just a bad job everywhere. <br /> <br /> And why is Kuzco back for a while? I thought he was reforming ... but since then this TV is a loyal version of the original * roles *. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but nothing is loose. . <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
