Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor are joining this comedy about the night club owners who are being squeezed by organized crime. Eddie Murphy wrote and directed this turbulent ego journey, so no one is blamed for himself but for his failure. It's a really bad movie, so completely without energy and humor that just serves as an example of Murphy's contempt for his audience. It will be remarkably easy to continue saving on this movie, but I will show it more grace than it has shown its audience and now stop.
