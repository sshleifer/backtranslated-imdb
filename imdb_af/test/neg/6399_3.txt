I just watched this movie and it had mostly a waste of time with little or no redeeming factors. I really don't understand where all the positive reviews came from - the animation is bunch and untouched. The plot does not make sense of an objective point of view and there is no sense of intrigue or tension in trying to succeed. himself as an intriguing and exciting film. I have never read the book, so I can't tell if the movie was true, but as with most movie adaptations, trying to fill in so much information in the shortest possible time. The result is an irreconcilable and illogical storyline that doesn't really make you understand or relate to the characters, or actually anything. Overall, I feel completely disconnected from the characters and the plot to the point where I could not care for what happened to them and the only way I can see how this animation can be considered beautiful is like your normal standard of animation is a Scooby-Doo cartoon.
