Harmony Korrine - Does he hate or hate him? This testimony can be a better word. Not he, of course, just everything he does. But it could have been so different, because the first ten minutes of this movie promises so much, including a fantastic idea that a Michael Jackson mimic will fall in love with a Marilyn Monroe mimic. Fantastic. And in Paris! It can be good. But unfortunately, Korrine can sparkle the strange decent idea, but because he is a terrible writer, the story at every level fails and the hearing that I have seen about an hour has been proven to be the most boring and pretentious movie there. . Apparently, the knockout rate at the Cannes festival's premiere last year was shocking. Instead of focusing on the two main players, he fatally switches the story to the borders of a castle to suggest a lot of other mimics that make the whole experience boring and hardly barren. When will the independent theater stop funding this startup?
