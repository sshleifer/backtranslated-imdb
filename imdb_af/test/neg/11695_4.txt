As for the Asian horror, I saw my share of the disappointments, along with some of the creepiest * imaginable ... "Acacia" doesn't really qualify for one of those categories. It had a few moments of tension and was interesting to look at, but I couldn't help thinking that this story should be a little more. The film deals with a childless couple who decide to adopt a child who has a captivating bond. He developed a bond with the Acacia tree in their garden and seemed to communicate with it. Then he stormed off during a fight with his mother who involved their new birth child, and threatened to get his dead mother who is now a tree. When he does not return, the parents send a report and wait, while the neighbor believes that he somehow inhabits the Acacia tree. The pacing is pretty slow and the end gets a bit odd, but I should recommend it as a little pleasant effort, though the story feels a bit flat. Hell, I can't really make my mind on this
