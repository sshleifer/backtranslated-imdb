I let a friend talk to me to view this movie, and all I can say is, I want to kill that friend. <br /> <br /> It's an hour and a half of my life. I will never come back and I will always regret it. <br /> <br /> If you've also had the misfortune to see this movie, you'll agree that it's the worst movie ever made! <br /> <br /> If you have never seen this movie and think to watch it, let me save you a waste of time and warn you: Don't see this movie, it's struggling !! <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie fails, the attempt at comedy and sexiness - it's just as stupid, trashy and disgusting. Try to have women in the movie who are actually attractive and sexy and not fat, ugly and coarse to look at! <br /> <br /> The acting is laughing like writing. Obviously it was made by total amateurs. I can't believe these people are allowed to make such a dumb movie, isn't there a law against it? There must be. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of good "b" movies if you are, but don't waste your time on this crazy movie. <br /> <br /> PEACE
