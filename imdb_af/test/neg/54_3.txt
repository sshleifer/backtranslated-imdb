1983's "Frightmare" is a strange little movie. The director tries to combine the atmosphere of classic '30s / 40s style horror movies with the shock factor of the then-explosive' 80s slasher genre. It's not quite successful (mostly due to many obvious budget constraints, and the inferior professional caliber of its role players), but it still has its moments, mainly due to the sophisticated performance (better than the movie deserves) by then German actor Ferdinand Mayne, who plays an outdated old-horror movie star (ala Vincent Price) named "Conrad Ratzoff". At the start of the movie we meet the dreaded horror star, as he is a trademark for denture and we soon learn that ol Conrad is a bit of a hoax, prima donna-juk-off. Just when you think he can no longer be unpleasant, commercial director Conrad recommends blowing a task for the umpteenth time and the old goat pushes him from a balcony to his death. Nice, huh? Conrad then visits a few fans at a college campus horror movie club, unfortunately he suffers a heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually ends up at his home to die. Still fine, even at the door of Death, he manages to deliver a despised business partner by suffocating him with a pillow before finally kicking the bucket. Conrad is then laid out in a true Hollywood style in a high-tech neon tomb with video screens above the coffin, which will play personal video messages from Conrad itself for visitors who enter their respect. <br /> <br /> is at this point that the children of the College Horror Movie Society decide to pay an after-hours visit to Conrad's tomb, break in the grave and take his body back for a whole night party. (Not exactly my idea of ​​fun, but hey, these are characters in an 80-year-old horror movie. Logic has no place here.) The college kids spend the night with Conrad's body sitting in a place of honor , position for photos with it and even dance around the room with it, before parking Conrad and his coffin on the attic, and plan to return to his tomb in the morning. Meanwhile, Mrs. Ratzoff, who robbed the husband of her husband's body, called on a psychologist to reach Conrad through a session. You can find out the rest from here very well. Since Conrad was not a very good guy in life, it is not much of a strain to assume he will no longer be friendlier in death. Psychic Lady makes contact with Conrad and wakes up in predictable demarcated fashion and then spends the rest of the movie around the corridors of the students' ridiculous big house, while the young grave picks robbers one by one. This is where the movie falls apart. Endless scenes of teenagers wander around empty corridors and say, "Hello? Is there anyone there?" are intervals with occasional bursts of violence (we get a nice slick deapitas scene, which is the highlight of the movie) before finally finding the last two survivors (WAY later if any semi-intelligent people would find the same thing. .. but again, we are in an 80's horror movie!) that the only way to stop the chaos is to get Conrad's body back to his tomb where it belongs. The sluggish pacing is poured out with very strange lighting and dry ice mist effects, supported by a soundtrack that is almost entirely of sound effects, rather than music (thunder, moans and groaning, crying, etc.) What after a while getting annoying. . <br /> <br /> I can't really recommend "Frightmare" to anyone who hasn't grown up to watch cheap movies like this on the 80's nightmare. "Modern Horror" fans will undoubtedly find "Frightmare" incredibly slow moving and goofy. If you got old-fashioned in that magical decade, you might get a nostalgia explosion from "Frightmare." Fans of Jeffrey ("Re-Animator") Combs can also look forward to this, as the future of dr. West appeared in an early role here as one of the unfortunate film students. <br /> <br /> I would recommend the reader to avoid the release of this movie on the EastWestDVD label (linked to Roy Ward's "Vault of Horror" and selling at dollar stores) because the print quality is terrible. I am told that the movie received a luxury release from the fine people at Troma, which looked appropriate. If you are a Troma kind of person, "Frightmare" will rise upright.
