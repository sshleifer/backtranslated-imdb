Clearly, Raw Feed Video is smarter than all of us wasting our money to rent this movie! They will make millions of video rentals and their low budget investment will largely pay, which will finance "Rest Stop II". I think they have spent a maximum of a few hundred thousand US dollars renting the actors, stopping the rest and burning a truck and dragging a motorcycle next to the truck for a little plus pay for the technical stuff . That's it. We all have to be as smart as these guys, I won't beat them to have the genius to promote a stinker in good monetary returns. Movie premium was good and it could have been a very suitable horror movie, but it failed by not delivering a clear story line. I'm always looking for a jewel of the startup movie companies, but I haven't found it here and neither. I'm sorry I lost $ 3.99 plus tax to find out.
