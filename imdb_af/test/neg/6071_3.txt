Terrible! <br /> <br /> Despite the good performance of Ed Harris, Diane Kruger, and the strong budget (the reason for the 3 stars), the movie is by far the worst I have seen of a composer, and the worst edition of a masterpiece of music. I agree with some fictitious things to upgrade a biography that might not otherwise be "charming". This is done in AMADEUS with the best results, but this B copy here is an error. Beethoven had a strong personality, but was a wise artist. Here in this movie, however, he looks much more like Mike Tyson! I also wonder if he had heard all the whispers in the last scenes despite his deafness (can be a cochlear implant?). I prefer to listen to the ninth on a CD with some beautiful maestro. Today most of their modern Wagnerian orchestras perform. By the way: I gave 10/10 Amadeus!
