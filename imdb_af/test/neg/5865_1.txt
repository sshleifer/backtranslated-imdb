We put through this movie and think why is this or that scene in the movie, what does it have to do with the plot? We hoped that everything would be slightly clearer at the end. It was not to be. <br /> <br /> I think the director in a fitness of pique throws the writing in the air and then some slight (and fierce) experience has randomly rendered it without filming (possibly with a scissors and gummok). <br /> <br /> The film's motives include: Communism bad? Nihilism Bad? Poor parenting bad? Triangles bad? TV bad? Coherent essay bad? Deconstructions good? It's really not clear. <br /> <br /> Lastly, no German water taxi would ever have an unchallenged staircase that dropped the passengers into the water. The abundant amount of "achtung" signs everywhere testify to this fact.
