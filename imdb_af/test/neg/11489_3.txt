When I saw that Icon was on TV, I was surprised. I know the first idea of ​​where it was going was the fact that it was on the Hallmark Channel. I was hopeful when I saw that FF was itself the Exec manufacturer, but saw very quickly that the only real way the TV movie and book were similar was just the name and the character names. The TV plot was a ho-hum to say the least, but I agree that the action was worth a 3 star. In my personal opinion, Mr. Swayze could portray a valid monk, but I think it would be for the film judge, it would have been a much longer movie and I don't think Hollywood would have gone for the plot. of discreditation by subterfuge. A case in point is the terrible movie version of The Sum of All Fears - should I say more?
