Let me start with a personal note as a movie and television buff, more on the enjoyable side of life. I love what James Woods can do and did, and I always love Melanie Griffith and Natasha Wagner were very good at this terrible, miserable, smelly, real crime setting. <br /> <br /> Whoever really wrote this role has never had time to talk to real criminals with real criminal talents. Yes, some thieves are junkies, but they have very short careers as thieves. . In fact, successful thieves are rarely caught because they do not "mess" or any drugs before they start working on a score. <br /> <br /> The James Woods character was true to this paradigm in the beginning of this movie, and then the writing was completely disassembled. He gets into a raging, alcoholic lunatic .... nice work for a tall man like Woods, maybe, but not at least credible. <br /> <br /> Most criminals are lazy. If they wanted to work, they would work. <br /> <br /> These people in this movie are beautiful, self-sufficient, drug addict narcissistic losers. They couldn't derive a real score in the real world, the real world where a big and cattle-like security guard who hits the living hell out of a slender child (as in the early scenes of this "DOG") keeps him knocking and don't let him go. Ever. <br /> <br /> How many ways did I find this movie hate? Very. Even utterly vulgar people - like most thieves and junkies - have a greater vocabulary than these criminals. And the rip-off scenes with the neo-Nazi bikers? Puhlease. All the rednecks are not after Nazis and those who are non-Nazi dealers are just not as stupid. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves a two because Natasha Wagner was extremely good in her role as Rose and because Melanie Griffith still has "something special", or at least she has it for this brutal and offensive stupid movie. I'm not one of any reason to sing praises to real criminals, but the reality of these criminal types in this horrible movie is that they would all be dead or in jail by Act 2, Scene 1. Look at a common zombie film. Spend time better than this .... thing ... and I hate zombies.
