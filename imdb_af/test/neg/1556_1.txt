This movie stinks. IMDb needs negative numbers in its rating system to properly evaluate this turkey. The acting is either wood or over the top; the movie was NOT written by anyone; and the samples are at best mediocre. Even as a movie driven only by the monster styles, those shots were so disappointing that they couldn't inspire sympathy for the rest of the movie. I want the 80 minutes of my life back that this movie stole.
