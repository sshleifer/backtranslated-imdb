What can be said about a movie about a cross dressing gangster? Not so much. With the average indie-style movie-making, this movie has everything wrong. Editing is just awful. As far as the gangster story is concerned, it would have been possible if the gangsters did not have character. Everyone looked like there was a kind of punch line. None of them were funny. The usual suspects in this movie are the hooker with the heart of gold, the dying mafia father who wants his son to legitimize his business, the best friend with the "zany" one-liners. But the main character, the gangster who likes to dress like a girl. Just his motivation to dress like a girl is that he is affected by a woman? Strange. The end of the movie had to be the nail in the coffin. It was anti-climate to say the least. I mean I understand how indie filmmakers don't have the equipment to perform a proper shot, but they can only use water rifles. Overall, I would say the hype that leads to it, (red carpet premiere in Vancouver), was a disappointment.
