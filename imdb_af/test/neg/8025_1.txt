After hearing that some of the people behind the low-budget flicks "Terror in Rock'n'Roll Önsjön" and "It comes from outer space ... and things" were involved in making this movie, I decide to buy it unseen on DVD. I wish I didn't. The other movies were funny, tongue-in-cheek and a bit silly. While Kraftverk 3714 is nothing short of humor. And it's so god-fearing that I'm angry, just thinking about it. The worst actors possible, the worst script possible, the worst special effects available. And the most unsexy sex scene ever. Uhhh. And the whole thing goes on for 2 hours and 45 minutes. Please, don't ever make another movie.
