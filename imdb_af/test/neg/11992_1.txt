Mr. "Your Fail" hits again, transformed a classic game into a cheap piece of crap. Poor acting; Poor directing; Awful adaptation; I mean, Far-Cry game was great, it's like a real FPS game, cool weapons and a lot of "point and shoot". In the movie we had nothing compared to the game. Well, we had the "point and shoot" thing, but ... I don't know how to explain, but if you've ever watched another "Your Fail" movie, you'll understand. If you don't believe me, go to the "petition online" site and check for one called "Stop Uwe Bowl". <br /> <br /> The movie made my eyes bleed, somebody had to stop him at once <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time.
