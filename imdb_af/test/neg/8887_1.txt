The chupacabra, according to this mockery, is a mysterious creature that kills and eats American and Mexico in Latin America. America and Mexico. One crossed the border to <br /> <br /> in the south of Texas, and a cute, intrepid cryptozoologist (no, I didn't <br /> <br /> make up) remote location to find one. Her uncle <br /> <br /> was killed by creation, and there are some grainy video footage of the <br /> <br /> sample. She takes a bad black man with a gun and two <br /> <br /> camera cameras (for easy modification), and they go for the <br /> <br /> chupacabras. Ten minutes in the movie they find it. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie has the team of documentaries <br /> <br /> attacked by the bloodthirsty monster, and stylized dialogue. At one <br /> <br /> point the team runs in a few hot witches that lead them <br /> <br /> to the chupacabra's nest ... for $ 100. If only the FBI knows how < br /> cheap Tex-Mex witches can be bought as informants. Whole <br /> <br /> dozens of mythical animal reports can be noticed with a <br /> <br /> blank check. <br /> <br /> In the end, after the bloody death of characters you don't give a kid, a chupacabra is captured, killed and <br /> <br /> revealed. The only point of the autopsy scene is to emphasize the <br /> <br /> make-up section's efforts in such a cheap movie. <br /> <br /> The movie was shot on video, just like "BWP," still the cameraman <br /> <br /> characters never recharge their tires or recharge them <br /> <br /> batteries not . The main actress here is terrible. The beauty of the <br /> <br /> average "BWP" was the use of improvisation during production. <br /> <br /> Here, all the lines are written and become like a weak <br /> <br /> Practice Christmas show. <br /> <br /> The film was also raced. The only African American <br /> <br /> here is a noisy cannon nut. At one point, as the crew <br /> <br /> breaks into a deserted home, they find a trio of illegal immigrants who <br /> <br /> ask their comics if they're from the INS. Chortle, chortle. <br /> <br /> The monster itself is a guy in a rubber suit, and nothing more. For <br /> <br /> such a clumsy and uncomfortable animal, he can <br/> <br /> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> throw, or they have idiotically closed <br /> <br /> in a giant cage as bait, or don't look like they just started <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> The gore is gruesome, but when surrounded by this kind of stuff, it loses all its efficiency. I don't know if it was <br /> <br /> shot before or after "BWP" but I can honestly say it's the worst <br /> <br /> movie ever made in southern Texas over " a mythical animal. Pray <br /> <br /> There's no sequel, I'll start a letter writing campaign <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> It's rated for strong physical violence, gun violence, strong <br /> <br /> Gore, and Curse. <br /> <br />
