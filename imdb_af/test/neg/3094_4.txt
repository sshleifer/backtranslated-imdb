directed by albert piun in his unmistakably terrible but odd hypnotic style, "crazy six" is another jewel in the crown for this decade's upscale hugo rabbit (jess franco?). "Stylish" exaggerated, incoherent plot, time-outs in the middle of action sequences for Eurodisco torch - solid performances, it seems to mean features for our man Pyun. Most interesting is how he always gets top-notch b-movies, compared to Wynorski or some of the other video directors. Ice-T, Rob Lowe, Mario Van Peebles, and the very strange Burt Reynolds are not a bad role, although they often look a little confused. Look at "Postmortem", "Mean Guns", & "Omega Doom" for more top-notch Pyun Mayhem!
