Okay, I thought it was terrible. But when I saw it, I proved wrong. Emily Bergl did an excellent job as with Jason London. Sue Snell was underutilized and signed. The meanies were ok, Dylan Bruno and Rachel Blanchard are definitely the outings. As for the things the teenagers do and how people claim it is all wrong. Whatever. My friends and I used the term 'swank' a lot and I drove a car and sent someone while I changed. It's almost all there. I have never been to an after-party party in a house big with its own light show. The deaths are good. The best includes a few glasses, a spear gun and a swimming pool. All in that order. I have to say there will be people who hate it but I'm not one of them.
