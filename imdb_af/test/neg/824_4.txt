If I compare two films with Sacha Cohen, Borat and Ali G, Ali G is immensely better. I'm not a masterpiece, but at least it's a movie. Borat is full of garbage and I don't understand how it rated better than Ali G. <br /> <br /> I can't put my finger on it, there's something wrong with the Ali G script: half of the jokes are as if written by a 15 year old, not by an adult writing writer. And a number of jokes including Mr. Cohen's lower body are rather tasteless. <br /> <br /> But the movie actually comes together as a comedy and there are also funny jokes that are funny: like how Ali G becomes a member of government to do something shameful and stupid in public ( unfortunately where in today's western society: people get careers to do stupid things in public, also Ali's advice on immigrant policy and some others. <br /> <br /> Ali G overall remains a sympathetic character, though a kind of spirit is underdeveloped for his age. But it's good to look, it's pretty funny. <br /> <br /> But never see Borat, it's terrible and sick every intelligent movielover.
