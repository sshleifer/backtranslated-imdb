I have to say it's better than most SyFy outings, but it doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> The plot is that someone buys a game made from the bones and skin of a dead witch of the Spanish Inquisition (and no one ever expects the Spanish Inquisition!) He and his friends play the game, just to break halfway through when the friend who has gone on the run is killed in a way that predicted the game. <br /> <br /> What follows is a series of killings that are typical of a movie like this, or any of the final destination movies. It has the puzzle at the end and the interesting subplot with the police wanting the game to bring his family back. But otherwise it's just a mess.
