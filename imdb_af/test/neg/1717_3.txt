I have read all reviews for this directly to video films. I can agree that the movie is not "Armageddon" or "Deep Impact" quality. Yet, if you are looking for a way to pass ninety minutes or so, then it is a movie that is bearable. <br /> <br /> Early in the AM hours, I watched the movie while doing some geek stuff. It was very nice, because I could switch between what I did and watched the movie, without missing a rhythm. It's a predictable movie, and the acting is not at stake for some veteran actors (for example, Dennis Hopper). <br /> <br /> But I have to point out that I only paid $ 2 (US) and As the old saying goes: You get what you pay for! If you are looking for a deep film that will have to look over and over again, then it is definitely the long video. On the other hand, if you are looking for something to pass the time, there is nothing wrong with Tycus. (What's called "Comet: Final Impact" in Mexico where I got this video).
