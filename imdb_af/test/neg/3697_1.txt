I saw this movie because it had a huge person and was marked as a monster movie. I don't understand why it's called a monster movie. The movie is a drama. I expected a lot of destruction, but what did I get? Most of the movies were relationship problems and people thought a woman was a wage because she had seen a spacecraft accident with a huge inside for an inexplicable reason. The action started a few minutes after the end. Since the woman was killed, is it not murder? Could they have done anything other than killing her? If you see it, because you expect it to be action because it is marked as a monster movie, you shouldn't see it. It's not a monster movie. It's a drama.
