This is the first time I need to comment on IMDb, to write some review, and it doesn't happen very often, but it's not a very good movie, but a very scary a. <br /> <br /> Take the latest narrative style of the Max Payne video game series, a cast of virtually unkonwns (which is not bad), poor dialogues, dark screens, but not enough, and make a movie of it. Don't worry about the bad acting, the length (far too long), the lack of immersion (the main character must be one of the most interesting things I've seen long ago - couldn't care less if he died) or the often ridiculous solutions they find for certain problems, find the main character himself. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't have written anything if it wasn't for another review here and it gave it 10 stars. I gave it four, but maybe three are closer to what I feel about it. Not only do I want to see it again, but the mere thought of it takes me dangerously close to killing myself. Oh, and a so-called noir movie is nothing without a good soundtrack - not the case here. The finite song sounds like it is more suitable for a western movie. <br /> <br /> It's not novels, it's not action, it's not noir, it's not good. That would be my rating if it wasn't for the minimum of 10 lines.
