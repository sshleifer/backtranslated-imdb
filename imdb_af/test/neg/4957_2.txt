Jack Brooks (Trevor Matthews) is a college student with serious anger issues. His family was brutally murdered when he was a child with a monster, and now he takes his anger over everything and everyone. <br /> <br /> So when his professor (Robert Englund) starts showing signs of monsterism, he learns he must control his anger and use it for good instead of evil and fight the creatures that have been his nightmares since his fatal ghost night. <br /> <br /> Really deserving its B rating, but what was cool about it was that it didn't focus on crappy B-rated CGI graphics. In fact, 0% of the film was CGI. The samples were actually properly assembled, and although the storyline was missing, it was somewhat noticeable ... than for just once.
