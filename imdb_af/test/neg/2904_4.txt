I remember remembering to catch this movie on one of the Showtime channels. What stood out for me is that this movie is completely in Phoenix, Arizona. I'm from there so I can easily spot the places. <br /> <br /> Regardless, a ninja kills a scientist because they wear yellow jerseys and golf pursued by the police. It takes about half of the police force to take him off and when they finally kill him, there are no noticeable bullet wounds. However, his spirit remains when a woman finds her and touches his katana. <br /> <br /> From then on, she was taken possession of from time to time and killed police officers who killed the original ninja. Then another Ninja comes from Japan to kill the evil Ninja. It might be a plot device from the previous two movies, or maybe a plot hole. All I know is that this movie is very champion, bad and entertaining. It's something to watch with a car of popcorn, and several friends and give it the MST3K treatment.
