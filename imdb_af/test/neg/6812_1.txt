Have you ever had one of those nights when you couldn't sleep and just switched on the tube to see what's going on? This is how I ran over these trips. For myself I would have thought better to throw and turn for the 97 minutes I wasted with this movie. <br /> <br /> In his attempt to be "real", these movie characters come as gangsta stereotypes such as the story of a Wayans brother movie. The dialogue? Please! It sounded like a white man tried too hard to write this movie. <br /> <br /> Editing was terrible. One of my "favorite" scenes involves a car behind a bunch of narrow passages. Cut into the characters being chased and drive through a park with baseball fields in the background. <br /> <br /> When any of our "homies" are shot in this movie, he bleeds miraculously by clothes that are no longer, which is more than I can say for the plot of this predictable charge ... . baking soda. <br /> <br /> Indie movies can be good, even if they are low on budget and effects, but they still need a cinematic integrity. If I could give it a 0, I would have liked it. If you see it, I hope it's on cable, because even the cheapest rent will be too much to pay. Actually, 97 minutes was too much to pay ...
