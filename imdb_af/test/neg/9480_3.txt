Oh yes, I admit that I was guilty of the crime of seeing this piece of garbage. I cannot say that I was forced by strangers who pointed a gun at my head, tied me to a chair and made it impossible for me to close my eyes and then turned on this terrible excuse for a movie . No, I did it with free will. I deliberately tortured me. Let's go through the fact here people. - The play is an insult to humanity. - The plot (if it exists) is ridiculous. - Character development is terrible. The characters appearing in the movie are so clear that you will recognize them in your average comic book. - Editing is sloppy and unattractive. - The camera work is low key. - The dialogue is simply the worst in film history. - Directing: well, let's say, I bet it wasn't Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> Adding to these facts, there was absolutely no talent involved ever. The director now has to smoke to forgive himself for the sake of this poison to the world. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Passport to Paris is one of the worst movies ever made. PERMANENT!
