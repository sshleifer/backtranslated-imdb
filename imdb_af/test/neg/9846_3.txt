This movie was horrible in one word. It was boring, predictable, and straight creepy. I was waiting for it to end and when it did, I was shocked. The end has left a bad taste in my mouth to say the least. My advice to anyone interested in movies about emerging female sexuality: stay away from this movie. Movies like this give classics like Lolita a bad name.
