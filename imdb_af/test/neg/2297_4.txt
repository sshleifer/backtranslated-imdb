The glorious Edward is raised in the world when his supervisor tells him that he can drop that dirty Swedish drama movies and go to the platter and gore section with the stairs. Excited with his great expectations for the new kind of movies he will soon change, he asks all sorts of questions about wages, his workplace and lunch. Well, not really. Edward may be quite the opposite. Calm, stuttering guy, in addition, he has glasses. With the exception of being mad. I think it created a very creepy atmosphere. Evil Ed is for all reason a Swedish film, but somehow a magical force came over the good actors and changed their beautiful Swedish accent into stereotypical American voices. I think it's some of the expertise an actor needs today. The acting is a lot. Wood, as in them, is inflexible, not flexible (though hey, what did you expect?). In addition, the movie has a theme theme song, which looks like its E-Type. Anyway, it just makes the movie experience worse. Since I have been pretty hard against this movie so far, there will usually be a breakpoint where I show the level of happiness. But there really isn't much to say. The blueprints look good, but somehow 'Hanz' spelled coffee over it and partially destroyed it. So I look at this movie. If the movie ended where Edward was taken to a spiritual institute and resettled the parts of where he went mad and killed people, the outcome would have been much better, but that's just my radical view. I also want to see more footage of the loose limbs films. <br /> <br /> There are also illogical things to discover in this movie. Let's say the actors are really American, who lives in America, why should they work on a Swedish movie, as Edward did? And also, the deliveryman, why is it that he never uses the doorbell directly next to him? Instead, he left with soft on the door. Good old Edward really has good ears to hear all this while he is saving. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie has its moments, it's just a pity there wasn't so much. But that doesn't mean I wouldn't recommend it. It's a pretty cheap movie, go ahead and buy. It's almost like I see a pattern for the prize and the movie. On the other side; If you like to watch print movies cut through the second, it may be IT. My verdict would then be a stone solid 4.
