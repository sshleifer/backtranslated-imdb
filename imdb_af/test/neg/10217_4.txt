Alert: This review contains large SPOILERS. Don't read if you're planning to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Judging by the number of votes it got (my voice was the fifth) very few people know or care about who Mimi Lesseos is. Well, back in the late 1980s, professional wrestling was pretty decent. An overall woman's federation opened the Ladies Professional Wrestling Association. It was a big league, and Mimi Lesseos was one of the names on the grid. I always thought she was one of the best people the LPWA had in terms of ringing ability and acting ability. Unfortunately, the LPWA closed in the early 90's, so it was only natural for someone with so much talent than Mimi to start an acting career, right? But surely there was an alternative to such things? This movie is really bad. As it goes, I have now compared it to an underrated movie called Survivor Quest. Only this movie has all that Survivor Quest has made enjoyable. <br /> <br /> When I started the tire, I quickly moved forward through the preview to get to the tire's meat. At first I didn't pay much attention, but then I realized that the preview for a movie with Mimi Lesseos was. "Oh," I thought, "here is another movie in which Mimi is looking." But as the preview dragged, I became aware that it was a preview for. "Beyond Fear!" You know you're in trouble if the only preview at the beginning contains the movie you're about to watch! The plot of this thing is fairly standard. Lesseos plays an ex-kickboxer who is found guilty of injuring an opponent / friend. She therefore focuses on her second career that she shares with her friend Sammy: a wilderness guide. On this occasion she gets a group of three couples. Two of the couples are just there to take up space. You think one couple, a Caucasian man and a Korean woman, will be investigated as there is a problem between them halfway through the movie, but it is ignored in favor of repeated jokes about trees in the forest, which the Korean woman consistently frightened. . The joke is funny the first time you hear it, but it's definitely not by the ninth time they do it. The third couple is just painful to watch: it consists of Mr. A wife. They trade insults back and forth, and Mr. Page uses his video camera for the art of voyeurism if he is not making cruel jokes on his young wife. Just like your typical American couple! Before the hike Page Page on two stupid guys and their prostitute. One of them accidentally kills the prostitute and finds out that Mr. Page it pasted. So the danger begins, as the two guys follow the group on their journey, and we wait and wait and wait and wait for them to finally do something. When they do, it's a fiasco. <br /> <br /> You can't blame the role. They try as hard as they can with the material they need to work with. The chief lady is director Robert F. Lyons, who has to go back to play some parts and stay out of the chair. Lyons starts and stops screens in such a messy, sudden case that you start thinking he's been suffering from dyspepsia throughout the shooting. There is even an incompetent moment when a broad daylight scene is slipped with the thugs between some night scenes. Then there's the audio section. The music and background noise dominate the dialogue so you have to move your ears right next to your television's speaker. Don't put your head on the screen! It's not worth hearing the badly written lines. In light of poor writing, Lesseos gets some credit there as co-author. The few interesting developments between characters are often left for shots of the thugs or bad practical jokes. Early on, Lesseos knocks a rogue with a switchblade knife, so once you think they are in danger of the two stupid drugs. When the rascals finally get their back points done by Lesseos in a good fight and long fight, our crowd all laughed a lot, despite the fact that one of them was shot and bleed everywhere. Yes, everyone is happy in the end. Everyone except the poor souls who experienced the movie, who wanted the good old glory days when Mimi played in the wrestling ring. Zantara's score: 4 out of 10
