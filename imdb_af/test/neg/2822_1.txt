Sex, drugs, rock & roll are without a doubt the worst product of Western civilization. The monologues are both uninteresting and useless. In the rare monologue that takes the audience's attention, it is quickly lost by too much repetition and unnecessary additions (The Hells Angels at McDonalds are at stake). I think Bogosian's one-man show needed fine material for a length he thought would justify admission. <br /> <br /> I'd rather sleep with my aunt and hang upside down and drain my blood than to see sex, drugs, rock and roll again.
