Four young high school girls testify to the murder of one of their classmates during what they thought was just an innocent match. The murderer is a strange young boy named Milo Jeeder. Sixteen years later, the four survivors of the event reunited in happier conditions in the same town where it happened. They believe that Milo drowned in a river shortly after the murder, but soon learned that the demonic killer Milo had also remained unchanged for another two decades. <br /> <br /> The cover for this movie makes it look really cool (yet I still expect a bad movie to come out). When I put in the DVD in my player, the menu comes up and still makes the movie cool. Unfortunately, this movie is not all that I am excited about. The movie is your average effort to make a treasure trove and if I mean, I mean just like all the other small-budget treasure movies that have never been welcomed with open arms in most members of the watch community (I'm talking about you , the horror fan). In other words, you can run on any horror fan and the majority of the answers will be this sigh. <br /> <br /> What mistakes did the movie make? First, the DVD cover art makes Milo look very dark, but they blow it all by showing his face in the movie in many different scenes. He had the potential to be a very freaky character. Secondly, tell the backside of cover art Freddy, Jason, Chucky, etc. to pack and unpack their bags, because Milo is so much better ... why would you want to say something like that when it comes to a no name, low-budget slasher movie which of course failed? I mean, it just increases your expectations of the movie, which makes it harder to impress him. In a last ditch attempt to attract attention, it says (in very large letters) "From the creator of Anaconda". Just show how low they get as much attention as possible for the movie. <br /> <br /> The gore in the movie sucks, the director gives you a few passing corners when Milo attacks someone. The music is not that bad and I have never fallen asleep in the film (congratulations). I'm still trying to find out what Milo is. My best bet is that he is a zombie, if someone else knows, tell me. Be assured, I won't lose sleep anymore if I think about it.
