Well, now I'm pretty sure my summary got your attention and my comment that Zazu Pitts is Satan is not without any basis. Let me explain. The film initially looks a dull B-movie about a bad organization called "The Crooked Circle" and their vengeance vow in the form of murder of a competitive organization dedicated to the resolution of crimes. While it is very strange (especially the idea of ​​a club of private citizens who solve crimes) and may have been interesting, this film falls apart, despite an impressive list of well-known supporting actors. Why? Well, because Zazu Pitts (never one of my favorite actresses) spends most of the movie just like Olive Oyl with a bad toothache! While murders are being committed, people are kidnapped or whatever, you can always count on full volume Zazu - almost like someone's trivial 3 year old who wants everyone at a party to pay attention to her! At the same time, she is NOT an integral part of the movie, but has received top billing. Why she's even out there is me - I suppose it's just screaming and screaming. As a result, I found the movie virtually irreconcilable and it was completely destroyed. Now you probably know why I'm referring to this actress of dubious talent as "Satan"! I'm sure when the actors in this movie saw the final product, they also felt the same way I did about her terrible, persuasive and amateur performance. <br /> <br /> This movie is in the public. domain and can be found for free download on the internet. I can see why.
