I was more entertained by watching my wife almost frustrate her hair in most of this movie. I thought something that would link it would just be around the corner of the milk shed. So I cheated, grabbed the distance, and was relieved to find that it ended in just 20 minutes. I had to change the channel. Cute, it has potential, but yuck!
