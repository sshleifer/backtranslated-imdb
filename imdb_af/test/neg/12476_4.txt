I'm amazed at the enthusiastic response to this movie. It seems to me boring, as much as I enjoyed watching Penelope Cruz, and the plot details often worked out poorly. It also looked like an intense sexist movie: if the gender roles were reversed, almost everyone would be in the arms with any sense, and complain that the movie was intensely misogynistic. It is not only that both the chiefs are portrayed as full-fledged and sexual predators, but also that the women are portrayed as almost flawless. They form a utopian community that has no conflict of any kind and is based on merciless generosity and good humor. Utopias are notoriously dull and this one seems to be no exception. But it is also interesting to see what happens (and here the plot comes away, but it refers to a very early scene) when the teenage daughter kills her father. (1) Her mother hurries to take responsibility for it and (2) the daughter almost has no remorse (and in fact her emotional life disappears from the movie). It is not quite a glorified murder, although Aldomovar's camera on the blood moves in a bloodthirsty way, as if it is an attractive painting, and then it wakes up and is out of sight without a daughter or mother not material or emotional, too bleeding. Later, the film shows another murder, again by a woman's husband, and again it is a murder that implicitly endorses the film. In short, Volver is an ideologically-driven film with an unpleasant and in fact a contradictory ideology. so I write an ideological criticism. But besides, it's just not very interesting. It has nothing of the depth, says Aldomovar's Talk to Her, which I loved.
