It's hard to see a movie that comes out in every aspect, but "Caligula" should surely keep this title. I'm not sure what is more terrible; the violence, the sexual perversion, the acting or the plot (or serious lack thereof). <br /> <br /> The two and a half hours basically follow the ascension of the infamous Roman Caesar "Caligula" to the throne in AD 37 and show the atrocities and perversity he suspected of being in power. The acting is lifeless and boring - but it is just the tip of the iceberg. It is clear that the directors decided to throw in as many nudity and orgy scenes as possible. But don't be deceived, but relieve these scenes or focus away from the spectacle of this movie. The camera work is clumsy, dialogue is laughing. Finally, congratulate Malcolm McDowell (playing Caligula) to keep such a straight face through such pharynx lines. And then there's the violence .... <br /> <br /> If you want to see the movie, be prepared. Some atrocities are committed in the film (not just by writing), but by disgusting acts that are of some or other purpose than rejecting the viewer. These are just the goals this movie has achieved. One has to wonder how the creators of this movie thought that bestiality, neck profile and castration (just to name a few) would attract someone. When it ends in two and a half hours, you don't take any of this movie other than some disturbing images and the knowledge that you may have seen the worst movie ever. <br /> <br /> You're warned.
