It's a student movie and it's a piece of crap. I will use much stronger language to describe it, but the review will not be posted and the world should know - beyond any possible reasonable doubt. This movie really looks. <br /> <br /> There is another ruler used to measure an already well-known director's early work. Like somehow it was genius that we were just too stupid to understand, because he managed it today. I don't buy it. The early movie "Bad Taste" made by LOTR Peter Jackson's sucks and this "early work" of another famous director sucks the same way. These "early works" are representative of crappy everything, from budget to scripts to actors etc. It's all at the bottom of the bucket trash. Don't be fooled by the big name. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a handful of males, 70-year-old hippie burns are as if they could ever command a ship with the worst special effects you've ever seen. It's your movie. . <br /> <br /> I can't f * 37449 believe this thing won a golden movie for the best special effects. That's a joke right? Or a joke award? <br /> <br /> If you want to see what this movie wants, it was a season or three of the Red Dwarf you hit.
