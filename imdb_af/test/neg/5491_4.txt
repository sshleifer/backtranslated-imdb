It is partly accidental for "Illuminata" that it comes out to Shakespeare in Love, as it deals with virtually the same themes of life as art, art as life and the Magic of the Theater and the same archetypes of Theater Folk, but much more perverse . <br /> <br /> There are scenes alive, like a play developed and reinterpreted by a writer's life, but there is a lot of Orson Welles-ish ego in this set by / directed by / directed by John Torturro as a vehicle for his wife, Katharine Borowitz (with a beautiful cameo by their son). <br /> <br /> Each actor literally gets his / her moment in the spotlight, but there are so many "masques" or set pieces that look like the 19th century salon games. Bill Irwin talks. Susan Sarandon becomes a diva. Christopher Walken gets another kind of villain - a gay critic. The women have to move unnecessarily because it is an art film. <br /> <br /> The art and direction are wonderful, but pretty dark. It should be an award as the best use of a Jersey City Theater as a set ever in a movie. (originally written 8/21/99)
