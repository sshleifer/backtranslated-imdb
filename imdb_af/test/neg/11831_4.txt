This is a semi-fictional memo from an "international man" who has had several political unrest over the past 30 years. <br /> <br /> I was hoping this movie offers unique insight into politics and war. I also hoped it would touch and influence. However, I was disappointed with this movie. "Chico" was fragmentary, with the main character, Ricardo, in one country for 10 to 20 minutes. As can be expected, no detailed storyline can be worked out in such a timeframe. The excuses to move him to another place have often been perfected. The result was a disappointing collection of fragmented clips shot in different countries.
