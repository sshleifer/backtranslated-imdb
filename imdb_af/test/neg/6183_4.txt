I have read all the complimentary posts on this polluted semi-noir and are confused with the high respect for what in the cruel light of 2007 looks like a very untidy late-night assembly line product. All the endless documentary footage of fish, waves, fish, waves has little to do with the central conflict and just pushes the time. The editing is straightforward: Scenes only end and are followed by other scenes that have little to do with their previous ones. The dialogue contains the stylized traces of the origin of Odets: high-flying metaphors that never came from the limited imagination of this working day people. But what is really surprising is how terribly the triangle is overshadowed on all sides. I love Stanwyck, but she snaps and exchanges and lashes out of game - an undisciplined show several notches below her standard. Douglas, who survives to be affectionate, then goes on a murderous rampage and is also hammy, as Ryan sniffs and shouts most unnaturally. The less interesting second couple gives at least a recognizable human behavior. However, Keith Andes, whose character is a kind of Neanderthal according to today's standards, is smooth and persuasive as Stanwyck's (much younger one supposed) brother and Marilyn Monroe as his girlfriend are natural and untouched. On Monterey's windy coast (and all the Monterey footage, while largely irrelevant, is interesting as a document of how the town looks), amidst all the overheated hysteria, these two islands are common sense. A final point and a spoiler: Perhaps the Breen office authorized it, but does anyone believe the happy ending for a second? Stanwyck may have temporarily managed to obey, but I give the marriage a month.
