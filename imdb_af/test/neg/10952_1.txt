Wow, I said it would be a B movie worth watching. I feel that I have been deceived after seeing this preview event. The plot is at best a twisted film of several films. Even the title is another movie if you can give the movie so much credit. I'm sorry to say I've been taken to the cleaners. I won't waste your time on this one. This movie seems to be a bunch of wannabes that came together and made a bad idea of ​​a movie with a borrowed camera at a weekend. Being in the entertainment business, I can judge a decent movie and this one must be earned or discarded. My advice, stick to a classic like the 1979 Dawn of the Dead. On a scale of 1 to 10, even a 1 is good for producers because this movie is BLOWS. (Under the limitation of what sucks) The producers must stay at their day job. If you see the movie, please. Honest in your posts. This one appears to be refurbished and inflated by some. There are a few who have seen it for what it is and are posted correctly. Sorry, but I must say this is one that must be skipped.
