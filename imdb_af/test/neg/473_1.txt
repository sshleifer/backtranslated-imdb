Let's get one thing out of the way. I'm a BIG Bruce Campbell fan, I have the Evil Dead series, have the action figures, and have seen Bubba Ho-Tep. I'm a fan of cheesy, ridiculous horror flicks and know how to appreciate the whole "it's so much good". <br /> <br /> I wish I could say the same about this movie. I watched this movie with high expectations, I wanted it to be good, campy, something from the VC that we all know and love. It started promising enough, but after the first 20 minutes I apologized for the rest of this sorry movie as if I were just shooting with tranquillizers. <br /> <br /> The idea itself is not a bad one; two men do not come together, both murdered by the same psycho-woman, half of one man's brain is transplanted into the other's head, they argue, disagree and come to the comedy. <br /> <br /> What killed me was how extremely disorganized and boring it was! It had potential, even as a campfire to be so much better than it was. The plot was boring, even Bruce's physical folding stick couldn't make it work. <br /> <br /> Word's can't even express the ridiculous robot that Bruce's wife's brain eventually abandons. Easily the worst search engine I've ever seen (even for a B movie.) The whole idea is stupid. <br /> <br /> What hell went through Bruce's mind when he made this steamy pile is beyond me. Why didn't Ted Raimi walk to his big brother, ask him to put some sense in Bruce and not to talk about a nice movie about a budget outside of me. <br /> <br /> Shame on your Bruce !!!
