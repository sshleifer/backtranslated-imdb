This movie was awful and finally wondered why someone had bothered to make it. Now it was not bad, I studied film and this film is very well composed and has very good movies with interesting angles to very nice lighting and excellent camera work. I wish I could have seen it back in school because it would have made a good movie to write a paper. BUT ....... Since I graduated and lost most of my film prediction, I realized that a movie should be especially entertaining. This movie is long and boring and I don't know when it finally pointed out that it was worth my time. <br /> <br />
