The film is visually stunning: from the dusty interior of the church to the illuminated stove, through the dripping street and downhill to the lightning that is the climax of the film. It also has a wonderful sense of time, both 1950s (opening the movie) and the 1960s. All the performances are top-class, especially Mathew MacFadyen as the psychotic minister and Gerard McSorley as the father who finds his own intolerance satisfactorily by his son. What a pity, then the story is so ridiculous. First, concentrating on the relationship between Gabriel (McFadyen) and his family, it becomes quite impossible to show how he managed to keep so much influence on the community. In the church we see five or six of the main characters in the front, and two or three in the back, but the rest of the congregation may only be mannequins: they show no sign to hear him, obey him or distinguish from him off; At the cockroach no one says exactly or no when he disrupts the proceedings, but also does not admonish or condemn anyone when Caroline throws a pint over him; A situation that leads to a stone thrown by the bar window is mysteriously solved by the onset of labor pains. Secondly, Middletown (which is actually not a town but a small town) seems to lack essential services such as police and fire services. Murder can only be handled by a relative with a crow; residents watched an inferno threatening to devour the whole town as if they were at the theater. For the case, everyday things like telephones and newspapers are strikingly absent, the rural community is alien to farm animals or wheat fields, and the most confusing of all to a 'typical' Northern Ireland environment, there is only one Christian community - Not even a few Anglicans to season the mixture. Even if you are willing to suspend unbelief, the story itself is beautiful, a pale imitation of an A.J. Cronin melodrama. And the music? Well, it's beautiful for the first two minutes, but if the same four chords are stopped for 90 minutes, it becomes more than a little annoying. My advice: look at the sound.
