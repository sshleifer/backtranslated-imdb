I know many people will claim some movies as "the worst of all time" but I think Redneck is making a claim for this price. A combination of very scary of both Mark Lester and Telly Savales and plot progression that convinces faith. <br /> <br /> On Telly Saveles: Was he drunk when he acted? He seems to be playing a slurry, laughing, curly, without beliefs. Maybe he mixed his medication with his whiskey, I don't know. <br /> <br /> At Mark Lester, a performance more wood than a carpenter's workshop. His cut British colors are not in this movie; and his transformation from the sheltered teenager to the gangster's pupil in 24 hours is angry. And the strip scene with Mosquito doesn't have any relevance to the plot; Perhaps the director likes this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Plot logic: when Memphis and Mosquito start the car, why does Mark Lester's mother not get her son out of the car? , before the wages turn it off? She just lets them go without saying a word !! On the other hand, Redneck must be seen - you won't believe how bad it is!
