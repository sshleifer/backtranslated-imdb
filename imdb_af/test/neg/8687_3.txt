The Evil Here begins on 'The Street of San Sebastian 1683' as the 17th century treasure ship the El Diablo sink into a violent storm. Jump to the San Sebastian Strait Current Day where two divers explore the beautiful underwater coral reefs, which are rich in wildlife, come across the sunken wreck of the El Diablo and explore it but are attacked and murdered by something that looks like an evil eel. Captain Max Cash (Wayne Crawford) owns and manages a boat-for-hire called the "Vagrant Viking" which caters for tourists who want to fish, dive and generally explore the islands. Sarah Livingstone (June Chadwick) is an art teacher who treasures a treasure hobby. Well, we have to do everything to make the right time?), She hires Max and his sly-dressed assistant Tracy (Sheri Able) so she can try to find and get the El Diablo. Speaking of sinful treasure generates some of the more unscrupulous members of the local community, as they evade the criminals and thugs, it is brought to Max & Sarah's attention that El Diablo has a sinister past, a past that still seems to be leaving behind the supernatural heritage. even now ... <br /> <br /> Targeted by Jean-Claude Dubois, according to IMDb, with some help from star Crawford, although the version I only called Dubois thought, The Evil Below has some potential and is a little different, but unfortunately it is not enough to save it from sinking to the bottom of the sea like a rock. Arthur Payne's writing begins with the two divers killed by some sea creatures, but this opening is never mentioned again, the creature is never seen again and there are no more supernatural murders. The Evil Here is a serious and terminal case of identity crisis. It does not seem to know what it wants, as it experiences pieces and pieces of different genres from underwater adventure, horror, action, thriller, crime & It even has time to throw in some murder mystery and religious nonsense. As a result, evil here feels very bitter, fragmented. Since the best scene in the whole movie, the opening sequence I found myself is becoming more and more frustrated because there was no consistent horror, as it quickly ran out and the fact that we never see the sea life again. Evil Below are dull, slow, unpredictable, predictable, stupid and lacking any kind of charm or intelligence. In short, the evil Here's nothing doing a good movie. <br /> <br /> Director Dubois Fails To Do Things, Although Of course He Shot A Lot Of Underwater Game, I Thought I Looked At A National Geographic Documentary With All The Shots Of Fish, Coral And Wildlife in general. Forget about any gore, a little blood-stained water and blood-coats are about as greedy as I am afraid. <br /> <br /> Technically The Evil Below is very basic, it is slim and completely forgotten, except beautiful underwater photography fish. It's point and shoot things and as a whole the production values ​​are very low, even the place where it was shot doesn't look very sunny or attractive. The play is poor, but again you expected something else? <br /> <br /> The Evil One below is a poor movie, the basic story is everywhere and it cannot decide what it wants to be & as a result it eventually becomes a mess. Add to the low production values, the fact that there are no gore here and absolutely minimal horror content, you have a movie that is probably best avoided unless you are absolutely desperate and even then there are better ways to get 90 plus minutes to spend your life. .
