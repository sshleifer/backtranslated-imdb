Christopher Lambert attracted me to this movie. What a waste! The plot has more holes than my rope. The special effects weren't very good, it didn't do much to find out who the mother's mother was and the creature owed more than a small debt to Predator. Anti-climate this movie could have been much better done. However, this raises an interesting point. When will Hollywood discover the rich vein of European folklore out there, just waiting to be exploited?
