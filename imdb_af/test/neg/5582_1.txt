It's amazing how a movie can take so much time and effort and become innocent. For those who appreciate valuable special effects and unimaginable detail in every shot, you will see this movie in awe. Usually because Predator Island does not contain anything. This is an excess repetition of every horror monster movie in the past two decades. Now I appreciate bad horror movies, they have some flash of humor in the most dramatic circumstances. However, if your goal is to create an unforgettable job that will be in the Cult Hall of Fame, my first suggestion is a little imagination / creativity, plus a little talent. Oh, and a few extra money to put in your picture. <br /> <br /> One horror movie tradition is to shock the audience with violent deaths and gore. However, shock does not deliver more than a few seconds. To actually pay a satisfactory response from the crowd, there must be b characters, some identifiable features. I know, you probably say this man doesn't give anything to the filmmakers, he just says an amateur comment. Well, it's about showing you how amateur these filmmakers are. <br /> <br /> Despite the horror of watching this movie, there was a silver lining. The performance by Dan Gordon as Chris is wonderful. He gets nothing to work on a screenplay and yet he can come out of the movie like a star. From all the actors he is the only one who believes in what he recites. He not only offers the audience to someone we can identify, but we also have someone we look forward to watching so we can get the rest of the movie. Gordon shows real talent and the ability to pick up quality work and overcome a major stumbling block, the rest of the role. Then Gordon will be a star, hopefully sooner than later. That is, if he can get rid of such films that will keep him back.
