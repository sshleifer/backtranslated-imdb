wasting 1h45 this nasty little movie is one to prevent, it's like a cheap bad cross between the saw and some other recent movies about kidnapping, why the author wrote it, is obvious. He has no soul and has done it to try me some money. The twists were obvious, when those in danger could escape, they made the obvious and not so on. Only good thing is this. I discovered one new actress that was worth watching. are too much better looking movies to watch than what will make you unhappy and think less of the world. Spend your time wisely, watch good movies, practice, cook a nice meal. Anything else wastes your time on garbage like this
