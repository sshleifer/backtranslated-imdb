This is one of the worst movies I've seen for years. The storyline has potential that is never realized. The actors are a poor choice but in the light of the writing magazine their talent is not wasted. I really wanted to kill everyone as soon as possible so I could see something else. Unfortunately, I stayed at the end and laughed at the rumors of people moaning about how crappy it is. There was no booing, it was England, but only discouraged about how shit it was. Then I look at IMDb and see 288 people give it 10 out of 10. I really can't see how those people can give that score. They must be a PR company working with the distributor. There is a hilarious problem at the end of the movie, when the church in the cemetery and the bumpy lookings look out for the dodgy scenery that is being pierced when touched (supposed to be a brick). The blood effects are waaaay OTT - the movie feels like everyone is making a ghost except the director.
