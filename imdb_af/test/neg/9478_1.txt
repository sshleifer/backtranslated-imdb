Just what the world needs - another superficial cookie cutter Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen movie. This movie gives horrible messages to girls everywhere, complete with stereotypical "junior high" experience. They make learning anything looks completely taboo. I can't endure the fake French accents, or the guys on the mopeds drive around who eventually fall for the twin. Why do I put everything in brackets? Because they are all diagnosed. The twins even complain that they do not have a stereotypical grandfather. They must be happy that they even have a grandfather. How does this fit the Mary-Kate / Ashley shape? This one determined them to be a single man who (gasp !!) IS NOT THE FATHER !!!!! Yes, people, they actually have a mother who appeared for five seconds. I didn't even sit thirty minutes of this and I can tell how it will end. This movie is so miserable, it leaves Miss USA looking like an academic bowl. Really.
