The thing that is really scary about this is that the filmmakers thought they were doing something intelligent and sexy. Instead, they probably made the dumbest horror image of the year! <br /> <br /> This movie starts with a lot of art snob friends at a gallery. This trashy European weirdo walks up and begins pretending fertile fertility to the main character, and sounds like he's just walked out of a Dark Shadows episode. He then offers her a little to smoke (yes, a freakin stick), which she eagerly agrees with! He took out some red khaki and put it in a spoon so she could freebase! If it ever happens to you in real life, don't! <br /> <br /> She is transported to a strange wannabe Jean Rollin netherworld that is supposed to be sexy, but it is not, where is something like a rotten creature of the black lagoon! <br /> <br /> Soon, she changes all her artificial sleazeball friends into her new form of supernatural crack. No matter how much these idiots freak out and turn blue they can't leave hell alone. At one point she even makes out the rotten creatures! <br /> <br /> After the final blow and the stupid woman has evaporated or whatever, the so-called hero is left alone to pack his copy of Michael Moore's Dude. Where's My country and can't resist smoking, holding on to trying to save his lady-friend. What a dope. <br /> <br /> Rates four stars for mere unintentional humor.
