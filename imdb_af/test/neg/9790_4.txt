This is a strange movie. It seems to be aimed at a younger audience, but is filled with sexual innuendos. The whole point of departure is rather absurd, not just the idea of ​​a few crippled heads of three dead children fighting crime, but the same said children who adopt a gang of tough older guys are a bit far-fetched, but again the Parents are mostly absent from the film and there is a lack of authority figures to keep the children in line. <br /> <br /> The movie is good, but Meg Foster plays a very nice mafia leader, with the handsome AJ Damato as the leader of the bulls. Aerky Egan and Rebecca Herbst are well-cast as young lovers, but for a comic actress of her talent, Leigh Allyn Baker is ravaged in this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is unusual but I don't have it Don't think it's enough to make for the poor quality and bumbling performance. The scenery is rather dull and the "special effects" are pretty gloomy. Turn this one off unless you are in the mood.
