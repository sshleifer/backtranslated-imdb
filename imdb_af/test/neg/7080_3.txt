The biggest problem with "Looking for historical Jesus" is that there is not so little at all. Shick-Sunn produced these "documentary" films in the 1970s and only in the 80s, who had interviews with "experts" and discussion of "science" and "facts" to make a case for whatever the title of the movie was. cash in. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "Historical Jesus" is little more than a third-class dramatization of Christ's life. Unlike Shick-Sunn's more superior "Looking for Noah's Ark" who spends most of his current time, discussing the possibility of the ark resting on earth today and where it may be, this film is basically the story of Jesus made no effort to prove or disprove his existence. The well-known Turrin garment is mentioned, but little other detective work is given much screen time. <br /> <br /> For fans of these quasi-documentary films such as "Jupiter Menace" and "In Search of Bigfoot", etc. , this movie doesn't offer much.
