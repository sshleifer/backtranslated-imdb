Imagine a movie the complete opposite of Lawrence of Arabia, instead of having a male cast, it has a female role. Instead of being in the arid deserts of Arabia, it is in the emerging metropolis of New York City. And instead of being one of the greatest films ever made, it is one of the most sensible, boring and forgetful. <br /> <br /> The film concerns Mary Haines (Meg Ryan), a perfect woman and mother, the envy of all others in her high society Manhatten social circle. She was painted as a woman wearing the weight of the world on her shoulders, despite the fact that she needed a life in nanny and household to handle her one child. But I don't want to make her too hard, Mary does all this while giving her a liassez-faire attitude to the fashion design that her father has given her. However, this idyllic lifestyle cannot last forever and things start to collapse in the right way. <br /> <br /> Mary's husband was deceived and her father burned her not to work hard enough. She is very naturally upset and breaks down a bit. <br /> <br /> However, Mary has to play back for her impressive young daughter and herself. She does it through rehab, straight hair and the design of her own clothing; but incredible for this kind of movie, not a montage. Maria succeeds; her daughter loves her, her mother loves her, her friends love her and her husband decides he loves her now. She decided to take her deceiving man back after she realized it was her fault that he was deceiving because she didn't cover him enough. <br /> <br /> The movies are a saving grace that is not the "all people are wrong" route.
