Poor political action. Badly photographed, acted and directed. Every single scene is underlying, including the very few being shot during the day. No matter what the location is. At a major conference in the White House, no lights are on, and the only available lighting is a bleak blue that is filtered through some windows. The primer of China is conducting a devastating phone call under conditions of such intense chiaroscuro that he must consider a bust of Homer in a Rembrandt painting. Honest. It's as if he had a small spotlight on his face and otherwise in total darkness. The slow motion deaths are now mandatory in any ill-considered film. <br /> <br /> Roy Scheider and Maria Conchita Alonzo are doing well, but Scheider is rarely on the screen. The other performances are inadmissible. There is a cute oriental woman in a short tight dress that is a rifle and is straight out of a Bond movie that accentuates a childhood in Basset, Nebraska. And who had to stay the model she probably started. Whoever takes on the surviving Secret Service Agent aboard the ship is probably chosen for the part because he looks like Johnny Depp, not because of any talent show. The Chinese villains, who represent both Taiwan and mainland China, swallow and grab the heroes. <br /> <br /> The writing is pretty horrible, recovering from other, better movies. There is a lot of shooting aboard the ship and virtually everyone is crossed. Two thirds of the way through, the ship explodes into the expected range of fireballs. Then divide the movie into two related parts. Share one, another shooting, this time in a waterfront warehouse. Part two, an exchange between the vice president, now acting president, and the oily Chinese premiere, came from both "Dr. Strangelove" and "Fail Safe." We unknowingly introduce our missiles. They start themselves in retaliation. We cannot convince them that our launch was coincidental, although we offer to help them destroy our own missiles. There is even the George C. Scott / Walter Matthau general who claims that their "nuclear" armor cannot match us, so we have to hit them with everything we have. More fireballs. <br /> <br /> The end doesn't come too soon.
