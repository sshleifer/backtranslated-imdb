Does anyone know the alternative comedy show OFF THE COMBI STRIP? An edition of Charles Bronson (Robbie Coltrane) interviewed on his new movie GLC: <br /> <br /> "It's about a man, an ordinary man whose wife and family are wiped out by creep and I have to hunt them and kill them in a sadistic and graphic way "<br /> <br />" And after GLC next for Bronson?

COLD IN ALEX AND THE FAVOR OF NAVERONE Two very much appreciated war drama often shown on Sunday afternoons. Believe me, this movie will only be shown to the watershed
