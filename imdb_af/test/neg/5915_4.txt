Produced at a point in his career, where he had the juice to do what he wanted, Eddie Murphy was given the task of producing, directing, co-writing and starring in HARLEM NIGHTS, an expensive but ultimately empty gangster saga about a group of black nightclub owners / gang members running a rally club during the 1930s, led by a wisecracking hot shot (Eddie Murphy) and his adopted father (Richard Pryor) and their efforts to prevent them from being overwhelmed by white gangsters who think they are taking grass It seems they are rightfully thinking of them, simply because of their color. It was an idea that probably looks good on paper, but it certainly lost something in the translation. It was a nice piece for Eddie and I think he spreads himself a bit too thin here to be the whole show here. It was a pleasure to see Murphy and Pryor together on the screen, but the rest of the great supporting role, including Arsenio Hall, Redd Foxx, Della Reese, Michael Lerner, Danny Aiello, Jasmine Guy, Thomas Mikal Ford, Stan Shaw Eddie's brother is actually very precious to do (though I will admit Murphy's battle scene with Della Reese is hysterically funny and probably the best scene of the movie). Murphy has thrown a lot of money into this movie and much of it is on display. The art and direction are impressive and the stunning costumes had to be won by an Oscar, but this one was a big mistake for Eddie, as he was definitely trying to wear too much.
