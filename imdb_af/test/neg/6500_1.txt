If you are planning to schedule your movie festival program, don't be fooled by what it says in the booklet. It is a total waste of time and energy. I looked at Bunuel, I saw Dali and admired them. but it is not surrealism, it does not have to be. Did they never think of the reputation of human race while taking this picture? After we have become extinct through global warming, it will be the remains of our civilization. What if the strangers sample it as an example of our intellectual capital? With all due respect for the effort put into it, it might be a good idea to end all copies of this movie - or whatever it is.
