Directors of "The Messengers" Danny Pang and Oxide Pang are responsible for "The Eye" and the sequel and play their leading American photo as "The Grudge" song in a farm. A family of four moving from Chicago to a run-down sunflower farm in rural North Dakota. Just start their teenage daughter, Jess, to see ghosts. Of course, her parents and the police are skeptical. In addition, the movie is well made and there are two or three effective scares, but too much on 'boo' effect. But the plot is a carbon copy of many ghost stories and the end is anti-climate and stupefyingly awful.Scares are also on the low side with a tendency to CGI. Generally, the messengers are a beautiful, weak horror. film that simply does not deliver from 4.
