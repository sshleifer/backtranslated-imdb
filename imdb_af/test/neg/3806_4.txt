Stodgy drama with Pat O'Brien as an excited reporter appearing on his former boss's home to ask for money to fund his son's operation, just to get him killed on the floor. Since O'Brien knows the guilty identity, he offers the rap in return for the money he needs. A decent point of departure is wasted on a movie pretending to have surprises, twists and turns, even if it really is. The performances are rotten about the board, the movie is like a hard boiled American noir, but the mix of dodgy accents doesn't work and the story is almost poignant. And it may contain the least attractive screen saver of all time.
