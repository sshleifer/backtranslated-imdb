There were many "spooky" westerns in the 30's and early 40's, and while it's a strong start, it's not one. Randy Bowers (John Wayne), who stops at a 'Halfway House' salon, finds it full of corpses, the bartender's body carried over the bar, carried a gun, eyes looked at Randy from behind holes in the eyes of a picture is cut, and a player piano plays "The Loveliest Night of the Year." <br /> <br /> It was the result of a robbery by the Marvin Black gang, to get Ed Rogers $ 30,000. Randy is an investigator who "works alone", wasting little time to be arrested, escaping (with Ed's daughter Sally's help) and literally landing in the middle of the Black Bend's hideout behind a waterfall. It all moves pretty fast. Only one too much chase after Randy slows it down. <br /> <br /> We even get George Hayes, cleanly shaved and playing two parts - Marvin Black, the villain villain, as well as the Good Burgers, Matt the Mute, who communicate via handwritten messages. He played two opposite roles, but it was a good idea, but writing messages, it is getting fast, even for him, and finally giving it to the end of Sally. "Oh, I love this!" You can find George playing a dirty, dirty, double-crossing villain in the series "The Lost City" (1934). <br /> <br /> I think it's the only 'Lone Star' movie in which the title relates or is called in the movie! Sally gives her hand to Randy and says, "He's no longer alone!" Then cut their arms around each other while looking for a lake. Sally's run-off with Randy seems too sudden and not adequately prepared. Too much time spent by the horse escaped the sheriff. <br /> <br /> Not so badly considering everything, but not so well. I really give it 4 and a half.
