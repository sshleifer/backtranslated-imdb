Stars: Hayden Pantierre. <br /> <br /> There are so many movies that have exactly the same plot, and this one is just a bad rehashing of it. Popular white girl moves to ethnic school, doesn't fit in, is soon accepted. Originality is not here, nor is it laughter. It uses so many old bad jokes it is irritating. I don't know why they think it's a good idea to make video sequels to mediocre movies, but that's not. Having said that, the positives in this are that all the people in it are fairly capable actors and actresses. <br /> <br /> My rating: * from ****. PG-13 for language and sexual humor.
