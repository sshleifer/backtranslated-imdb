I watched DEADMASJINES as part of BCI Eclipse 'Drive-in Cult Classics (with Crown International Pictures releases) on DVD. As I work through the multiple DVD sets, I grow a lot of Crown International's movies - especially the creepy, erotic, psychic thrillers! <br /> <br /> DEVICES are not one of them. <br /> <br /> Having seen movies like MALIBU BEACH, THE CREEPING TERROR and THE ROUND ANGELS, it's hard to say it's the worst movie. ever made; but it is not much for it. <br /> <br /> No plot; really no story to talk about. <br /> <br /> The play isn't clear ?? only the actor responsible for the terribly played Tony (with the thick, fake Italian accent) made an effort to "come in character." <br /> <br /> The score is annoying and pedantic. <br /> <br /> The only thing about this movie is why ... what forced the filmmakers to make this movie? <br /> <br /> Have the story of: 1) three ninjas, 2) two competitive crime bosses, 3) a complementary bartender / karate school student character; and 4) his zealous love interest nurse was so compelling that the world would not be complete without this movie being made? <br /> <br /> It's a total waste of time and money, for you, me, the producers, writers, actors and the director.
