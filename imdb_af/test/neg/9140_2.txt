I'm a huge fan of both Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi, but this movie is just not good. The judge below is quite correct that the beautiful images of the Detroit station are the first and last memorable scene in the film. I really wish I had left afterwards, instead of continuing with hope in the film. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I felt dropped. <br /> <br /> The score is almost completely rehashed from the previous two - not necessarily a bad thing if you are a fan, but there is only one piece it considered me fresh. However, it was good enough that I would probably watch the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> But just keep this in mind if you see this movie: if you at any time realize that you don't enjoy, go ahead and divide - you won't miss anything because it won't be better . <br /> <br /> I'll even give the executive summary here (warning! spoilers!): many shots athletes who look almost good enough for a Nike commercial, shots of smiling people, inexplicable, dim foreheads of famous people Woolen moths (WTF, do they think here?!?), a few giggling babies (cuuuuute), a few "bitchin" "Photoshop effects, a few images intended to compare the flow of water, suggest information, money and people (I think) ... and then a lot of fast unrelated scenes of mass violence ... and then a bunch of inventory space. <br /> <br /> I can retry this movie in 10 seconds. Here's my pitch: <br /> <br /> 2 seconds of a happy dad with a shaved head and lycra pants playing with a toddler playing with a kitten playing with rope; 5 seconds from that scene in "Network" where the guy talks about the "elemental forces of nature" and how "money flows in, money flows out;" 1 second by Reginald Denny is bristled with a brick and then 3 seconds by Alan Bean reflecting on the moon. <br /> <br /> There you go - it's just 88 minutes and 50 seconds of your life I just saved. Of course, I want to get a copy of After Effects and apply a filter or two, so it won't look as blatant as it is. If Steven Soderbergh reads it, hey, I won't even need much money for this project ... <br /> <br /> If you insist on watching a movie about "Life and War", I suggest For "Bowling for Columbine" instead, it may not have the pseudo-intellectual veneer as fashionable under the black-tailed crowd, but at least it's funny.
