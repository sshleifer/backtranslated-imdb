If there is one thing I want to distinguish from all the other great judges here, it's that I am the Queen of finding strange films in thrift and dollar stores. That said, you can't possibly imagine how happy I was when I found this one. <br /> <br /> I can even remember that Saturday morning when * every * station simulated it, so you were stuck if you wanted to see something else (then again I think it was the idea). As a child I did not know if I looked the way all the different characters were kept together (there are some crossings that just do not * work). But I think the special has the intended effect. Don't do drugs because you'll have nightmares over the Muppets. <br /> <br /> Now, if you see it as an adult, you'll be treated to the * strangest anti-drug movie this side of "Reefer Madness". I think I'll leave it first before I get in trouble.
