This movie is about pathetic, spoiled, ego-driven winners who think they have something interesting to say, performed by pathetic, spoiled, ego-driven winners who think they are interesting. Straight from the cobblestone gutters of New York's artificial, shocking drama scene. <br /> <br /> How many viewers are kneaded to make them think it's a dust, is a mystery to me. Perhaps they are also in the secret of this overpaid and overestimated "actor guild" or perhaps they have never seen a decent role? <br /> <br /> Get out, put your hands in the dirty earth and get a real job. Otherwise, kill yourself with a real gun.
