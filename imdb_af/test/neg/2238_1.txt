Inglourious Basterds IS Tarantino's worst movie he ever made. It's full of its usual ingredient ie funny dialogue, brutal and sudden violence, but it all feels deja-vu. The direction is typically Tarantino and nothing seems to be newcomer. It's almost as if he's copied exactly from his only masterpiece, Pulp Fiction. <br /> <br /> There is nothing new or exciting about Inglourious Basterds to be honest, it's just a war drama that's not funny or brilliant like Pulp Fiction. Basterds is thought to be Tarantino's tribute to Leone's Spaghetti Western, but apparently has been misplaced and out of place, especially with the persistent use of great subtitles and balancing the public.
