ZERO stars out of **** <br /> <br /> Endless Descent has absolutely no redeeming values, be it the ridiculously bad act, the legally terrible special effects, the incompetent direction, the silly writing or the grim annoying musical score. It's the kind of zealous production that makes me wonder how a movie like this might even have the slightest consideration of being in the first place by a studio. <br /> <br /> I don't think I'm going In the plot plunging, except saying it's about a lot of people trapped underwater and killing many deadly creatures. <br /> <br /> Let me go into more detail about what is so terrible about this movie. First, the play is simply horrible. Jack Scalia is ten times worse than Sylvester Stallone, a performance that is hard to reach as it is. The supporting actions aren't really better. And what about the actor Luis Lorenzo, the man who plays the chef, Francisco. He has a high voice and an accent suitable for a comedy, not a sci-fi horror movie. <br /> <br /> The special effects are even worse. The creatures range from sumptuous peas to giant starfishes and "compliments." The effects look like something you'll see in a muppet movie, and I don't believe I have to go deeper into this issue. <br /> <br /> Director JP Simon has little cult status because of all the horrible movies he is making. I'm sure some of Endless Descent will enjoy an Ed Wood type, but I don't even think it's so good. Everything he does is slim, especially the camera. The man can't lead a movie. It's the last of four underwater movies. It makes sure Leviathan and Deep Star Six (Both bad movies in their own right) start to look masterful in comparison. Anyway, just stick to the precipice.
