Why did I have to go out and buy (yes buy!) JACK FROST 2: REVENGE OF THE MUTANT KILLER SNOWMAN ??? Perhaps it was an outbreak of temporary mental disruption? But I guess, because I enjoyed the first JACK FROST. It was a stupid but funny horror comedy that had some good effects from Screaming Mad George. This and the fact that on the back of the successor this beautiful picture of this man was hit by this giant icicle (coming out of his mouth with lots of blood and everything). So I thought: if it's as idiotic as the first and has a beautiful splatter in it, it should be fun, right? Well, I was so dead wrong! <br /> <br /> Let me first say that the movie earns credit for a very crazy and delayed plot. I mean, a mutant killer snowman on a tropical island that produces mutant killer baby snowballs, which can only be killed or harmed by bananas ??? As much as I like, I hated the movie. First of all: while the first JACK FROST looked like a real movie (apparently being shot on the real movie and everything), this sequel has the look and feel of a third-class soap opera. It also has a smooth shot-to-video look. The lighting is just awful (bright white spots look for the day, and stupid colors like blue and green at night). The acting ... doesn't even go there. The dialogues range from stiff to extremely senile (the Jamaican man was just moronical and says "man" to every sentence). And when it comes to the voice of the killer snowman, everything I could think of was a seventh-course chucky from CHILDREN'S GAME, spitting dumb and so-called witty one-liners before killing anyone. <br /> <br /> The best joke was where one man asked, "Why are you talking to your watch?". And the best scene was undoubtedly the one with that beautiful Asian chick coming out of nowhere and taking a swim in the pool completely naked (thank you for that!). Oh, and that little scene about the final credits with the two Japanese dudes on a miniature ship being poorly baptized, also laughed at me. But the worst thing about this movie was: Where were the gore and shattering action everyone was talking about? There were many opportunities to show some decent gory murders. Many people were killed here in original ways, but all outside the screen. As I read in many other remarks, there was indeed a good intent for a head explosion, a broken body, emitted eyes, the tongue broke out, but at critical moments, the editor cut to some blood splash on the floor or nothing at all. That leading shot of the British man who was placed from the back of the DVD was not even in the movie. I just saw that particular murder filmed from behind (which means I didn't see it!)! I waited throughout the movie to make it happen, and then I see nothing?!?! What a late-down! Could it be that I saw a cut version of the movie? It will be a pity, because just a decent amount of grubby can save this movie if you ask me. Since many deadly snowballs reduced to bloody pulp, I didn't cut it for me. Talk about the snowballs: they are very poorly done. They made MUNCHIES look like state-of-the-art animatronics. But I think it was the whole point. At one stage, the special stock crew even changed some nice bad CGI. Son, you really have to believe it. The best is not to see it, actually, because this movie is just bad (okay, I laughed for it because it got worse and worse). Just keep the first JACK FROST (1996) and you'll be fine (just keep in mind it's a very crazy horror comedy, but fun in its own right). <br /> <br /> It's funny, but author / director Michael Cooney had to somehow realize that he was a pretty bad director to JACK FROST 2, and then focused on writing. It appears that he wrote two pretty good thriller screens for THE I INSIDE (starring Ryan Phillippe) and IDENTITY (John Cusack). So the man does look like talent. <br /> <br /> Now it would be too easy to give JACK FROST 2 the lowest score possible. So I say one point for that naked Asian babe doing the skinny baptism and one point for the totally delayed snowball. Away to Mr. Cooney to go!
