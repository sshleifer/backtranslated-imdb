absolutely nothing about this movie is funny, interesting or relevant. Except that two characters come together, nothing is ever solved, and there is no plot. And by the way, what's the deal with the cover of the DVD? it has a female ass in daisy duke pants ... where was that scene in the movie? No one was wearing daily daisies in this movie! Surprisingly, almost all the actors in this movie are good, and Jack Black plays a full song (can be a stubborn d-track ... don't know yet). However, these are the only redeeming values. Overall, it's just a waste of time.
