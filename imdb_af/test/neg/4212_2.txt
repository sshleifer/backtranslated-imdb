Biker! Biker! Chuck Norris, as a truck driver and a karate master, talks about juggling two divergent professions. He gives a load that he cannot hand over to his younger brother, Michael Augenstein, and then if the young man does not arrive, Chuck is looking for him. <br /> <br /> Which young Augenstein has been in a speed-squad run by Judge George Murdock, who comes from the Roy Bean School of Law. Of course Norris deals with matters in the usual Chuck Norris way and when he gets in trouble, the call goes out over the certification body so all truck drivers can help their good mate. This speed trap, known as Texas City, has a bad reputation and the drivers are just too happy to help a friend. <br /> <br /> Of course, Chuck is quite young and with no facial hair in this one. He has the firm look of a man who realizes the Academy won't look at these gobblers. George Murdock is outrageous as Judge Roy Bean wannabe. <br /> <br /> This one is strict for Chuck Norris fans.
