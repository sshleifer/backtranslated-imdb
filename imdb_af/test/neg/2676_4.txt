"The curse of Michael Myers" is a very frustrating piece to deal with a fan of the Halloween series. After a very disappointing fallacy in Halloween 5, the series reached a close ebb in plot lines, with a stupid devil in witchcraft and a teen cult dedicated to the worship of Michael Myers. The curse of Michael Myers makes the blood in the blood and gore, but really represents a decay in the range's integrity. It's too bad because it's the last movie for Donald Pleasance as the character of dr. Loomis. Pleasance has some good screen moments (precious if you're a fan of the series) than the now older and as he says "very retired doctor". Unfortunately, he died before the film was completed, and it is very clear at the end of the film that the stories were never realized in the original climate scene. From the beginning, Halloween 6 felt more like a TV movie made than the blockbuster horror it started in 1978. Any loyal Halloween alumni needed more from this movie ... Dr Loomis and Donald Pleasance deserve more.
