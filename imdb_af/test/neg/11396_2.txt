If you read Errol Flynn's autobiography, My Wicked, Wicked Ways, you'll see this movie is full of poetic licenses. Not that it was much different, because Errol Flynn was pretty generous with poetic license in the autobiography anyway. I don't have to worry about spoilers, because there's nothing to spoil. <br /> <br /> For me it seems more sensible to use the story of a fictitious Hollywood actor; then you can go out and find a better actor than Duncan Regehr to play him, and you won't have to worry about the audience and say things like, "But he didn't have a mustache in Captain Blood." Another failure of this movie is that it shows Flynn as a two-dimensional character. Flynn was an intelligent man, well-educated, well-read. This movie does not focus on its funster image. <br /> <br /> Regehr is a disaster. The rest of the throw battle with their scripts. Hal Linden is OK as Warner, and Barbara Hershey makes a credible Damita, although Lili Damita didn't even think so. <br /> <br /> The best thing to do with this movie is to forget about it and let it gently leave behind for oblivion. So for what I write, I can't imagine.
