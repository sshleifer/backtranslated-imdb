H. Wells turn. No doubt about it. <br /> <br /> Really, it would have been a decent sci-fi / adventure movie if it wasn't based on a classic novel and directed by the author's grandson. I heard how it would be the definitive version of the novel. The result was a pathetic and simple bastardization. <br /> <br /> The novel is a great scientific story but misses many people when they read it (probably because they read it when they are very young) is that it overflows with social commentary. The Eloi and Morlocks are a satire of class distinctions from Victorian England, and the overall message of the film is that ALL STATEMENTS AND DEGENERATES, a satirical jab on Victorian complacency and their belief that their civilization will last forever. There is no love story, no romance with a beautiful Eloi woman. In the novel, the Eloi are 3-foot-sized creatures with a mental capacity that is not far above that of an animal. The Time Traveler is friends with an Eloi woman, but it is clear that he thinks of her more like a pet, and in any case she is killed before the novel ends. <br /> <br /> This movie first tries to tell us a completely stupid "why does he want to travel over time." The treacly romance and lessons he has to learn are enough to make film friends vomit. <br /> <br /> A future disaster will interrupt the journey to the future. OK, not bad, but it would have been more punch if we were allowed to see that man was generally degenerate, as in the book. More a reflection of the times, I think, as the George Pal version had a nuclear war. <br /> <br /> The general story? Ugh. An overall misrepresentation of the novel. The Eloi is too capable and warlike. The Morlocks are too intelligent. The UberMorlock is an embarrassment and there is no setup. He just shows in time to be killed. Dug. <br /> <br /> Samantha Mumba does OK. Guy Pearce is one of my favorites, but he often looks confused and in pain. (He broke a rib while filming it.) He also looks unhealthy and too thin, as if he had been ill for a long time before making it. <br /> <br /> A sad, sorry movie version of one of the world's classics. H. G. Wells deserves better .... much better. <br /> <br />
