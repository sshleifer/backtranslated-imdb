Shopping, sunny lice, beaches, boarding school for rich teenagers and perfectly happy ends. Welcome to the life of Zoey Brooks and her friends. Zoey Brooks is portrayed by Jamie Lynn Spears, the self-proclaimed actress who boasts of being the youngest sister of international pop star Britney Spears. With her beautiful blonde wig in the first season and an attempt to hide her monotonous accent, it was confirmed that Nickelodeon had gone to the dogs with nepotism. When Kristin Herrera, the actress who portrayed Dana Cruz in the first season, left the show, all hope disappeared because she was the only decent actress. The female casting is a complete disgrace, but the male casting has potential for teenage media. If they stay Jamie Lynn Spears as the picture of perfection, many people will have to lower their standards. With hope they will soon find that you can't make a career out of nothing. Jamie Lynn Spears is useless to act, sing and anything else she tries for the downward spiral, she calls a profession. There is no wonder why she is a self-declared actress. Critics will definitely proclaim her as something other than that.
