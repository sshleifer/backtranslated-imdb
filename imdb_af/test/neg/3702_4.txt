The films of the Science Fiction Channel (Sci-Fi Channel) have become boringly predictable. It looks little on budget, originality and plot. <br /> <br /> In this creation, the government is getting a lot of telekinetics and utilizing a poor soul through cunning means to help. There are many overworked recycled twists on the evil government organization theme. black coats, shadows, short, meaningless lines make these one dimensional cartoons. <br /> <br /> Daniel Dae Kim emerges as a good actor in a small role. He brings some of the style of his "Angel" character to the role. It's hard to miss the link that his "Crusade" character was a telepath and it's a telekinetics movie. Was it a Sci-Fi deciding move to attract fans of the other show? Who knows. Fortunately, he is a decent actor and a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> The movie is definitely a low budget. It reflects the current Sci-Fi channel model of Canadian location, little-known characters, little effects, and terribly horrific plot and character development. One would think they believe science fiction fans will see anything called "scifi". <br /> <br /> If you want a good telekinesis movie, check out the "Fury" (1978).
