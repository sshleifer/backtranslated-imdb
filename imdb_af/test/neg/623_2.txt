I am an atheist. For me, history and truth mean a lot. <br /> <br /> This film is made after a novel published in 1921, which has been updated to date as if it were a history book. Well, it's not. The movie is about the novels 1950's version. Some actors were BIG, but it didn't cover the plot. <br /> <br /> In short, humans are investigating a super boom so that God and his friends hold a tribunal to see if they should intervene. The devil analogy persecutes man and for the defense we have the spirit of man. What is the spirit of man anyway? And why was the first defendant Adam? Eventually, you only get American Christian propaganda in a 5th history book of the time. Although other religions are mentioned, only European Christianity is being investigated. <br /> <br /> First, we get the cave keeper's story. The women are scary stereotypes of damsels in distress. True cave women were as strong as men and just as resistant. Hard times, hard life, adjusting and surviving. All these things are watered by the age-stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Next we get Egypt's first pyramid construction. Today we see another story and know that there were also many fewer deaths and regular citizens at work. The loss of specified quantities of many lives in the process would be a national disaster and no one will try to beat it afterwards. As if there was only ONE pyramid building. <br /> <br /> The section about Moses and one true god was as if the Spanish Inquisition had asked nicely. Inquisition itself has never been mentioned in the movie. <br /> <br /> Helen of Troy's evil fury was so dirty that I didn't see why so many were even interested in her. In fact, they were merely soldiers, according to commanders, who discussed a political issue of power. She was just an excuse. <br /> <br /> The Cleopatra story was where I saw this movie was inaccurate and propaganda filled. Here brother was much younger. She was not obsessed with poison, was fairly educated to restore library content and was politically competitive to smash Egypt out. <br /> <br /> The part with Nero and praying Christians in a cave was disgusting. Yes, Rome burned down. Yes, Christianity is being persecuted. But the way they portray it was as if the Colosseum was building itself and there was no Vespasian to rebuild Rome. <br /> <br /> Attila the Hun appears briefly and when we jump to King Arthur. The crusades are called with minimal bloodshed. And there is no mention of the crusades east to Russia that ended in an ironic struggle. The knights just went home and started having fun. A licky stuff is put down like no indoor plumes, hygiene and pests. <br /> <br /> Then they cover Joan of Ark, where she always makes too much makeup and looks like a princess. Territorial politics has been replaced by an unfair court. The seat alone on a chair asks me how someone can follow here. When I was on fire, I wanted to "kill Hura! Now die! Cheap special effects, where's the fire?". <br /> <br /> By the time they called Leonardo, I already got the movie. Columbus, the Spanish massacre of America, shouts Queen Elisabeth "kicks the Spanish armada" and so on. <br /> <br /> The only reason I wanted to see this movie was the fact that it was the last with all 3 Marks brothers. And all they got was the scene with Manhattan and Indians. Amusing, but not more than a smile. <br /> <br /> The witch hunts are briefly mentioned, as well as pests (after renascence). When they begin to portray the revolutions, things become power-hungry and anarchic. The American Revolution is pursued by the French Revolution. Repression and incompetence are bad, but you can't just blow the old way out of anger, you have to replace it with something. So they replaced the French monarchy with the new French monarchy. So we get Napoleon and his ambitions to go to India. But they replace his motives with unity and bind him for only the title "Emperor". The conquest in Europe, the defeat in Russia, is being fired at Waterloo. <br /> <br /> The American Civil War, the English Empire Inventors (Tesla not included). "Mr Watson, come here, I want you" made me laugh for teenage reasons. Technological hard work has been watered down to the final discovery and comic abuse. <br /> <br /> Eventually after 85 minutes we come to world wars and organized crime, but not one of its abominations. Adolph's words "I fall into Russia. This is my last territorial question" was hilarious. That was his LAST territorial question. <br /> <br /> To build, God puts a countdown clock until the day of death on the "wall" for the final words. All might not break the universe for a second? There was no need for the persecution, but the defense made one last throw. <br /> <br /> Finally, we see the man of tomorrow as the final defense. Apparently a paradox man, because the bomb had to go today. His toys are a music box in the form of a gun and a pencil box sword. Now is it so wrong? Pencils and pencils have drawn so many leaflets that the killing of the atomic bomb is surpassed. And make music from a weapon? Several selfish generals make music from fire of fire. So tomorrow's man is already a monster. <br /> <br /> The way I see it, all the defenses had to do was shut down the devil as the true conspirator for men's demise and affair. And frankly, compared to all the barbaric things our ancestors did centuries ago, we're actually pretty human. We have to summarize everything I would call "Firefly" episode "Jaynestown": "It is my belief that everyone ever got a picture of him, was one kind of boy of a bitch or another. It's not about you, Jayne, it's about what they need.
