George Segal lives with his elderly and senile mother. There are many jokes about her Alzheimer's-like dementia and most of them are not funny, although there are some funny moments sprinkled (like the naked one walking through the park scene and the old people's house). Initially, Segal tries to kill his mother because she is difficult to live with and because he is a selfish man. To make the movie like a Wiley Coyote against the Roadrunner comedy, where he again tries to kill this indestructible gall, would be a hoot - it wasn't the overall tone of the movie. <br /> <br /> I welcome Carl Reiner's attempt to make a tasteless film designed to offend everyone. I have a special place in my heart for movies like ED and his mother-in-law, eating raoul and happiness from the catacombs - all the movies about death that dare to insult. However, the problem here is that WHERE IS POPPA? It has some funny moments, but it also has very flat units and the overall product is incredibly juicy. Plus topics like homosexual rape, incest and the like are really hard to make funny. I read in "THE ROUGH GUIDE TO CULT MOVIES" that it is considered a cult film, although I can only see anyone who wants to see it more than once.
