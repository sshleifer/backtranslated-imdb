To be myself (somewhat) an independent filmmaker, I really understand what these guys are trying to do and it seems to be a good idea. On paper. On 16mm film, however, it is terrible. I didn't realize the thing was made in the mid 90's, because the movie was so gritty and bad, I would have sworn it was one of those 30-year-old movies where a porn product is trying to go mainstream. And the sound! Oh, I don't know what kind of microphone they used to record, but it looks like somebody over the thing is walking over dead leaves. I don't think I should judge too much, how many photos did my company take out? No one, but I would like to think that we have at least good picture and sound quality to deal with our poor acting, writing and directing. A + for idea, F-- for execution.
