Eastenders became the full circle of indispensable in 1985, completely abysmal. This is such a bad reflection of the nation. These crap are the ratings. <br /> <br /> The ideas for plots can be of no less trivial nature than ever putting characters' names in a hat. The first two (regardless of their sex) will sleep with each other, the 3rd and 4th will have a fight in the Vic, the 5th will be arrested, the 6th will develop an addiction, 7th will become pregnant, and so on. /> <br /> The producers are both smart. The 30-minute show is actually out of 3 lines. <br /> <br /> 1) Someone will walk into the Vic and say, "What's the matter?" 2) Someone else will get up, say, "Let it come out" (out) 3) Then a woman will say, "Doan choo honor an" abusive mah family member "<br /> <br /> That's it It's every show, except the occasional, "Get it sort id / Is it black id?" <br /> <br /> The show was once a realistic depiction of East End folk and their way of The buffers came down 1) They extended it from two nights and 2) The Slater family arrived, how their viewers are attracting is beyond me, the Kat character symbolizes everything that went wrong with society, treat anyone otherwise like something she pulled down from the bottom of her shoes. <br /> <br /> The people who vote for her the best in these polls should be the same as those that Jamie Redknapp's "Best Sportsman" vote for. despite the fact that he has not played a match for 3 years. <br /> <br /> What I can never understand is whether the show is the pinnacle of British TV, why do everyone leaves the biggest names? Ross Kemp, Martin Kemp, the list is endless. <br /> <br /> How long does the longest married couple, married to each other, last? Yes, people leave, but until the authors realize that characters, couples can be interesting and active without sleeping, the performance will still decline. An episode last week had 3 separate parts of it exactly. And Zoe & the Doctor also have Lofty & 'Shell' as 'Most Unconvincing Couple' ever featured on TV. '<br /> <br /> Yes, Eastenders is the most watched show, it's unquestionable. But many external factors contribute. 19.30 / 20.00 is the perfect time to get the most audiences, it has a 2-hour omnibus edition, and more than that, millions of viewers have nothing more than a habit, but if they were completely honest For themselves they admit it (in 2002, more than ever) can be absolutely miserable.
