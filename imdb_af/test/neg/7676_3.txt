The true star of the last of the airport movies is the great supersonic carrier that the French created The Concorde. If you keep in mind that the whole movie is dedicated to showing what that jet-plane can do, it's the whole movie that makes sense. <br /> <br /> But if you expect a serious drama here, anyway, take the elusive action the Concorde shows here when some nasty people try to shoot her. <br /> <br /> Susan Blakely plays a television news reporter who is also the mistress of military industrial magnate Robert Wagner. One of Wagner's tools just happens to bring her information about some of Wagner's dirty business operations, and the sale of weapons to people who aren't friendly with the US. When the source, Macon McCalman, is killed before she is almost done by a hit she obviously escapes, she confronts Wagner with the information. And of course he denies it. But just before Blakely's board The Concorde, McCalman's widow Kathleen Maguire gives her the necessary documents. <br /> <br /> But on the way to Moscow with a stop in Paris, Wagner and his minions are trying to put the big bird down. But the fearless crew of Alain Delon, David Warner, and George Kennedy are on all their tricks. It's quite a bag full, because you'll see if you want to see the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are an aviation enthusiast, you will absolutely not care about the plot. It's like the movie Le Mans with Steve McQueen, who has a legion of motorsport fans who made it a cult item. Perhaps Le Mans is better off because they just didn't bother with any kind of story. <br /> <br /> Among the passengers is a pot smoke saxophonist played by Jimmie Walker, a distorted mother who accompanies a new heart for her child, played by Cicely Tyson and Martha Raye a woman with a weak blowing off the whole trip from Washington to Paris. She's actually the best one here. <br /> <br /> However, Robert Wagner had to be psychic because I'm sure of the strength of this movie, he achieved the role of Doctor Evil's number two in the Austin Powers series. <Br /> <br /> I'm sure everyone involved got a big payday from this movie, but they seem to have killed the movie saga airport.
