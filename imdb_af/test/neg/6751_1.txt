it was pretty bad. pedestrian or worse. I don't think it was homophobic, just really bad. If it was something, it was really amateurish, like when you were 14 and first discovered the swear words and powers. <br /> <br /> The main point of this movie, the romance, really falls flat. I can't help but wonder if the authors ever had any serious relationships before this movie. <br /> <br /> Plot and pacing is terrible, nowhere. a minute we look at the guys who catch cheaters, then we are at a gay club, then we are on a date. From nowhere, the girl keeps leaves from comics, and then they sleep together. Not one of them really feels like a basic school production by Shakespeare if Hamlet was written by a frat boy. <br /> <br /> The end was a kind of creepy about the top revenge fantasy by a loser by a girl. Unnecessary and actually kind of upsetting. <br /> <br /> But you should see it. Why? <br /> <br /> As others have noted, the director's commentary is actually hilarious - what kind of professional talk about "attacks" or "joining" the actresses? dialogue sucked, relationships lack of chemistry. You will be lying on the floor at this pretentious jackass.
