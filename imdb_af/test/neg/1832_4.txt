1st watched 6/24/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Stefan Rujowitzky): OK, but a little too predictable. This story is based in Germany, which is also the movie. It's about a young medical student who gets a shot to go to a premier school in Heidelberg and see that there are strange things. Someone who met and saved on the train pointed to the school's experimentation table and she suspected dirty play right away. She does an investigation and the disappearance of her friend leads her to a secret society called AAA (and no it is not Alcoholics Anonymous) that has something to do with the anti-Hippocratic oath and is used to perform experiments on living people who doctors can normally do. She found out of her grandfather (who was a dean at school) was a big part of establishing it and it was fairly easily filled by school members. This is an interesting story, but the problem with this movie is how quickly the audience is told what is going on and then it is kind of a horror movie with the heroine who fights the bad boy of the group who goes to the next psychotic level take. Although this film was made in Europe, it plays to a young American audience focusing on gore, sex and the horror movie incident (it's really a big downfall) and explains why it's probably made good money and " a successor created, but not 'necessarily a good movie.
