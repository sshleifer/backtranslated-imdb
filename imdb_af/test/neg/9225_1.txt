If something is worse than this movie, I don't want to see it. I remember so many wonderful things - a nun went out of a coffin to make a raft for a blond boy; the blond boy himself worshiped as a god; Many stock materials from Peru as an ideal holiday spot. Shining Path and Alberto Fujimori must evade any idea that Peru is a holiday paradise. The whole thing is so terrible that Plan 9 or even Robot Monster has been treated aesthetically for comparison. This film has to be bombed and punished again and bombarded again.
