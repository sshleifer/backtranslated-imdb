This low-budget indie movie redefines the word "blah". It will be most surprising that this word actually appears in the dictionary, defined as: "nonsense, uninteresting, boring, lifeless". The movie redefines the word because I have to add the four words: "PC crap", "pretentious on pathetic level" and "useless". <br /> <br /> The movie is trying so hard to be "hip" and "in contact" with contemporary beautiful people-struggling-for-your-sais-quoi behavior and "thinking" (do they think?) . There is almost no plot to talk about, even though there is one to sleep. The fonest and most politically correct thing about it is how a white woman is good friends with a young, black stud, the black street sax player with a fondness for the cute wise advice and advice and the thick black psychic. Isn't it beautiful how the games can happen after all? ... Ahhhh ... Finally, the woman reads "poetry", which is nothing more than one of her dull "dear diary" entries. She gets a standing ovation (!!!), although her listeners in real life would be more likely than they did in the deep sleep. But this movie has little to do with real life, even if it is supposed to happen. In real life, her "poetry" reading would only have been standing ovations if she had the meaning to include the juicy sexual details. "And then I rub his big penis against my sweat, impatient, pink, small vagina ..." Cheers! Worst of all, the main actress has a dozen scenes in which she baths or screws with someone, but they never have the sense to show her breasts. It was clearly the only thing to save this mess. <br /> <br /> The black man and the blonde, who are separated by a height, hook them up: they look like a cheap variation of Rodman and Madonna (as if the last two are not cheap) enough combination is not). Nicole Eggert, named by Howard Stern in his book "Miss America", is the blonde. Stern writes van Eggert that she took out her implants. Yet, I believe that when they took out her implants, they also sucked most of the meat out of her meat and muscles because she looked hungry here. <br /> <br /> In one scene, the sax player develops angelic wings; He looks like Al Roker's advertising angel cookies.
