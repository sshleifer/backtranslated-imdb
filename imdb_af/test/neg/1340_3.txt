I went to this movie with this grief; the original is a masterpiece of both writing and acting and unfortunately my fears have been realized. It is a humorous piece of work and I sat in the theater waiting for the white and humor to start. I'm still waiting, it looks. Upgrading the storyline to the present time just didn't work and changing characters an absolute travesty - why did they suggest Bette Midler's character as she disappeared as fast as she arrived; The related character in the original 1939 was an integral part of the plot. The women in the theater laughed a few times, but nothing touched me to be funny, except for a line of Meg Ryan talking to her mother about her situation and telling her it wasn't like a movie of 1930. look at the 1930s version. It was all too touchy, "sisters keep together" and really need some of the sharp white and clever dialogue from the original play. I still look at the original movie and get a line I've never caught before. There is no sense in closing this new version, and while the 1939 movie is politically wrong according to today's standards, every thread is tied up and when the movie ended, it did so strongly. This remake should be marked with a warning for any viewers. If you know the original, don't bother it. I deceived myself by losing a portion of my life in a theater that saw this awkward piece fluff. Bring up the jungle!
