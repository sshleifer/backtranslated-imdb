*** SPOILERS *** This movie - called EATEN ALIVE here in the UK is possibly the worst movie ever made and is just brilliant. A sexy rich girl crew with a rough action man looking for her sister in the New Guinea jungle. What follows is an unspeakable shit mix of cannibalism, insane cults, and religious maniacs that must be seen to be believed. The cannibalism scenes are pretty awful, but are performed so badly that they seem to be quite amusing. The cast is horrible except for Janet Agren as the excellent female head. Watch out for the scene where she is stripped naked and covered with gold paint! My rating - 1 out of 10.
