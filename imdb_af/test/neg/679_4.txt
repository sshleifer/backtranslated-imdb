Tamara Anderson and her family are moving again, because her painting painter father is chasing his next landscape. Fifteen years old she is in her rebellious stage. Already angry with her father for their regular move, her anger is exacerbated when her mother suddenly becomes a sanatorium for tuberculosis. Her mother's absence caused Tamara to iron out at her dad and seek comfort in religion, the boy next door, Rusty, as well as the spirit of the dead teenager living in her rented house. <br /> <br /> The story is modest to a mistake. It's strange, and even during his emotional scenes there's no tension. The actors depicting the parents are good. Alberta Watson is incredibly charismatic as the sick mother, and Maria Ricossa is especially effective as the guilty mother of the dead teenager. But Katie Boland, as Tamara, is too amateur to wear the movie. The dialogue is very natural and Boland can't do it. She had her moments and when she hit them she could be good, but there were too many times when she became uncomfortable. One can think of her "that's what my line is and it's the face I'm supposed to make" rather than actually responding to the other actors. She is not the only one, Kevin Zegers as Rusty and Megan Park, as his sister Brenda also suffers from stolen delivery, but they are at least in less scenes. <br /> <br /> If it's right, the script can have made it. an influential film. And it has moments, but many of them are trapped with an amateur head performance and flat direction.
