The movie's tagline is "You think you know who you are. You have no idea." I reject both the suggested idea that I do not know who I am and suggest that this film tells me who people really are. If people in real life are so real, then the man is screwed. <br /> <br /> A rogue movie I walked early in the past. A film so equipped to become The Race Film of All Time, which loses sight of the tools a movie needs to use. <br /> <br /> The rules of Hollywood are so: if you show something In the first half it should be used in the second half. So the gun that worries the daughter about her father's purchase will somehow find his way in the second half story. The rules of Hollywood are to make dialogue 'real' - a concept that changes with every decade. Is this "real dialogue" somehow less ridiculous than Kevin Smith's "real dialogue" ten years ago? The rules of Hollywood declare that we have set the scene, and as the action rises, the camera moves closer to the faces. In this film, in particular, we can see the supposed shame, humiliation and transcendental realism of the characters. The strings increase, the frame slows down, and our heart is meant to break. <br /> <br /> This movie is so clumsy manipulating because it's vapid. I have my own prejudice against L.A., which I freely acknowledge, to combat this prejudice. I won't say it's a natural situation coming out of the location, but probably from the author and director. The writer, Paul Haggis, has already shown a taste for controversy over humanity in his Million Dollar Baby, who at least had a director who understood how to make the vision of the film. Now that Paul Haggis has his own hands on the camera, it becomes clear that he not only knows how to write true, natural human drama, nor does he know how to photograph or direct it. Paul Haggis comes from the country of TV, let's not forget: the country of reduced expectations. <br /> <br /> Everything is as obvious as a TV movie, which is only offered for simple thought. Haggis practices in us, over and over, that people on the surface may look awful, they have hidden secret pain. It's a good idea, but it's so terrible that the whole composition of bad / good has an amateur feeling. The film was structurally recorded, in the tradition of Magnolia and other previous films. The editing is so typical and conventional "movie" as it can be. If there is a dramatic movement, such as a doorway or a car that has passed between the subject and the camera, the editors use the utmost movement to give the cut that takes place. a more kinetic quality. The problem is different from the drive to make things move, there is very little intelligence and thought behind the tracks - everything is kept by the books. Not only are the dolls of this terrible racial and legal performance improperly handled, but even the curtains are lowered and rendered incompetent. <br /> <br /> The movie desperately tries to present reality, but there is no talent at all. Some of the actors are good, some of the actors are bad, and all the performances are merged, fired by the low, low aesthetics of the film. We have cinematography that is technically clear: we can see the scene, we have a clear understanding of what's going on. But not just cinematography is imperceptible, but it is ungrateful camera work and framework that believes it's actually inspired. The result is small stylistic flourish that recognizes one, but does not add anything to the drama or pathos. For example - and this is a spoiler - if a father keeps his dying child (the father can also be shot, I didn't get trapped to find out). The camera sees its face and gives us the well-known Vertigo track / zoom. The Vertigo shot !!! It was at this point that the film became hysterical and I just had to get away. I had to go because it was so bad. I ran away because I was in the middle of an overcrowded theater, and I wanted to express to the audience that I was sick of heartfelt Hollywood art that was full of sound and anger but nothing at all (in Bard's own words) . I hate to waste such good Shakespearian references on something that is remarkably bad.
