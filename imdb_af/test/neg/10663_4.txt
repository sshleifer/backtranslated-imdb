As a good anecdote to one of the above remarks: In about two weeks before the release of this movie in Mumbai I was approached - to be white - to copy some of the lines of this movie into a recording studio. <br /> <br /> While speaking German, I was kindly asked to do all the double scenes in English, otherwise it would be too confusing for the Indian audience. So, all Germans in this movie actually speak English! funny enough I had more characters, so if you really want to spoil the movie again, listen carefully; <br /> <br /> All non-Indian characters are only done by 4 votes! . . . .
