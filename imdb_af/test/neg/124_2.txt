STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Former New Orleans killer Jack Robideaux (Jean Claude Van Damme) was again assigned to Columbus , a small but violent city in Mexico to help the police with their efforts to stop a major heroin smuggling operation in their village. The criminals appear to be military leaders, led by former commander Benjamin Meyers (Stephen Lord, otherwise known as Jase of East Enders) using a special method he learned in Afghanistan to fight his opponents. But Jack has a more personal reason to pick him up, which pulls the two men into an explosive final, where only one goes away alive. <br /> <br /> After Death, Van Damme appeared at a high level, pointing out that he can best direct video films in the action market. While it was a much more drama-oriented film, he returned with the Shepherd to the kicking, no brainer action that first revealed him and unfortunately made his worst movie since Derailed. It is nowhere as bad as that movie, but what I said is still standing. <br /> <br /> A deaf, predictable movie, with very little in the way of any exciting action. There is little there, consisting mainly of a few sleep-fighting scenes, which try to look cool and trendy with some cheap slo-mo / sped-up effects added that unfortunately make them look more desperate. Director Isaac Florentine, who is a Mexican movie, tried to give the film a Robert Rodriguez / Desperado-type feel, but it just adds to the despair. <br /> <br /> VD gives a particularly memorable performance and given he was never a Robert De Niro kind of actor, who can't be good. As the villain, the Lord does not expect to leave the beeba anytime soon. In the beginning he gets a small dialogue while struggling to collect an American accent, but mysteriously gets better at the end. All the supporting roles are equally dull, and do nothing to collect the movies spirits. <br /> <br /> It is a shepherd who gets lost in the herd. *
