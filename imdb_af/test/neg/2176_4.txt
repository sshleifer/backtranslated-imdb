Adenoid Hynkel, a low soldier in the First World War, rises in the following years to become the relentless dictator of Toumania. He creates an aggressive, anti-Semitic war machine and cultivates a little toothbrush mustache. Sounds like anyone you know? <br /> <br /> From the safety of Hollywood, Chaplin uses this soapbox to admonish Europe to take up arms and defend Hitler and Mussolini. Since the United States had had more than a year of neutrality in 1940, and no strong desire to prevent itself in the civilian struggle in Europe (remember, it was Hitler who declared war in the US and not the other way around). ) Surprisingly, Chaplin may spread this immeasurable controversy. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, the story involves the vulgar and apostate Hynkel and the reign of terror over which he indecently presides and life in the Jewish ghetto where every person is friendly, human, brave, etc. Chaplin is Hynkel, and he also plays The Jewish Barber, the little hero of the ghetto (The Tramp in everything but the name). Needless to say, Chaplin writes, directs, stars, composes the music and does the catering. <br /> <br /> In 1940, the full truth was not yet known about the Third Reich, and Chaplin can be forgiven for something less than perfect historical prospect, but even according to the standards of the day he gets Hitler bad wrong. A comedian and a sentimentalist, Chaplin tries to mock Hitler by making Hynkel fool and uncomfortable. All this is to humanize him. When Hynkel wanders the non-soldier soldier with the big gun and the upside-down plane, he becomes more engaging rather than contemptuous. As a dictator, he inspects his subordinates' technical innovations that do not work (the parachute cover, the bulletproof uniform, etc.). In fact, Hynkel's regime is made cute and enjoyable by his bully. <br /> <br /> Indeed, Chaplin's day has already passed when he made this ill-considered polemic. At heart he was still a dinosaur of the silent screen (watching the humor, with gags like the half-conscious up and down the street, or the pantomime of the coins in the puddings). The hero Schultz is meant to represent a measure of European decency with which Hynkel can be judged, but Schultz looks more like an operetta character than a Nazi. Is it in any way credible that a Schultz figure (if it existed) would say to the Fuehrer's face: "Your case is doomed to failure because it is built on the stupid, relentless persecution of innocent people" ? And how did Schultz get into the cellars of the Jewish ghetto? If he is the object of an exhausting manhunt, why does he continue to wear his Ruritanic uniform? Chaplin does not yet know the full horrors of Auschwitz-Birkenau or Treblinka, but the Nazi concentration camp he offers us is hopeless from the wilderness with the grim spirit of the ages. As usual, Chaplin thinks in terms of 'quiet' comedy sets, loosely attached to narrative clothes. There was the knockout with the storm troopers scrapped, a man shaved to the accompaniment of Brahms and the globe (look for the segment filmed in reverse order). <br /> <br /> Paulette Goddard is the incessantly perfect Hannah. Just as the people of the ghetto are impossible and the Jewish port in Osterlich is ridiculously idyllic, Hannah is literally too good to be true. Brave, challenging, resourceful, hardworking and (of course) beautiful, she is the canary of Judaism in the ghetto tube. "Give, am I not cute?" she asked, after the hairdresser gave her a makeover. Too cute, far, is the answer. She doesn't come close to truth, because Chaplin made her a caricature. The "wouldn't it be wonderful?" Speech that Chaplin puts in her mouth is typical of the author, too wordy and too emotional. <br /> <br /> Jack Oakie is wonderful like Napaloni, the fascist dictator of Bacteria. He brings a whistle of the much-needed comic brio to the proceedings, but remains the film's underlying weakness. If Napaloni is stupid and ineffective, how can we fear him? And anyway, the stuttering start of the back project train is a fine Chapline example of a gag that stays well beyond its comic value. <br /> <br /> And where did the Jewish Barber get that impeccable Shin uniform?
