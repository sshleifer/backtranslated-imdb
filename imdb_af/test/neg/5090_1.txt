It's by far the most boring movies I've ever seen! And if you don't believe me, go ahead and see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly, the storyline doesn't make sense at all. People who fight don't make sense. I couldn't make sense of what they were talking about during the movie (in most cases I didn't even bother). It does nothing to make you look at the movie. The only plus is the movie. New Zealand looks great. All the others are just sucking. <br /> <br /> The actors are trying their best to keep us awake, but unfortunately you will go to bed instead. <br /> <br /> Do we all do a favor, even if it gets on "On Demand", Don't See It!
