In this desperate and thoroughly foolish attempt to keep Hammer's Dracula franchise, although most of his power has long since disappeared, our legendary vampire is again brought to life in the waving London of 1972. Actually, a hundred years later, he is through his archeemy Van Helsing, an occult disciple named Johnny Alucard (get it? Get it?) Collects his flamboyant friends in a deserted church, including Van Helsing's grand granddaughter Jessica, and a satanic ritual that raises Dracula in a smoke. Dracula's only goal is to destroy and break the entire Van Helsing lineage. Jessica is the ideal victim to achieve this. This is probably the only 70-year-old movie that goes on top, to look like a 70-year-old movie! Considering the previous six Dracula films has been in the Victorian era, but director Alan Gibson wants to stress the fact that we are now in the 20th century, and so he makes his movie with impassable hippie characters, shameful 70's fashion trends and terrible 70's music. Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing are hopelessly lost in this area and their performances regret it. The opening sequence (a flashback) and the climbing climax are pretty pleasant, but everything in between is painfully boring and the opposite of scary. The biggest elements of this series of films have always been Dracula's dark castles and the exciting coaching series and of course this installment doesn't have it all. Fortunately for the fans, Hammer Studios also released other films that are much better on vampires ("The Vampire Lovers", "Twins of Evil", "The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires").
