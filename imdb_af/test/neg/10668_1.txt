If you feel Reshammiya because the singer is too much of a pain to watch on TV, try watching the movie straight for 2 hours. His face is completely through the whole movie, and it's very comical to see him tackle the demanding and intense scene. It is far from a true love story (gets the spelling right, Reshammiya - it's not luv or real) and is full of him doing a Mithun da dance, a car rickshaw fight, Himesh captured become, Himesh being accused of being murdered. he flees from prison etc. If you want a good laugh, there's nothing like this one, especially the screens where he cries in Mehbooba. If you despise the nasal compulsion and want to know what two hours of Reshammiya can do for you, don't miss this movie. <br /> <br /> I couldn't stop laughing from the beginning to the end. The only saving grace that this movie has is the cinematography, places and some of the songs. Even if you are a strong Reshammiya fan, avoid this movie at all costs.
