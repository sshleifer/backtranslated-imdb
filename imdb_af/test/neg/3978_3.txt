I have now suffered from Parts, The Clonus Horror. <br /> <br /> To have the word horror in the title of this movie is an insult to real horror. <br /> <br /> The story of a cloning-centric possession of "The Man" They Grow Clones to later harvest clone organs for the original people who need transplants. One clone escapes, the government gets angry and kills everyone involved, but the story leaks out anyway. <br /> <br /> It's really scandalous how a film with potential is destroyed by amateurs like Fiveson. The only thing he really managed to do was to weave the concept of human rights and the philosophical aspect, what makes one human and would it be good to grow clones for organic harvesting? Unfortunately, mediocre actors were chosen and the plot left town until the end where a pathetic attempt was made to summarize it. <br /> <br /> But !! What disturbed me the most was the introduction of new characters that lacked real relevance to the plot. Despite this, Fiveson feels the need to kill them in a bad blast that only Sir Coleman Francis himself would be proud of. <br /> <br /> The environment was interesting. How Fiveson thought plastic and running water would leach over them would make a credible river outside me, but I think if you would compare Coleman Francis' gray pie oatmeal environment, this movie would win. br /> <br /> Maybe Coleman has changed what bad movies are for me. 10/03
