For three-quarters of an hour, the story gradually evolves into a central point of some kind. Although it is overloaded with scenes that are just meant to blur the viewer and lure him away from the real plot, something happens. It's not much and it's definitely not obvious. The combination of palace impressions and story-row scenes does not add depth or insight to the entire cast of characters. In fact, they keep them sterile, because there is no character development at all. Everyone just keeps turning their own cliché and role - the cute, cute, big-eyed girl; the battles überwoman, the sneaky aristocrat. The male head does not seem to distinguish at all, he is a shallow presence, which doesn't really matter, because he's just there because the storyboard needs him - he seems to be on holiday and caught up. When the point comes to turn the angle in terms of what happens, the movie cuts completely a few minutes and then becomes ridiculous. It solves - or better, solves itself with a by-the-book Deus Ex Machina, more clichés and some of the most coarse plot devices and choices I've ever seen. It's history, okay. First, the movie is a drama, but it has to be comedies, and then it becomes a farce. The protagonists do what they are expected to do, and there are no surprises. However, the first set of somewhat serious antagonists is replaced by a couple who were literally just bored. Maybe it was a kind of nod to the audience. <br /> <br /> This movie does not get a bonus from me for the underlying philosophical meaning (because there is no one) or its technical realization. The animation and editing is fair and so is the sound mix; but it is by no means outstanding or even above the average Japanese productions of the late 1980s. In fact, the visual delicacies look static, uninspired and non-original. <br /> <br /> Worst of all - it doesn't fail completely, even if you don't bother with characters and all the stuff. There is too little going on here, and the rest is at its best. Get a real Ghibli instead, keep a feast together and keep your fingers off this one.
