I'm glad I never watched this show when it came out. <br /> <br /> I just wondered why it took 4 years. It reminds me of the terrible 80's with fake people, fake clothes and fake music. How did I ever grow up in this era? <br /> <br /> The play in most episodes I watched is forced. It makes for very boring performances. The plot lines are not very interesting, as the old Twilight Zone shows. The old show inspired the imagination and looked forward to the next show. <br /> <br /> Stick with the old Twilight Zone and save yourself the pain of looking at garbage.
