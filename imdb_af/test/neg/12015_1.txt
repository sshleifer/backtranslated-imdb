"Problem Child 2" was a total waste of my time. The original movie wasn't very good, but it's a classic compared to this movie. The first film has gone over the top with his scenes of a devilish child devastating great destruction in the lives of everyone he is. Here it goes over the top. And one scene in this movie proves that theory. The carnival ride was too much for me to stomach. It's terrible. This movie should not be made. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (out of four)
