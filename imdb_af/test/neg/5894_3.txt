We will never know the truth about 9/11. And this clumsy movie shows it. <br /> <br /> I recently looked at a YouTube report claiming that there were no aircraft involved in the destruction of the Twin Towers; that all the news programs are supposedly provided with the same corner shots from the Towers of a mysterious source (probably the gubmint?), and in the prescribed footage, CGI aircraft were replaced for real MISSILES that actually hit the towers. <br /> <br /> This is a compelling video, and although I'm not a Wacko Conspiracy Theorist, I'm not sure if the actual aircraft hit the only day of the day (the Towers, Shanksville Field, the Pentagon because there is no aircraft wreck available. (And what about the notorious "black boxes"? No recovery.) A million other theories are abundant, all of them transmitting a drop of truth into an ocean of speculation. But you will drown in malarkey before you find something truthful or about which you speculate in the 9/11 COMMERCIAL REPORT, a no-budget movie trying to close the barn after all the horses and jihadists have escaped. <br /> <br /> Of course, writer director Leigh Scott is a concerned American citizen who wants to relieve audiences about what the 560-page report can reveal. This will help if his movie actress, instead of a guy who looks like David Duchovny, a chick that looks like Gina Gershon, a man who thinks he's Russell Crowe and another man I'm pretty sure about, try hard to be Sean Bean. . This would help if his camera operator had no Parkinson's; if the lighting director does not try to save on electricity; This would help if his editor did not have attention to disorder disorder, or if the soundtrack was not a few trivial new world order esoterics; and the loop should probably have been inserted if people actually move their mouth. <br /> <br /> We can't even call this propaganda. It's too funny. And with funny I mean unwavering. <br /> <br /> You can't be a problem in this complex in a two-hour movie, but Leigh Scott tries anyway, including all the sexy catches we've made. to: bin Laden's intention to attack, buying Somalia weapons, non-aggression agreement with Iraq, Mussawi at flying school, weapons of mass destruction ... <br /> <br /> The problem is: we know it is all retrospectively, so every discussion of the relevant intelligence operations has a series of false backlinks, all in a neat conversation. As erected reverse engineering, everything is briefly mentioned so that we can shake our heads in wonder about how incompetent all these branches of government have screwed. <br /> <br /> There is a ridiculous interview scene with a nasty bimbo knock on a man with tomato sauce on his face. Now - it will be regarded as torture if most guys have not considered it as an attack. <br /> <br /> The tagline is: "What if the attack could be stopped?" Based on this film's account - and according to the Commission's report, the CIA and other underground agencies are all planning to catch bin Laden and have not done so. Everyone involved in "terrorism" reports (you mean you read these reports really?) Is so worried that we just want to beat them for their bad acting. <br /> <br /> Yet, the whole story goes much deeper than the banal sound bytes, the negligent Ku Bush Clan flew to the American people after 9/11. We now know that even bin Laden would not change or reach anything before the 9/11 attack - the wheels were moving with or without the Taliban figurehead whose involvement was the possible imagination of someone's crazy imagination to unite America against a common enemy. Unlike the general belief, they "did not attack us". As Ron Paul tried to explain, it was a case of the middle eastern blowback - "they were so sick of America planting their unbelieving feet" out there that they brought the war here. "Death likes to put on the stupid behavior," We fight them there so we don't have to fight here, "in fact." Because we are there, the battle is brought here. . "<br /> <br /> The 9/11 attack was not so much about the complicated planning of terrorists, as it was the gross negligence of the Bush administration, who we know (without Commission commissions) has the intel of Clinton's administration, information on terrorist cells that reach critical mass and their intention to cause chaos, but the Texas oil idiot, who refused to read his Daily Briefings and rather at his Crawford farms spending an extra day at work, the duty he swore lifted to do - protect the American public. <br /> <And then the scum who called himself used the attacks through his negligence as a political hammer against his own dumbed-down countryfolk to hit a second quarter, to destroy the US Constitution and to take America into a false war of a lie (WMD), with a country that has nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks, strangely the movie is never close to the Ku Bush Clan, without opinion or judgment, Leigh Scott wants to stay neutral. Tell it to the rapes and plunder hundreds of thousands in the Fake War on Terror in Iraq. <br /> <br /> By chance I realized I watched this DVD while wearing my "Bush song. Thousands died." t-shirt.
