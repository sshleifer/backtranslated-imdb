I have read other hacks reviews of this movie and although it is definitely not the best movie ever made in the sci-fi / horror genre, it is not as bad as you accept it for what it is - Budget, b-movie prize we'll say, "borrow heavily" from the kind of "Alien" (a strange alien monster that gets its victims). "Species" (a wonderful and confused "space girl") and "Incubus" beastie-hatching-with-prisoner girls corner). This is a serious movie, and the whole thing is, of course, done on a shocking budget, although the alien is not too bad (I have seen less convincing men-in-rubber suits anyway). None of the plays is Oscar material and the Isle of Man doesn't mean much for Boston Massacresetts. The plot is also pretty predictable and the assumption that an alien craft would travel with millions of miles and an accident crash in the middle of a college campus of all the girls. It therefore offers a rich source of perfect brood victims. It's completely ridiculous. However, the movie has its exciting moments, there are a few nudity and semi-nudity tools. The film is one of the few movie appearances of the beautiful and tragic model / actress Kadamba Simmons (as the "Space Girl") who, at the age of just 24, was shortly after she killed this film in London by her jealous boyfriend.
