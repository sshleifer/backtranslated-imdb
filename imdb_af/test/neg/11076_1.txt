Horror movies are a peculiar thing, sometimes they succeed in stumbling across a formula that works very well, sometimes trying bravely to tell a worthy story despite time and budget problems. Sometimes they are so bad that they are actually a little fun. and sometimes they are 'The Cavern'. <br /> <br /> A good horror / suspense movie should contain vagaries guessing, they should allow you to be interested in the characters and their motivation so that you actually have some kind of reaction when they die. The Cavern, however, chooses to represent elements that first work, only to be denied by its own light storytelling. <br /> <br /> All the characters are completely forgotten and any real story that can even make them. distance interests are wiped out within a secondary monologue, making it impossible to do anything other than laughing because characters are picked up almost randomly and on more than one occasion in the least frightening way. <br /> <br /> To spoil a scene, one victim is taken during a complete eclipse which may have been a little frightening if the sound effect used to indicate his murder did not remind at the helm of a potato too thick macaroni and cheese. Add to this formula The camera that makes me work, let me think the director saw one too many Nine Inch Nails videos and an end that, in an attempt to be shocking, serves almost no purpose, but to the viewer irritate and confuse and you have an almost completely unwavering horror. movie that fails on each level. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a claustrophobic caving horror movie, I will be honest with you, watch "The Descent" and I feel weird to say it because I didn't really enjoy that movie too.
