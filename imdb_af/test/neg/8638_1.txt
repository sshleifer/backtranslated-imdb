The film begins with a tale of the protagonist who declares certain crimes that occur throughout the city and then teaches that the hero is a cop who has been suspended or is likely to have retired. I didn't have the patience or interest to verify the above before commenting. If there is a stereotype for storytellers to have a deep, dormant voice, it's time to put an end to it. I fell asleep seriously and didn't bother closing the movie. Still try to find out what the movie is about and why there were no outdoor shootings. A third rate TV Serial will add more sets compared to this crap of a movie and I'm still sorry the actors and producers involved in this great bullshit of a movie. It had to be produced as a regular TV show or maybe even as a local drama in place of putting it on the big screen. Total waste of time and money. The movie had to be in production for a long time, and it would have been better to leave it like that. With excess sleep induction dialogs and sets, it's the worst movie I've got.
