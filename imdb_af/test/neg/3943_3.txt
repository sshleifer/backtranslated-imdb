A mediocre, best horror movie dealing with stupid, not so horny teens discovering an evil video game kills those who die in the game (DOUBLE GASP). This movie is the continuing secret of the Mystery Walk in "Scooby Doo". I waited for them to pull off a mask from one of the villains. I can handle it for 40 minutes, even as a movie on sci-fi, but go completely to the theaters, come on people. The consequences were very mediocre, this whole scenario is something of the crummy two-but director Uwe Boll, as it will be his role. As always, the big thing about video games is the glorious power button. I suggest you use the mid-version. * 1/2
