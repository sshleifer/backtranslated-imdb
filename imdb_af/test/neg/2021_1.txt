I have a loss for words. This movie is out of description. I do not believe there is a language on Earth that has a word that can describe how terrible this movie is. If you're trying to look at it, make sure you keep the "surprise ending". I just made it over the three quarters of the way through this piece of shit before I couldn't take it anymore. Fortunately (or unfortunately) some of my friends stayed until the end. When they woke up from their coma and after a few weeks of therapy they could fill me in on what I missed. This movie has no story, no plot, terrible writing, and even worse acting. If you like to see train wrecks or car accidents, this movie is for you. I think my IQ dropped about 30 points after watching it. (Insert explicit here).
