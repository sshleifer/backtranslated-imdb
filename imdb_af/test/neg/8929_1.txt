It's 3 months and you know what it means ... A new Seagal movie. Seagal is really on movie movie after horrible movie. Every time every movie gets worse and worse, it's really great! I don't really know what to say about TIME, first it's a piece of shit, the story doesn't make sense at all, secondly he uses stuntmen in all his fighting scenes, and last but not least, many of them footage taken from other movies! It amazes how this man works, arrives late and sets early, so his films are full of plot holes and stuntmen. Why are we continuing to buy his movies, why do we hope that maybe he'll make a good movie?
