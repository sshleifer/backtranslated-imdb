A little crippled teenager from Brisbane. While the plot depends on a fairly decent idea, the writing is very lame and two of the three main teens are absurd. The problem is that the kids have to go with their plan, they must be far more reckless than they have shown, but if they were devilish, it might be difficult for them to be equal. not really either. In fact, I first started enjoying the movie when I started their death. One of those movies where in about a thousand places the most sensible option would be to call the police. I realize we won't have a movie if they've done it, but it would be nice if we could believe they wouldn't. Avoid.
