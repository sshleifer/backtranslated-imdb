If you find the portrayal of violent murders and incessant police brutality expressed in a plot less movie with glacier active, you can enjoy Surveillance. This film was rubbish for both the mind and the spirit. The idea that it is a thriller is comical; This will imply some kind of tension and twists. You've been waiting for the story to actually start with the start. It never rises above a glorification of poorly intelligent violent criminals and individuals of all levels of life. Suggest all the violence of "No country for old men", without any kind of chase or sympathetic characters. Upright killers run amok. The acting is good, mostly, but the writing is a heap. Don't bother and tell your friends not to bother.
