This video has sound intended for someone to hear during their sleep. And the same can be said for the video. <br /> <br /> Morgan and his wife pretended to snatch it on minimum wage opportunities? With a camera roll? And his little wife-poo complained? Give me a chance. They are both rich. They are sitting in their fake $ 350 / month apartment that filmed it with their $ 1,000 / month video crew of 12. <br /> <br /> I respect Morgan, but now his 30-day experience is no more than trying. To mislead any volunteer who is willing to deceive. <br /> <br /> C'mon Morgan, you are filmed to do a work of $ 6.00 per hour and you are paid by naive employers who do not see those big people cameras filming the whole thing ?? And we can't think they didn't pay you under the table?
