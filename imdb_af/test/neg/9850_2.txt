This is one of a rarity of movies. Instead of a bowl of popcorn, it should be watched with a bottle of vodka. To be completely honest, we are a group of people who actually know the man, Mo Ogrodnik, and have decided to be foolish to this movie. <br /> <br /> The film by Wolfgang Something's photography both seems to be eliminating. close-ups and breasts. Mo and Wolfgang's joint effort revealed the passion of the two actresses, plastic pans that have passion. There is also a beetle. As Violet put it, "This (plastic carpet) goes on your butt". The rocky porridge and the subsequent root marrow are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Good. So if you're still reading, let's explain who we are. Mo Ogrodnik teaches at NYU and we are a group of her students who, when finishing a film class with her, decided to get poop-faced and look at the director's debut. She also wrote Uptown Girls. I can't tell you how much it has been hammered into our skulls. So this movie is quite the experience. At the bottom of this post will be a drinking game that we created for this movie. <br /> <br /> About 13 minutes into this game, none of us could see straight. The mere amount of Dido's in the first thirty minutes created enough reasons to drink an elephant. There was something mysterious to see that two minor girls hit a Kurt Cobain lookalike with absolutely no context, except for his mysterious scene at the convenience store. where he obviously read a local newspaper. Because that's what we all do. The heart-shaped glasses were wonderfully derived from Lolita. And something about the challenging scene of the naked chin-up boy suggests the directors' history of homosexual pornographic experiments. We wish we were joking. <br /> <br /> Enough intellectual consideration. To the drink game! This will ensure that the viewing experience is a positive one. It's very simple, and you will probably care for at least one of your party immediately. <br /> <br /> The Mo Ogrodnik / Ripe Drink Game: 1. Every time you see something related to pornography, drink a little. 2. Every time you see, the author Mo Ogrodnik's name appears, drink a little. 3. Six. 4. (plastic carpet) requires two drinks. 5. When someone indicates a rifle at another character, take a drink. -In this stage you will probably have to stay away from any body you remain. 6. Any time there is blood (INCLUDING "LADY BLOOD"), please take a swallow! 7. The under-used hula hoop girl needs one drink per second. 8. Free use of the "magical black man" requires one drink. 9. If you can't figure out the doorline, HOW DRINK, Beyotch. 10. If you can predict a line, take a drink. Trust us. It's easy. <br /> <br /> That's it, internet! Keep drinking, and try not to ripen. <br /> <br /> -Hawaiian Smirnoff Punch, Jr.
