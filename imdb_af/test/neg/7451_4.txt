This movie started tremendously; The first 30 minutes are very funny and clever with some interesting characters. That's the good news. The bad news is that the movie then becomes too repetitive and then it becomes stupid. <br /> <br /> What comes up is a Santa Claus with "magical" powers with lots of New Age baloney being thrown into the mix. It's just ridiculous and hardly the kind of Christmas movie I expect from Jim Varney's Ernest. <br /> <br /> To be honest, it still has a decent amount of laughter and is profanity free, but not a movie I could recommend.
