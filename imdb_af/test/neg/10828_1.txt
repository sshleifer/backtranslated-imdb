Right ... so you have a pond, tons of water (it really looks very slow) and a small town right below the dam's path of destruction. Throw a lucrative glutton, a seemingly mentally unstable and disgruntled architect and his son, and then add a bad plot and bad scene. All in all, if you look at this movie from a paying client's point of view, I will feel very much like a pay-per-view movie. If you want a laugh ... then you really should watch this movie.
