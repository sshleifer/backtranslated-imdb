It was one of the worst movies I can remember watching. I'm sure I got worse if it softened me. It's not funny, there are stupid stereotypical jokes that aren't funny again. I was a prisoner heard on a plane and watched this movie. It was a total waste of time. I enjoyed Martin in previous films, but not this one. The same for Queen Latifah, she was excellent in Chicago and in Set It Off she was also good, but this role was terrible. <br /> <br /> I mostly have credit for the failure of the bad writing writing. I feel strongly that you cannot save a formal, intact script with decent actors, this movie as a point in the issue. Yet, everyone involved must be prudent enough not to participate in this film. I'm just surprised that something can get worse, made, released and promoted.
