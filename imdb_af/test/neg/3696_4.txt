I was interested to watch it since it was named the worst movie ever on an entry dedicated to the 1950s sci-fi theater in a British magazine from the early 1980s, titled "The Movie" (also the Leonard Maltin Film Guide awarded it the unenviable BOMB rating). When it came out on DVD last year, I was interested in buying the "Cult Camp Classics" kit in which it was included (along with the WORD OF OLD ROOM [1958] and THE GIANT BEHEMOTH [1959]); But since I recently bought QUEEN on DVD-R, I paid the idea. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I just stumbled across the movie on DivX, but the pressure is not from the Warners DVD (which is said to give a surprisingly pleasant transfer), but rather a muddy TV print ... but not so much that the detail is lost (that is, it was like watching the movie in sepia as opposed to black and white!). Anyway, to get the matter going: I have to admit that I was somehow disappointed. The movie was not the feast I had been expecting all the time (Maltin calls it "hilariously awful"). ; actually, i found it very enchanting - and thankfully briefly in an hour long. However, some uncomfortable bits remain - as when the old nurse shouts her head at the eyes of the 50-foot woman and when the Sheriff's deputy almost walks over his head and the front lady's butler, in his enthusiasm to be helpful in such an unusual case. The special effects did not hit me as "under the funniest" (Maltin again) on film - though it certainly is embarrassing! <br /> <br /> OK, so the idea that a stranger (in huge size human form, dressed in cave rags, and radioactive to start!) comes to Earth in a large ball-shaped (!) spaceship and apparently after the heroine's esteemed chain is completely nonsense - and its quasi-transparent appearance does not make it good at all ... but really, this is the human story of our attention (relatively speaking). The character of the man in the country is not very interesting, but his two women are: rich, but overall alcoholic woman Allison Hayes and the ambitious, fiery girlfriend, Yvette Vickers. Also involved in the story is Hayes 'faithful servant (already mentioned), some policemen (one of whom, as mentioned elsewhere, is almost goofy) and so many doctors (one of whom is Dr Cushing [!] And another' a specialist enrolled when Hayes grows in size after being exposed to radiation.) <br /> <br /> Of course, the film can be seen as the reverse female version of THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN (1957) - although it wouldn't be fair to compare the two further, since the Jack Arnold / Richard Matheson classic is much more psychological / intellectual in approach; Actually, Hayes doesn't seem to be associated with her "condition" and actually benefits from teaching her husband a lesson! However, her devastation - exaggerated in movie posters of the era - is rather peculiar (especially if it is considered that it only occurs in the last ten minutes or so); when it's not the damage caused by her huge but highly convincing hand (especially when she lifts the puppet what her husband should be!), she is mostly seen as she moves in long shot and almost from behind (with her size even contrary to the buildings she passes) !! Still, Hayes's downfall via electricity (when she's stuck in an electric cable) is being done skillfully. <br /> <br /> Finally, I followed this with his 1993 TV remake with Daryl Hannah as the titular being - which I specifically hired for this purpose.
