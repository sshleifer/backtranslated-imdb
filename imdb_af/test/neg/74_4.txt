The talented screenwriter, Alvin Sargent, unfortunately cannot get any pleasant ideas that boast of this artificial little thing about a vibrant mother and her adult teenage daughter trying to make their lives work in Los Angeles, despite the mischievous behavior of their mother . Apart from several good rows, I did not buy Susan Sarandon as a wing (she is too intrinsically smart and focused to go beyond this devil-virgin lady) and her naturally grounded personality is a bad fit for the role of an irresponsible parent. Natalie Portman is much better than her child, and yet there is a terrible dislike for her work (and some of her scenes, such as the one she's asking for a boy to strip, are wrong and uncomfortable to look at). Certainly not an incompetent piece, "Anywhere But Here" has moments that work, but it is not an embracing film, nor did it play an important role. ** of ****
