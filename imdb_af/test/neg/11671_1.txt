Like the previous two Mad Max movies, 'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome', it is no exception to the violence and the strange plot. Mad Max is in a post-war society where he has to destroy the master blower and get the children tomorrow. It's generally a warped movie with Peter Pan references and Tina Turner, methane pigs, and strange characters. I was very bored by looking at everything, and it didn't offer me anything. I didn't feel inspired after watching this movie; The only decent thing about this movie was the extremely strange characters that were chosen in various ways throughout the film. This is too strange for me, and it was very boring.
