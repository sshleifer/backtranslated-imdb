I saw this ego-centric "attempt" to achieve a film of "epic" status in the company of several indigenous Russian family members. Five people gave 5 different reactions, from Mikhalkov's worship to my cynicism. <br /> <br /> I saw a movie that Mikhalkov looked like, took a lot of "Canal +" money, some of it in his (and other's) pockets and transferred the project to a bunch film students. I counted at least 4 different styles in the movie. There is no way the same director is responsible for these different scenes. Contrast it to yourself: <br /> <br /> · Cadet polish shoes with a dog. <br /> <br /> · Train station scene (goodbye Andrei). <br /> <br /> · Outdoor panoramic shots. <br /> <br /> Ormond speaks through the keyhole. <br /> <br /> · Initial effort to get the Grand Duke and later pursued scene to sing Andrei back in Figaro. <br /> <br /> Screen Order <br /> <br /> Julia Ormond is faster than superman. She learns about his transfer later, she gets across Moscow in one minute to bless André. <br /> <br /> Russian residents felt the impression of Russian life was "caricature" and not history. They call it "tourist postcard" Russia. <br /> <br /> They were all proud that a Russian director / manufacturer / fixer managed to break in "big time" and wasting more than 30 million dollars from others. people's money, while you might put some in local bags during filming. <br /> <br /> If you want to think, you've seen that Russia is going to see this movie. Drink coffee before you go.
