When they announced this movie to TNT, I was excited. A Travesty of Donald Westlake's "Enough" was one of my favorite stories. After watching it, I wasn't so excited. Recently I had a chance to see it a second time with my aunt, and again I was disappointed (she didn't like much of it, and she never read the book). In this movie they managed to juice all the charm of the book and make it into dull frost. A major part of the problem was William H. Macy. I like him well in other movies, but he (Terry / Carey) played Thorpe as a stuttering, incompetent yutz. In the book, Thorpe takes a lot of valium for his nerves, but almost always stays outwards, which is part of the fun. SPOILERS follow: They also left a great deal of the story (except a 2 second glimpse at the embassy), where Thorpe did not release 1 but 4 murders for the police. This is important, not only because it is funny, but because it helps the relationship between Fred and Thorpe. In the film, Fred's betrayal is ultimately not so detrimental, as they do not look close to everything. In the book they become good friends, especially on Fred's side, which makes it ironic that he is the one who arranges Thorpe's demise. Fred also stuck a little, I love Adam Arkin, but he wasn't happy. He was happy to be alive. These are similar detectives, traits that the book of Fred owns, which obviously makes it more character to beat with evidence more shocking. Patricia and Edgarson were very close to the book, and James Cromwell was good, although he didn't look much like Martin Balsam. The whole boring boat scene, which was completely added to the movie, was far less interesting than police found Edgarson's body after Thorpe sent it to Seattle and blamed death on the gang. Kit was okay, although she was mostly rewritten, and it would have been nice to see her die because she was slightly annoying. I don't mind making changes to books to make movies, but I know it's needed due to length and trouble, but it would have been nice if some of the changes in this movie were harder or smarter rather than dimmer.
