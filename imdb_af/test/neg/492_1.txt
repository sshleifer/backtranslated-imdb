Well ....... how and where do I describe this full nonsense? Imagine the morale of a cute Hollywood western, throw a cute help from the most striking soap opera storyline, and try to urge the kids to keep their cool off by taking care of something contemporary ' to be. This film is all package and absolutely no dust. <br /> <br /> It starts with promise ...... young men who dream of becoming rockstars and getting involved in the kind of excessive heroism everyone can laugh at. Then it all goes downhill ..... faster than a bobsled without brakes. The scene in which the first concert with Steel Dragon is involved is one of the most pathetic pieces "cine kitsch" I've seen in the past. The singer appears on stage for his debut and falls on a staircase ..... will he rise and sing ?? ...... or will he stay on the floor and not sing ...... who is giving up now? It gets worse, but I don't want to endure myself by remembering it in all its ominous details. If you look at this review, it's your own fault!
