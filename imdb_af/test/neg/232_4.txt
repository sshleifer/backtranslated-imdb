I can't stress it enough, * do NOT * this movie for the kids. <br /> <br /> For the sake, you also want to save the adults the best. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe I'm a little exaggerated. This is not the worst child movie ... no, let me repeat it. It's not the worst movie made by frail adults for disciplined adults and somehow marketed for kids (that would be "Jack", which I meant to revise / gut like a fish). <br /> <br /> Adults will not learn anything surprising (good if you need to, just ahead of the end credits for an Educational Little about an Interesting Cosmic Phenominone). We usually don't end up as adults we wanted to do as kids like reality tend to get in the way. Well, I can tell you that (four years of college at an art school, but I can degress). <br /> <br /> I have no idea what the old kids might get from this movie. . Probably it will only upset them (we get the moment when Russ has been traumatized for eight years). There is a better movie, "Kiki's Delivery Service", which essentially has the same message, but rather handles it instead of drilling it in your head. And the adults will love it too! <br /> <br /> By the way, there is a moment in mind with amateur MST3K riders in mind, thinking of the other Bruce Willis movie with a sad little child in it.
