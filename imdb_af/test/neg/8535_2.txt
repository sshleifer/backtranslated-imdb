****** Spoilers are ******* What a dull, predictable, non-scary snore attachment. The film had no character development: I had no empathy with any of the characters (except the little boy) and didn't care what happened to any of them. The movie has so many click bits, or elements stolen from other horror movies. <br /> <br /> The movie was so predictable. Many times I will say to myself: "Let me guess, does it happen next?" Yes, I'm right. Even in the opening scene, I predicted that the "attack" was on the family by someone, probably the father (because only the wife and children were attacked). Sure enough, that's what happened (of course you have to wait 79 minutes to check). And of course, another "evil man" scenario. Why was he angry and killed his family? Because he is a man, duh! <br /> <br /> As someone else said, this movie can be frightening to anyone under the age of 13, or to a 1970 movie, but it's far from a frightening movie according to today's standards. AND, like so many other crap horror movies, were a lot of frightening fakes. Scary music, Scary music, Scary music, and ..... a crow suddenly at the window! Wow, scary! <br /> <br /> How did the old banker drive a few times to run over an open lot without the dad seeing him? I probably thought the old man was a ghost. No, just a crappy movie. <br /> <br /> I evaluated this movie a 2 out of 10 because it kept my attention enough to sit down the whole thing.
