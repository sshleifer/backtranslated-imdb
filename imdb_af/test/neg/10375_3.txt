I just saw it at the Castro Theater in San Francisco and had trouble staying awake during this incredibly repetitive, unexposed little movie. It is a 75-minute movie that feels like 175 minutes and has about 20 minutes of modest material. It's not bad in any offensive way, but just repeat what has been said many, many times and more interestingly and challengingly. With just a few exceptions, the interviews are over and over and over, making little emotional contact or context for the whole subject. It's more like a "how to" guide for something that can no longer be done. I was alive during the era, but had little connection or nostalgia for what was offered.
