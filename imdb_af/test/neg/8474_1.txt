The satirical film site Dateline Hollywood sang the "Son of the Mask" all playing a practical joke star Jamie Kennedy on New Line Cinema for his show "The Jamie Kennedy Experiment." If so, then. And if the movie was as bright as the satire piece. <br /> <br /> "The Mask" was the ideal vehicle for face-catching Jim Carrey who printed so many viewers; It was also delighted men at the age of 12 to introduce Cameron Diaz. Such a succession minus both of them was not a good idea, plus you would have thought New Line would have learned their lesson after "Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry With Lloyd." But no ... although it is fair, it is in line with the original cartoon (in which the Mask passed from owner to owner). However, as written by Lance Khazei and director of Lawrence Guterman, there is nothing in return for it, except for a steady stream of well-known FX through the usual squadron of houses (Industrial Light and Magic on the Ally McBeal dancing baby and their own "Baby's Day Out," with the Tippett Studio, Giant Killer Robots, Digital Dimension and so on in support) and an even greater pledge to cartoon fans by having our heroism at an animation company (responsible for such gems as "Siamese Easter", which calls its character after Tex Avery, and works in not only references to classic cartoons, but also real cuts. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the last approach doesn't really work, partly because most attempts to bring cartoon shows to action are flat (especially the cars are in the party mood) and mostly because The tribute to Flintstones, Woody Woodpecker, "Duck Amuck" and especially "One Froggy Evening" shows how poor this movie is. Plus the movie fits into the shambolic slapstick next to the tense feeling (the underlying theme of the story is family; our hero is not ready to have a son, and his nemesis - Alan Cumming as the Norwegian god Loki - is far from the apple Odin's eye ... and what Bob Hoskins does here as Odin, even after Super Mario Bros, "outside of me," and Kennedy is just not in the same league as Carrey in the zany game - although not like him is not getting any help from the writing. Also note that, unlike Diaz, the very cute Traylor Howard (like the Mum's mother's mother) doesn't have much to do; <br /> <br /> Further points have been lost because Cumming, Hoskins, Steven Wright and Magda Szubanski are being thrown away, for a suspiciously shortened running time (missing some gaping plot holes and scenes) and for an incredibly bad attempt at an inner joke when our hero does not have the concept of the "green man" as a animated TV series sold - "The Mask" has become an animated TV show in real life and was a much better result than this sequel. The fact that it actually opened in Britain before the US has to tell you everything ... which looks like this and "Blade: Trinity" is New Line's intention to pave the way for the terrible successors with "Two Guys And A Girl ". "What next," The Butterfly Effect 2 "with Nathan Fillion? <br /> <br /> Someone stops it.
