Luckily I watched this movie alone, so I could move through the worst scenes (most of the movie actually). OK, it's not bad, with some good photography (even some of the underwater scenes) and sometimes not bad. But it still doesn't save the incredible poor writing and the way it's worse. In addition, if I don't find the movie "hottie" to be it, even the wannabe-sexy love shows are boring. Really boring! And for the drama: You know it's always a bad sign if you don't touch all the characters, you really don't care, who lives and who dies. <br /> <br /> If you haven't yet got tired of the reality series Survivor, you might find something in your movie. If not, stay clear!
