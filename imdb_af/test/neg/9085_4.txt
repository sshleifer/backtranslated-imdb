During an eight-year period of the 1980s, when Charles Bronson made nine films, only one was released by a company other than the Cannon Group: The Evil That Men Do, a TriStar Films bakkie from Sir Lew Grade see ITC Entertainment company. Bronson was already in talks with director J. Lee Thompson, who was in 1989 'Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects'. <br /> <br /> Expectations should be pretty high with Bronson and Thompson working for better-funded outfits like ITC, but 'The Evil That Man Do' is a huge disappointment at many levels. While still from the low budget, B-movie form of the 1980s, 'Evil' draws the potential for a good film. However, everyone in the production department took an easy way out and sold hackwork that was not of Bronson's imprint. 'The Evil That Men Do' had a concept and technical resources that could be used to make one of Bronson and Thompson's best films, but instead it is one of their most average. <br /> <br /> This 1984 political excitement / action is furiously opened with Clement Molloch (Joseph Maher), a British doctor, who holds his special training class for political leaders in Suriname. The gray-haired, passive Molloch is an expert on torture methods operating in many political governments. In the opening seven minutes, we see Molloch using electric current to cause unbearable pain on Jorge Hidalgo (Jorge Humberto Robles), a dissident journalist. As you might expect, the scene is horrible to watch and cut from the original VHS release. <br /> <br /> Hidalgo was none other than a friend of Holland (Bronson), a retired killer who enjoys life in the Cayman Islands. Holland was approached by the journalist years ago to liberate the humanity of Molloch, but overturned the offer. A Mexican professor, named Hector Lomelin (José Ferrer), visited Holland shortly after Hidalgo's death in finishing the work, with videotapes of evidence from the doctor's victims. While in denial, Holland finally agrees with the dirty work, which directs Molloch and his doting sister Claire (Antoinette Bower) in Guatemala. <br /> <br /> Holland goes to Guatemala City with the help of a consultant, Max Ortiz (René Enriquez); He is touring with Hidalgo's widow Rhiana (Theresa Saldana) and young daughter Sarah (Amanda Nicole Thomas). As with most of Bronson's later output, his character beat Molloch's henchmen one by one, with roads with a bad American diplomat (John Glover) and his supporting hit (Roger Cudney) along the way. A brutal end occurs in the slits of an opal mine, where the doctor only gets deserts from several of his victims. <br /> <br /> "The Evil That Men Do" is based on a forgotten novel by R. Lance Hill and jumps during US political activity in Latin America during the 1980s. Indeed, 'Evil' is cooked heavily in every sense of the term, as it uses sensation and doses of brutality to cover major weaknesses in plot and character development. For every plus this movie has, there are three or four minuses that emerge from the craft. <br /> <br /> While 'The Evil That Men Do' has a good concept, the movie is never more than an excuse for Bronson to wipe out foreign foam. In the style of bad pulp fiction, 'Evil' is filled with cardboard characters that we never get to know or understand. Holland, despite being heavily played by Bronson, never talks about his inner feelings or explains what motivated him to become a murderer. Rhiana, a terribly weak part for Theresa Saldana, becomes disgusting to many of Holland, but later feels a love for him. Where does her love come from, especially after watching Holland kill several people and just go home, just a few scenes? <br /> <br /> The most interesting characters are actually Molloch and his sister Claire, because so many questions can be asked of them. Of course, we never find out what they have brought so closely together, how and where they started torture, what is Claire's precise role in their business? These plot holes can last forever, especially with the filming of the paint-by numbers that appear to be fine. Why has Hidalgo's daughter been brought in such a dangerous situation, other than that his convenient hostage must be taken by Molloch? If Molloch's bodyguard Randolph (Raymond St Jacques) Holland and Rhiana in the cockpit arena clearly saw, why is he so friendly with them in a bar? Is his memory so short? And what was the purpose, unlike the cheapest atelier, of Holland that Molloch's driver Cillero (Jorge Luke) threw off a window rim when the murder could be more strategically handled in Claire's apartment? <br /> <br /> The overall play is decent and somehow Bronson gives one of its strongest performances. J. Lee Thompson's direction is lacking at points, but can be compromised on site by limited time. Apart from Evil's filming in Mexico, the presence of ITC is evident through better production values, cinematography and music. Rural sites are well used to convey the warm and dusty atmosphere of Latin America and cinematographers. Xavier Cruz offers rich color and clarity. The orchestral score of Ken Thorne ('Murphy's War') is refreshing in an era of synthesized litter. Oddly enough, these positives just add to the frustration of a good movie screaming to come out. Peter Lee Thompson's editing is better than usual, but with more laughing continuity errors. <br /> <br /> 'The Evil Than Men Do' was the perfect grindhouse material for the early 80's and I find it hard to recommend for the 21st century action. fans. The Columbia TriStar Entertainment DVD is a great presentation and offers widescreen and standard four-language subtitles. While video quality is well above average, 'Evil' was originally recorded in regular mono sound. The theater trailer is on offer and actually has a grindhouse feel, with eroded color and fuzzy sound quality. <br /> <br /> ** from 4
