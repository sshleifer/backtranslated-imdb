I like the concept CSI, but the show is spoiled by some serious woodworkers. The Medical Examiner has the best lines and delivers it in a bow, oblique way that delivers the story. Unfortunately, he has little screen time. <br /> <br /> Also, why does Jorja Fox always look so unhappy? I know forensic investigation is a very serious matter, but the characters are mostly serious about humor and a complete lack of personality. I can't think it's Sarah Sidle or Catherine Willows; What are you talking about? I wait for the episode when Catherine at the end of a shift picks up a remote control, shows it at Grissom, puts him down and wheels him until the next day.
