As I am from Norway (one of the top ten (or so) richest countries in the world), it was great fun to see how our trucks used to come from the 1950s and live in cottages of the Middle Ages. And since we have very strict laws on handguns, it was fun to see how many guns there were in Norway during the five minutes of the shooting there. Mr. Direct-to-video even brought his thumb to short notice. He must therefore have powerful friends in the customs. <br /> <br /> Please do at least _some_ research before going to an "exotic" country, dudes - you can hurt the feelings of old fans. <br /> <br /> Sverre ou fan with sore feelings.
