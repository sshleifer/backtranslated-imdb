Normally, any movie with Steve Railsback is a good movie. However, this film does not match that opinion. Life Force is an under-average movie that is extremely confusing at first (reminds me of Star Trek: TMP), but can get things done until the end of London Zombie City. A horror / sci-fi button that is very difficult to go through, although the naked space / vampire is very easy to watch. This movie earns a score of 4 out of 10.
