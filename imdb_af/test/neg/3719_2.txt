If this movie becomes a holiday tradition, I have to hide for the rest of my life for Christmas. How do you even think about comparing it with a wonderful life! It was absolutely terrible! The boy curled my toes. And what on earth was dealing with his hair? Emmy Worthy Performance?! Please. Granted, Lucci did well, but an Emmy ????? I think this movie is a waste of money. The fact that they were so close to the original story as giving it a modern and retro touch made it even worse. It had no enthusiasm and perseverance on all accounts. Lighting, wardrobe, make-up, everyone seemed to want to go home. Just a big NO of me.
