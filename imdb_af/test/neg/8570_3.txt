The heading describes it exactly. This dribble of a movie was nothing more than the typical group of teenagers who accidentally killed someone, because somebody had been pursuing them for 20 years. The only turn is instead of an angry ex-classmate or lovely psycho / loser, it was a nun. Nun wants to cut off the sins of the girls, blah blah, girls accidentally / deliberately drown the nun, blah blah, not cry the girls, people die, movie ends. The only thing this watch made was the dead scenes, which were pretty cool (especially the one with the elevator door that rounds off this thick lady's arms), but even they couldn't make it a good movie. Brian Yuzna must hang his head to attach himself to this garbage. I'm sure I rented it and didn't buy it, or I'd be furious. If you want a nunsploiting movie to please the senses, check out Demonia or something. Stay away from this garbage.
