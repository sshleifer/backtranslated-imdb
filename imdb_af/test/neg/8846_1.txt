Forget the bad acting that can be forgiven in this kind of movie. Or even the terrible, unnatural dialogue and illogical events (if my captions actually reflect what was said). Much worse is the blatant absence of an experienced or experienced director who might have had a holiday with the editor while the film was made? To watch the movie, it feels completely outdated, although it was "just" made 7 years ago. A computer virus as a portal for the afterlife? lol? A dial up internet connection? Clucky ghosts photos photos in photos ("He! Look there is ... is it. Is it a face?" and ranges are poorly edited and as a result do not flow at all. You will look at a girl who gets a body that is still in one scene of the knot, and then literally 10 seconds later to see her again in one place, apparently untouched, smiling and going. <br /> <br /> Apart from the many problems I have with the film in terms of production value, it is also painfully long and repetitive and therefore quite boring. <br /> <br /> I recommend 'Shutter' instead, an Oriental (Thai) horror movie did well.
