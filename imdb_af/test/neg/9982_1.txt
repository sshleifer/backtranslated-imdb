As a semi-movie buff, I've heard of this infamous movie for a long time. I heard that it was basically a $ 15 million film about the tyrannical rule of the Roman emperor Caligula, with harsh nuclear pornography. What struck me was that it was a porn movie, but it had great thespians like Peter O'Toole, John Geilgud, Malcolm McDowell and Hellen Mirren in it. ?? A week ago I saw a documentary about Caligula on the History Channel, and this film came in my head and eventually my curiosity got the best of me. I rented the DVD foolishly and looked even more foolish. <br /> <br /> In the first 30 minutes I saw acts of sex and especially violence that earned an NC-17 according to current standards. It was really necessary to have a scene of a man who closed his urinary tract, and then yarn threw wine into it and then cut his stomach with a sword (all in great detail). And a scene where a man gets his d *** and cut off from dogs (again in very graphic detail) .... and it just scratches the surface. The argument for this movie by those who like it seems that this is the only film that honest Rome depicts honestly and that is excessive. When it's actually what this movie really is, it's just exploitation. From start to finish, you see nothing but endless torture and decapitations, and all kinds of violence and crude behavior imaginable (sadomasochism, rape, nekrofile, it just never stopped). There is no insight into Caligula itself, which can have made him drunk, the terrible childhood he had that shaped him as an adult into a sadistic form. This is not a historical movie, it has been slammed. Even pornography in this movie stinks, and many of this when I wasn't gagging, I was just bored. By the time it was over, I was depressed, didn't feel much like eating and this movie was impossible, it could really turn you off sex. <br /> <br /> What were these great actors thinking when they came? in this. I read that the porn segments were filmed after the main shooting was completed (which explains why none of the key players in any of these scenes is and why the quality of these scenes is so poor). But still, all these actors must know what they are doing. The opening credits include "Penthouse Magazine and Bob Gucionne Presents". And the screens that the famous actors really participate in are completely repulsive in and of themselves. Apparently, director Tinto Brass wanted to remove his name completely from the finished film, just like the author (Gore Vidal of all people). Even John Geilgud and Peter O'toole asked people not to see it when opened at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> For the amount of money the producers spent on it, the quality of the film is terrible. Everything is underlying and dark as if the movie was dropped in a swamp before it was developed, and that is when you are lucky to see a scene that is actually in focus. The sound is badly baptized, many of the music is uncomfortable and the editing is very good. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I brought this movie to myself. My advice ... don't look here, don't look here, don't look here ...... as for myself, tomorrow night I'll look something lighter .... like DAY OF DEATH!
