The story of Ed Gein is interesting, VERY interesting. However, this movie is just interesting in the fact that it's actually made. Kane Hodder's portrayal of Ed Gein is so far, it's not even the slightest bit funny. Ed Gein did not behave in public psychologically, he was very calm and collected and always extremely polite to everyone and spoke to anyone who would listen. This is one of the most important things this movie doesn't show the audience. But the biggest mistake of this movie, side of even one frame ever shot, was that Ed had never killed anyone without telling it through his dead mother, whom he thought to speak of outside the grave. He just killed the people who said his dead mother had to have it, because it was God's will, and he was very remorseful, but it didn't stop him from experimenting with cannibalism and carrying people's flesh . I officially gave this movie a score of 1, simply because "0" was not given me as an option. <br /> <br /> I encourage everyone to stay away from this movie. If you want to see a movie depicting Ed Gein accurately and not trying a sub-plot of love story between a policeman and a never-existent woman, I suggest you watch the original movie unhappy doesn't look like IMDb.com, although I could be wrong, but I haven't found it here yet. The original does not reject the actual events and does not try to turn the story. I can understand the story from a different perspective, but this movie has just been trying to change the true story itself, which I find so horrible as to make a movie based on 9/11, but it was Canada was behind it. Or a WWII movie that Hitler says was a good guy and helped fight the Nazis.
