As a geology student, this movie shows Hollywood's ignorance. In the scene where the dog grabs the bone from the inside of the burning house, it is less than a foot of lava that has an average temperature of 1,750 degrees Fahrenheit. This stupidity is once again seen when Stan is going to save metro 4. His shoes melt to the floor of the subway while the rest of the team is just off the flowing lava. And to complete these samples of a movie, they find the most illogical solution, and stop a lava flow with cement K-rails. Earlier in the movie, a reporter's voice can be heard that nothing can stop the firefighters, cars and CEMENT have tried. Common sense dictates this film is a turbulent and gross understatement of human knowledge.
