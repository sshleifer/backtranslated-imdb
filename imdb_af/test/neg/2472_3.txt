Well, it's standard Hollywood Schmaltz you can see coming a mile away. It's nice in parts, but just o so predictable. I have to confess I didn't really enjoy it, but I'm pretty hard to please and many of my friends love it. <br /> <br /> It's pretty sweet, and the actors give good performances. It is a nice background and the eyecup is pretty good. But the annoyingly predictable, inextricable and really dull story contains the film back. Personally, I can think of better ways to spend a few hours of my life. <br /> <br /> The chick flick genre gets some bad press, but there are some real good chicks out there; it is not one of them.
