Look forward to a continuation of Lonesome Dove, but it was total rubbish. Cinematography was terrible. Shoot away too tightly. Was almost the Grand Canyon through a stationary telescope. Editing is cut, cut, cut. Not even at all. More like a bad student editor. Don't know if McMurtry played the screen, but the dialogue was terrible. Actually like Val Kilmer's depiction of Doc Holiday in Wyatt Earp, but what did he do with this character in Comanche Moon? I have no idea. Even it seems to have been shot at a good stage using the old Bonanza sets. How could the director of the original Lonesome Dove go so wrong? Where was his head ............. Can't say much for the acting either. It's a pity they hid such a beautiful western one, but they were in a hurry to get it in the tin. Read other reviews and see others feel the same way. Not even curious to look after the next few nights, as it would just be a waste of time as the first night was. <br /> <br /> (2nd post) .............. .... OK since nothing else was on TV, I must be honest and admit that I am the last Watched 2 nights of Comanche Moon. And I will be honest to tell you that I didn't make it to the end of one of the last 2 episodes, because I fell asleep! I can only admit that I followed the two main characters very carefully and I could select some of the ways Steve Zahn did while portraying the character Duval did such an excellent job. That's why I have to give it to Zahn. As for Karl Urban's portrayal .... simple dead meat. Can only say that I was very disappointed just because I cared so much for the original LD ​​and, like others ....... defended my feelings for a truly great western.
