San Franpyscho: 1 out of 10: So you want to make a serial killer movie. But your budget doesn't exist, your camera equipment is elderly and your stars are Joe Estevez (Martin Sheen's younger brother and a staple in really bad movies) and Todd Bridges from various regions. There are probably ways in which you can at least draw a viewable movie. The Quiroz brothers have no idea. <br /> <br /> In the first place, most of the cast was chosen in a desperate attempt to make Bridges and Estevez look like Oscar caliber intermediaries. Really, how difficult is it to play a priest or a remaining mother? Certainly a San Francisco city has a few professional actors willing to work for a few dollars and a screen credit. It is clear that Chris Angelo and Bonnie Steiger who play these roles have other talents, such as landscaper or waitress, they have to voice well. Joe Rosete as the killer (yes, the serial killer is simply known as the killer) is also very horrific in a spirit-like way, but I'm almost willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, as his character is written with zero style or personality A delicate, almost smiling serial killer is a problem for a serial killer movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, it seems as if the brothers of Quiroz originally planned it as an ABC family movie of the week There is no nudity or violence to speak of, and the R rating is clear for adult style pacing, which moves meanders like an 85-year-old woman riding a wrap sunglasses and her turn signaled. The only horror comes from Estevez's face with a glow that seems to have been removed. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect a good movie when I rented San Franpyscho, but I didn't expect not sensible boredom either.
