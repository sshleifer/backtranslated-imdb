I watched this movie recently mainly because I'm a big fan of Jodie Foster's. I saw this movie being made right between her 2 Oscar-winning performances, so my expectations were pretty high. Unfortunately, I thought the movie was terrible and I still wonder how she was ever persuaded to make this movie. The writing is very poor. The story itself might have been a bit credible if someone like Mel Gibson played the role of the hit. The idea that Jodie runs with Dennis Hopper and his annoying accent was impossible for me to buy. I thought Jodie looked good in the movie, probably the only reason I watched the whole thing. Perhaps Jodie was transformed with as little clothing as possible, the only reason the movie was made. I saw a television biography of Jodie where basically all her movies were responded to in chronological order. This movie was the only one ever mentioned. After I saw it, I can see why.
