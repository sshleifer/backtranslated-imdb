The lives of Megan (Jackie Kresler) and Dylan (Shane Elliott) change into the Nevada desert between Reno and Las Vegas. They stop eating at a small fatty spoon where they unwillingly learn about the infamous area 51 by the cafeteria (Jonathan Breck). After returning on the road in their forty-year-old Lincoln, the radio received a bit of crazy broadcast of Hitler's speech during the 1836 Olympic Games, and later a 1958 news bulletin by Elvis Presley was set up in the army. The car breaks down slowly and the two are in the fright of their lives, as mysterious inexplicable things happen in the lonely radiation-poisoned desert. remnants of nuclear tests. Megan meets a lost little girl (Channing Nichols) and a wounded World War II soldier. The nightmare trip doesn't end there. Kresler is impressive to some extent and author / director James Lay makes good use of Patsy Cline tunes. All in all, pretty interesting Sci-Fi.
