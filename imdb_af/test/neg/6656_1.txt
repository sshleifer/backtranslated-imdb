I didn't see Ishtar, but I had the misfortune to see Kevin Costner's Postman. It's worse. Perhaps the absolute worse piece of garbage I've ever seen, and if you look at my review for Moulin Rouge? it says something. Bad plot, acting was unconditional and even wasted (though, Michael Keaton is in some of the worst movies I've ever seen), and this movie has no reason for anyone with more than half a brain. Don't see if you've graduated the 4th grade, as you will find it an insult to your intelligence.
