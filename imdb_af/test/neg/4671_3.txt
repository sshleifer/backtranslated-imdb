decay <br /> <br /> This movie is not action pack; It is slow and boring. It is not funny or exciting, it is predictable and plays on cheap sentimentality and vague patriotism. The special effects aren't imaginative or impressive. They are noisy and uninspired. <br /> <br /> The acting talent is wasted on hopelessly stupid one-liners and clich√©s. It is mocked by characters called 'soft giant black man', '' eccentric genius who is about to crack '' a square hero of age, 'by-the-book coward', a happy player who lives by honorary gods, 'impulsive princess' and so on. <br /> <br /> And the writing! How much un-dramatic counting did they think they could fit in this thing? Draw a scene where people have to defuse a bomb by cutting some wire, even more than fiction? The drama of the last 15 minutes of the movie depends on the audience caring or some may set aside his personal differences with Ben Affleck and eventually come to Liv Tyler to save the earth. All the work was done; We just have to wait a few seconds for Harry Stamper, the jerk, to throw some cotton tuck lines. I know Bruce Willis is a generally charismatic guy, but his Harry Stamper character is a silly drill. I thought he deserved the Golden Razzy he awarded for this role. <br /> <br /> Since the film is so long, the plot is so obvious, and the dialogue so available, one can't help finding the inaccuracies. , contradictions and plot holes. 800 feet in something the size of TX is less than a spit. Try walking 800 feet into the TX and see how close to the center you are. After all the discussion about the artificial gravity at the Russian station, it seems to be random inside. Actually gravity comes and goes through the movie. Does it make sense that anyone except Michael Bay will give these morons a few shuttles and send them to blow up an asteroid that threatens the earth? <br /> <br /> The sentimental phone / insurance / cola commercial style fittings were offensive. <br /> <br /> I do like action movies. Really. This one is boring, stupid and really stuck to himself. It deserves hate and mockery, as it is all that Hollywood's most expensive efforts have become - a lot of cheap cliches running from one expensive explosion to another. Oh yes, the whole thing is being penetrated by a Neanderthal conservative outlook on sex, politics and so on.
