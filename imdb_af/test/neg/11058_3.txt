In another case of misleading marketing, this film is included in a 10-movie DVD series called "Women Who Kick Butt", but even in its original cover, it appears to promise Shannon Tweed in a action role. In fact, in most of the movie, Tweed plays the typical whiny and pricey female character to be saved by the male leader, and even when trained in the jungle war, she must still be dragged by him! There is one female rebel that has a stronger character, but she is mostly in the edge of the movie. The male head is Reb Brown, and he has some (unintentionally, I think) funny moments (like when he gets electrocute). The action scenes were poorly directed and poorly performed: some of the stuntmen needed some lessons on how to get shot and convincingly. I think if you're in the right mood, you can find some things in "Firing Line" to laugh. (At one point we hear Tweed talking, but her lips are not moving!) But mostly I just got bored. (*)
