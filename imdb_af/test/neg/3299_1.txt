I watched the first episode of "The War at Home" because I thought it was worth replacing "Arrested Development," son, I was disappointed. It should be clear to all that this show has been blatantly ripped off from "Grounded for Life", "Titus" and "Married ... with Children" as they are all similar in plot and overall mood. The so-called "punch lines" are all repetitive and formulate, even more, those "punch lines" are not funny at all, to me they are more like the crass and rude. The main character Dave Gold acts like a white trash can, which he thinks is funny and cool, which he is not. (Even Hillary (Dave's daughter) said it in the episode "Gaza Strip." <br /> <br /> In the episode "Dream Crusher", Hillary wanted to be a singer (but was actually pretty bad), Dave and Vicky then decided to wipe her dreams by telling her she sucked. Then she wanted to be a child psychologist and planned to go to Harvard, after telling Dave and Vicky and leaving the room, the two mocked her unceasingly. Also in the first episode, Dave of Hillary's (black) boyfriend said, "Does she actually think we're going to walk her with this guy? I'd rather drink my own urine," the line has the thinnest line in television history . And Dave is constantly making fun of Larry (his son) if he breaks the fourth wall because he thinks he's gay and is a neck. Let's not forget that he also enjoyed Larry's (fat) girlfriend. Dave is the father he is supposed to stand for his son, no matter what. "The War at Home" is without a doubt the worst television program for family. This clearly explains why the show should be canceled because it spreads racism and homophobic agenda. It's as if the show is funny to always follow that deaf laugh when someone says something, but the lines are all somewhat forced, idiotic and pathetically young. <br /> <br /> Another reason why the show is terrible is acting, Mike Rappaport and Kyle Sullivan are terrible, terrible actors. Rappaport should always move his hands around when he is in front of the camera, he does not just do this show, but he also did it during his time with Boston Public. Sullivan speaks and acts like a robot every time he acts (he also did it in the middle of Malcolm). <br /> <br /> To awaken this whole thing, you all have your reasons for what is wrong with this show 1.It's inextricable 2.The acting suck 3.It's not even funny 4.All the jokes are the same 5.The lousy script 6.The characters are miserable and unlikely 7.The father is a rip-off of Archie Bunker <br /> <br /> FOX needs to remove this waste from the air because anything is better than that.
