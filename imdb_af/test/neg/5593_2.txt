Why was this movie made? What were the creators of this thought?!?! The first 8MM movie has at least a plot that made sense and possibly interesting. The first film was about the snuff movie industry. This sequel is about ... keep on ... the porn industry !! Yes, as if the snuff movie industry, an industry in which people are entertained for entertainment, is not in the same relationship with the adult movie industry, an industry in which people play other people in unstable sex acts and erotic situations. The idea alone should warn you about how poorly the idea for this movie is. It is not helped by a lack of plot, character, acting, direction, writing, logic, theme or even good design. This is a remarkable boring movie that never once held me. Nothing literally works. Why would a riddle about the porn industry that works murder and betrayal anyway? I don't have much interest in adult movies, but I've been watching them before. Why would anyone make a film about their evils and that they would do so in a sequel to a movie about sniffing movies? I don't even know if there's an industry involved in sniffing, but I don't hope so. The idea of ​​a sniff film alone is terrible and only people who are really sick and bad will be part of it. I don't think the adult movie industry is turning to murder and torture. I'm pretty sure many people make pornographic films for good intentions rather than hurting and killing people. It is never good to hurt another person. The adult movie industry doesn't hurt people. It's about creating movies that is a distraction and a waste of time for me. What is this movie trying to say? It doesn't work.
