I'm blaming The Comebacks for anyone enjoying Date Movie and Epic Movie. Your people have encouraged the Fox studio to continue desperate parody films, and now we are confronted with what only the most eager and desperate one of them can be. The return hardly qualifies as a parody. Heck, it hardly qualifies as a movie. It is a comedy in theory, but not in progress. No one, even the people who were involved in this mess, could possibly deceive themselves into thinking they were making a funny movie. Director Tom Brady (The Hot Chick) made a real misery here. <br /> <br /> The plot, or even call it, is on a man named Lambeau Fields (David Koechner). Just as I heard his name within the first few seconds of the movie, I knew I was in for a long movie. Funny names are seldom funny, and even less funny, the more you hear them. Lambeau is one of the worst coaches in the world, but he has been given another chance by his best friend, Freddie Wiseman (Carl Weathers), to lead a high-school high school team, The Comebacks. Not only must Lambeau lead the team to victory, but also teach them the ways of inspiring sports movies. He expects his children to have poor grades and problems with alcohol and mock them when they don't. When it looks as if the team has a chance to play at the big championship toilet bowl game (10-year-olds wrote this script?), Lambeau is shocked to discover that Freddie is the great competitor's coach do. play against. It seems that Freddie just encouraged Lambeau to take the coaching, because he wanted to lose the return. <br /> <br /> The return is a movie that is so compulsory and pathetic, I almost struggled to believe what I was watching. Screening films have recently become a "movie reference" game, and it continues with the tradition. It tries to print in as many references to other sports films as it can, but it also does nothing with them, and expects us to just show on the screen and become familiar, or try to get funny and flat on his face. . Some of the movies referred to include Field of Dreams, Bend it like Beckham, Rocky Balboa, Friday Lights, Stick It, Radio, Miracle, Remember the Titans, Gridiron Gang, Invincible, and Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. But wait, was Dodgeball not already a parody of inspiring sports films? So, in other words, we are looking at a parody of a parody of inspirational sports films. If it makes sense to you, you're just the audience that this movie is looking for. Some of these films are referred to in the plot, and some (like the Rocky one) are just thrown in without the filmmakers trying to refer as many movies as possible. There are some who even feel the film's need to explain us in its dialogue, only if we missed the obvious reference. You know a movie is in trouble when it comes to spelling out our own jokes. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the screenplay by TV veterans and first writers, Ed Yeager and Joey Gutierrez, I don't even know the first and most important rule of parody. You have to play it straight. The actors have to pretend they are not joking. The reason why the classic Zucker Brothers movies such as Airplane, Top Secret and The Naked Gun are remembered is because they throw serious actors like Leslie Nielsen (yes, he was a serious actor before he was comedy) and Robert Stack. then they throw in ridiculous situations. What made it funny was that they acted like they weren't in a comedy and kept a stone face to the strangeness around them. Those movies wouldn't work if they played their roles broadly. The Comebacks prove this, as all the actors are forced to play their roles so goofy, they are shouting at us to laugh. David Koechner keeps beating his arms, bending his eyes and screaming at the top of his lungs, to the point he looks like someone who knows he's trapped in a dead-end comedy. He's just trying too hard to think he's having a good time. . The movie also does not understand the art of celebrity cameos (also an important factor when it comes to parody movies). What kind of cameos do we get in The Comebacks? Andy Dick and Dennis Rodman. <br /> <br /> By the time the movie is in an out of the way and extremely useless cast musical number after Journey's "Do Not Stop Believing" for absolutely no reason whatsoever, I was just about ready for the walk out of the theater door. I was the only person at my screening, and the idea of ​​this movie goes in a pathetic way to a completely empty house that appealed to me. I sat by the rest of The Comebacks and I was not rewarded for my efforts. The sad thing is, Fox is not ready to kill the spoof genre. They have a 300 parody coming out next year, Meet the Spartans. I'll say it can't be much worse than this, but I've seen the trailer, and I don't want your hopes up.
