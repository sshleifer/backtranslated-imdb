This is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. And believe me, I've seen a lot of movies. The incredible twist of the film goes from a very bad "Alien lifeforms inhabit earth" movie with a bad bad play, to a movie that is spreading an archaic Christian. "Judgment Day is at hand, looking for Jesus or even forever will be burned in the fiery guilt of hell" message - amazed me after being tormented for 85 minutes. Even religious Christians should be ashamed or obsessed by checking their beliefs. I didn't know what to do with myself when I saw the terrible play that could be performed by 7-year-olds. Simply disgusting. I'm not a Christian or very religious. But if I had been, I would no longer be afraid of hell. Rich Christiano has shown that this is something much worse.
