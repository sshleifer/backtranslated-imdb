"Wild Rebels" was probably a fun second film, 40 years ago, in a spin. It did not age very well, but it was never supposed to age well; It was obviously meant to be discarded from the beginning. On the level it is a good example of the biker movie genre. <br /> <br /> Several elements help distinguish the dozens of similar movies that are cut out simultaneously. The 'hero', Rod Tillman (Steve Alaimo) comes out as an unconscious 'Everyman' - he is not particularly brave, talented or handsome (although he is halfway in the battle with a tough biker gangster winning the movie, and The girl gangster prefers to help him over her fellow gangster at the end of the movie. The soundtrack is pretty well done, with a nice 'Ventures' style bass / drum riff that moves things and saxophones and copper cards that add up a bit. And although the writing is fairly level, all the actors keep convincing and with a fair amount of energy. They are very indifferent technical gaffes: horrible 'day-to-night' scenes that come in broad daylight, tearing tires in a swamp, firefighters holding the soundtrack incorrectly instead of police sirens, a tape-board on a ceiling, a Luger that sounds like a Winchester 30-06, rifle storms that cut a detective who kills a biker on a third floor, land from the ground with a 2-inch turret . <br /> <br /> There are a lot of goofy story elements: Linda (the girl gangster) eliminates a bank guard with a drug filling syringe, the final shootings take place in a lighthouse (!), police roadblocks not actually blocking roads, police apparently never heard of ducks and police detectives apparently never heard of planting insects or with their shelter man weaving a wire. <br /> <br /> But the plot shoots, the cameraman knows what he is doing, the pacing in most scenes is pretty good, and there are some nice, zany one liners and dialogue swapping here and there that the keep energy level. (My favorite: "Man, you're knocking on private shares!" (Dw Linda) So no, don't look for this one or nothing, but if a copy of the MST version should fall into your hands, you should have some good, level fun to watch, much better than "Five the Hard Way" or "The Hellcats" or even "Girl In Gold Boots" (three other MST-covered anti-culture movies).
