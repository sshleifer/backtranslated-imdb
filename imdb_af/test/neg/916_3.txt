Why did I buy this movie on DVD? Well, the short answer would be: I really don't know. As for the longer version, it actually comes down to the fact that I really play Tatyana Ali and Alicia in this. <br /> <br /> Now does Tatyana Ali give a real good try in this movie? I have to say that this is one of the better ones, and she is a pretty decent actress. I very much look forward to seeing her in action, if better material will be available. <br /> <br /> It is said, this movie was terrible - and my score is based on this: 1 star because it wasn't The worst movie I saw, 1 star for performing Tatyana Ali, and 1 star not to think it deserves only 2 stars, there are worse movies. <br /> <br /> Yes Rule should keep up with Rapping, not my favorite rapper to say the least, but some look like him - and if he's there, I'll be happy not to pollute the scene. <br /> <br /> Ving Rhames: Ah man, Marcellus Wallace, what are you doing here - you were cool man. Just because Michael Caine is a very brilliant actor, who was in so much horror as well as good, you don't have to copy him. <br /> <br /> The rest of the semi-big names in the throw: It's OK, there are bills to be paid and we have to do everything we don't occasionally pride ourselves on. <br /> <br /> The movie itself. It's so massively flawed, it's pretty hard to know where to start. It's more like a lot of scenes being thrown together, as the director says, "We must tell it, and we must tell it." There is a story, unfortunately there is nothing surprising about it or inside it. To say the least, the plot changes in the story were excessively obvious and so it was predictable what would happen all the time. <br /> <br /> Summary in a word: Reallynotgood
