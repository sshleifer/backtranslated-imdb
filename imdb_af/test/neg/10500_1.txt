I don't normally give movies a "1." Although I am a HEARTLESS critic, I try to find something that makes the movie worthwhile (that is, viewable). The most important thing I'm looking for is a coherent plot. If it is alone, I can see it! Let me first say, it doesn't even make a movie, it's more like an elementary school project ... gone terribly wrong! And I saw every Sci-Fi movie specially made. <br /> <br /> Many times I read professional criticism reviews saying, "It played like a Made-for-TV ... (etc)" and I said, "Oh come on "I wish they would really criticize." Well, it's worse ... much worse! It's really the worst thing I've seen that lasts the length of a movie (if I consider it a movie, it's my latest worst movie of all time), and I've seen every movie Uwe Boll! This movie makes Uwe Boll look like Francis Ford Coppola! :) I want to see the Jaws the Revenge all day and see it again ... even 5 minutes ... there was one good scene and that was the END! - Oh OK, enough to make Ron Hall's works, now for the serious criticism. <br /> <br /> The writing is poorly written, the dialogue is delivered in a timely manner. The effects are brass than those in a Power Rangers show, and don't even get me on the screen enable transitions (ugh). Somebody actually looked at this thing, changed it, and then said, "okay it out"? I'd rather burn it than it did! Eventually, I can only say: "Thanks, DVD and VHS players have a Stop and Eject feature!" My advice ... don't rent it, if you do, you'll be happy to stop and delete! :)
