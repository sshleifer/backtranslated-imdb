Angel-A is a tempo change for Besson; monochrome, mawkish and rather mediocre. It's well-photographed on location in Paris, though captive readers need to take note: quick dialogue and good cinematography can provide frustrating performance. <br /> <br /> This movie is not "Wings of Desire" or "Wonderful Life". Despite his shared themes (heavenly intervention varying suicide, angel / mortal relationships), Besson does nothing to relieve or inspire us. Even the things that acted, tear-like moments, are rapidly sinking into tone-curling sentimentality. <br /> <br /> The film's lack of ideology irritates; an angel whose message of love and respect for himself is constantly undermined by her own violent and promiscuous behavior; a "happy ending" denying the hero's supposed journey of helplessness to self-esteem and independence. <br /> <br /> Pronunciation: Fairly good to look at, but confused moral and philosophical messages displace the film exactly where it should shine. 10/04
