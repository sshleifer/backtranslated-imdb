Crash is supposed to be a film about racism in Los Angeles. But in reality, it's just a lot of coincidences between several characters who connect each other in one of the world's largest cities in one day. Who's gonna believe it? There are unrealistic situations, one after another. On the other hand, this film proposes to show racism between Asians, Iranians, Latinos, Blacks and Whites. But the big mistake depends on a pre-determined racism that comes from the writer. Mainly because the white characters in this movie are usually portrayed as people with better socio-economic status than the rest of the other races. Iranians are poor, just like the Asians. And Latinos, as always, are portraits as housekeepers, police officers, or with a very low profile working like a locksmith. Jesus !!! Don't guys think it's time to change these stereotypes? The same with blacks, portrait as gang members, with the exception of a black TV director, who was the only fresh character for me. This movie sucks so hard, it makes me so disappointed with the kind of cinema that comes out of Hollywood today. Always with stereotypical characters. No realism whatsoever. Nothing to identify with. It's just a big waste, as it could be a good opportunity to show Latin, Koreans, Iranians and Blacks from a different perspective.
