The TV commercials for this movie have shown that the wagons have set a truck on fire and then clipped to the other side of the truck. I thought the special effects were good, but the general style of the movie was wimpy. It is the "Charmed" TV series with three boys instead of three girls. <br /> <br /> The big surprise for the three teenage adults is that there is an unknown fourth member of the clan out to get them and consolidate all their strength. Except for driving in trucks, these kids can fly on the sides of houses, climb out of windows, push each other into stacks of garbage and protrude the veins into their necks. But if they use their powers too often, they become premature and weak. The father of one of the boys is proof of this, as he is sitting on an attic that looks like a mummy, but he is only 45 years old. <br /> <br /> The three good warlocks are badly rich in their own right, totally spoiled, unpleasant and annoying. In any public school these children will be beaten every day. Their brilliance and faces will not cut a mustard with the hooded sons. Unfortunately for all good people, these Charmed boys were sent to Hogwart's Reform School for the war lockers who could not get into Harry Potter's class. <br /> <br /> So what was the movie about? Three teenagers act with each other and their friends. Another teenager who utilizes their power and money and is a lost family member. After some scenes where the Charmed boys show their powers and have sex with their girls; the movie comes around for the revenge money of the unknown wartime. The predictable things happen. The bad warrior jumps over several friends of the other warlocks, and also starts attacking them. The final confrontation happens, and it's about it. <br /> <br /> The special effects aren't bad, but nothing special. If you want to see fireballs, spiders and blue veins, then it's a good movie to watch.
