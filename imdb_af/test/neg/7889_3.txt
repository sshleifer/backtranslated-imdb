This film is meant to be light entertainment, and it is indeed successful as such during its first half, but then it leads to a fast-paced script that drops it. Harry (Judd Nelson), a "reformed" burglar, and aspiring actress Daphne (Gina Gershon), is working as a live window manager at a mall where they leave one night and are locked in, witnessing it. their less than protective glass observation point, an apparent murder on the street. The obvious murderer, Miles Raymond (Nick Mancuso), a local sculptor, returns the next day to observe the mannequins, as he realizes they are the only possible witnesses of the previous night's violent event. And as one of the potters "flinches", the fun begins. Daphne and Harry report their observations at a local police station, but if the detective remembers a crime report's criminal background, he becomes cynical. There are many ways in which a movie can be hacked, and this one manages most of them, including a mandatory slow motion bedroom scene of passion. A low budget issue in Vancouver, even police procedure aspects are displayed by Root. Gershon always tries to make something of her role, but Mancuso is incredibly histrionic, bizarre, as he attacks his lines with an obvious loose smell. Although the film falls into uncertainty, movie maker Glen MacPherson prefers not to follow, as he camera setup and set up some wonderfully-realized compositions that can focus a viewer while ignoring the holes and the whitish dialogue. A well-crafted score, appropriately based on the action, is contributed by Hal Beckett. The aforementioned dialogue is somewhat fresh in the first place and has been well behaved by Nelson and Gershon, but in a subsequent context of lack of continuity and logic, predictability remains. The direction reflects a lack of original ideas or points of view, and post-production mistakes set the work back as expected for a basic thriller.
