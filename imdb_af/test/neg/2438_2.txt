Oh, dear. It was probably the worst movie I've seen for years. I mean what more can be done with the old "woman within men's body" storyline? It was full of cliches, eg. the nerd comes in his own order, gets the "boy" who comes to him, etc. I don't call these spoilers because someone can guess what happens! The only thing about it was Laura Fraser, who achieved an average performance. and as for the "dream" boy, it was the wettest play ever. even the bad guys were immediately forgotten. <br /> <br /> horrible movie.
