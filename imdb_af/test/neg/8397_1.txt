How any of you gave it more than 2 stars surprised me. I created an account on IMDb to comment only on this cr @ p movie. The acting is cr @ p and the plot is cr @ p. It would not deserve stars if it was not for the descent soundtrack (and yet there are some cruel clown songs, especially those with the oboe and sound like black and white cartoon comedy background music and in no way fit the intended mood of the ghosts they haunt) and quality cinematography. The dialogue and plot is about as complex as that of a Dr. Sues book. These actors are terrible. I'm actually watching this movie and with every word I'm amazed that you've all swallowed this shit. The only reason I didn't turn off the movie was because I was bought to create an account on IMDb and post this review. I dig mainstream movies, I dig silly silly movies, I dig retro indie movies, and almost any other type / genre if done well. My brother convinced me to rent it because he said he heard it was good and he generally had a good taste in movies; from the moment he looked at me the title for me, as if he were crazy. I have a difficult time to end this rant because there is just as much trouble talking about. The only way I can rationalize the good ratings is to pay this movie high ratings. It's done so poorly and not so close to dramatic, artificial, complex, well-written, well-prepared, or even bearable. If it were the final product of my hard legal services, I would be embarrassed to disclose it to the public, so I don't even feel sorry for the director when he reads it - what was the hell you think you are?
