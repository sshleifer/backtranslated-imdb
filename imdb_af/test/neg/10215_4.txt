Note, it is not supposed to be, but it is. As a woe, I watched this movie in the theater (a huge struggle and Hulk Hogan fan). All I remember from the night is that we were the only ones in the theater and didn't really like it much. I eliminated the rest, and with good reason. <br /> <br /> A bad movie similar to the greats like "Gymkata" and "The Pumaman", "No Holds Barred", is a movie in the high game world of pro wrestling. Well, maybe the game isn't that high ... and frankly I just feel dirty just to call these people "professionals". And really, except for the first scene, there's no struggle to talk about. So I think movie is about the marginal low game world of amateur knock-on-the-*** *** people. Sounds good, right? <br /> <br /> Hulk Hogan plays the WWF champion Rip. (Never say that Hulk Hogan was tipecast, it and films like Thunder in Paradise showed how he challenged him with deep roles that really pushed the boundaries of his talents). In essence, he plays himself, but with a wardrobe that is more black and blue than the Hulkster's red and yellow. He also has this gesture he does. It's like the ozzy devil's track that makes people rock concerts, unless you put your thumb in the air, and you curl your index finger. My friend claims it's supposed to be like an "R." to look. Try to see for yourself. If it looks like an "R", well, then Mars needs women. But anyway. <br /> <br /> Kurt Fuller, with his over-active fritz-detector, plays a TV exporter with his slightly homurotic heart aimed at making Rip, apparently bigger than Elvis, on his network. get. He will have nothing of it (and go out of the office with a triumphant hand gesture to no one except the camera), and so follows the movie Fuller to improve ratings and return to Rip. He does this when he creates his brilliant title "Battle of the Tough Guys". Marketing genius, this man. <br /> <br /> Of the many gestures, after the rather idiotic battle scenes (All played as if wrestling is really and deadly serious) to the overworking, too many shots of Hulk in nothing but insignificant, this movie has everything you ever want in a silly movie. It is frivolous, not too tax on the spirit, violent, and includes the phrase "What is it smelling?" "Dookie!" "Dookie?" <br /> <br /> A classic for all time.
