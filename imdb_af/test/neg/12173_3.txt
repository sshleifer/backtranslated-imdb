In Michele Soavi's confusing house-zombie movie, Dellamorte Dellamore, Rupert Everett, Francesco, is a caretaker in a cemetery where the dead have not been buried long ago. Using his simple assistant, Gnaghi, Francesco deals with the zombie problem of the cemetery by either shooting the dead in the head or shooting their skulls with a spade. <br /> <br /> But shortly after the fall of the mysterious beautiful widow of one of his recently enchanted, Francesco finds himself more busy than ever before? <br /> <br /> After receiving some favorable comments from some of IMDb's more respected horror officados, I decided to see what the fuss was about. I just watched the movie, and I can honestly say I wasn't disappointed by a horror movie for some time. <br /> <br /> With its urgent, confused pseudo-philosophical plot, and Dellamorte Dellamore, a very unimpressive performance by leading man Everett, an annoying and turbulent mess that doesn't even spoil (thanks to Sergio Stivaletti ) and welcome to save nudity (from Busty Anna Fialchi). I have a loss to understand the amount of in-depth analysis and discussion that these pretentious bilge of his wrong supporters have received.
