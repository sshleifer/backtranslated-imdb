No wonder so many young people have attention to disorder disorder. The stage (dance) productions nowadays seem to be about how many cameras and camera angles a director / editor can print in a 1-hour show. Is there a special Emmy category for this achievement? Try to count them sometimes for something else to do, otherwise, completely incompatible display. <br /> <br /> I tried to make at least some faces of some of the other dancers in the production. It was impossible. They seem to have no faces, just blurs - it was just Michael Flatley's face, Michael Flatley's bare chest (pretty shine!), Michael Flatley's feet, and the patented Flatley over the shoulder here squared repeated infinity. As he was an executive producer of this cut and paste job, I think it was expected. One doesn't have to wonder too much about who his target audience is. <br /> <br /> Riverdance was a much better production as it tried to show the show, as it can be seen from the audience, not the catwalk, the wings or the flooring perspective. If I'm not wrong, I believe Mr. Michael retired. Thank God for small blessings.
