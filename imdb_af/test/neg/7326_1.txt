Again such kind of zero-budget digital video video waste. and again I fell in this fall. The title had a zombie in the title. (German title: ZOMBIE ATTACK!) The story: On Halloween, some people go to the "museum of death", it's a fall, a crazy doctor wants to kill the people, everything related to some Aztek cults. so they fight against some zombies in it. <br /> <br /> Ultra inexpensive scenery: some black-banded walkways. some dilettant drawings and a few skulls as you can find them in every fun shop. no actors, only low-grade models wake up with absolutely no idea what to do. no effects. fun make-up, your local hobby makeup zombie fan will do better. They don't seem to have had enough money for enough color, otherwise they just couldn't do it, man, they had to realize the look of their "zombies." Some ridiculous martial arts fight with zombies, slow motion. Just when the director wants to make it frightening, he uses a standard digital video camera effect, where everything is fake. unbelievable! 0 out of 10!
