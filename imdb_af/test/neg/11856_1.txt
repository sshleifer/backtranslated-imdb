It's so bad, it's entertaining, especially during the cocktail hour, and believe me, you'll need a beer, a drink or whatever to get through this turkey. Where do they get the financial support for such paint-by-the-numbers horror flicks? The fun of this movie is to predict which characters will be eaten and in what order and so-called "uniforms" carry the "military" wilds. The raptors, incidentally, are not the same raptors we met in "Jurassic Park" but a cousin. (Sorry, no pampering here. You have to see it to find yourself). Don't expect the plot to make sense, simply as it is, just go along for the ride. You can make it a game ... another drink every time you hear a certain sound ... or better yet, every time someone is hit by a "raptor". With a bit of luck, you won't even remember seeing this "C-grade" made-for-TV movie!
