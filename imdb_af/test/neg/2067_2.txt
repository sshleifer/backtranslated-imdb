I have a loss to find the words to express how bad I thought this movie was. The initial prescription was promising, but in all respects it was totally awful. Let's walk through the main points. Plot - good initial idea, but really terrible development. There were many points when I thought "no, no one will do so foolishly". The end was incredibly anticlimactic. Characterization - All the characters were either completely lean or grotesque caricatures. I keep thinking of one who wasn't - possibly the mother, but that's it. Music - intrusive, inappropriate and generally terrible. Direction - totally amateurish. Cinematography - Doubt if they heard about it. Camera angles / stability / zoom levels are often very poor. I am totally amazed at how this movie has been so successful. It's the worst movie I've seen in the movie for years, if not ever.
