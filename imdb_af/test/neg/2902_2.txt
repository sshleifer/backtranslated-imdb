... and boy is the collision killing. A female telephone line man is taken over by the spirit of a ninja who recently died, put down below her, threw tomato juice on her body, so her boyfriend could lick it, do a seductive dance and then kill the policemen. killed the ninja she owned. Just chased by a one-eyed ninja master. Just like in real life, eh? Just live by Sho Kosugi's martial arts choreography (and she is descending to put his petty children in this one), you really have to see it to believe it. This is the ultimate mix of completely at-odds genres.
