I'm not really going to waste my time in depth analysis, I'm just going to say I'm very disappointed that Catherine Zeta-Jones made the mistake of starring in this absurd, nonsense. full of cliches that are bored to death, mindless, pathetic try in movie entertainment! There is no point in finding the positive side of this movie, as it is poor in every respect, and the saddest thing is that Zeta-Jones is so uncompromisingly dragged into the cliches that she has absolutely no chance of even 1%. show off her talent! <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie even on the opportunity to spend the night at home!
