I tried to love this movie. I really did. Kevin Bacon is a victim of cerebral palsy, befriended by a 10-year-old girl whose China fantasies excavate, fly in a balloon and so on, is her way of dealing with an urgent existence. I admit that I quickly progress through one of the screens in which the two of them share friendship and simple pleasure while playing soulful piano music in the background. Good, three or four of those scenes. Maybe nine or ten. Okay, okay, it was fourteen. But I watched most of them.
