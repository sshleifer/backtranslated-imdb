I went into this movie with low expectations because Uwe Boll's legacy was known as a film director and screenwriter, and I was still disappointed. Your Boll finds a way to make every movie, he is worse and worse. The overall concept was not bad, a man who was bored with his life as a stockbroker became a serial killer. But the problem with the movie is that there is no in-between, he goes straight from stockbroker to serial killer. The film has no actors, and I can see why, after watching the movie, I can't see why any actor with a career would even want to be involved in this movie. Anyone who fired it had a favor with their careers. And if you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and do it. <br /> <br /> I give Sanctimony a 3 out of 10
