I saw it in the theater during its initial release and can only ask: "Has the world become angry?" The seemingly overwhelmingly positive response is indignant to this poorly written, terrifying blow. <br /> <br /> Stephan Elliot is not a genius movie maker as evidenced by the constant bombs he has ever made (see "Welcome to Woop Woop", "Eye of the Beholder") <br /> <br /> I can only suppose to make a movie dealing with gay / transexual culture, and people have assumed that it is not the film, it is a violation of this sector of the population. Aren't we smarter than that? What about an interesting script and good performances? Okay, so the 3 leaders are well taken into account with what they need to work, but this movie does not help the worst performance of a children's actor I have ever seen, through a terrible dialogue and a really lame resolution you can see a kilometer. br /> <br /> It's a disappointing movie and one that hasn't earned the remaining reputation it deserved.
