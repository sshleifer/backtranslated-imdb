Last year I was forced to watch 'Changi' in 10 Australian History this year. Look at the classroom, both classes, all 40 students were almost asleep, all 40 heads on the table whispering to the person next to them. I refuse to believe it, because I'm only 16, who doesn't believe my opinion, after studying World War Two, I was not only ashamed and shy to watch this Australian piece of garbage television. In my mind, I was applying this mini-series to the use of movie elements. The acting was poor, the screenplay was very inaccurate and the score was scary. Please do not look at this movie, it is prejudice and many racists (for the Japanese).
