**** Contains Spoilers **** <br /> <br /> As a fan of Rachael Leigh Cook, I looked at this show to finally get up to see it. I signed it so I could see it several times, and there's something about this show that really bother me! <br /> <br /> I admit it was a TV for the television. Not only that, but it's made for lifetime, which is a channel I despise. Because it's made for TV, I can ignore the big plot holes. I can ignore the huge lack of character development in Ally Sheedy's character. I can ignore the fact that George C. Scott and Rachael Leigh Cook, both very talented actors, have certainly not achieved the best of their abilities. I can see the fact that Don Diamont's character was so cliche'd, that you knew when you saw him he was the villain. I can even pass the obvious mistake in the timeline (she gets raped during her winter break, and then in a year later she gets the baby out of it.) <br /> <br /> The most important thing I don't There are two trials for supervising the child. In the first trial, supervision is given to the child's father because he "is better educated, has a college degree and has a full-time job." In the second trial, the judgment is reversed because the Judge is of the opinion that there is a lack of evidence that Emma (RLC's character) is an unauthorized mother and that surveillance should not be taken from the primary caretaker and to someone given that not previous interaction with the child. <br /> <br /> The problem is this: Nowhere in the course of these trials is the fact that a 30-year-old man raped a 15-year-old girl and took her into consideration! Whether it was a rape or not, he had sex with a minor! Will it not be taken into account if the judge chooses him for supervision because he is an "adult adult"? Adult adults do not have sex with minors! <br /> <br /> It's not the worst cable movie you'll ever see, it's not a good performance either. ** from ****
