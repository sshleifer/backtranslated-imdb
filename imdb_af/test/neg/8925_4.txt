Ho Hum. Just another movie with Steven Seagal, who pretends to be a spiritual being, but that it was nothing. Of course, he justifies this in the end by donating the money to an orphanage. How sweet. Let the world waste and we will ignore it if you care for a girl. Jeesh! This time he is with Ice Cool (Anthony 'Treach' Criss). Have someone to lay all the curvature-inducing lines, man, and there are many. The dialogue is pure crap. <br /> <br /> They go to bad guys Nick Mancuso and Kevin Tighe, two people born to play the scumbags. <br /> <br /> He blinks Mari Morrow and impresses soap. star Sarah Buxton. How cute. <br /> <br /> I think if you have a few July excitement, that might be enough. If nothing else, it will help you get your degree in Seagalology.
