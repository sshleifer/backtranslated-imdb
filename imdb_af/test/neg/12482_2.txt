It's just scary. I regret every second of the 80 minutes I spent. I think it's supposed to be a comedy, but I don't remember much to laugh, except for some blatant inconsistencies and striking mistakes. <br /> <br /> An unattractive middle-aged man named Lester meets rich, unattractive middle-aged women through lonely hearts advertising, and then murders for the money he needs to feed his gambling addiction. It's the whole plot, and that's really all that happens. Along the way there is an attempted plot when Lester begins to get calls from a mysterious stranger who knows him about his secrets, but it is so badly implemented that you do not realize what is actually supposed to happen. The sequences in which Lester murdered the rich widows are all rather brutal but apparently dressed as comedies. One order blew a woman with a wooden pole and then moved into an oven. It has been portrayed very cruelly, but it is played against the leaves of big bandwaltz, with Lester dressing faces and taking the comedy. Another scene killed the victim while constantly singing shrill opera songs ... you have to see it to believe it! Actually - you don't have to see it at all, in fact I strongly recommend you to avoid this flop. Fulci does not seem to know what hat he is wearing and there is no evidence of any of the flair he has seen in his earlier career. One succession seemed to me extremely extreme: the revelation when Lester suddenly realized that he had no shadow. Fulci does not seem to be able to conceive of any visual representation of these phenomena on the screen, so from this point on, he just leaves the actor as normal, shaded and everyone! And so completely blows the whole corner. Either he had no budget for bonds, or he just didn't mind finding any way to show it. Whatever it was, it will give you a taste of how lamb this whole project is. I couldn't even understand most of the movie, and there was definitely nothing worth seeing on the screen half the time. Even the end was as flat as a pancake. A real dud.
