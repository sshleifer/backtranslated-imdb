Some folks have recommended it, but as a movie it was originally missing. I found the characters to be unobstructed stereotypes, and the plot is almost predictable from the start. However, if you like traditional English / Appalachian ballads, it will keep your interest long enough to hear the next one. I also read that the soundtrack is nothing like the music in the movie, with professional musicians filling in for the actors.
