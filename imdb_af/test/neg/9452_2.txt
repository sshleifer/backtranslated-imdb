A very horrible movie, very low budget, with horrible acting, a complicated and intense plot, a modest reworking of the vampire stories mixed with modern science. <br /> <br /> The result is a total mess, meaningless to most parts, with very limited and cheap effects. It's not even fun, like some of the low budget independent movies of this kind. <br /> <br /> A waste of time
