How can anyone even begin to think that this movie is really beyond me. <br /> <br /> The idea? It has nothing. A man fell apart. That's the idea. Wow. An environment slowly killed him ... now it's original and worth watching. <br /> <br /> This is the first Fasbinder movie I've seen. I heard that he was a genius of mise-and-scene, but I saw student movies with more attention, inspiration, idea and art than this ... this .... this nothing. It has nothing! <br /> <br /> Each and every shot is too long. There is so much emptiness in them ... The play is terrible. You can see that the actors didn't have any preparation at all, no understanding of their roles, not even an attempt to show emotions ... it's so ... superficial ... The lines are so explicit that you 90% of them can be removed and still have the same crappy movie. Tempo? Who cares about it. Atmosphere, dynamics, it's for pussies! One shot per scene, 80% of the time people are unrealistically staring, has no idea how to represent the emotions and importance of the moment except staring at the camera or each other. Editing? All editing rules have been ignored with no father of any kind ... Photography? Half of the shots have a reflection in them, and bubble lighting with no styling of any kind. Shadows, Shadow ... who needs this? We need a guy to drink, drink, beat his wife, as he is ... as he acts. We need a lot of close ups from a not-so-beautiful woman ... we need an amateurish climax of his capture by an unconvincing Arab torture ... This film has so much injustice that it is not the budget is not. It had. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I haven't seen a movie bad since American Pie 5. Yup. It's bad. <br /> <br /> I just started looking at his "Veronica Foss" movie, which looks much better, based on the first 15 minutes (as it has a hint of directing and artistic idea, unlike it crap ), so I won't argue that Fasbinder's clueless .... but this .... this movie SUCKS!
