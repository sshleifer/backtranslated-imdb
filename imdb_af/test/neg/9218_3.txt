One must have the right to expect people who make a film about the Second Coming and the Third Testament, that they have read the other two, or at least know a little more about them as miracles and Judgment Day. This film contains absolutely nothing of relevance to viewers interested in Jesus, religion or philosophy. There is only the standard British social realism with guttural dialects and plump characters in pubs. <br /> <br /> Actually good candidates for a True Third Testament have been published several times - such as a course in miracles or conversations with God. They all have new challenges and angles for Christian faith and theology. The most interesting information in IMDb's rating is not the number of stars, but how many people have bothered to vote. In four years, only 387 people were bothered to vote for this movie. As usual, enthusiasts are most eager. For comparison, look at Jesus Christ, Superstar, original version of 1973.
