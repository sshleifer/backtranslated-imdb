Even if I didn't read Anne Rice's "Queen of the Damned" from the "Vampire Chronicles", I would probably have thought this movie was just terrible. <br /> <br /> It was tasteless, plot-less made absolutely no sense. I sat down for a while about the plot that was turned off from the book, and the longer I thought about it, the worse it was. Associating it with the previous Chronicles movie in any way is ridiculous, because it is ridiculous contrary to that movie, let alone the book. The mere few ideas taken from Rice's genius in "The Vampire Chronicles" have been slaughtered and mocked. <br /> <br /> It's an absolute insult to Anne Rice fans everywhere and such a pathetic excuse for a legacy to be Aaliyah's last movie. . Surely this is also an insult to Aaliyah fans. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the only compliment to the sound effects as well as some of the graphics can be paid. Well as they may be, it's not enough to regret the time to watch this movie. In fact, I joined this membership for the only reason to communicate to people trying to bother this movie (7 years after release, as it may be) not to waste their time
