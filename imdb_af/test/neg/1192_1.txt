Don't get me wrong, I love the TV series League Of Gentlemen. It was funny, twisted and totally inspired. I was looking forward to the movie, the point of departure was interesting and I look forward to seeing what they did to the characters and where the bizarre storyline would take them. <br /> <br /> It was a total disappointment, to start with The three worst characters in the series were the clues and it contains only little parts for the other characters (why don't you choose Mickey & Pauline, Papa Lazaro or Tubs and Edward for the main parts!?). It was infallible throughout, half-baked gags and poor slapstick humor. <br /> <br /> The real vowel was the usual ridiculous period drama / comedy (and I'll use the word comedy loosely). It derives from the main story and feels uncomfortable, not to mention painfully unfunny. The direction of the movie is frightening and often feels that the lines are delivered by the characters in one go. Many rushed. <br /> <br /> Then - the three-headed Plasticine esquire monster. What was hell about it? It is ridiculous, it feels as if the leadership of the gentlemen has endured it in the end. <br /> <br /> All in all, I watched my watch and sigh with disappointment through my movie experience. What was once a wonderful television series was contaminated by a horrible unfunny movie. <br /> <br /> If I could give it 0 out of 10, I'd have it. Don't waste your money to see it.
