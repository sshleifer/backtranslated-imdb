There is so much not to like this show, it's hard to know where to start. Indifferent characters, horrible plot lines, horrible writing, and horrible acting. Don't even start me with the turbulent theme music. <br /> <br /> In addition, the show is out of touch with American audiences due to the heavy Canadian references. "Oh, say Derek, go to Queens College in the fall! How's your bean? <br /> <br /> Granted, other programs are filmed in Canada for financial reasons such as Stargate: Atlantis, but while the shows may have suffered from a few annoyances (as Rodney called a ZPM a "Zed-PM") the show did not focus on life in Canada. <br /> <br /> MTV runs Degrassi (another exhibition based on the experiences of the Canadian teenager) during daytime when no one looks to fill time (most teenagers are at school when it airs) .I will bet it is for the same reason. The teenage life in Canada does not translate well to an American audience. <br /> <br /> This display must be canceled and the remaining masters burned in an oven.
