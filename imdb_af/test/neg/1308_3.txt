I usually do not write reviews, but for this movie I had to. I'm shocked at the acting talent in this move going to waste ... the scare was terrible ... the editing awful ... and the plot very thin. You spend the first half of the movie wondering who is talking to whom and what they are doing on earth. The last half of the film slows down slightly but has no depth or feel. The only saving grace is the beautiful but still limited CGI, and that place is London. I gave 3 stars for it, and the fact that the actors still tried a good job with the drift they gave. If you'd like to lose a few hours of your life with mediocre popcorn disaster entertainment, anyway, it's the movie for you. But I recommend doing something different with your time, like watching the right archive material online! :) http://www.weatherpaparazzi.com/flooding.asp
