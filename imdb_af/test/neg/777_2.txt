I was very disappointed with the quality of this documentary. The content is poorly produced, very poor quality video and especially horrible sound. There is very little about how Bruce Haack produced his music and virtually no examples of direct connection with later and contemporary electronic music. The interviews of people who knew Bruce Haack are ad hoc mostly impeccable mumbo jumbo. Too much yak and not enough Haack. Although I have a serious personal interest in electronic music and have a higher than average attention span, even for slow and / or difficult topics, I fell asleep while I watched this documentary and had to review it for the parts I was slept, see. If you see it, make sure you are set up before you see it, like Alex in A Clockwork Orange. Bruce Haack deserves it much better than that. Shame on the producer and director.
