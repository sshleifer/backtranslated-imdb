This movie was actually shot and made in 1987, but did not hit the theaters until 1990. When I saw this movie, I could see the good intentions it had, but I'm afraid there wasn't much talent or experience behind the camera. to make it work. Story takes place in California in the 1890s and some Italian immigrants who have their own vineyards said they had to leave their land to get a railroad. Dennis Hopper plays William Berrigan who has offered money for the country but has been rejected. Giancarlo Giannini is Sebastian Collogero and he is proud to go and ask the other farmers to stand up and fight to keep their land. Berrigan becomes impatient and rents a bunch of thugs to make everyone flee. The boefies are led by a man named Andrews (Burt Young) and he doesn't hesitate to kill anyone who gives him trouble. Andrews and his men murder Collogero one night and his son Marco (Eric Roberts) vows to take revenge and get the country back for everyone. Marco blows the bridge that needed the railroad and they also destroy a tunnel and it puts the project back for a few months and Berrigan is now getting heat from other investors. This film was directed by Peter Masterson and, in addition to "The Trip To Bountiful", he has a spicy career at his best. He's a good actor, but he seems to be in his head. It was a movie that desperately needed more attention to detail and it was easy to see that it didn't happen. Roberts hairstyle is perfect for the 1980s, but it's supposed to be 1890! The cinematographer is Toyomichi Kurita who eventually became a good cameraman, but it was only his fourth film and he certainly did not learn everything. It's not a sharp-looking movie at all and I noticed on several shots during the day that the sun was hiding from something and the screens just didn't have the sharpness that helped the overall look. The script is just a revenge story and no surprises occur during the film. We know Giannini will get it and it was just a matter of time. The role-play is, moreover, they do their best, but the whole movie is over as uninspired. This is promoted as Julia Roberts movie debut, but I'm not sure it's correct. She has previously appeared in a movie called "Firehouse".
