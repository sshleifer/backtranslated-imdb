Well, it certainly amazed me - I can't believe anyone made another Australian movie that's even more boring than Somersault. The story is undeniable, the characters, except the characters of Friels and Mailman, are unattractive and wood. Tom Long has a wide variety of facial expressions: happy and unhappy, and the "sekstones" that have been very confrontational and disturbingly erotic would have been at home in a low-budget porn movie. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie I've seen in 30 years of cinema that has been on the edge of my seat .... ready to get up and leave. <br /> <br /> The best aspect of this movie is the promotional poster.
