Critters 3 starts on the open road as Clifford (John Calvin), his teenage daughter Annie (Aimee Brooks) and his young son Johnny (the IMDb list two actors' Christian and Joseph cousins, identical twins?) Go back home from a holiday. Suddenly the band falls on their bus and they have to stop at a public resting place to fix it. While Annie and Johnny meet a boy named Josh (Leonardo DiCaprio, yes that one), everyone arrives at Charlie McFadden (co-producer Don Keith Opper) of the previous two Critter films. Charlie tells them the story of the Critters and the town of Grovers Bend, but they don't believe him. In the meantime, there are a few eggs on the bottom, outside the eyes of everyone. Once Clifford tied the band, the trio set off for their home, a descending urban block in Los Angeles, completed with Critter eggs together for the ride. On arrival, the eggs hatch and the Critters head straight inside the house block, after which Frank (Geoffrey Blake), the caretaker, is discarded. As the night goes on to the few remaining residents, a fat woman, Rosalie (Diana Bellamy), a telephone repairwoman Marsha (Katherine Cortez), an elderly couple, Mr. (Bill Zuckert) and Mrs. Meet Menges (Frances Bay). with Clifford and his children to fight the Critters. Josh also makes an appearance when his stepfather (William Dennis Hunt) owns the building. But will the group beat the Critters and prevent them from getting dinner? <br /> <br /> Directed Kristine Peterson I thought Critters 3 was an incredibly unpaved movie, but at least she could say she has a movie star Leonardo DiCaprio & not many people can say it! The budget for Critters 3 was probably not a fortune, because the whole production looks cheap throughout, there are very few characters, very few Critters and I think only 3 ever appear in the same shot simultaneously and doing away with any kind of space corner so there is no expensive spaceship or distant strange planet special effects to pay. David J. Schow's writing is strictly at-the-numbers and very predictable. A group of people are in an isolated situation with Critters and have no way to contact the outside world for help, the plot scenario sounds very familiar right? Well, it's the same as previous Critters (1986) & Critters 2: The Main Course (1988) and many other horror movies, so should it. Critters 3 does nothing with the premise, it never tries to get an old, tired and well-used story. Kritters 3 is also very comfortable for a horror movie with only two people being really killed, the comedy elements are also very lacking with the best joke. Critters 3 can eat the Critter a Critter who eats beans and then sails, very funny when you are about 5 years old. The characters are mostly standard horror movie cliches and become quickly annoying. There is virtually no blood or blood in Critters 3, just a few splashes of blood and disappointing. Indeed, Critters 3 seems to go out to show no violence. The special effects on the Critters are OK, but they still look like static, simplistic puppets that have very little movement. The acting is not that good and Critters 3 is a certain Leonardo DiCaprio's very first feature film, to be honest with the child, he is good and I wonder if any of the other cast or crew had an idea of ​​what he goes on. Why on earth should the Charlie man pop up in these Critter movies? To give Critters 3 some credit, it moves at a good pace and is not boring. It's generally made good with good production values ​​and it's a bit of harmless fun if you're in the right mood and grateful just for 80 strange minutes. Overall Critters 3 is an OK time heater, but don't expect anything deep or significant. There's nothing really wrong with that as cheap horror movie, but I couldn't help feeling that I've seen it before. An average time loss that is not as good as one of the previous two Critter films. Kritters 3 ends with a "sequel ..." as it returned with Critters 4 (1991). It went unexpectedly straight to video, probably saving even more money. Critters 3 is a decent enough way to waste 80 strange minutes if you can see it for free on T.V. Don't bother otherwise.
