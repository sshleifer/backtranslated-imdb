this is the worst movie in the world. the only reason I gave it a 2 was because the first 10 minutes was hysterically funny in a "is it really?" kind of way. it was so cute and low budget ... they didn't even bother. there was nudity and violence for the pure purpose of having nudity and violence and the effects were just as bad as you would not believe (think ketchup as blood and cabbage for cut heads). don't rent it !!
