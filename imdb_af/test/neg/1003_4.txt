This story of the higher classes to get their arrival and weaken in their high-class misery is like a contemporary Mid-Sommerish version of an old Joan Crawford movie she suffered in mink. Here people act in a very civilized way in the presence. A well-groomed London lawyer, Tom Wilkinson, discovers that his wife is not just a relationship with the local man, but also has hit his housekeeper's husband in an accident. He threw up, but otherwise stiff his tight upper lip. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Julian Fellowes, who won an Oscar for writing "Gosford Park" (it's his director's debut), of a novel by Nigel Balchin, that's quite comic, although I'm not sure how much of the comedy is meant. It's like a setback to British films in the 1940s where characters all behave like characters in books or plays, rather than in real life. However, this is not bad. Wilkinson is great, even if you never believe in him as a person, while Emily Watson (adulterous woman), and Rupert Everett (the highly amoral high-class toty), are both very good at covering the cracks in the material . Tony Pierce-Roberts's cinematography ensures that no matter how difficult it is on the ear, it's always good on the eye.
