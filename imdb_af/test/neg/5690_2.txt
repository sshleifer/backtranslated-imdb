Let me break this movie out for you ... <br /> <br /> The first fifteen minutes is a showcase for terrible special effects. I'm not one to talk about special effects, but what you need to understand is that if you can't afford good special effects, don't embed your film around special effects. Star ships fire color leaves together, flash in stock explosions, and care for passing moons with multi-corner counts low enough to count with your fingers. You won't know what happens. It won't make sense. <br /> <br /> The second act involves a woman walking in the desert. At this point you will be treated to murder scenes, and illogical, boring combat scenes. No one is talking. Nothing interesting happens. The protagonist's goals are unclear and not very compelling. It's about 45 minutes. <br /> <br /> In a five-minute assembly, she sneaks into an enemy base, ties her into a rocket, tries to destroy, fails, and dies a doomsday weapon. <<br /> <br /> None of these have any influence on the ultimate direction of the movie. <br /> <br /> In the last twenty minutes, the chicks' memories are basically transferred to her daughter, who stays to a very large number of years, learning the secrets of man. Then we see the first and last five-minute segment of human interaction in the movie, then the new heroine is forced to choose whether to become part of the material that causes the big bang or not. You know. Because when the universe collapses, you decide whether you want to be part of it. <br /> <br /> She chooses yes. BUT THE THOUGHT OF MANKIND OVERFLOW IN A CAPSULE. Maybe we won't make the same mistakes again, huh? If you like movies with characters, it's not a good movie for you. The lead roles could have been well fulfilled by any old wind game that was able to stay upright while walking through sand. All the story is told by painfully dim narration. <br /> <br /> The film tries to look deep by putting together a whole host of undeveloped science fiction ideas. There are enough concepts here to burn a number of movies, but as it stands, it is inflated with completely irrelevant details. Two-thirds of this movie could be reduced to 45 seconds. Instead, the narrator fulfills a novel's background without ever giving a reason to take care of what happens to the characters. <br /> <br /> There are good ideas in this, but no one is watching movies to see ideas. People watched movies to be entertained. Don't entertain this movie.
