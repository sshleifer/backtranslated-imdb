Ewe, The opening screams zero budget. The titles that look like me look like my grandson, with iMovie released. The DVD box gives the impression that you will be treated with boobie movies on the old days of the '80s. Nope! Barely a celebrity of a movie starring Traci Lords! This movie also needs the nudity. Instead, you get lots of Lord peaches that show through a shirt, but they seem to be activated by hot steam. It's strange, in my world the headlights continue in the COLD. <br /> <br /> The plot is pathetic, the blind man is just a joke, and not a funny one. His fiancee is so forced and predictable. He's about things and you're seeing him fall. He has to work on his physical comedy. <br /> <br /> Most of Frostbite's nudity comes from a bubble scene that seems to be shot months later and is being inserted to get a distributor. And the nudity is not worth it. <br /> <br /> NamoiBucks; It's just a matter of time before Starbucks complains about it. Not even funny. As Billy arrives in town for the first time, they come across Namoi Bucks. He says, "Wow they have it everywhere." This leads you to believe it is a parody on Starbucks, but surprised, behind the counter of this place is Namoi herself. Apparently she loves coffee so much that the owner of this big chain decided to work in a small cold town. <br /> <br /> The only thing this movie is about is Warren Miller snowboarding. Yes, it's all about Warren's stuff, so if you want to see a good action, get a Warren Miller movie. Leave Frostbite alone. <br /> <br /> There's nothing good about this movie. There is no need to rent or buy it, and offer as a friend a copy free of charge. Touch him and end the friendship.
