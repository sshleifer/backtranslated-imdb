I really like this movie. Number 5, the star robot of the movie is hit by lightning and something happens to its circuits. He acts and thinks more like a human. The robot repeats ads he learns after watching TV. He then applies these words to his circumstances. Number 5 is quickly witted and funny. The character imitates voices of stars, trying to dance like John Travolta in Staying Alive and many other things. He has a verdict for most of his circumstances he has remembered. The action of the robots is really good. Number 5 wants to drive, cook and please Stefany with all the characteristics of a person. The way the robots move and arrange is really hysterical. I'm disappointed that the writers can't keep it clean for all viewers. This movie has a surprising end to something you wouldn't expect. I hate movies that swear in them, though I love them, I give them a lower rating. This movie had swear words. Jesus Christ is used as a curse word that insults me, it is used at least 3 times. G-d D-m, Bull sh_t etc. It could have been a wonderful movie with all this offensive language. There is no sex in this movie, some violence like robots that blow cars and machines.
