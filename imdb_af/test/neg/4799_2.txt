The bipolarity of this movie is malicious. For a moment, it makes fun of Latin Americans, American tourists and banana republics in general, the others they want to touch, with burnt villages and orphans. Even the serious revolutionary hero at one point becomes a parody of a revolutionary. But the comedy parts aren't even funny, as it is so clearly stolen from Star Wars. Yes, Star Wars, the "hero" is basically a villain with a heart of gold. Add to this stereotypical sound effects, Latin Americans speaking English to each other, and a villain who just vanishes from the story. And what is the point? It's basically revolutionary propaganda without resolution, and no planning (because there's just no way these people can lead a country). The US government is bad guys, but who will make money to produce it? Not a poor farmer, that's for sure.
