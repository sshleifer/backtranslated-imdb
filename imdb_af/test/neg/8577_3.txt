This is a stereotype plot. A young fighter tries to enter a competition if he is not ready and is not chosen to represent his fighting school. This leads to separation of the fighting school and of course he finds a strange new master learning to fight him. <br /> <br /> The battles are not of high standards. They are far too "simple" in a way that 1 + 1 is simple for every adult. The fighter trained and entered the ring, but did not do what he had trained and got an asshole. The coach screams it and does it without success. And after even more of this ridiculous beat, he suddenly does what he is told and hits his opponent once. This leads to a turning point in the battle, although our hero has until then been a beating of his life. Think of the Rocky movies and you will have a good point of reference on how much he really needs. The battles are also badly shot. <br /> <br /> The final thing that screws this movie is the stupid romance. Cheesy music and awkward moments are not what I call entertainment. <br /> <br /> These guys really made quality entertainment, but the director wasn't on the job. Or the other crew, in my opinion. Maybe they had a small budget, I don't know, but what ultimately matters is that this movie is bad and deserves the 3 out of 10 score.
