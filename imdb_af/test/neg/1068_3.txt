This movie made me think ... of how I could write something about it without personally rejecting the director and all the actors. As an Australian, I am proud that I actually go there and make a movie. <Br /> <br /> But the movie itself? Let me tell you a story. <br /> <br /> Yesterday, this DVD found in my local rental shop and had vague reminders of reviews at the time of release of cinema here, so I thought I'd make it a go. <br /> <br /> For some reason I decided to watch the "special features" before watching the real movie, not something I usually do. I put the 'halfway door' because I had enough to be at 'the'. We are not so wonderful at joining such a hard hit with such a raw script attitude. <br /> <br /> The movie? Ugh. Full clich√©s and pathetic character development. The actors? Well done guys, you are Aussies and I applaud you. And just like a footy team is just as good as the coach they manage, you unfortunately didn't have a good script to work with. <br /> <br /> I wanted the movie to have so many of the subjects trivialized that it wanted to appear. I have seen many reviews here that call it nothing but a soap. Agreed. <br /> <br /> Finally (and forgive me if I don't put it down correctly), I was very disappointed that there were no optimistic overtones at all. Yes, we all know that life is full of hard things, and yes, we know that things like incest do not occur, but I really find it hard to complain about a movie that doesn't have much joy in it. I believe that a director has a responsibility to include it there. Otherwise the movie is all about them and their feelings, they created it for themselves, not for an audience. <br /> <br /> What I think is the basis of why this movie isn't so good. The special features mention that the director wrote in a 36-hour session the script, the day after he tried to end his own life. Well, it might be catastrophes for him to do this, but the movie series of self-confidence when you discover the story why it was written. "I feel terrible, I'm going to write a movie about how terrible it was." (Note: I have read and understood the interview with Andrew Urban WHY Thalluri had to write something to help him through his own problems, but I believe there is a line in film that cannot be crossed. Your own emotional needs , and I feel that this has happened unintentionally here) <br /> <br /> By his own admission, the director didn't have any technical experience at all, and unfortunately it makes the movie look like nothing more than a year twelve media project. <br /> <br /> As for any recommendations that this movie should be studied at school, or that all teenagers should see it - certainly not there either. Because there is a very dangerous line at the end. I was also in a place where I thought someone who had to "see" no longer is happy, but as an adult, I worry that this line may be influential on a young viewer in a vulnerable condition was state of mind. Perhaps there is to promote discussion, but again it does not reflect the possibility of salvation or joy in this story as a whole. In fact, it almost indicates that there is more sadness to come. <br /> <br /> I didn't see Elephant, but I can only find it, all the equations here. <br /> <br /> Nothing personal here guys, I hope you can make another movie someday, and we all have to start somewhere, so forgive me if I have been too hard. I'm glad you're proud of what you've created, which is ultimately what life is all about. This is not a movie I would recommend. <br /> <br /> Oh, I thought the way the time frames often crashed was an interesting way to film. <br /> <br /> But the whole "These are the stiles you should look at" - we already know.
