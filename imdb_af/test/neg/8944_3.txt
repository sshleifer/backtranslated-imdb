Early talkie feature based on a popular stage game. A murder has been committed and a lot of people hire a medium to take a look to see who the killer is. While the lights are out there, there's another murder ... so there's someone in the room. <br /> <br /> What follows is a clear, dull and creaking murder mystery. Most of the role players overestimate to a ridiculous extent. They act as if they are on stage (where you have to overcome things) and it looks silly on the screen. Most embarrassing is Bela Lugosi (two years before "Dracula") who really surpassed it as a police inspector. Static guidance by Tod Browning (who is always overestimated) does not help. <br /> <br /> Only for Browning and Lugosi finalists. I give it a 3.
