There are many 'bad' movies out there. Tune in to Channel 5 every day of the week and you can only be treated to a daily, shocking effort by one movie maker or another. There may be movies that have caused me more pain - it's harder to go through - than that, but in terms of writing, acting, direction, cinematography, and the bare basics of movies. Inbetweeners are a real, truly terrible effort and should be avoided at all costs. The only laugh it gave me was in the background of the screens on the DVD, in which film's geeky director Darren Fisher explained how it was his script that attracted the talent for the project! Never investigate the power of self-deception. <br /> <br /> Darren Fisher - Britain's answer to Edward D. Wood Jr.!
