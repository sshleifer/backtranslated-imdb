This is by far the worst movie I've ever watched. I have never rated a movie 1 out of 10. My advice is not to see it. It doesn't even classify as a movie. <br /> <br /> You'll be better off sitting on the couch rather than watching this movie. Acting was terrible, but what was the worst was the storyline. Highly unlikely sequence of events that are not even funny. They are actually very lame and stupid. Very foolish choice by Ashton Kutcher and Tara Reid to perform in this movie. Maybe even upset their careers. <br /> <br /> When I entered Blockbuster, the main focus was on this movie, so I decided to rent it. I really regret it. <br /> <br /> Once you're 10 or 20 minutes in the movie, basically you can predict what's going to happen. I was hoping it would get better, but instead it got worse. <br /> <br /> I don't overdo it. The movie is terrible. Don't look at it. Hope this helps.
