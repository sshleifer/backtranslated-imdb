Jack Margera of the Jackass fame is back with his own reality show, and it's not just as funny as Jackass, but it's also amazingly stupid! It must be one of the dumbest shows ever invented. Certainly there are worse reality courts, but no one is just as enthusiastic or dumb. <br /> <br /> Bam Margera made it big, and his parents decided to save his caterer. Bam and his parents, his uncle, his crew of idiotic friends, all live together, and while Bam and his friends are no longer doing things and coming into trouble, his parents are usually stupid. When Bam's parents are not home, they are tortured by Bam, especially his father. To add to the humor, we are treated to his fat uncle Don Vitto who is constantly out and never paying attention. <br /> <br /> This show is really like a finished version of Jackass ... toned There are no stunts, but Bam and his friends will just break things, and bumps, and meanwhile, loud music is playing make it more and more fantastic. It's not funny at least. I can't imagine a fainter show than this because there is no our intelligence. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of Bam Margera, you want to be one of the many follow-up / cash-in jacks on the Jackass series. <br /> <br /> My rating: * from ****. 30 minutes.
