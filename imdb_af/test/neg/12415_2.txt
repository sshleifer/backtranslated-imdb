This movie is missing in many areas. It's about this Elvis-type guy who drives cars and is approached by these BIKERS from SATANS ENGLISH. One of them was called Banjo and they beat college kids for fun. They want the Elvis man to be their "manager". Sometimes I wanted to keep the people of MSTK3000 quiet because the movie was really good. Sure, there was violence and lots of cute lines, like "What kind of beer do you want, a COLD ONE". It was cheesy. The man playing Banjo is a good boxer and I was happy to see him do some fighting scenes. The biker named FATS also had a NAZI SWASTIKA on his jacket !!! It was pretty fat if I had to say it myself.
