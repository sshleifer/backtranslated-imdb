First: The recent campaign of this movie is a big hoax. To judge from the cover, you would think it was a kind of scandal about Kylie playing a character with sex, drugs and whatever. It's just a cheap market scheme. She is scarce in it and does not do any of the things. The marketing here is incredible, and I am surprised that the filmmakers have not objected. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was a great disappointment to me. It looked like a Sunset Beach episode handled by a teenager, Quentin Tarantino. And it's not meant to be a compliment, you think. <br /> <br /> I think the weakness of the movie is the story. It seems to be nothing. Just about cool teenagers turning around 'on the edge' around life. The characters themselves have a degree of personality, but the film does not use its potential. As said, there is no story of any substance here. It seems to work out too much on a cool dialogue and ultimately looks like a colorful MTV ad. It certainly has the feeling. <br /> <br /> However, I think some people will enjoy it, but I'd say there are much better movies like this.
