I don't even know where to start. I didn't like it. It didn't behave like a story and so much has been injected into the movie (the pot tans, the boy was gay (?) The murder was justified, what possible reason could be in the writing for Linda aka Penelope to exist) never do not explain. It was all the liquid thrown on a table and run off the counter until it all made a big mess on the floor. <br /> <br /> Why did Vanessa Redgrave choose a five second? Why did Diane Wiest use her Bullets over Broadway character without the camp fun? Why did Jane Birkin start in the storyline? The list is endless. The movie ended and we all looked at each other - like - did you understand any of these? <br /> <br /> I tell you one thing, if I watch my lost dad be killed, I will definitely not "Don't hug the killer. Tell you another thing, if "Bob" broke up with Bob, what purpose did the boy hide in the closet? Was Bob sex with Bob for the boy? How did the killer easily touch the boy? <br /> <br /> If this review is affected, it's because it was a waste of film, talent and time. What the shit shrank the dead has something to do! <br /> <br /> Jezz, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, because it had to be better, stronger, and made a little sense. Any sense. Instead, we get a chilled "Diva" (the seventies movie with a murder) and tired performances that read boring words from a completely insane script. <br /> <br /> Passing it. Or maybe the rest of the people who have reviewed this movie are too stupid to understand it all - it's a French movie.
