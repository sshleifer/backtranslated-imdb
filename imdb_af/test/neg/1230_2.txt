After growing up on the West and watching the current western creatures on television and theater, I was really looking forward to the moon of the Commanche. <br /> <br /> After looking at two nights and not another, it seems to be on a tight budget shot. Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones stars are remarkably absent. There is Val Kilmer, but how's he doing? Four or five buildings on either side of the street plus the Scull house make the entire town of Austin. The capital is never seen, just inside the governor's office. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is often times hokey, meaningless stumbling blocks. The plot line differs. Completely forgotten.
