"House of the Hidden" (also known as "Specter") is one of your layers, budget, haunted house worries, filled with mediocre performances and inexpensive effects. It is about a family who owns an old Irish mansion, and after entering, begins to experience strange phenomena and ghostly appearances, including the ghost of a young girl murdered in a wall in the mansion's basement and is buried. The couple's young daughter is then beaten in another dimension and they seek help from a group of paranormal investigators for help. <br /> <br /> The ideas this movie borrowed from the 1982 haunted movie "Poltergeist" is obvious. I will say that this movie has some funny rows, but it is sometimes very, very boring. The acting here is nothing special, the mood is good, the score (which was mostly this dramatic Irish opera music) was somewhat annoying, and the CGI special effects are really awful. I mean, it was 1996, you'd think they could've done a little better than they did. The end where the house was on fire was the cheapest special effect I saw, very cheap. But hey, it was a cheap movie. <br /> <br /> Also, the transparent monster wolf thing their daughter sees looks terribly fake. And what was that important in the film anyway? What is a wolf monster that has a haunted house? The special effects here are that this film really destroyed. The acting was also bad. I usually enjoy very low budget horror movies, but not this one. "House of the Damned" is nothing special, just consider looking at it if you have nothing better to do. But you will probably want to convey it. 10/04.
