This is a disappointing adaptation of the James Lee Burke novel "In the Electric Mist of the Confederate Dead". It was rather poorly acted mainly because of the miscasting of the main players. Tommy Lee Jones, a normally-fine actor, does not only take Burke's "Dave Robicheaux". As Robicheaux's main nemesis, John Goodman does a messy job as the "heavy". The man who plays Robicheaux's actor buddy does not look like a former "A" list leader. The rest of the movie is mostly cast with a no-name resident who just doesn't meet a great novel. <br /> <br /> The movie and Jones' performance is also too fast for one thing. Robicheaux in Burke's series of novels, gives the impression that he fits well in the area, lagging behind and moving slowly most of the time. It is just like the deep south and southern Louisiana. Then Robicheaux is sometimes almost manic in his effort. Jones just moves through the whole movie. He doesn't change. Ned Beatty is wasted. Mary Steenburgen is out of place. The only good thing about this is the environment. In general, the movie gives the impression of a TV movie.
