Well, to do a US divorce with more money than brain, buy a rounded villa in Tuscany. (Much more money, while knocking over the prize, she manages to cook delicious buffalo for her workers and walk around in Italy indefinitely without any work or apparent means.) Interminable boredom and the inevitable Italian lover follow; it is a chick spot in the most pejorative sense of the term. Lane acts as an unqualified, unresolved teen general throughout - dynamically clashing with her severely faded appearance - en route in a variety (mostly Italian) cardboard stereotypes, dykes, divas, senile contessas and gigolos. Blown up with unnecessary scenes, the most ridiculous is the clumsy and relentless recreation of the fountain tones in 'La Dolce Vita'. (A similar concept was used in an effective and appropriate narrative context in 'Only You', Norman Jewison's exaggerated ode to Italy and romance). 'Tuscan sun' is perhaps the most vacant piece of cinema of the past decade, despite the well-lentic of Italy. Bonus negative point for the strange lover who was parachuted in the last minute to give the required Hollywood end to his purposeful audience of Oprah broken housewives. Avoid at all costs unless you are of course Oprah and Dr. Phil considers the highlights of intelligent discourse.
