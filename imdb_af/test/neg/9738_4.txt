Maybe it's just me, but this movie looks more like successor or follow-up than the separate project. Why? When filmed (just a few years after the war), most of the viewers probably knew why Rommel was so famous why his death was so important to the Allies, why he was Hitler's favorite general, but now, 50 years later, it's not 'It's not that clear. <br /> <br /> "Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel" is a decent war movie, but it is in no way explained how Rommel got his nickname, what he did Allies consider him their best general Why their soldiers were so scared of African Corps? That's what goes wrong in this movie - we see his fame, his character, his way of treating soldiers and enemies, but f.e. We also see Hitler complaining about his achievements in Africa, calling him cowardly, etc. So, we lack the big picture here - it's "The Story of Rommel", but unfortunately the part of the Desert Fox is missing.
