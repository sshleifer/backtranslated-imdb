I'm so angry at the point that I usually make reviews with spoilers, but in this case I'm making an exception. The first scenes of these movies are poor and when they come to the meat and potatoes of the movie, it sucks. This is a movie I was rooted in for the bad guys, because the captain-save-the-day was incredible and there was no connection with him or anything to make you feel like he was. The lead actor delivered the worst performance and Laurence Fishburne or Matt Dillon couldn't even save this movie. Sometimes there are eye-catchers or big moments in a movie that may not be so big. This movie has nothing. If you're looking for a movie to see while you're not interested ... don't choose this one. Save your money.
