Emotionally uncertain Tom Russo (Asbestos Felt) reads the secret diary of his sexy wife Leeza (Courtney Lercara) and is upset to discover that the love of his life has slept with every block she meets. This shocking revelation sends poor Tom off his tumbler and he continues to make bloody revenge on the men he believes his old lady was. <br /> <br /> In my experience, really bad movies can often be as much fun as really good, and no film with a cut through a machete-enhanced ceiling fan should ever be considered totally worthless; but although Killing Spree often entertaines with ingenuity and inexpensive and cheerful gore, I have found that the terrible direction, terrible production values, ugly cinematography, muted sound, terrible lighting, sensible boring and boring story are mute plot that is telegraph from the beginning , plus a useless zombie final, nasty synthesizer score, inevitable dialogue, and thorough amateur acting workers all served to make this attempt by author / director Tom Ritter an almost joyful experience.
