Not terrible. It is almost unbelievable that, with characters and situations provided by Dashiell Hammett, such a plowing, passionate mishmash can lead. But it's television for you - stuffing between ads. The first warning signal sounds of the fussiness of the re-creation period, which cries out "1928" in banner type. Airplanes and touring cars, fedoras and waistcoats, flaps and speakeasy jazz (suddenly played) - with all the attention paid to useless, detail, are ignored. <br /> <br /> Like narrative clarity, or plausibility, or proficient writing and acting. The plot suggests one of Hammett's operations ("Hamilton Nash", whether he is called "Ham" or "Nash," which we think of Hammett or Dash) who is investigating a false diamond theft. This is how the young woman is introduced who supposedly wears the Dain Curse (the charming and talented Nancy Addison, who has returned to sails where she belonged); she belongs to a crackpot religious cult led by Jean Simmons and also seems addicted to "drugs"; There is also a mysterious ghost that enters rooms. <br /> <br /> But enough. The writing is never more pedestrian than when it is reached for poetic or high flying, and the sink parrot it the only way they know how: through grotesque adversity. Simmons is treated like little royal Old Hollywood, but the grandeur lady is not washed. For some reason, Hector Elizondo has a second bill (after Coburn) for a volatile part. Other well-known faces drift through, do little for their resumes. <br /> <br /> The actors are not even photographed to look good; Jason Miller is a particular scare, but Coburn's close-ups are also dishonest. Coburn probably applied this role because he, with mustache, has a strong deal with Hammett. He needs more guidance than that; no one gave him the faintest hint on how to play his character, or the story's tone, or how the different parts of the plot work together (they do not, at least not tell in this). So he grins his big Chesire cat, whether it's called. <br /> <br /> The Dain Curse is available in video tapes, in various lengths. For those who are foolish to "see for themselves," the shortest shortening is the cut of all.
