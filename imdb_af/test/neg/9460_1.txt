Before I saw this movie, I believed there were two kinds of bad theater. (1) Your average, totally uninspired price (ie "Constantine"), and (2) the work that is bad, or so bad - it's good (a la "Manos The Hands of Fate"). Now that I've seen "Dr. Gore", I know there's a third kind of bad movie: the full crap sandwich. It will be irretrievably tattooed on your memory. A work that is sensibly impeccable. Anathema. <br /> <br /> Previously, I hated some movies, but I've never hated such a movie that my aversion has reached its thirst and become self-disgusted! Have you seen a movie that doesn't just regret the hour you spent, but grieve for another hour? Secret Science Theater Discipline, this is soul-sucking theater. Go hire "Circle of Iron" or "The Killer Shrews" instead.
