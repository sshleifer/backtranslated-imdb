Think Charmed with testosterone instead of estrogen and you get the general idea for this photo. A very lame story with mediocre effects and an anti-climax that ends up opening the door to a part 2. Let's hope someone has the sense to spend their money better. I suggest a 'Charmed - the movie' because it's kicked ass compared to this 'Charmed' movie and I just saw the show please my girlfriend !!!! Wait and watch it on DVD on a rainy Sunday when you can't do anything better. Or download it even better so you don't waste your money. The first 15 minutes were good. But the funniest line of the movie and also the only highlight of this movie is when Reid says, "Kiss my ass Harry Potter" while driving a cliff. Although they are not worth kissing Potter's ass, Potter is much cooler and at least his movies have a story. The pitcher was even more horrible than this !!!
