This movie has some of the worst production values ​​and editing I've ever seen. There are several cases of actors pausing while trying to remember their lines, actors talking to the actors and one point where the film overshoots seven frames. Not to mention the heroine shot in the chest, yet she starts to hang out! Oh, and how about the secret passage that is well lit and straight in the open. Terrible. <br /> <br /> The plot is non-existent, something to do with a primitive nuclear bomb and to the ends of the Earth and a kind of cavalry war. Ator pulls a hang glider at one point in the stupid moment of the movie. The dialogue is stupid, with such gems as "It's all and nothing." and "I can feel it, here." <br /> <br /> The movie is a mess, a confusing, unashamed mess. Ator is a mere hero, the sword fighting is absurd, and the plot comes slowly. All in all, it's a movie to avoid.
