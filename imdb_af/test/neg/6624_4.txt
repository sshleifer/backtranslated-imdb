People don't seem to think that movies can be bad and good at the same time. The same kind of people who see a movie with Carrot Top on the cover, navigate through a frickin office and continue to watch the movie with serious expectations. Is Carrot Top Funny? Of course not. Was this movie something special? Of course not. It was a stupid movie and everyone was so simple based on what they said about Mr. Top know. Movies like this, or Kazaam, or Killer Klowns From Outer Space and almost any film that Pauly Shore ever had, are not meant to be taken seriously and therefore they should not be considered as the worst movies. . You see if they are expecting a silly movie that is hilariously bathed or you are six years old and really think Carrot Top is hilarious. <br /> <br /> People if you know you know Root Top is delayed and you want a Serious movie and effort to write a serious review .... don't look after it. Picking this movie is like choosing a 5-year-old because he doesn't know the alphabet.
