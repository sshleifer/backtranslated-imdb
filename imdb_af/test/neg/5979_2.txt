About 5 minutes into the movie you are thrown into this brutally lukewarm cat and mouse romance between the two main characters and it just gets worse from there. The biggest problem is the characters and how utterly incredible they are. That's what 50-year-old producers and out-of-touch Hollywood writers think, stoner life is like, like giving friends a throw. Pale, dull, irritating and totally unrealistic. I despise this movie.
