4 Oscar winners, Karl Malden, Sally Field, Shirley Jones, Michael Caine. Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle. 1 hour 54 minutes of pure tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a waste of a script and a sinking sense of GOOD LORD, WHAT WAS IT? <br /> <br /> Irwin Allen just tried to pay off on the popularity of the original classic Grade D minus writing disaster movie, the actors were obviously just for the pay, ... the horror, the horror! <br /> <br /> How insane are the characters playing Caine, Savalas, Malden and Field? Go into a potentially deadly sink that is 1. 2. Hot steam 3. Slippery of water and oil, 4. Boilers that explode every 5 minutes, etc. Everything for the love of money? Greed? 5. They have very little equipment, not even some gloves or work boots in sight, much less a bumpy hook, rope, etc. <br /> <br /> Stupidity! <br /> <br /> What were they thinking? <br /> <br /> Peter Boyle convinces so much that I just wanted to hit him! Stop it! And how about the bad rope? Also, there is no way you can believe his character was a World War II veteran. <br /> <br /> Caine, Field and Malden find all the gold and money and they are happy - who is it! We are rich! (We may not live to spend it, but hey ...) <br /> <br /> And that's the big character actor Slim Pickens! <br /> <br /> Survivors are a lot! Jack Warden and Shirley Knight too! <br /> <br /> The final dramatic subplot about that scary plutonium has never really gone, it's like they've forgotten, kind of? Many holes in the writing. <br /> <br /> This film has a disease that cannot cure the strongest pill. I am surprised that Alan J. Smithee's name was not in writing, I would be ashamed to write this one! <br /> <br /> Oh the madness, O humanity! Oy Vey! <br /> <br /> The Horror, The Horror! <br /> <br /> It's like a bad TV movie of two hours. <br /> <br /> At least the sets are made from recycled material from the first movie. <br /> <br /> The script had to be on the compost heap ...
