Right on Colmyster. I totally agree with all your sentiments and add them. I came especially to my computer to post a comment on this terrible (minus) Bgrade movie. I would say I am lost at this time to understand how someone can make such a grueling movie - but you beat me with it. Anyone who reads it and Colmyster's comments trust me ---- Don't waste your time and money. It's an absolute shock. The acting is completely pathetic, the writing is much worse, and the (so-called) special effects are a joke. Certainly, no one actually invested money to make this movie? I really can't think of anything about this so-called horror sci-fi product, but have to push this comment to comment 10 lines to accept it for submission.
