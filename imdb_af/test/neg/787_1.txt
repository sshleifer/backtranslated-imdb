This is my first review on IMDb.com and probably the first time written review of a movie I did myself - not for a class assignment. I think that fact alone says something about this movie ... not a good thing! I am not a seasoned journalist or critic (although I saw my fair share of the movies), but I found this movie so terribly painful to watch. It was essential for my own mind to escape the experience. The better to do than IMDb? Forcing myself to sit through the movie, physically from the inability to connect, I was sure there would be a "light at the end of the tunnel" - a revelation to explain what was in samhe. was going on. The movie ended and I was as relieved as dog ****. After reviewing several scenes, I couldn't make any sense. I found myself screaming. "Does it make sense to anyone?" I would recommend not wasting your time, but if I were you I would like to experience it myself. If this is the case, bring a crossword puzzle or something so that you don't get bored.
