In the early 1950s and 60s, 70s, and even in the 80s, a lot of war films were produced in the former Yugoslavia, which glorified the heroism of the "Partisans"? civilians who turned out to fight a guerrilla war against invading German forces. Hajrudin Krvavac, who is generally only known in Eastern Europe, has directed a number of these "partisan" stories; Unfortunately, only a handful of them have ever been exported to the rest of Europe and the United States. "Battle of the Eagles" is a rare, low budget look at the formation and exploitation of the Partisan Air Force. <br /> <br /> Marshal Tito decides that a partisan air force should be formed to combat German Luftwaffe in the clouds over Yugoslavia. A group of former pilots join forces with two small biplane and start attacking enemy bases and convoys. Over the course of a few months, more pilots and aircraft are joining the ranks, eventually forming a formidable air force. Maybe it's history, or maybe it's fable? Whatever it is, it's certainly not convincing, but role players from big actors are certainly trying to make it work. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a well-paced German air raid on defenseless parties. The nuts and bolts of the plot gather almost immediately, and for a short while the audience is treated to a very patriotic series of scenes. Then the action begins, and this title quickly becomes a low budget, by-the-numbers adventure. All the characters are well-known clich√©s: Major Dragan (played by a well-known Bekim Fehmiu) is our typical patriotic, heroic leading man. He blows away with sturdy aircraft with a machine gun and even has an airline with the villainous Klauberg (Radko Polic), a completely predictable and lime-like climax with an equally predictable outcome. The rest of the parties are known: Ljubisa Samardzic ("The Battle of Neretva") is a Zare, a hotshot playboy; Bata Zivojinovic ("Hell River") is Voss, a veteran pilot coming out of the woodwork, now that his country needs him; and Rados Bajic ("The Day That Shook The World") is Dalibor, a young messenger boy who moves through the ranks and eventually becomes a seasoned fighter pilot. The characters and their stories are known to any war mate, and Krvavac does not attempt to build these stereotypes. The role play does a fair job, and despite the two-dimensional writing, every player is watching. Bajic, in particular, has a few good moments? when he will take his first flight as a shooter, and later, when he is forced to land a plane after the pilot dies. The plot consists only of a series of air strikes against the Germans, and subsequent retaliatory acts. <br /> <br /> Krvavac handles the action sequences skillfully with a mix of actual footage and miniature effects. Unfortunately, the miniature types are so cheap and fake that the transitions between actual aerial photos and toy airplanes scare and laugh. Some of the punishment and bombing scenes seem shocking, while dogfights involving scale models, complete with action figure pilots, are just pathetic. Sometimes "machine gun" smoke powders are so large that the smoke illuminates the entire model level. Worse, the editors often persuade shots of fighters over real-world footage. Although the aircraft is usually in good perspective, they are surrounded by a distracting glow that prevents any attempt at realism. All this action is set to an incredibly well-known and annoying score by Bojan Adamic. <br /> <br /> "Battle of the Eagles" also suffers from a very poorly edited English version. To begin with, missing 28 minutes of footage? Cut the film from 130 minutes to just 102. The missing segments are carelessly cut, and the cut looks very messy. Music modes are suddenly cut off and scenes are abandoned before being resolved. In the last third of the movie, the story falls apart, and only a few bad action screens can try to save it from total incomprehensibility. Then there's the dubbing ?? All the screens revolving around the parties are dubbed in English (rather weak), but several long screens remain in German, without the benefits of captions. The film may have made more sense if the German-language sequences were cut out instead of critical scenes revolving around the party parties. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Krvavac handles the outdoor material very well. There is never a moment where the audience feels that they are on a soundtrack. In particular, the German Luftwaffe bases are vast, complete with decades of Messerschmitt fighter jets and extras purchased in leather flying jackets. The scenery is fresh and green, and Krvavac is not afraid to shoot scenes with very wide corners or far away, just to carry the scale of a fight or long trek. A German ambush of a partisan unit early in the picture comes out, just like a series where Zare and Dalibor escape from an enemy base. <br /> <br /> As it exists on the home video, "Battle of the Eagles" is just one more story about the Yugoslav Slavic partisan movement. There is nothing to hide it from the rest of the harvest, and the terrible special effects and drastic editing make it a notch below acceptable. Try to avoid this one unless you can get a full length copy.
