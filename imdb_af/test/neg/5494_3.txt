While I'm usually a big fan of John Turturro's work as an actor and director, ILLUMINATA is a huge disappointment. Although the movie has a few beautiful moments, it is totally flat. Worst of all, the movie is confusing. Where is the movie set? Italy or Italian troops in New York? Why does a historic movie bother if it doesn't bring about an institution? If you want to see a well-made, inspirational historical film about the theater, watch Tim Robbins' THE CRADLE WILL ROCK. This movie has many pluses, including a good performance by John Turturro.
