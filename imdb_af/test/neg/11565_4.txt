Well, there's no way to do sugar cover. The plot was ridiculous, the point of departure was ridiculous, the acting was undecided, the effects were laughing and all the outside scenes appeared to be filmed in New York's Central Park. It was said that there was something about this movie that I could not walk away from. Maybe it was the atmosphere, or maybe it was the evil super-vixen or the Amazon twists. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm not the one to put on the margin and criticize without pointing out some redeeming features. here they are. <br /> <br /> A great shot of the woman's lib movement is portrayed in a wilderness environment (central park, of course) and all the masochistic young men out there will be very impressed. Furthermore, some of the scenes in which certain characters lose consciousness are amusingly dramatic (you will note that I write dramatically rather than convincingly.) <br /> <br /> All I can say is that some people like B movies and I'm one of them. If you are one of them, then give it a spin. Cheers, Mr. Kincaid. This is one for centuries.
