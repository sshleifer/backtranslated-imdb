Luther the Geek (1990) is a dull horror movie and is really bad even by Troma's standards !! It's about a freak that bites the chickens' heads and kills people by biting their necks and he thinks he's a chicken himself !!!!! Luther is released from prison after 25 years because he apparently was a "model" prisoner and earns another chance in life (it is VERY hard to believe after seeing him acting and treating people throughout the film). <br /> <br /> After killing an elderly lady in a supermarket park, he manages to sneak into a woman's car and go to her, her daughter and the daughter's boyfriend at their home in the country torture. <br /> <br /> Then we are treated to a long, winding and boring movie, with terrible acting all the way through, before a useless policeman arrives to try and kill Luther once and for all! Oh, and the movie also has a ridiculous and ridiculous ending! I love low budget horror movies and I think "The Toxic Avenger" is an all-time classic, but I'm afraid Luther the Geek is just boring, illogical and boring, not much in the way of gore, just " a few bloody necklaces and that's about it! 10/03
