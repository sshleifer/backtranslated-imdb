AALCC informs us that 14-year-olds can be pretty stupid and angry. For those who don't know, the film performs a public service. Otherwise, it's very flashy videography with little or no reason to be. I will allow the camera work to be remarkable at times, but also that it may be self-sufficient at other times. The actors occupy screen space and screen time, but do not calculate as compelling people. I think the email flashing on the screen means you have to find out what character a moniker has, but I simply couldn't tell enough differences about it and didn't really organize it.
