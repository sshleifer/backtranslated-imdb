What a true moronic movie, all I can say is the writer must love magical mushrooms and LSD because it must be one of his travels. <br /> <br /> You follow the whole movie thinking alright it is very strange but hey I'm sure in the end there will be a perfectly good explanation for all of these ... Just to be disappointed to have no There is no explanation at all and the turn at the end makes it even more confusing. At the end of the movie you will probably have the same facial expression as if you were in a queue, who paid for your groceries and the trader told you, it would be 11.95 and please elbow you in the balls for no apparent reason . There are so many factors in this movie that are inexplicable and I think it leaves the imagination of the viewer in a completely bizarre way. Don't get me wrong. I like strange movies, 'The Cell' can easily be described as strange and twisted, but in my eyes it is a brilliant movie (despite the decisive J-Lo I don't like to the max, even it doesn't passed to swing my opinion). It's not one of those movies, and I think you should consider the characters of those who praise this movie. I can tell you that they are probably the kind of people who go to an art exhibition, see a splat pigeon design on a white board and say, "Oooooh, a masterpiece, the artist has truly found a unique way out of eternity "when in fact, the tailings of birds are on a plate. <br /> <br /> Keep this last in mind when watching this movie, <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading!
