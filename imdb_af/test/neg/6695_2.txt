<br /> <br /> I voted in this movie because I'm a fan of American High School basketball (I rarely watch NBA games), but rather because I'm a fan of Gene Hackman which is usually manages to bring an impressive depth of his performances. In this case, however, I was very disappointed. It was not one of the bright shining stars of Hackman's career. <br /> <br /> In fairness to him, he didn't have much to work with. Like Norman Dale, the new coach of a small-town high school basketball team in Indiana, he's not called to do much. Basically, his performance consisted of pacing on and off basketball margin ranting at the referees. I didn't find him particularly credible in the role of being honest. I was also not impressed by the required romance between Dale and Myra Fleener (Barbara Hershey). Frankly, there was no chemistry between Hackman and Hershey. The romance never caught my attention, nor the basketball "action". It was all too predictable. <br /> <br /> There was too much trouble with this movie to make it worthwhile. I never understood the depth of mere hatred that so many of the townspeople had for Dale, almost before the time he arrived. The character development was poor and the story itself was poorly developed. Too much basketball and not enough human interaction, in my opinion. How many shots of children's shooting baskets should we see to get the point of being a basketball movie? There was no tension: is it even possible to doubt that Hickory will win the big one? I realize it's based on a real story, but I think it proves that not every true story should be a movie. Frankly, it wasn't just a very interesting movie. Definitely a movie that Gene Hackman would like to forget. <br /> <br /> No better than a 2/10 in my opinion.
