Rubbish. Full mess. The authors should not have read the book or seen David Lynch's film. Not worth wasting your time. <br /> <br /> Longer no better. While it is more in-depth than Lynch's movie, it has a gross accuracy and the key role of the story. <br /> <br /> A night at the Roxbury is worth more time.
