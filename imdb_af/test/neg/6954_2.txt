Michael Caine may have tried to make a bigger than life character a success, but the whole story and character is around him where it's not nice or interesting. It was all very boring and somewhat predictable. Martin Landau, a favorite actor of mine, had nothing. He was useless. Michael Caine became a bit annoying and the movie couldn't decide whether it was a comedy or a serious excitement. Caine is trying hard and well with him, but I feel the direction and storyline allow him. Don't waste your time. It starts well for the first 10 minutes and then it is about it. A Movie For The Hard Caine Fans Only. Stay away from this one ...
