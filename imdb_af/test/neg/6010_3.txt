For producer David O. Selznick, no one will ever direct. So, on a farewell to arms (1957), do we get two? Charles Vidor and John Huston. Although both men were quite perfect, they couldn't make the head or tail of this disastrous remake of Hemmingway's magnum opus. Hemmingway in general has never translated well from book to screen. But under Selznick's zeal to turn it into his next 'Gone With The Wind', the outing is punishable and exhausting. At this point in Selznick's career he was no longer the titan that could take "box office poison" and turn it into Gone With The Wind. Tired, weak, minus his studio, and with an exciting sense that his second marriage to Jennifer Jones might have been a mistake, did Selznick surrender the creative rule of this movie to Fox Studios? but he kept enough of himself to become a damn nuisance. <br /> <br /> By now, one or should be familiar with the bittersweet tragic love story of a nurse, Catharine Barkley (Jennifer Jones) and her soldier hero, Lt. Frederick Henry (Rock Hudson). Their passion is supposed to serve as the stabilizing force for what is essentially a war correspondent's story of romance that is well-cast. But the chemistry between Hudson and Jones is both turgid and boring. In the final line, Jones' facial distortions during the birth of children are so severe. I'm surprised no director chose to cut them out of the general expense. Part of the problem with Jones is that she thirty-eight is too wise to play the optimistic Catharine with any great conviction. However, older actresses have often managed to prevent an audience from disagreeing with each other. Not so with Jones. One is painfully aware that she doesn't fit the bill into the acting chops or years invested on this planet. Hudson's laconic charm is out of touch with the army of a military soldier whose heart is broken, but the head remains strong. The supporting film is shattered with such locations as Vittorio De Sica and Mercedes McCambridge, but it is wasted bits of nonsense that in no way reflect on the formidable talents of some actor and the best that is visible elsewhere in their filmmaking canons. <Br /> <br /> The anamorphic image element for "A Farewell to Arms" looks good enough, although there is just too much film grain in some scenes for the rest of the review. Overall, colors are subtle and muted, but balanced according to the DeLuxe color processing currently in use. Some are blurred. Stain does not show very naturally. Contrast levels are a bit weak. Blacks are generally solid. Whites are almost clean. There is not much to recommend this movie. This is essentially a true picture with gunshots as background. There are no extras.
