Thank God for DVR and its high speed is fast forward. Even so, I could no longer sit through that travesty. When they came to the old Indian Indian Ocean, I gave up and deleted it. Is it the best thing SciFi Channel can do for Saturday nights? How about some old classics instead? The idea of ​​a coed special power unit was bad enough. They seem to want to save money by filming everything in the bush. What else can I say? It was so terrible I didn't think I could get enough lines to qualify for the space to review it. But, one more line seems to do it. Save your time, let alone your money on this dog of a movie.
