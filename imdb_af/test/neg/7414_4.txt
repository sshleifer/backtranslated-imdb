Bigfoot movies tend to be bad, so I'm not inclined to watch them. However, there were good ads on the Sci-Fi channel, so I decided to watch. An expedition leads to the northwest of the Pacific to find a fallen aircraft that has the expedition leader's daughter (played by Lance Hendrickson), and brought a revolutionary DNA detector that can be used to sasquatch prove its existence. And it actually creates a tension. The sasquatch is invisible but sees the heat of the mountaineers (like the stranger in Predator), and I wondered when it would strike. The acting is sensible, just like the background music. The dense wooded area is well used. And when the creature is finally seen, the costume is not bad, but nothing good. But as the movie touches, it becomes increasingly annoying and absurd. Most characters are unpleasant people, rude to each other and only in the expedition for money and publicity (except Lance Hendrickson's character), so it may be impossible to worry about what happens to them. And their behavior is becoming increasingly stupid. One man shoots the creature (not deadly), gets drunk and sits alone in the dark. One female camper sits on a slacking side before she crawls into her sleeping bag, and barely escapes through the sasquatch in the bush, without overhauling her hair and makeup. Then the survivors come to the conclusion that the sasquatch is really on the DNA detection machine and lets them live if they leave it behind (a creature knows what threatens it). Obviously, the instinct does not apply to these actors, or they would not appear in this movie. And the end is so stupid you will want to kick the TV screen. If it wasn't for the script, it would be a decent horror movie.
