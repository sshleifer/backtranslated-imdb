Just saw it at the theater. I didn't read the books. There is nothing new about this movie. <br /> <br /> The bad guys seem to be dying with a few slashes, no matter how many times our hero has been stabbed with a big sword that he keeps looking the same! There are several action scenes, but they are very fake. filmmakers seem to be under the impression that when they are not fought to choreograph a combat image, they move the camera neatly, move fast and turn the music on ......... This makes me feel crushed again. <br /> <br /> I admire getting a dark story without the usual Hollywood cheese, but I'm sorry to say the filmmakers have failed. The characters are 2 dimensional. We hardly know them or feel them at all. The lead has a beautiful farmer's accent ..... though he doesn't seem to have much to say. <br /> <br /> Don't bother it unless you're bored and get half the price of blockbusters.
