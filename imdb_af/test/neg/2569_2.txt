Wow, I didn't see a movie that's bad, because "Fire Down Below". Wait, it's also a Seagal movie. Like "On Deadly Ground" and "Fire Down Below", Seagal puts the film around its environmental awareness message and how the military, FBI and CIA are incompetent idiots. The problem is that both reality and a meaningful plot are secondary to everything that Seagal's social commentary is trying to overcome.
