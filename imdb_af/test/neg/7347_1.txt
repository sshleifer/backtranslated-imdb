When I first watched this show on Cartoon Network, I found it uninteresting. Then I read very good messages about this show, and I decided to see it. The show was so boring. Every episode was predictable. More, this show has no logic. Hypersmart girls, who go to school and sometimes do such stupid things, start 99% of the episodes with a monster attacking Townswille, Mayor (he's a real fool, he's not funny, he's so stupid I don't can't imagine how he became a mayor). Professor, yes, must be the smartest person in this show, but actually ... He even found no difference between monster and his brother. Narrator comments make this show boring. Because they also have similar lines at the beginning of each episode and in the end. The animation is also very strange. Everything but main heroes are shown in an ugly way. Also, in every epsode, this show gives you life lessons, which means it is oriented to small children, but when you look closer, you'll see a lot of violence and even blood (!!!) during their battles.
