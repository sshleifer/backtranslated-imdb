Lack of character development proves fatal to this movie. Valeria Golino's character Grazia begins to look like a bipolar personality, but quickly degenerates into a caricature and seems unreal. The other characters are thin, probably the author's fault not the actors. The only exception is Filippo Pucillo as the younger son Filippo: his energy and bravado are funny and convincing. <br /> <br /> I suppose the children's little cruelty is supposed to contribute to an atmosphere of paleness and to emphasize the pervasive spirits. In town, but for me, the free cruelty is superfluous and contributes to the overall boredom of the movie. Some scenes were amusing, but not necessarily meant that way, for example, when the abused dogs appear fat and healthy and appear to be ready to show. The beautiful cast and the setting make for an attractive trailer, but can't carry the whole movie.
