A good young actor is being wasted in this empty, mawkish, manipulative film trying to be a combination of both a cute comedy and an informative drama. The plot moves so slowly that the 90 minutes seem endless, because characters do nothing but mop and emote. The dialogue is filled with stilted cliches and fortune-cookie attempts at the pseudo-philosophy. <br /> <br /> Apparently trying to be a moving and profound look at life and love. The movie just ends pretentious. The only real weight is the burden that the talented throw is forced to wear as well as possible. But, do not fear - they are held by the puppet strings of the confronted plot.
