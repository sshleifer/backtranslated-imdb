Joe Rogan's whole act is a wickedness with gall. He is a pot smoker who entered Fear Factor and thinks it was a joke. He said he would own people because he didn't know how stupid people would be. The producers of the show he explained went to the fore to play pranks on unsuspecting participants to see how far they went. The particular evil level is a little twisted. Mr. Rogan's special is just filled with the rations of someone who is too regular for ordinary people. I found that he was offensive and his stuff could be heard by more talented comedians like Eddie Murphy or Chris Rock. Rogan even makes a five-minute set on the N-word. Generally, ignore this special.
