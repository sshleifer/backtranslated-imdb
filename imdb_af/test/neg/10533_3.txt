Half past death was unlike any Steven Segal movie I've ever seen. Very little of Segal, himself in action and I agree with the last review I read, Nia Peeples steals the show. <br /> <br /> I have seen nothing really new here, just the same old stuff from other movie has a little. The best action scenes were Nia's while she was kicking again. It was interesting to see her as the bad guy after looking at Walker, Texas Ranger for two seasons, but still kicking, but for the good guys. <br /> <br />
