I wish Depardieu could finish his book and see it become a brilliant success. At least he ended up with something. <br /> <br /> The movie struck me as useless, rattling and very stylish, like some recent French films. Not to beat it. Most recent American films are useless and run and have no style. We need to be grateful for photography calling a European city in the midst of a wind-blown continental winter, and for elliptical talks that challenge our ability to understand what is emerging. <br /> <br /> But there may be too much of a good thing. Golubeva is found in the midst of the freezing night to stumble near the sea and in a bad accent on dreams and so on. (There are a few rows of dreams that include things like swimming in a river of blood. You will love it if you are Vlad the Impaler.) Many people die. Catherine Deneuve dies in a suicide per motorcycle. I do not know why. Golubeva's young girl also dies, and I don't know why she doesn't die either. She is slapped in the face, falls on the pavement and dies. <br /> <br /> There's also an explicit sex scene. I will have to take their word for it because it is stylishly photographed. It is stylishly photographed in almost complete darkness. Don't worry about kiddies being shocked. Anyway, they'll probably fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Depardieu is not a bad actor. As we see, he is being degraded by a caring, attractive young man - well, beautiful, except that his nose can't get out of his way - to a discolored, murderous, hairy physical wreck, we feel sorry for the man. Golubeva has a very pretty face, with big half-faced eyes and wide cheeks, like a doll. Her next movie should be a remake of Lewton's "I Got With a Zombie." Then there is this mysterious man who leads a bond. I think it's a band. As far as I could tell, the group consists of about a dozen drummers and a dozen musicians playing electric guitars. Every viewer will find the resulting sound interesting, but untrained listeners like "easy listening", may not enjoy it. If you don't like the music, there is a payout because the sinister composer and leader is knocked over the head with Depardieu's cane. <br /> <br /> I have to say, I hardly saw it worth it to put through. (And it's also a longie.) Sometimes it was like waiting in your car at a railroad crossing, while a long-time freight train slows down, sometimes stopping altogether. I wish it had some jokes.
