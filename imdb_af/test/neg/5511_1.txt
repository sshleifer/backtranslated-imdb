I've been trying for years to remember the name of this movie (not sequentially, of course). I saw it at the local dollar theater when I was 11, and it was so horrible I almost walked out; I think I didn't realize that one should be allowed to leave before the movie ended. Anyway, it is in my mind just about the worst movie I've ever seen. I can finally give it the rating it deserves. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (this was oddly satisfactory)
