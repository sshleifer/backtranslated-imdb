I've never seen the first Killjoy movie, and I've never heard a good thing about it. So I see Killjoy 2 in the local Blockbusters and pick it up and look back. Play Trent Haaga and Debbie Rochon boast it. Now the massive Troma fan I'm there, no way to rent out this movie, how could it be bad with these two init? Oh, how wrong was I? Even Trent and Debbie can't save this excuse that a movie is as bad as it really is. Trent is honestly storing as Killjoy, although it is probably more to blame for the authors, giving him some of the worst one-liners in the history of the film. Debbie does a good performance, but that's not enough. Death is terrible, just like the gore effects. For example, watch out when the man is supposed to be placed on something or something else. And just to bowl it, it's just the worst I've ever seen in film history. The film doesn't even work so well, it's good level. Avoid like the blow. <br /> <br /> 2/10
