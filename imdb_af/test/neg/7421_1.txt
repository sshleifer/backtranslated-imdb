Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen) brings a group of people to a mountain to help find his missing daughter (Erica Durance). What they do not know is that she was killed by a sasquatch (Taras Kostyuk) and it is still out there. They are waiting for them. <br /> <br /> It was a late night when I sneaked it into my DVD. player. I sincerely wish I could go back in time and stop me. Most people will tell you that movies like "House of the Dead" or "S.I.C.K: Serial Insain Clown Killers" are the movies you'd never seen before. Wrong. It will be. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of shit, but it's the only crap that followed me. How I wish I never looked at it! Actually, the acting isn't that bad. It's just writing and directing and pacing and everything! I'm actually a fan of Sasquatch movies. But not this. <br /> <br /> Please, listen to my warning. Don't Watch This!
