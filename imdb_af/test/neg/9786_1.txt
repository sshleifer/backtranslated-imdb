Nine out of nine people who watched it declared themselves spiritually fit for life. Nobody will ever have to see this horror. The English language is poorly equipped to express how completely, terribly horrible this "movie" is. It's really not worth the plastic it is made of. In the entire history of creation, no greater crime has been committed by the human race; There will probably never be anything worse. <br /> <br /> It was unanimously agreed that the scene at which Tommy's head and young girl's blouse was involved was incredibly ill and twisted; In fact, many of us have not yet recovered from the ordeal and are currently sitting in the corner of the rock room, sucking and sniffing our thumbs. <br /> <br /> However, the fundamental question about everyone's lips should be "Why ???". How is it possible for someone to create such a monstrosity and then submit it to so many innocent people? After watching the trailer, we thought this movie might be a laugh: how wrong we were. <br /> <br /> Please sign the petition to get rid of the world of "Shrunken Heads" so no other poor civilians are exposed to it. Please, for the good of mankind.
