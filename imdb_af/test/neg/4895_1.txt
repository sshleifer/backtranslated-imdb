How do you make a totally unattractive movie from a story by one of America's best-known authors? Watch this movie and find out. Maybe I'm exceeding author Carson McCullers, but I was impressed by "The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter" and also hoped for something memorable here too. Forget about it. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave looks like a man with her short hairstyle and clothes. I never found her much to get excited about in almost any movie. Rod Steiger as minister? How insulting is it? Unlikely characters, one after another. Well, maybe it's also the book, and I'm unfair to this movie. I am not familiar with the story except what I saw on the screen and it was so unpleasant a movie I could never recommend to anyone. <br /> <br /> It's just one backward person to another in a backyard. Outside of some nice cinematography here and there, there's nothing to recommend. How someone can put it through 100 minutes is wonderful. <br /> <br /> I didn't even decide how bad it was. There is good news: it was the only movie that Simon Cowell directed.
