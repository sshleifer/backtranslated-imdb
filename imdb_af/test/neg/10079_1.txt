It will probably be a good movie to see .... provided you have already seen all the other movies, and have thoroughly examined the bellybuttons of yourself and those around you. God, this movie was incredibly unsatisfactory, with some of the worst (or non-existent) writing ever captured on film. There is no savings for this movie; Even the animatronics are kind of crippled, and it's just a total waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> Start. Quickly. It's quite awful. <br /> <br />
