what a shame our first movie is so bad .............................. hi sham, what did you do in this movie : It's a disappointment, and the majority of the crew is not from Saudi Arabia. It is supposed to be a comedy film, but it does not contain the most important elements in Comedy. <br /> <br /> I know the first cinema experience in Saudi Arabia, but I expect better from Kaif Al Hal! The only positive in the film is the presence of some talented actors who didn't help much to blast their talents. Finally .., do you want to know your comments about this movie guys ... is it bad or what?
