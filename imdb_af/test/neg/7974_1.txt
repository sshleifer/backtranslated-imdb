The first question is: how many talented idiots do you need to screw a movie? Answer: One is more than enough, if he writes the script and directs it. The second question is: has anyone taught the actors to handle guns properly? Answer: hel. I wonder if Kristy Swanson touched the face with hot copper - because it was so! The third question is: how many times have we discovered the "super secret government agency conspiracy from within" plot? Answer: A good couple too much! The fourth question is: is Michael Madsen and Ron Perlman overestimated? Answer: In this movie, unfortunately, yes. The fifth question is: can some boobs save this movie? Answer: Even three (Kristy Swanson's couple and the director / writer) did not. <br /> <br /> God ... If I see the (probably) killer getting her guns ready for a hit, then the Morons of the stick department gives her quite another set the first bloody thing in the goddamn movie, the "suck" meter strikes the highlight. Time from start of movie to me to turn off the TV: fifteen minutes. Just a little more than it took me in the case of 'Alone in the Dark'.
