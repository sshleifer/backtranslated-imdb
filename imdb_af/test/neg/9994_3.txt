In this film, we are invited to observe the descent in a moral and emotional funk of someone who doesn't like to start. What was the point to make the movie, then? To show that it would have been better not to have IN COLD BLOOD - a book I admired casually to keep our hero's integrity intact? Rare. He performs at the party at the beginning of the film exactly the same way he behaves after his triumphant reading from the book, so his decline is a matter of degree. Should we care enough about Capote to take seriously his claim that he and Perry Smith's murderers are spirits, with the first thing that has had the break, while the latter had nothing? Mr. Capote's fate didn't touch me at all, I'm scared, so if it was the central idea, it was my mess. But even if I could understand why the filmmakers were visiting this insidious project, the storytelling story would still bored me as it did. Hoffman gives a bravura performance without emotional effect, while Keener and Cooper are so warm and interesting that I long for more of them. Dreary beyond belief.
