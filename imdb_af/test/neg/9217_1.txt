I hoped in this movie for an imaginative turn on the Second Coming. Boy, was I ever wrong. BBC is dullards to pacing a movie, total idiots to create tension, fools at building intensity. And this movie is no exception to the rule of how much BBC sucks. <br /> <br /> Ugh, the pacing and time-consuming dialogue was just painful to go through. The first 30 minutes felt like 2 hours. I looked down on my watch and wondered when the senseless, monotonous drift would end. They wasted a perfectly good actor in the lead, because the material was so lazy and sloppy, written. All that happens is to kill only time. <br /> <br /> From 155 minutes, only 15 minutes is interesting (the controversial end). What a pity. Reading the plot summary is more interesting than watching the movie. The preaching, the "I am God", endless blah blah-ing, the stupid as of almost boring miracles ... UGH. <br /> <br /> DO NOT BE THIS CRAFT.
