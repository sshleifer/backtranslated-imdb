Larry is a perfect example of the United States Democratic Party, of which he is a strong member. King was slightly righteous and unbiased and had a variety of guests. The party was also centrist, but it was still an era. Now, like Larry, it's far left. <br /> <br /> At least 90 percent of all guests at King's show in the past year or two are liberals sitting there bashing President Bush and every conservative they can think of ... night after night. Bill Mahar, one of the more viscous, is - and you can look it up - the most frequent guest in the history of King's TV program. You can count on other outspoken Left Wingers to be at King's show every week, but don't wait for a conservative. They are few and far between. <br /> <br /> King was also one of the innovators of media survival. That everything starts with the O.J. Simpson trial. Night after night after night, it's all you've ever seen in the mid 90's. Whatever the last gossip on Anna Nicole Smith, or the Petersen murder case, or Paris Hilton, Britney Spears or any other tabloid box, you can bet Larry will kill it. Unfortunately, all the other networks are doing the same thing now. Larry was a leader in this regard. <br /> <br /> King also has the nerve to give advice sometimes, as on marriage. I'm not joking; I heard him. The joke is that he is married and divorced half a dozen times! This man has little scruples, believe me. As for morality, he is clueless. Maybe that's why he dr. Phil has to explain certain facts of life to him regularly. Larry would nod but he didn't understand more than Billy Graham was talking to him. <br /> <br /> King is also known for the softball interview, which means he doesn't ask hard questions. This is very much due to the fact that most are his guests of his political belief. People know they're at King's show, like having an hourly public relationship. <br /> <br /> What this all means has been a serious decline in ratings over the past five years. People see through him and his Liberal-and-tabloid TV mentality and transferred from King and CNN to Fox News.
