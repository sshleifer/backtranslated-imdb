I saw worse movies. It's bad but at least doesn't try well, so it deserves a short applause. It rests firmly in the kingdom of the low-budget B-movie sci-fi genre. <br /> <br /> It is a garbage film but in a good way and is definitely worth buying if it's in your bargain at local supermarket. Very charming rather than just terrible. <br /> <br /> The highlight for me is when Galaxina's lover goes to save her. At the rise she called "Bunnyfluff!" Off. who pulls triggers from his fellow pilot. <br /> <br /> Sit back, get drunk, enjoy!
