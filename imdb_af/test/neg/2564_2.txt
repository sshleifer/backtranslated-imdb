Well, some other people have noticed that this is not an action movie, so I don't have to reprimand it (although I just did it). It's not really a deviation, it's actually nice to see an actor try something different. But unfortunately it is not one of those opportunities. <br /> <br /> Now, the story: doesn't exist. This movie is missing in storyline almost as much as 'Showgirls' did. Certainly, they throw in a few environmentalists, no, not even environmentalists, anything else, sweets here and there to please Seagal (that's what he participates in). It doesn't make a story, not even close. Now, the end ... Even those of us who really liked this movie ... the end, you must admit it was a bit, or very stupid. <br /> <br /> Now, from what I understand it was a direct-to-video movie (at least in the states), but it's even too good for this one. This piece of garbage only had to be cable, on TBS or Starz (late night).
