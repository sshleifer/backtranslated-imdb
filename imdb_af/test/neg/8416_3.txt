It is a dull spoof of private eyewitnesses as a novelist (Michael Cain), who has to make an autobiography of a colorful, deviant Hollywood star (Mickey Rooney). Sometimes sobriety becomes unpleasant. It is not Cain at its best. Rooney is far above. Striking support from Lizabeth Scott, Lionel Stander and the crazy Nadia Cassini. Not easy to look at.
