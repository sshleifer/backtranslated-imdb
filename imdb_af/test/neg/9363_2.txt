<br /> <br /> I understand that people have different expectations of low-budget, arthouse movies. I also know that John Sayles has a kind of glow over him, that earthly, intellectual anti-hollywood vibe, a la Tim Robbins, the Coen brothers and Atom Egoyan, who make a treasure with the critics of the visit . br /> <br /> But that's not a good movie. I'm sorry, it's just not. <br /> <br /> This meanders. This has too many characters. His tone is uneven, his point of view is astounded, the play is across the board, from naturalistic to top. It lasts for long moments with small characters, we don't care and cut away from tense scenes just when things are going well. <br /> <br /> It misses the point. <br /> <br /> The worst mistake in the movie is that the two closest things to a protagonist are Edie Falco's Marly and Angela Bassett's Desiree straight jacket in no-ride characters. Marly is an apathetic drunk, penetrating her own inertia. Desiree is a woman trapped in her own suppressed pain. When your two main characters' world views can be summed up with the phrases "I don't mind" and "I want to get away here", why should the audience give the rat's patot? <br /> <br /> I'll be clear: Sayles writes funny dialogue. He is very skilled at making a scene. The problem is that these scenes don't go anywhere. There is no backbone for the movie. No drive. The movie does not create root interest in any of the characters. In my opinion, he is too preaching about big, bad corporate America sitting on the little man. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a small "small" movie, see David Lynch's "Straight Story." Pass this one up.
