He's the only reason to watch this movie. He gives a very good performance - much better than this crap deserves. He is very attractive and very talented - he deserves better than that. Also depressed is to see Malcolm McDowell in this. He is another talented actor who earns better but, like Esai, he gives a very good performance. So, if you're fans of any of them, you might want to look. Otherwise, stay away. Another complaint - couldn't we have had more scenes from Esai shirtless?
