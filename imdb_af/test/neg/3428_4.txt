The story of Farewell to the King is intriguing. An American "devastation" (I have had the impression he and his three comrades have just tried to escape in the Philippines, as their desperate escape with Borneo is not your classic desert). But sooner they come ashore when they are discovered by the Japanese. Nolte's character (a sergeant) only walked on the beach only moments earlier and was not noticed. And unbelievably, no one noticed his footprints in the sand that would have led Japanese law to him. But anyway, Nolte is overtaken by a tribe of coopers and becomes their king after defeating another progenitor. So he is out of the war. Then the British commandos appear and the tribe wants to help them fight the Japanese. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Nolte's incessant hamming disturbs an interesting story. Instead of returning like a former soldier, he retreated into the war, now with a tribe of warriors under his command. Nolte acted as if he had been raised by the tribe. He speaks as if English is almost a foreign language, which rarely uses contractions. He makes terrible gestures when he speaks, and acts as if he were one with nature, as if raised in the jungle. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of action and interesting scenes with the British interaction with Nolte and the tribe. But Nolte's character is never credible. He always seems to be persuaded. He had to be a little more of an American soldier and much less of a tribal. As it is, he comes over, not as a royal king, but as a madman who forgets who he really is. But that is not the intent of the movie, as the writing admired him and trusted by the British commandos. There is never a suggestion that the British thought his behavior was strange. He is simply regarded by the British as the defacto leader of the tribe. It always seems that Nolte's character does not fit in with what is supposed to be in the film. <br /> <br /> Another actor may have done a good job with the role, making his lines credible and making it a great movie. But Nolte ruins the movie by picking up every scene and doesn't appear to understand what his character is supposed to be. <br /> <br /> What a waste.
