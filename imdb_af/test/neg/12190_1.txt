This movie is simply horrible, how the particular talent is, is beyond human faith. Although they should have been thinking of this idea, I feel as if two hours of my life have been taken from me. Hector Kietel will try and distance himself from this garbage, it must have been a big crime movie, but it develops into a gory mess of vampires. I would recommend this movie to people who want to sleep through movies, you will not miss anything. The humor is set to appeal to the lowest common domination, can lift our movies and remind us that life is worth living. This movie just suppresses you. If DeNiro said in one movie, the saddest thing in life is wasted talent. This film is a perfect example of this statement.
