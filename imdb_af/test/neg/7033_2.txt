It was a terribly bad movie! Ashley Rose Orr was horrible, she didn't have any of Shirley Temple's charm! The horrible smiles she'd do if she were her piggy-eyes in a way I think was "cute" and let the audience go - "aahhhh bless!" It just made me bang. She had to struggle "oh my good!" about a hundred times in the movie. Also, she can barely express a sentence without guiding it with a false giggling. Horrible HORRIBLE movie. If I could calculate it minus 10, I would. Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage, go out and buy a real Shirley Temple movie!
