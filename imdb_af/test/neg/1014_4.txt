The 3rd in the series finds that Paul Kersey (Bronson) turns vigilante to get revenge on the thugs who killed his old friend. I don't know why this movie moved me to it, but somehow it did. I found myself Bronson to wipe the floor with those punks. Every time I blew away one of them, I felt good. This movie doesn't take him seriously, but what if it did? There is a good buildup for the fireworks final in which Bronson goes on a rampage. But as far as acting and plot go, it doesn't just measure. If I lived in that area, I would come out as fast as I could, but people seem to be in trouble. I know there is that mentality we need to save our streets, but there is a limit here. I had to give it a 4. Certainly there are good "blow em away" scenes, but it's about it. At that time, Bronson was 64. I'm sure those villains really wanted them to get their way with Bronson. Bronson takes the place of a Schwarzanegger or Stallone in this movie. This movie gives you a sense of joy. The ordinary man can save the environment except the day. To sum it up, it's far from the original wish of death, but it's pretty good if you're just looking for an hour and a half of the shooting.
