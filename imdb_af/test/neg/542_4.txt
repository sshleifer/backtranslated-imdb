First of all, I just want to say that I'm a very big Naruto fan. I love the Anime and the Manga stories. Also, the first movie just confirmed that Naruto is about great fun, good action, wonderful story, but then came the 2nd movie. I was very inclined because the first movie grew up. But that didn't satisfy me a bit ... The story was lame, the action wasn't that good, especially when compared to the Anime series. This also applies to the quality of animation. I found it very poor ... Can the story get any lame ... ANY ??? Where is the kyuubi of Naruto? Not once does he turn demon ... I mean ... COME !!! My advice is ... see the series (until episode 140, then it's just fillers) and then read the Manga because it's still nice. Ignore this movie and hope for something better in the future ... <br /> <br /> Everything and I gave it a 4, just because it's Naruto ...
