Hairdresser Shop 2: Back in Business was not as good as it was originally, but was just as funny. The film itself had few things that kept the original one that made it much nicer. Back in Business was just another worthless prosecution to bring in money with a very thin plot. Cedric the Entertainer's horrifying flashback excuses devastated the movie and was a bad way to try to adapt the audience to character. Overall Barbershop 2: Back in Business was a sequel not needed, without the original charm, soul and spark.
