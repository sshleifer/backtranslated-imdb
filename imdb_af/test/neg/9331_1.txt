Tyrone Power is the lead of Solomon. However, he died unexpectedly, partly through the film. The studio chose to envisage Yul Brynner and shoot the screens that Power did again. Afterwards, considering how horrible this movie was, Power was happy - because it would be a horrible way to end his lovely movie career !!! <br /> <br /> Of all the biblical stories I have seen, this one is by far the worst - and it says a lot, because Hollywood has made very dull biblical stories - so much do you wonder if the creation of these films was " an atheistic conspiracy !! In fact, the movie was so boring that it was properly included in Harry Medved's brilliant book "The Fifty Worst Movies of All Time". There are so many reasons to hate the movie, but the worst is how amazingly the whole thing was! Certainly, people who played with Italian, Eastern European, Scottish and English accent to play Egyptians and Israelis were definitely bad - but it made the film strange in anyway. Gin Lollobrigida, who was the role of a woman allegedly came from a place around Ethiopia, was also terrible, but at least she was beautiful even if she couldn't act. With an overweight and middle-aged parent George Sanders playing such a young role was also pretty bad, but at least he had a nice voice. Creating an orgy scene that was choreographically and rebelliously dull was pretty bad, but at least you had to see a person's name as the orgy choreographer! No, the worse thing about this movie is that almost two and a half hours, it seems as if nine were so weak and unsatisfactory! Since the only mention of this Queen of Sheba and Solomon is only in a few virgin verses in the Old Testament, it is incredible that the film is just going on. THE GREATEST STATEMENT SET UP was a bit longer, but that movie was based on four Gospels - not a dozen or so verses! <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that the film is miserable in almost all ways (except for Gina's fission). Even for dedicated Christians and Jews, this is a movie to be avoided because it plays so fast and loses with the truth, as well as a wonderful amount of sex in a Biblical movie! Terrible in almost every respect, it is truly a blessing to Tyrone Power that he did not remember to act in this inflated turkey.
