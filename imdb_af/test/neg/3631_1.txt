For the first time I watched this show and hope for a few laughs, good acting and good plot. Unfortunately, I have nothing of those things. <br /> <br /> First, this show is totally unrealistic. How can anyone go to a boarding school, it's super hip, awesome place, and hardly any rules? Plus a sushi bar. A SUSHI BAR. No school has a sushi bar. And how about the big, ultra-cool, ultra-hip dorm rooms? It doesn't happen in boarding schools! Everyone in this show looks perfect. Zoey, looks perfect, has the perfect friends, never does homework and is super popular. Sounds more like a villain to me! I hate how they use so many clicks in this show. Example: Dana cheating the skater. She is totally ignorant and wears "edgy" clothes. The jokes are old, sooooo old! I will not watch this show if I were you, this is one of the most horrible shows I have ever watched and I hope it will be canceled soon! Rating: 1/10
