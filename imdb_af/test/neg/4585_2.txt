Like another user, I got it cheaply - I thought. $ 85 (Â£ 8). Although it's not so much money, it's a total classic I saw - like other users - when I was a kid and looking forward to seeing again 20 years later. The story is incredibly thin (that's why it worked for kids), but all the radio and trucker stuff does it right. It will look good on my DVD shelf in the coming year. First inspection (1980): 10/10. Second View (2002): 4/10
