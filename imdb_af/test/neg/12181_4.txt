First, I'm a great Bronson fan, since the late 70's. I watched every movie he made on the big screen since "Love and Bullets", which ironically was the beginning of his end as a big name, Hollywood star. <br /> <br /> I was hoping things would turn around for him, that he would make a very good movie in the 80's, but it never happened. And I don't know what he thought when he signed for most of his last films with the cheap Jacket studio Cannon and hack director J. Lee Thompson. <br /> <br /> "Assasination" gave me some hope when I saw Peter Hunt instead of Thompson directing, but that hope was quickly punched. First, the movie looks incredibly cheap, as it was made for about 3 miles, minus Bronson's inflated salary (I heard he insisted on 5 miles per photo that's probably more than the rest of the budget for all his Cannon films) . The White House scenes were filmed in the Western LA area - I took the bus when they shot. Nice work to recreate the white house, but didn't anyone think of getting the palm trees out of the shots? Don't guess. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the supporting role is really bad. Ireland died of cancer and despite this she was not bad, but the terrible Asian woman playing Bronson's sidekick was typical of Cannon's talent at that time - non-existent. I would really be curious to learn how she had this role. I can't imagine a worse actress for the part, plus she's a good 40 years younger than Bronson! The story is not that bad and it is something that bigger and better budgeted studios did later (Eastwood's "In the Line of Fire" and Costner's "Bodyguard" movie), but the way it is presented here is really heart broken. I wonder if they can't afford to do more than one or two, take a shot. None of them is credible in the slightest. If Secret Service men really behaved like the keystone policemen in this movie, our presidents had to turn out of the office (and out of life) every few months.
