God! Where do I start? From start to finish I can't help hating this movie. Vineyards? Vineyards that make phone sounds?! Oh yes, I'm so scared - I'm going to get rid of the weeds of the earth! Come on people! The plot didn't go anywhere. When the group discovered the ruin, and the town personnel (no spokesperson intended) came to warn them and secure weapons in front of their faces, don't worry. Amy (Jena Malone) was there to take pictures! That whole scene really wondered why she didn't take pictures of her beau, Jeff (Johnathon Tucker), of Mathias (Joe Anderson) legs. When the idiots first threw the rope to Mathias, how the rope was at least ten feet off the ground, but how it could eventually be only two to four feet from the ground. I can't think of anything wrong about this movie, there's just too much to cover. I will say the graphics as far as they were, but it didn't produce anything, as the acting and the script were so bad.
