The conversation was held a thousand times. Is the "Merchant of Venice" antisemitic? (I think it is.) Isn't it unfair to always point out this little anti-Semitism in another great piece of art? (I don't think so.) Does it stain Shakespeare's reputation as the world's greatest playwright? (I think so.) Does it play a role if he hasn't done it on a specific racist purpose? (I don't think so.) Michael Radford knew all this and therefore, in his film, he gave a prologue about the pitiful situation of the Jews in Renaissance Venice. <br /> <br /> In vain; because the play remains what it has always been and the new makeup only gives a first (but useless) hope that someone has done something right that remains a permanent indignation, not because his degree of anti-Semitism would be particularly shocking but because the play comes under the name of William Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Why spend so much time portraying the hatred of a man - Shylock? Why does a big and serious actor like Al Pacino work if everything is finally ruined in this outrageous (but hey, I'm non-responsible-Shakespeare-written-it) courtroom scene. And now I want to be very precise, just like Shylock himself. <br /> <br /> He claims his right, according to the contract that the - not very responsible - Christian Antonio, who always used to look at him, signed in full awareness of the consequences. Sure, who claims Shylock, is cruel and useless, but that's not the point. What we see (or should see) is a man who is humiliated for his entire life, to the point where everything that remains about him is hate. I think it's definitely a bit inappropriate to read such a man about things like compassion. <br /> <br /> But what the play / movie (they are one and the same now) is at this point. become a soap opera! The cruel man with his knife, the terrible (but rather short-sighted) audience, tied the poor "victim" to his chair. True, Antonio accepts his fate, but why can't he just say one word, sorry? I don't think we should lose many words on the ridiculous verdict of the young Dottore of Padua; it is a real "popular statement" not much different from what would be seen 400 years later in the Nazi show trials. From one minute to the next, this Jew is robbed of everything he owns, condemned to be christened, and kicked out. <br /> <br /> Isn't it shameful? Obviously not. The story moves to the romantic complexity of the rings and its happy ending. <br /> <br /> What one can learn in Libeskind's Jewish Museum in Berlin and similar places around the world is that anti-Semitism often goes unnoticed by mass because what is so devastating for a minority or some individuals is embedded in the alleged larger goods for the majority. It must be exactly the task of all of us to develop a sensitivity to discover and unmask such trends. <br /> <br /> I do not accept the excuse that this film was made to create empathy with the badly treated Shylock (it just doesn't work out). I don't think anyone can be forced to be gracious. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie; especially not for an Oscar.
