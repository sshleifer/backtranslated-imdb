Big spoiler here: this movie is B! A! D! But enjoy, it's good bad. <br /> <br /> Bugged is the kind of movie you can't believe, with dialogue, plot and direction, so clumsy that Uncle Ned's Carlsbad Cavern home video looks like an IMAX experience. . Since it is a Troma movie, there are many chosen ones on tap, but it's even harder than usual. <br /> <br /> Most of the production agents appear to be buying cold drinks and casting sandwiches. The brilliant dialogue is best summarized in the immortal, "% @ # $! What was it?" What is second is just screaming for the often, "Now what?" <br /> <br /> Any knowledge of how people act in a desperate situation is the writer / director Ronald Armstrong. When one of the friends is found, it is generated alive by a locust / termite / chiapet thing, Armstrong immediately made the survivors time with cute, but stupid-like-a-door knob, "Divine." While being beaten, Divine makes a large steam jug of a gear-poison or oatmeal mixture on the stove, stirs, smiles, stirs, smiles, never fails to fume! <br /> <br /> The killer bugs are as scary as pi√±atas, which they also look very much like. The effects used to move them include working over the tile floors, fasting with their legs trailing behind. <br /> <br /> The highlight for the movie would probably blow up the house, but they were either out of cash or never had any, so instead of seeing even a miniature in flames, leave them simply turn the screen black (eat your heart from ILM). <br /> <br /> The casting is almost all black. How can the NAAKP consistently censor something that is funny like Amos and Andy (which is certainly no less similar to 99% of all white comedy shows), but tells Nary a peep about something like Bugged. Oh yeah, it's best not to know how engaging in this movie is for everyone (as if it were played by a single ethnic group, honestly). Before placing the kabosh on Bugged, friends get together and get ready for the Plan 9 of Bug Exterminator movies.
