As with most viewers of this movie, I am an avid reader of the books. The first two films feature Buck, Ray and Chloe as main characters, but in this second successor, they play second-violin for Louis Gossett JR's presidential effort. World at War is based on the meeting he has with Buck in the book series. <br /> <br /> The problem is - this movie is as horrible as the first two. Amanda just appears from nowhere and suddenly has an important role to play (I won't reveal it if someone hasn't read the series). Other illogical parts contain. I really really want Cloud 10 to make a good back film, but unfortunately it's the same in all the bad ways as the first 2.
