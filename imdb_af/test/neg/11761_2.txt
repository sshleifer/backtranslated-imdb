CHO! is a bad movie and deserves reputation as an inadvertent funny movie. It takes a serious subject and presents it like the Cliff Notes version or Classic Comics, because there is not much emotion or a proper story - just episodic segments merged with mostly silly "true stories" that come with a variety of yutzes transferred. /> <br /> This is a deserving movie because it is poorly written and performed. But what I found most interesting about the movie is its apparent gay subtext. Instead of Che Guevarra and Fidel Castro working for a Communist Cuba, they seem to be more of a gay couple - behaving with Che and excited and Fidel as the fiery suites! Again, the movie runs with good lines, like when Fidel wants the Cuber of Cuba ... needs you .... I need you !! "I am not sure if the studio intended this homosexual undercurrent, but it does not take a brain surgeon to recognize it! I am very surprised that the other reviewers do not point it out. watch the movie, make it much more exciting and worse. <br /> <br /> A final note In recent years, Che is very chic - even a fashion statement with many brain-dead teens, who do not know who he is , with shirts with his face adorned, being a cold-blooded killer and nihilist (a strange combination for a doctor), this new reverence for the man is gross, what will they do next, put Hitler or Dr. Mengele on T-shirts and posters? !!? Even communists with consciences need to be frightened by the bloodshed Guevara was responsible for and I find it ironic that people with computers are a man champion who might have given them half a chance! <br /> <br /> Considering how silly and unintentionally funny this movie was, it means n iks to promote the message that Guevara was not a hero. I would like to see a realistic movie of his life - with the good and the bad but also with the dialogue and a plot that is not apparently created by chimpanzees!
