A wide variety of snake stages a revolt on tourists "invading" their island because of their captain's boat damage. The few remaining survivors who are not affected by the snakes will try an escape box, aiming to flee to available boats that can safely get off the island. <br /> <br /> Presented straight with injected doses Of visual humor with many snake days, Wayne Crawford's SNAKE ISLAND features many different races of slithery predators, strikingly ready to attack their prey. Star William Katt, as a writer exploring snakes for an upcoming novel, has fun in his role with author / director / fellow student Wayne Crawford (as the tourist boat captain) as commissions that are a serious crisis. Kate Connor is Crawford's attractive love affair, a vacation lawyer. The other cast members serve as tourists or crew, mostly feed for the snakes. <br /> <br /> Like many other movies of this kind, director Crawford offers live snakes with computer-generated, and the violence is really tough. Crawford even incorporates the point-of-view technique with the camera as the eyes of the snake as it looks the potential victim (with the actor looking directly at the camera). Never be taken seriously. The speech was probably the best way to shoot SNAKE ISLAND, because the point of departure is just too ridiculous to accept it. <br /> <br /> The effects and tension scenes rarely work because Crawford is often incapable of successfully placing the rows of people with snakes. The snake attacks themselves never happen on the screen (either one or two peaks), or are so exposed, they leave little impression behind. It's a no-no for a genre like this. Fans of Katt will probably want to choose it because he provides a vision committee that defines the overall tone of certain scenes where he has to defend himself against the snakes. The CGI scenes where we see a large number of snakes in a common area are not very effective, removing the realism that Crawford may have tried. There are much better horror movies with snakes than the aggressors than SNAKE ISLAND. Surprising moments of nudity, moving to a scene where tourists and crew relax after a long day, without knowing what danger lies ahead.
