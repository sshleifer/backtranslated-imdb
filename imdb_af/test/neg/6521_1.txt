This movie is by far the worst movie ever. The story line is weak and never shows what happens to the people after leaving their hands. It really makes me wrong. It pulls up and on without any meaning, very boring. The only good thing was the cast, WOW, great time actors and actress in it. But besides, it was terrible, terrible and repulsive, doing yourself a favor, not looking. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 1 out of 10
