Last Thursday I rented this TV movie version of 'Troilus and Cressida' from my library and couldn't believe my eyes. Where do I start? There was no attempt to make the play look remote, as it was about the Trojan war, all actors wore Elizabethan dresses. In addition, most actors were too old and terribly wrong - Aeneas (with his white beard) looks older than Nestor, Troilus was at least 30, Hector looked like a Spanish pirate. Ajax was badly played anyway and Thersites was a transvestite. br /> <br /> Similarly, the action is poor, the duel between Ajax and Hector is short and amateurish. The camera angle focuses more on Nestor's face. We can only see what is going on in the background, which in itself is frustrating. Also, the "battle" at the end was not given, it is respectful. We don't see Troilus and Diomedes fighting, and no one else, Paris and Menelaus seem like a bump to the Thersites. Even Patroclus's death has been omitted. All this was a great disappointment, as I took a very faint 2 and a half hours from the BBC costume drama. <br /> <br /> It wasn't bad though. I thought the Incredible Orlando as Thersites and John Shrapnel as Hector were well played, even though they didn't seem right. I will say the same about Kenneth Haigh as Achilles, as he did not have the striking prestige and was sometimes almost dry. SPOILER: The climax at the end - the death of Hector - may have been the best part of the movie. Achilles' dialogue is excellent here and summarizes the attitude of a cold, seasoned killer. But the horror scene of the scene (when Achilles seals on what Hector's head was) pushes it anyway. <br /> <br /> Charles Gray as Pandarus was beautiful as a messy old pervert and I thought the actress playing Cressida had an OK job. The war-sampling Troilus, however, was annoying and I think the game would have been better if he had been killed by Achilles instead of a peacenic like Hector. <br /> <br /> Conclusion? OK, but could have been better if it had a younger role and costume that at least tried to look ancient Grecian, not to mention the lack of action. 10/05
