Describing this movie is a difficult task. On the one hand, it's a top vampire ghost festival, complete with cobwebs, ominous music, a hypnotic medal, and, of course, a coffin with a creaking lid. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is one of the silliest scripts this side of Edward D. Wood, Jr. Produced by the same people as the "The Bloody Vampire", "Invasion of the Vampires", and the predecessor of the film, the humble title "The Vampire," The movie is close to the lack of logic that characterizes the other films. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned, this movie is a sequel to "The Vampire", which I haven't seen. But no matter ... it's really easy to think what happened. Dr. Enrique, played by Abel "The Brainiac" Salazar, becomes frozen at the conscious but deceptive dr. Marion brings back the bumped body of his vampire enemy, Count Karol de Lavud (I suppose there's a rule somewhere that all vampires should be counters of some kind). Dr Marion complains that all major doctors throughout history had to resort to some kind of robbery to promote their medical studies and he hopes to use the vampire's body to study such phenomena as the vampire's lack of normal reflection ( at what point does he have a mirror up to the vampire and instead of no reflection, we see the vampire's skeleton. Enrique is not satisfied and seems determined about the events of the first film as mere fantasy and superstition. "This man was not a vampire ... I would admit he wanted to drink some blood, but that's all!" he says. Also confusing is the fragile Martha, a part-time nurse and part-time showgirl (!) That results in Enrique's object of love. Martha escaped the Lavud's clutches in the first movie. Enrique apparently spent a lot of time healing her thoughts and making her think that everything she was experiencing was not right. <br /> <br /> OK, so if you were the scriptwriter for this movie, you would need a way to get someone stupid to get the game out of the vampire, right? Well, how about the greedy man who helped Marion steal the coffin? After he had a look at the Lavud's body, he glanced at the expensive pants the spade wore, and he returned to steal it when the doctors didn't look. But darn it ... he can't remove the pants because of the game, so ... you guessed it. The Lavud was released again, this time with the shadow as his human handler. <br /> <br /> OK, so of course the vampire is back to Martha, and meanwhile, the doctors are really confused about what they believe. Initially, they are determined to prove that there is no such thing as a true vampire. By the end of the film, they are trying to get the police to postpone a bulletins bullet for a dead man but still alive! "<br /> <br /> You can probably imagine the rest of the plot from here, but the filmmakers throw in some nice twists and turns. One of the movie sets is a ghostly wash museum (is there any Other types in these types of movies?), Complete with a fully equipped torture room ... with REAL torture and execution equipment. The movie has a very fine sense of style, not just in the campus spider webs. spectacular series, De Lavud has been a victim of a seemingly endless series of streets and corridors, along their progress along vague buildings with no doors, while the scene is being illuminated as a German expressionist nightmare ("The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" seems to be Don't be an influence. <br /> <br /> But the rest of the movie is young, especially in the movie's climax, and the special effects are quite rough, even for the year it's been made, and the climate battle with the Lavud in bat shape is laughing enough ... but the director feels the b need to ask us to believe that Martha will fall and crash directly. on top of a guillotine, positioned so that her head was in the perfect place to be cut through the blade, which is in danger of falling because the rope rope suddenly started to flame. What an unfortunate coincidence! To make matters worse, he cuts off the tearing rope into the scenes of Enrique to evade the wavy rubber bat, basically stand still and waving his arms. It's definitely an Ed Wood moment when ever there was one, especially if Martha revived on her own and got up firmly on her feet, just as the blade collapses. Wow! What a relief! In terms of cooking, the "Vampire's Coffin" does not have the brightness factor of "The Bloody Vampire" or "Invasion of the Vampires", but fans of these old horror films will appreciate the atmospheric photography and the fact that the director succeeds in a twist some chills of this material to count for something (have).
