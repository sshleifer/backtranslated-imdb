"Haaaarrrryyy!" <br /> <br /> The reinforced, indifferent female voice was Leona Helmseley in heat, but no, it belongs to Allison Hayes as Nancy Archer, the 50-foot-woman of the title. In the most notorious role of her film career, Allison's performance literally falls off the roof. In fact, it makes some roofs. "Aot50FW" is the story of Nancy, a neurotic, boozy heir and her loveless Lothario man, Harry (William Hudson, who is also co-starring to the Amazing Colossal Man). Nancy has a close encounter of the third kind, in the desert, with a bare giant from outer space wearing a mini-dress and gladiator sandals, and having a thing for Nancy's jewelry. What he's doing to her now is probably the best of a mystery, but Nancy is starting to grow fast. <br /> <br /> In the center of the village, tranquilizers, tightly wrapped in nothing but sheets, The buxom giant leads to the low-rise salon where Harry laughs with a floozy named Honey (Yvette Vickers). The confrontation gets ugly. <br /> <br /> The poverty drive f / x makes the alien giant and Nancy seems to be transparent due to unauthorized images. You will understand why director Nathan Juran changed his name to Nathan Hertz on the credits. Juran was not a stranger to directing huge creatures, man or not. He also has the Deadly Mantis, the 7th Feed of Sinbad, Jack, the Giant Assassin and several episodes of TV's World of Giants and Land of the Giants. "<br /> <br /> Lots of laughter for all the wrong reasons.
