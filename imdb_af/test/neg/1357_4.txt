I'm sorry, but I can't even partially agree with some remarks about this terrible piece ... English is not my native language, because I'm a German citizen, so don't blame it. I for inappropriate grammatical structures or something * I can't understand why this movie got such a high rating? 6.3 ??? Are you joking? This movie has no sense whatsoever, not even a desire for good acting. <br /> <br /> When I look at the comments on the Da Vinci code, what - I think - has almost the same rating, I have to hit my head on the table, because I have 00 Schneider directly to Sakrileg watched, and oh my god, there are worlds between them. <br /> <br /> The majority of posters in this board cut each filmed movie into pieces while making the crime of the movie with a 6.3 and calling Helge as a genius. Of course he knows how to make money, but I think the main aspect of your opinion is the fact that the German is not your mother tongue and you just ignore it - or rather not the bunch of shit in the sentences. OK, I have to confess that some scenes are funny, but everything is a 6.3 just too much for my compatriot;)
