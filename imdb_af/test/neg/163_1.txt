I can't believe how silly this movie really is. The storyline (written by Keira Knightley's mother) is destroying the film to the limit. it is straight, dull, absurd, and makes absolutely no sense ... <br /> <br /> this movie is so bad for most of it, especially at the beginning. The story just continued with each other and continued on their everyday flirts, often like a threesome. In this movie you have an annoying dead couple (the poet and his wife) who have been drunk from the beginning. The woman sleeps with other men to meet the end, while the poet is a pervert who thrives on cheap evil and women. The woman, who became too fast, became friendly with his former childhood (played by keira), suddenly became jealous and well know that the two lovers were because they were children. something doesn't look here .... i mean, come on ... come to the program lady! what you expect. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is: earlier lovers meet again with a new woman who embraces it, then becomes jealous, then earlier female lovers are married and her husband becomes jealous and bombard the mad drunk couple's home. , madman calls the police, and they eventually go to court for the man's attempted murder. it is summed up ... <br /> <br /> This movie has it's moments like the quality and good acting of Cillian Murphy, but otherwise, I can't believe I watched it ... I complained about it during the movie and some family members who watched it fell asleep. I decided to give it a chance and I had to hold onto my first instincts.
