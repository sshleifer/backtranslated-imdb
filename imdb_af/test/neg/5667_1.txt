Again, like many other TV shows, some actor / actresses hit the spotlight, in this case Miranda Cosgrove, who built her reputation in previous films / series (especially Nickelodeon and Dan Schneider.) She is now the star from the show, get the soundtrack singing (which she did NOT write and thereby gaining more fame from it). It creates so much imbalance in popularity with her fellow co-stars, especially Nathan Kress, who is constantly thrown into small roles in every episode, except iDont wants to fight. Cosgrove's music would never have met the cards without this show and her singing the main theme song (not written by her) and other covers like you now and remain my baby. Remember that she doesn't sync / sing lip. Does that tell you how to make a singer today? <br /> <br /> Back to the show, Cosgrove shows more physically through plays in a bikini, Hawaiian hula-type bra and called bra many times through. Bras and seen in many cases (though not from the other actresses). Wedges are mentioned, panties are once mentioned. And let's not forget "Oh My God" (is any of the writers / actors Christians?) Granted that the show isn't just meant for kids, I'm amazed at the multitude of notable features of the female underwear, especially in the first episode, where the phrase "pointy boobs" was called. I'm not sure children will remember to say it at home / school. <br /> <br /> It's not that I'm against the mention or display of female underwear (which girls will wear), but for a performance of Nickelodeon, people in charge should realize that children are exposed to such things . I doubt other Nickelodeon performances have such content in them. <br /> <br /> As mentioned other reviews, the lag track is extremely annoying and unnecessary in many parts, for example when the character Sam cries, how earth is it a time to laugh? It leads people to get the joke and is almost used in every sense. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, Cosgrove is the star of the show and thus gets the greatest fame and support from the tough fans who even shook. a hotel staff when she is told to stop her noise level (see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk0gtfUk98U). Jennette McCurdy is the second star of the show, but she faces Cosgrove's competition in the music industry (comparing the popularity of her new single vs Cosgrove's lids). As indicated, the third co-star Nathan Kress is the least known of the lot. He is portrayed as an atypical boy who suffers from a girl and other boys, but somehow a wizard on technology. His highlight in early episodes makes him a cute actor, but unusual, gives his character's beloved on Carly / Cosgrove. In addition, Kress does not break into the music industry and as Cosgrove's fame grows with every episode, Kress falls behind. I bet he was the least paid from all three actors. <br /> <br /> The content of the show is of course fiction, but we can also wonder how it fits into a comedy series at certain times (so the lag track is used). It also has several continuity errors (how can your dad be and air force colonel on a submarine? American special forces have their own branches, and the air force doesn't use US submarines - it's for SEALs). A unique feature is that viewers can submit their own videos during or after the episodes, but the videos somehow do not repeat the theme of comedy. <br /> <br /> Once again it is a show It is beaten with the names of the female underwear, skin exposure, and the use of laughing tracks. It's a series that has so far pushed a teenage actress into the crowd, so her songs / actions are overly supported by her fans.
