Are the Cannes controversial meters remarkably esoteric, or is it that our Americans are so dirty and cynical that we never read between the lines again? Be it as it may be, with a very thorough analysis, "Falscher Familiar" apparently by no means appears to be the disturbing controversy allegedly brought to Cannes in 2005, a mysterious and purposeless film that rather comes to mind. glossy American re-titles ("Low Profile"). <br /> <br /> Based on well-known themes of Bourgeoise anxiety and subsequent sexual liberation (kind), it is indeed a film without being at the level of the interests of the surface. It starts with a grab, as a hasty shot of an abandoned off-road focuses on a teenager-driver, who eventually goes with a total car, after which a brutal hit-and-run has left the driver dead. a nice mess. Stunned, he does nothing but scrap the remaining engine. <br /> <br /> Just outside the school, the driver Armin Steebe, a product of the German suburbs with minimal ambition, appears. Perseveringly pressured by his caring, but somewhat crunchy parents to get a good job, he is interviewing every arrogant interviewer with everyone with the same fruitless outcome. He immediately became ill, and his aforementioned highway encounter soon prompted his first act of rebellion: claiming the crime he did not commit. <br /> <br /> Pretend to fill in more applications and fill in more and more bizarre. work interviews at sunrise, he participates along the road alongside sexual fantasies and smaller vandalism. As the days get shorter and the nights get much warmer, while staying in his suburban neighborhood, as if he's doing nothing out of the ordinary. <br /> <br /> If you're looking confused about what's going on, don't worry about being the only one: it's about as far and wide as the story gets. The plot seems simple enough, and perhaps because of its seemingly direct purposes, Falscher Familiar is inexorably amazed, enchanted with endless false conclusions, dreamy situations and graphic sex scenes to try to relieve a story that is the clear logic of an already Vague argument (so-called soul-succeeding effects of the modern suburban desert, or something about the youth's fascination with crime. Very, it can even be an out come movie.) It spends a lot of time creating many symbols, both tangible and surreal allegorical, but it doesn't seem to matter really. <br /> <br /> The deadliest mistake, however, is how the filmmakers paint all his characters in a rough vanilla tinge. There are hardly any distinguishing features to understand their purpose, and how the secondary characters (especially the confused relationship between Armin and his rather normal-might-normal family) catalyze the overall underdeveloped main character's "fate" never fails . How should we identify with this young adult's uprising, with little sense of the world in which he lives or the prominent figures around him who help it? <br /> <br /> Many people fall in and out of the movie (including Armin's kind friend Katja, and a strange, affluent visitor who for some reason finds pleasure in eating the protagonist), and seems to exist for no reason whatsoever. They eventually look like a long padding to an already thin story with useless subplots that continue to prove the movie draws a total empty picture about where to go. <br /> <br /> And even a movie that is likely to play with reality (especially with Armin's nightly editions), it ends with a literal, almost moralizing scraper that turns the questions into a "story" as it is Makes little, but puts it in a state of useless exhausted confusion. <br /> <br /> Without any color, it is impossible to shade anything essential.
