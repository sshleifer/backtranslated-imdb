Did I see a worse movie? No, I can't say I didn't. It was pathetic. If the director is still alive: 1. He should not be. 2. He must be ashamed. 3. God, how I want to spend my 2 completely wasted hours on his $. <br /> <br /> To give you some hints of the "movie": <br /> 1. (I'm a male) and I'd rather give a paper print to the opening my urethra before I see it again (seriously). <br /> <br /> 2. It does have some familiar names in it (Casper Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio). They do not help and their careers in the movie after this "movie" is officially over. <br /> <br /> 3. The dialogue is the worst I have ever heard. "I want to ejaculate on your boon box." What kind of writer did they have on this movie? Was he still using the hook-on sounds and just mixed his letters to make these horrible sentences? Or did he try to kill the Director by the few people who saw it? <br /> <br /> 4. Look at this "movie" backwards. Because I LOVE YOU that you don't want to see it. <br /> <br /> 5. This "movie" will get Helen Keller up and out of the theater. <br /> <br /> 6. The set of movie looks like a McDonald's adult playground. I just waited for this so-called "Dracula" to fall into the bat at one time. <br /> <br /> 7. I also like having 3000 headers in the year with threads going to their mouths. No bluetooth, no wireless headsets, no slides in the brain, but they used capital letters borrowed from a telemarketing agency that was eliminated in 1983. (Nice job Set director on this one.) Real professional. I hope you are currently unemployed and read it.) <br /> <br /> 8. I do not know who was in possession of special effects, but I could have done better in my backyard with my VHS video camera not has a battery. <br /> <br /> 9. I was a religious Catholic before this "movie". But since I looked at it, I know there's no God, because if he was there, he wouldn't have made this movie. I'm now an atheist. <br /> <br /> 10. I'll be honest, I can't talk about the end. Last time I tried to explain it, I fell into a coma. <br /> <br /> However, you are bored, however curious (or brave) you are, how much you laugh, think you will come out of this movie, please DO NOT LOVE THIS. It literally destroyed my life. Avoid ALL COSTS! <br /> <br /> Comment on the director: I hate you. You ruined my life. After watching it, I feel empty inside. My wife and children left me and hated me because I couldn't speak or barely move after I saw it. I lost my job, my dignity, and especially my pride. I will never forgive you in this life or the next (which doesn't look good from my newly found beliefs).
