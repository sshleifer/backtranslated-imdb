This movie is trash because it is based on Mark Furman's book, which is also dirty for many reasons. let me say that Mark Furhman is a racist pig who is just looking for another way to get himself into the spotlight - and others who are right are this kind of trash in prison. because the movie itself, based on the book, was also frightening. The only reason why this murder case has become such a big book and film was because the husband, through his aunts marriage, is related to the Kennedy family and it is ridiculous that people still believe that this family has somehow the ability to to cover and cover murders - they are just a family and middle America must come over the obsession. This poor guy, and his family, have been beaten by police for years, they can't get thumbs up, so they went to Micheal. It is amazing that he was caught with all the evidence that he did not do. Apart from the facts that, among other things, had to keep the law of limitations, this hearing must be brought back to the love of God after twenty years, do not look at this garbage
