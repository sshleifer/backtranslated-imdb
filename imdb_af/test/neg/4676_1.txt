<br /> <br /> I appreciated trying to bring Shakespeare to the masses, but why ruin something so good. <br /> <br /> Is this because 'The Scottish Play' is my favorite Shakespeare? I do not know. What I do know is that a certain Rev Bowdler (thus bowdlerization) tried to do something similar in the Victorian era. <br /> <br /> In other words, you can't improve perfection. <br /> <br /> I no longer have to write, but if I have to write at least ten lines of text (and English compilation was never my forte, I just have to go and say that this movie, like that said, just don't cut.
