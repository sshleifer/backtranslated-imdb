Oh my God, I expected something more entertaining than this when I downloaded this movie, since 1903 was one of my favorite years for movies, but it sucked! The "plot", though I will hesitate to mention it, is about a dumb elephant. It slowly makes its way onto a certain platform and is shot dead. Lamb. Even for a short movie, the plot was too thin to keep my attention. Edison is like the worst director ever. In addition, the elephant has no screen presence whatsoever. And the end? Wow, it was not predictable at all. * Sarcasm * <br /> <br /> Picture quality is also terrible. You can hardly tell what happens most of the time. The only positive thing about this movie is that, unlike most other terrifying movie, it didn't grow eleven successors. Other than that, it's a complete waste of money and one minute of your life never gets you back.
