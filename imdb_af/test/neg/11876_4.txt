After an interrupting mission in Bucharest to announce an international gang of arms dealers, agent Sonni Griffith (Wesley Snipes) is assigned to protect Romanian Nadia Kaminski (Silvia Colloca), the widow of an accountant of the Romanian Mafia . However, the CIA safe house is being broken into by the criminals, and Sonni realizes that the information is leaked from the agency. Only, trust in his friend Michael Shepard (William Hope), fight Sonni to survive and protect Nadia. <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes's career is downhill. I just saw this movie, and this is another disappointing film by this actor, whose career is very similar to Steven Segal's one. The movie associated with many explosions, shots and car hunting with a horrible story and horrible acting. First, African-American Wesley Snipes are being rushed by Bucharest police, but they never get a black American man. I have never been to Romania, but I believe there are not many African Americans in this country. His character doesn't like to bathe, with lots of clothes on the same clothes. There is no chemistry between Sonni and the sexy Silvia Colloca, but she has sex, falls in love with him and shares her fortune with him. The boy who does Nadia's son is terrible. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Detonador" ("The Detonator")
