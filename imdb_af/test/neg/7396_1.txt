The movie is broadcast as I write. <br /> <br /> I just forgot how terribly an experience I watched in the theater. <br /> <br /> The whole idea of ​​the movie is flawed. The fact that intelligent Europeans and Americans were stranded in the desert forgets all the concepts of moral and civilization within a few days, is ridiculous. The madness of the Lord of the flies was in the making longer. <br /> <br /> Details that are annoying are many. One is the single-African divine character who mysteriously survives the terrible climate and has done it for centuries, without losing its mind and it also seems to have no supply issues. Ridiculous. Similarly, the tour guide's rescue effort, an Indiana Jones parable, whose rescue effort ends in a tragedy and death is 5 minutes walk from the hut. Then there is Lear's choice, imposed on the group by an artist's guru-like joke. He reminded me of my hippie high school art teacher. <br /> <br /> The worst thing, however, is that the Learners choose a lifetime. Obviously this is an intellectual brain spot. How ever it was a success is never clear to me. <br /> <br /> Positive is little and far between. It's a beautiful movie, but it's never important. <br /> <br /> High school intellectualism. Weird for the sake of strange. This is a total waste of time unless you like the useless art films.
