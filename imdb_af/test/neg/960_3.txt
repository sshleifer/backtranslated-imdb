I'm a fan of the original 1950 and about 20 minutes into this remake I started thinking it was going to be as good as the original, but it wasn't. The motive for the murders was incredibly stupid. Two of the lovers in the movie seem to be brother and sister - excuse me while I was barfing. The main character stops in the middle of the movie to have sex that doesn't make sense in view of the situation in which he is involved. If the filmmakers wanted a sex scene, they had to make it earlier in the movie before the main character (Dexter played by Dennis Quaid found he was going to die and that he was accused of a crime. There is a reason for where the sex Early in the film Dexter does not live fully to life, so he does not want to sleep with Meg Ryan, I still feel it would make more sense for the sex scene to be both cut or earlier in the movie and that the two brothers were not lovers. <br /> <br /> One of the stupidest parts of the movie is a rifle fight, a few people are killed and one person gets over everything within 15 yards of " A crowded carnival has never walked into the carnival notices! Also in the scene, the tar pits are built on the university where the movie takes place If you fall into the tar, you sink to the bottom and in a matter or seconds. Not only is it hard to believe things will sink quickly into tar, but important there is building a university on tarpts. I'll tell you more about how stupid the end of the movie is, but I don't want to place a spoiler in my post.
