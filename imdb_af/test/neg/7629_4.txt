This derivative erotic thriller stays mainly transparent, mainly because a viewer is spectacularly curious about how it will come out, and because the director, Peter Hall, can manage a nice hot (and rather bold) sex scene. But the final, though unexpected, is ominous, and the whole composition (complete with trauma for children and multiple disorders) shows that it is unbearably clicked, especially in terms of motivation.
