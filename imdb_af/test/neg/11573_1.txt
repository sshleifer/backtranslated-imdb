Within the first 5 minutes of this movie I knew I was in for one of those "pick by the faults" kinda movies. The acting was terrible, the writing was even worse. Who ever lets these people write, write such a crap, because a movie must feed the Komodos themselves. With Russian Mig jets acting as US air force arrows and pistols that can miraculously shoot 50 to 60 laps, quick fire without recharge becomes poor detail to any story. In one scene Komodo kills special troops at night, explaining in another how the komodos and cobra are cold-blooded and do not come out !! Also with the fantastic special effects available in today's movie industry, they were just average, even for this low budget film. <br /> <br /> All that is said, I have looked at it to the end how curious it is that can produce other bad movies. Shame Shame Shame, for producing such rotting! <br /> <br /> This movie had to be left on the cutting floor !!!
