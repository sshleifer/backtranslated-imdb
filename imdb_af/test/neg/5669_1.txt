Of course, if you think Hannah Montana or the Suite Life at the bottom of sitcoms, you never looked iCarly. iCarly is without a doubt the worst show I've ever seen. From the inanimate one acting on the low budget, the spectacle of cheapness, like last week's Chinese pick-up, left to simmer in your overheated car. <br /> <br /> The show turns around a nice, spicy and "supposed to be" funny girl named Carly, as she and her friends make a live web application called iCarly. Carly lives alone with her older brother who needs serious counseling or something because he is a few cells short of a brain. <br /> <br /> The plots of the shows are highly ridiculous and unbearably irritating. But to see Carly and her friend Sam, their little iCarly show-in-a-show is even worse. They basically point out strange pictures and keep things on their nose as they play over and over. I mean seriously, every two seconds the laughing track seems no reason. <br /> <br /> So what's the point of this review? you may ask. Just to mock iCarly? Well, yes, but I also warn you to note this show. Because seriously, if I had to choose between iCarly and Barney? No questions about it, I'll pick Barney.
