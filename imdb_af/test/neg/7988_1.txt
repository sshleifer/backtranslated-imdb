This evil little movie is terrible. My low rating for it comes for two main reasons. The first is that it is a sniff movie and I find the whole concept so dirty it changes my stomach. Filmed more than a hundred years ago, I can only hope that we have developed into something a little more humane and compassionate. This film is completely and completely exploited, which is made cash on the sensational aspects of the film and the subject. Aside from historical interest, it is something to look at only if one finds himself in the grip of the morbid fascination. <br /> <br /> Reason number two? Look at the way the camera is set up. It is placed in the best possible spot to fully capture the full effect: elephant's long-haired forward, perfect view of the electricity platform and a cold and clinically indifferent elephant's stance with smoke emerging before it finally crashes. Sickening. <br /> <br /> Thomas Edison has done many great things for civilization and his talents and intelligence have no doubt. No one is perfect, but if you realize that this movie A) provides an opportunity to trump early film rivals with a sensational film of an exploded elephant, and B) he filmed the performance for the greater efficiency of GS Unlike AC, you can't help but wonder if the scientist in him was a little too discouraging and cold. Any number of Peter Cushing's crazy scientists will be proud. The rest of us must be ashamed and excited.
