... if you easily hit the biggest mistake of the movie. What was the motive? The details of the murders were used but never explained. I think the team got too much in the atmosphere, which is great, but the story is definitely lacking. There is no wire to follow. If it was done well, the movie would have been a little longer, but it would have been worth it, at least for me. <br /> <br /> Casting is very good, I loved Wilson as the vulnerable Vicky. <br /> <br /> Not much more to say. But I really wish they had a little more concentrated on the less obvious. <br /> <br />
