I was ready for a Crouching Tiger style movie and all I got was the worst movie I've seen in years. It was almost as bad as Baron Von Munchhuasen. Dead writing. Dead action. Kill everything. <br /> <br /> Allowed there were some good fighting scenes, but the positive side ended up there. When this movie arrives in your home, runs to a phone and dials 911 and says, "Please help, there's a movie in my house designed to force people to commit suicide."
