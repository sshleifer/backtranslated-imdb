As an avid Gone With the Wind fan, I was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they left out very important characters. Fortunately, the film on its own was a wonderful piece. When the book Scarlett came out, I read it in the hope of following two of my favorite literary characters together. While the book does not have true quality, it remains a good story, and as long as I could separate it from the original, it was still nice. However, I see the six hours I've spent watching the "Scarlett" miniseries to be the worst hours of my life. This series also denied the story of the successor in one of rape, mistrust, murder and deformed relationships that even scarlett's book stays away. The casting for many characters refused to explore the features that were so well-formed in both the original novel and film, and even in the second book conveyed and again at least one incredibly important character. In the novel, Scarlett O'Hara Butler follows her estranged husband, Rhett Butler, to Charleston under the guise of an extended family. After making an arrangement with Rhett, she agrees to leave and continues to connect with her O'Hara family in Savannah. Eventually, she accompanies her cousin Colum, a passionate leader of the British Brotherhood, to explore Ireland's "deep-rooted" roots, and is eventually called the head of the "The O'Hara" family. While her duties like The O'Hara are practicing her in her village of Ballyhara, Scarlett goes out into the world of English landowners, and immediately becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties. She was closed off time and time again by Rhett, and eventually she married Luke, Count of Fenton, until Rhett came in a cleaved "night-on-white-horse" type of rescue. The "Scarlett" miniseries fail to do even this justice. She raped her fianc√© and raped her family. The series shows that Scarlett was thrown into jail after she was found guilty of killing her cousin. <br /> <br /> I encourage everyone to spend their day reconsidering this decision to reconsider this decision.
