Jack Lemmon was one of our great actors. His performances in the days of wine and roses, the apartment, some like it hot, missing (to mention the first) all come worthy of nomination for best actor. His only victory was Save The Tiger, and that's a shame. He becomes a science of melancholy, but never balances it with the manager of his character. He actually has a similar character much better by the end of his career in the one-note Glengarry Glen Ross. <br /> <br /> As far as the film is concerned, the wonderful supportive work of Jack Gilford as Lemmon's partner and Thayer Dawid as an arson is nothing else, as the rest of the script is an embezzlement of fake vignette , anxiety, neurotic nostalgia, and useless moralization. Once as a time capsule to see the experimental direction of 1970 by Avildsen.
