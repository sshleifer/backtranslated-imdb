I have never seen the original movie that made other comments, so my perspective is just about this movie without comparison. <br /> <br /> I found the message from the movie: if you only worry about yourself, everything will be right with the world, everything will be in place, your lovers will love you more, your friends will give you more respect and have more, your employers will have you more, pay more and even your own children and parents will love you more. <br /> <br /> I find this message reprehensible and completely false. <br /> <br /> Kudos for the very funny end-of-life test; there is no mother out there who will not laugh in that scene. <br /> <br /> Overall a very disappointing movie slot. I didn't find myself for someone in this movie. I thought they were all pathetically absorbed, that I just didn't care what happened to them and not a movie that people wanted to see.
