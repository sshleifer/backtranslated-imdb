I really wonder why this movie was ever made. A Bulgarian-Italian co-production in a version of Berlin where all Germans speak English with a German accent and speak all the Turks with a few Turkish words is hardly credible. The English vocabulary is basically limited to "fuck you, bastard" and the acting is worse than anyone can imagine. In addition, racial tensions in Germany can be an interesting subject, but in Germany I know there are no gangs in the middle of the street shooting in clear daylight. And if all is not enough, there is also a serial killer killing Turkish children and painting them white. To create excitement, we see the serial killer and he hears hum Schubert's lullaby, but we won't see his face. <br /> <br /> I don't even believe they actually shot it in Germany. There are a few street shots that are of course in Berlin, but the actors are not seen in that shot. This is probably Bulgaria with a few German signs being added here and there.
