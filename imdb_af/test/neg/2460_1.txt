A lot of medical student yuppies come together in their spare time to connect and die to each other on the electrical cables. Then they stand to kill the time before the brain, then start CPR and heart massage and bring each other back to life. The fact that Julia Roberts was in this movie must say it all. FLATLINERS are like group GHOST. Everyone wants to see their dead family and visit their old dead friends. So, the better to do this than a lot of medical students. You will kill you for five minutes and then bring you back. The rest of the movie has the predictable relationship issues, plus the predictable "GIVE MAYBE, IF we kill everybody else, one of these one will stay dead?" D'OH !!! This movie should be called BRAIN DEAD. The fact that the characters are portrayed as medical students has made me wonder if they went to a foreign correspondence school to get their degrees. The only thing that kept this film from a total laugh was that they not only put their fingers into electrical outlets to die. This movie would have been a big THREE STOOGES comedy movie.
