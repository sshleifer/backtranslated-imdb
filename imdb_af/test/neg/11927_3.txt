The MTV sci-fi animated series "Ã†on Flux" is brought to life with Charlize Theron who plays the title character, a freedom fighter who fights in the walled city of Bregna, 400 hundred years in the future. For her latest mission, she was sent to kill the city's leader Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas), but she discovered secrets along the way. <br /> <br /> Aeon Flux falls under the good premium, mediocre category. Interesting story, but the movie was a bit dull. Many people say it's one of the worst movies of the year and it's not true at all. It may be a disappointing movie, but it's at best an average movie. I have never seen the cartoon version of the movie, so I can't compare the two. This is probably better because they have the chance to explain the story more. The film is not so confusing, but it's easy to get lost if you're not familiar with the material. The acting was good, nothing special. Charlize Theron gives a good performance and is dedicated to the film. The rest of the film also gives decent performances such as Jonny Lee Miller, Frances McDormand and Marton Csokas. There are also some interesting characters in the movie, including Sithandra, Aeon's friend. <br /> <br /> The problem with Aeon Flux is that it's too serious. It carries the same ceremony throughout the film and it gets a little tired. There is no humor and the movie is sometimes a bit boring. This is the same problem that Elektra had. Because the movie is so serious, the dialogue sounds cheesy and the serious scenes seem to be forced. The action scenes are pretty good, but that's not what the movie really is about, so don't expect an action movie. The turn at the end is not caring, but it is still a nice ending and better than other exciters that have come out over the past year (Hide and Seek). The costumes are a bit strange, but look rather nice and interesting. The footage is also well done so the movie looks good. So, the movie can be a case of style over fabric. Interesting to look at, but don't keep your attention for a very long time. In the end, it's not the best movie out there, but it can be a decent rental. Rating 4/10
