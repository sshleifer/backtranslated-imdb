I just came back from see, "Comedian". This was ... good. It looked me on the screen. It's just not the kind of thing I want to pay. $ 7 to see. <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong, it will make a good HBO feature. If it was something I watched on TV, I'd be beaten. It gives a great look at which comics go before and after the scene. It will be of interest to anyone who looks at comics. <br /> <br /> But if I go to the movie, I am entertained. I'm not there to be educated. Now I know what Jerry Seinfeld looks like before going on stage .... big. But honestly, I'd rather just laugh at his jokes than worry about it. <br /> <br /> One more thing: With the bad attitude that Onry Adams has; I'll expect him to take my order from Burger King before I see his HBO specialist. He wasn't funny. He is the kind of person you like to hate.
