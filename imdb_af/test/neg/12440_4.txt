If you liked William Hickey of "Prizzi's Honor", he relives his character, like Don Anthony in "Mob Boss". It is a very poor "Godfather" satire with little laughter. Stuart Whitman looks surprised at what he's doing in this shock party? Morgan Fairchild's performance is one of the better efforts in the movie, and that alone is not a good sign for sure. Eddie Deezen vacillates between "Three Stooges" slapstick and a bad Woody Allen simulation. Poorly flawed, "Mob Boss" is so distracted that boredom quickly overcomes comedy, and the movie goes on with car jackets, hidden weapons in a restaurant bathroom and many other nonsense. - NOTE
