Just an hour ago I finished watching my friends. As fans of Dragonball, we think this movie is so bad that it's good. We will say one thing: without a six-pack beer, there is now way you can survive through this movie. This movie has to be watched by some Dragonball fans to slash their hole. The best character in the movie is Mr. Horn, his makeup, his laugh and behavior crate the unforgettable experience. What we liked in this movie was the fact that the island of Turtle Man was the same as in the cartoon version. We believe that the only character similar to the one in the cartoon is the Turtle Man. He is also a sex maniac and kind of idiot.
