I really wanted this movie. The second film in the series became stupid, felt in film, it was fun (of course, I was drunk too). I watched this movie with the highest expectation of a similar experience of high-key cinema, a-la-Mystery Science Theater 3000. I was wrong !!!!! This movie is a god horrible waste of movie, and I had the second one !! From the slight villain with the David Bowie horror wedge, to the tough, petty female villain with laughter that could break the paint of a car door, this whole thing was just a painful mess. I actually felt bad for Sue Price because the material was under an actress of her stature (it says pretty much everything). A terrible, horrible movie (it's not a recommendation).
