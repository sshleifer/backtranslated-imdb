A movie about a French girl raped by street cheaters. The rape scene itself was shot in all its greedy details with all the male and female organs and their interactions clearly visible to the camera. In a rage, the victim took her friend (or was it brother?) Rifle, grabbed him, and shot off the gun. She meets this prostitute who has just seen her pimp shot, they team up and go down to Paris. A series of crazy, meaningless and wild murders follow, the girls look more than any one who enjoys every murder. One poor man is shot in the **** hole. There are good doses of sex that are thrown between the many murders. <br /> <br /> The movie is not the most violent thing I saw, I would say that Private Ryan Savings probably had more violence. If violence is what you are looking for, then there are many other movies out there. And if it's sex you're ready for, then I will suggest one of those XXX's. <br /> <br /> I went to see the movie because of all the hype the media gave it. The movie itself is not a big problem, just a lot of violence and sex shooting with something like a hand camera. I was surprised that this movie is 15 years old in Sweden. If 15 year olds can watch this movie, they should also be able to watch XXX movies.
