First, I saw another reviewer, said this movie was fantastic. Well, nothing can come out of the truth! This movie is complete rubbish !!! A moronic horror comedy that is not even funny !! Do not mean that it is so bad that it is good, because it is not. It's a total waste of time and money! <br /> <br /> Here's what I see in wasting a DVD. A group of friends come along after a weekend, get drunk and then decide to make a backyard video. They grab Mom and Dad's video camera and start to spot scenes. They all get a big kick to look at the camera themselves. Their figure, if they think it's funny, everyone will think it's funny. Well, they're wrong. This backyard home video is garbage. The acting and comedic gore effects are common, but I think this is to be expected as it is nothing more than a home video. <br /> <br /> On the bright side I think the fact that this crap came out gives hope to anyone out there who wants to make a movie. If these people can make their movies and be released on DVD, anyone can! <br /> <br /> 0/10 - Save your money.
