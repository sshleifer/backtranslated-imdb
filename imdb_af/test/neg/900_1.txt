I don't know what the creators of this movie tried to reach or say, but they struggled badly on whatever it was. Unless of course the object was to completely confuse the viewer. I watched this movie just because Drew Barrymore was in it, and it turned out she had a smaller than small cameo in it. The whole idea of ​​letting this kid go on a wild car trip to win a huge cash prize from a petrol station and meet with all sorts of wackos is completely ridiculous.
