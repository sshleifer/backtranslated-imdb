First of all, let me make it clear. This movie is a real piece of garbage, but even though it's a piece of garbage, it's a better piece of garbage than it could have been. It could have sucked much time, but it didn't ... <br /> <br /> What this movie didn't have, for example, was terrifying moments, good acting and good writing. It wasn't very entertaining either. But the movie had cool music, fancy places and hot girls. It also works well like a Dracula spoof. (hope it was so meant, but I don't think so) <br /> <br /> The story focuses on three girls in Transylvania, waking up an old vampire, terrorizing and killing the girls one by one. Sounds familiar? Yes, so do! <br /> <br /> After reading it, you may think I should have voted better. The reason I'm not doing is because I almost fell asleep ...
