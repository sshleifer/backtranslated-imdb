Sure, I like some indie movies. Very, actually. I don't always understand them, and that's good. Not everyone was meant to be understood, especially by mainstream people like me. I'm probably showing my ignorance, but I'm still amazed at why 'Book of Revelation' is called it. I love the world stories and the only thing I could see at the end of the world, and this movie was the torture it took to get it through. I'm not talking about the subject; Perhaps I was muted by all the other torture / porn I saw. It was just the incredibly slow story, one hour and 15 minutes stretched for almost two hours. (Large spoilers are ahead). Hetero-man dancer is kidnapped, seduced and raped six ways, or in this case 12 days, by three women with a haircut. After his release, his rare dancer / girlfriend barely falls (except for dropping a glass) after wondering what she had missed: the cigarette she or she had originally sent for kidnapping. Still in a state of reasonable shock, he refuses to speak, and she goes to work without much hugs as if nothing has happened and he takes a much needed shower. Problem. As much as he is tormented by the flashbacks to his, oh "attacks," he is just as equal. Granted, I'm not bound and used as a play, but I doubt if I'm really "in the mood." Oh, I forgot, and how did he try to solve this crime? Sleep with as many women as he can to try to see the birthdays or tats that the criminals had. I see where they are going? shows a gang rape of the male POV. Well, despite doubt, you can never feel this guy. Only saving grace was the good performance of the LifetimeTV Dancer / Cancer Instructor. But even she couldn't save the movie.
