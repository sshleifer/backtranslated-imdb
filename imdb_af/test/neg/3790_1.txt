I think I've finally seen the worst movie ever, and it hurts me to say it. As a big fan of indie cinema, gay or otherwise, I had great hope. However, a few minutes in the movie, the sheriff appeared and voted for the worst actor of this or any other century. His performance, and the dialogue he was forced to perform, caused me the unusual step of stopping the DVD in his orbit. Hours later, when I had enough courage to push the play button again, it wasn't any better. <br /> <br /> Apart from the sheriff and his cartoon racist delegates, the film has an attractive role to which I really felt sympathy because they had such an unfortunate writing. The idea behind the film is fine. Use linework from gay men in the "New South" in the same way as it was used on black men in the old south, leaving "strange fruit" hanging from the trees. <br /> <br /> With a full-fledged author and director, we might have had a movie. Instead, we find false detectives, platitudes about homosexuality, and a clich√© with the one good white man trying to save the day. <br /> <br /> I have no doubt that racism is still flourishing. The FBI is currently investigating a white school bus driver in the backyard of Louisana who forced the black children to get in the back of the bus. But this town is a cartoon, and it's hard to believe anything you see or hear. <br /> <br /> There are a few subplots in a poor attempt to make the main character more three-dimensional, but for <br /> <br /> For the truly masochistic, the DVD contains some removed scenes that will let you go for cover. <br /> <br /> This is probably the first movie that makes me believe that writers / directors must pass a test and be licensed before they can make a movie. Although I look forward to seeing various role-players in better movies, I would find it hard to see anything else from this director.
