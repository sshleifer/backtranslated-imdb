It appeared on a DVD that a friend bought from me. They listed it as "The Savage Guns" which was a completely different movie. Obviously the people who packed the DVD never bothered to look at what they were burning on the disk. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is about as bad as they come. The soundtrack is a combination TV Batman / Early James Bond / Spaghetti Western. Many galloping for this music. It seems the man has to gallop between scenes to burn some time and do the soundtrack to people. <br /> <br /> English is called Italian and it really shows. I wish it was just a little worse and then it would have had some of the camp's feelings of the Ed Wood movies. As it is, it's just awful.
