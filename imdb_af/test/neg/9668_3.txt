Visually, this movie is interesting. Light is literally thrown in a way, along with cinematography and an enticing introduction to the titles, which had my hope at the beginning, but then - a b-movie is a b-movie is a b-movie No matter how much spectacle is seen. This film surrounds Albert Fish's life, one of the best-known series killers in the world. Active around the beginning of the 20th century, Viss's life was hastily and vaguely treated before he started killing children at an older age. This film is based on two tracks: Fish's life and that of William F. King, chief investigator of the case. What saves this movie to become a Hallmark spectacle and debacle of the ordinary kind, when movies about serial killers are the direction, which is a two-edged sword; director Scott L. Flynn focuses enough on the b-actors not to make their mistakes shine, but at the same time they have created a really dull and stereotypical view of US police through the King's corner. Sure enough, he has thoroughly considered Fish's encounter with Grace Budd, the 10-year-old girl he killed, although I'm not really sure her mother is the media-crazy person Flynn really tries to emphasize that she was. I miss more psychological diving in Fish, not to mention the very little time spent on Fish's catch. All in all, interesting for those who are in serial killers, but mostly a deviation; But if the director makes another movie about another serial killer, I will definitely see it in the hope that the holes have been picked up.
