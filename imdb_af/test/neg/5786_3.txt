Top rifle without internal hostility. Or class. Or money. Or Cruise. An excuse for an upward mobile cast of next-great actors to market their ability to lead a matinee doesn't really have anything anyone can get their teeth on. It is a pity that Charlie Sheen's opening shot opens with a big promise that is almost thrown out with a deadly wedding piece. Barking. <br /> <br /> Dennis Haysbert is a variable actor for me, but in this movie he is good, especially the action series. Michael Biehn is a first-class action hero, but not a leading man. Charlie Sheen is the leading man for all purposes, but never an action hero. There is a stunt throw of hundreds that is also noteworthy. 10/03
