OK, only there can be a SPOILER here, as I don't know what to do with too much information. My beauty says it's all, but surely, people will want to know why it's so stupid. <br /> <br /> First, this movie follows a bunch of Yuppies as they go to a sports match in Chicago. wrong exit and liquidation in the ghetto. Scary, huh? Well, first of all Emilio drives everyone in the world's remaining RV / Winnebago, with a satellite dish and cut like that. So, these guys are going to a sports game (I forget which, probably the Bulls or the White Sox, as they are near the cute ghetto), but they can't even ride it on the highway without an ESPN boarding command to shame. Yet they are smart enough to earn living things that will pay for the stuff, but are such sports fans that they do not even know what exit they should leave, on the way to the game they love so much. <br /> <br /> I gave up the movie within half an hour, but the reasons were plentiful. They arrive in the GHETTO, but their biggest danger to their existence is DENIS LEARY. A WHITE GUY. I'm not racist, but come on. In anything RESEMBLING reality - and this movie is trying to be an urban nightmare - Denis Leary doesn't want to kill Emilio Estevez, he'll take a ride to get the f *** out of Dodge himself !!! /> <br /> It's easily one of the stupidest movies ever created, although I don't know much about the rest of the world's theater. If MST3K was still on, they would certainly have dedicated an episode to this one.
