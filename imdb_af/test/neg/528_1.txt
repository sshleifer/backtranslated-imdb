I wasted 35 minutes of my life on this turkey before giving up. The main character is completely clueless and amazingly unsympathetic, but there is no humor in his blunder. As soon as he arrives in Germany, the author draws the old "there is only one room in the hotel, you have to share a room with a nice girl" stunt. Come on, at least you can let them develop their relationship. See how one has done it to see how to do it right - or any of a thousand movies ever since. <br /> <br /> The acting is consistently second-rate, and the improvised dialogue must be left on the dressing room floor. This does not lead to any plans, despite the fact that the film telegraphs the destination's destination from the moment Greta is launched. <br /> <br /> The first song in the board is soft but sang. The rest of the songs (well, to be honest, I just heard those in the first half hour) are just useless and awful. Most of the singers are painful from the mouth, but not deliberately humorous.
