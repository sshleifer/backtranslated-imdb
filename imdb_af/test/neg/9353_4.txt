I saw this movie on Cable in 1956 and again a few days ago. The movie didn't improve with age. On the contrary, the opposite. It's a real spaghetti epic. <br /> <br /> The Trojans are heroic and fun; the Greeks are nasty, small and ugly. <br /> <br /> So, if Paris ran away with the king's wife? Hey ... love is love.
