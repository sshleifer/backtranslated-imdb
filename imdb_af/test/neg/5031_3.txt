I have not made great assumptions about the fact that it was certainly a very, very free adjustment to the work of Eça de Queiroz, and I have to say that this free adjustment forms the book as very good ideas and characters. The problem is the way it is done, without any care, without any taste, just a rumbling of bad taste clusters everywhere. The writing is so fake and the characters that are so unreal are that it makes a spicy spectacular actor like Unas, Bryner, Morgado, Lagarto and others, in a net of everything but theater or storytelling. To my surprise, newcomers Jorge Corrula and Soraia Chaves are brave in their performances, but you can see them like a driven boat without any direction. And talking about direction, does it seem to miss something completely on this movie? Where's the Director? Everything is bad taste; The frames are whatever, and when using the handheld camera without any motivated reason exists the light design that builds up environments (and no excuses that the whole point is a dark true story). The problem generally in this "trying" film is that it is no taste, or very, very bad taste. It is sad to see that Jorge and Soraia, in such fake and gratifying, use sex scenes, painted here and there, by using the film as closing narratives or as fakes transition motifs. Perhaps Carlos Coelho da Silva should see the 2002 Carlos Carrera adaptation of the same book Eça and get the felling of how to build a real movie.
