Incredible that such a thing could be found to be viewed by the public. I knew it was through Uwe Boll, and I found it in the bargain at a store for $ 2 (still very much taken into account), but the morbid curiosity led me to see it and: <br / > <br /> 1). I'm pretty sure it's a rip-off of Seven, Silence of the Lambs, and American Psycho, all rolled into one, with a dialogue that could possibly be written by preteens. <br /> <br /> 2). Casper Van Dien plays the main character, and he is so absolutely bizarre and creepy that almost everyone knows he must be the crazy serial killer. <br /> <br /> 3). Jennifer Rubin plays the "good policeman" who invites a serial killer to her apartment for a homemade meal, and what does she get for her trouble? I'll make you guess. <br /> <br /> 4). Michael Pare plays an "intense" cop, driving a VW Bug, a new style, with a siren on it. A VW Bug ... it will hit fear in the criminal's heart when they see the next. <br /> <br /> 5). Van Dien breaks off his fianc√©e, but she still has a "not engaged" party, complete with "not a wedding cake". Imagine everyone's surprise that he appears (of course he was invited) and they are all shot. <br /> <br /> 6). Actually, it had to be # 1. The killer in this is known as "The Monkey Maker". This is undoubtedly the stupidest killer's name that anyone could emerge in a million years. Presumably it has something to do with the "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil" and say, complete with monkeys. It is possible that monkeys also had something with the writing. <br /> <br /> 7). Oh, and there's a club that visits Van Dien near the start of the movie. There is bad disco music, I mean, really bad, and a chain link fenced in cage, gang members who split the shit with baseball bats? That's how it looked. And of course, it's just the tip of the iceberg, the very cool things (?!) Continue in the basement, where a dubious "actor" speaks some women to sign a confession before they are shot, that is, I think, a sniff? Not quite sure how it fits the rest of the movie, and Boll probably wasn't, so if he wasn't worried then I wouldn't worry. <br /> <br /> An incredible piece of entertainment that makes you feel something of a parallel universe. A parallel universe that looks like ours, but where things are just enough where they don't look right. You entered the "Boll Zone". Get out as soon as possible and don't look back. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
