I was told about this movie by a friend who saw it late at night. He told me it was so bad I had to see it! So I went to an auction site and bought the movie. It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. It makes you laugh if it really doesn't have to. Terrible acting and horrible storyline. Plus, he doesn't look like Michael Jackson !! <br /> <br /> I recommend buying this movie as one of the funniest things you'll ever see. Van Peebles is a joke in this movie. <br /> <br /> Robots can't bluff ... PSYCHE! <br /> <br /> I have to say though the special effects are really great ... PSYCHE! DVDs were probably even out when this movie came out, but if I could find my way, it would be straight for VHS release. Yes, it's so bad!
