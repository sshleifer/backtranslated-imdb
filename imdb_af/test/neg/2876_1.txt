For me, Bollywood movies are generally not too much, although they are still very willing and Bollywood is a great file maker as they have their own fans. <br /> <br /> The only motive that showed me was to see to what extent an American actress can change or influence the logic on which Indian film is based. Not only did it not change the film story, but this mix also caused some ridiculous series of events. <br /> <br /> I think it's very common to see many illogical things through Indian movies, as they are their own world in their movies. But as soon as you see such incidents with an American, it makes you laugh. For the sake of God you can believe that a well-known American actress is trapped in desperate circumstances and feels impotent. Can you imagine that an American actress falls in love with a dance instructor whose fianc√© has already fallen in love with the American boy friend and met them at the same time. There were many similar things to mention. the less said the better. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I was wrong if I expected too much of Indian movies.
