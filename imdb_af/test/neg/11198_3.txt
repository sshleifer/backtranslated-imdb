I went to Crooked Earth to see a piece of New Zealand. What I found was a badly written and poorly performed echo of the people I know. <br /> <br /> Great moments between characters ?? including many of Temuera Morrison and Lawrences Makoares scenes together? It is often ruined by long-standing monologues that the actors are forced to stumble. Beautiful and bad phrases particularly deterred Lawrence as if he were the new Maori Messiah at his pulpit of beer cats. <br /> <br /> Looking at any movie with Maori actors, I found that I can always choose half a dozen characters to remind me of someone in my life. With Crooked Earth I struggled to find one key character that made the whole two hours true. Most ?? including Wiremu and Peka ?? stop saying or doing things that I didn't understand and couldn't connect. By the end of the movie, the author managed to alienate the audience where the Maori could not tolerate it and the Pakeha got a license to dismiss it. My feeling is that the movies message ?? or at least the head of a few who had been swollen to the audience? is important enough to prevent the use of character extremities. Unfortunately, no one who read the script before it was filmed thought to surrender this advice. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was intrusive, and as annoying as the horrible bing-bong sound they caught on "Eyes Wide Shut". The audience was not so subtly automatic to laugh, cry or be angry when the music changed. It reminded me of Darth Vader's access music in Star Wars: obvious and almost amusing. <br /> <br /> I think there are a few people out there who can enjoy this movie. It's funny in parts, has a good amount of action and has very powerful scenes. Calvin Tuteao and Quentin Hita also hit work. As a whole, however, I did not enjoy the experience as much as I know. Barb Wire, Speed ​​2, The Island Dr Moreau and Crooked Earth look like they're going to be, Tem's quartet of crap.
