Just saw it last night and said it bluntly: "Style instead of dust". We can guess that there is much more to Jerry Lee Lewis than is portrayed here. The character of Jerry Lee Lewis in this movie is not represented as a real person for one minute, but again the other characters are only one pencil stroke of total characters. <br /> <br /> Let's get started. We see Jerry Lee and his cousin Jimmy Swaggart watching the black jazz club and we see Jerry getting his inspiration. May be possible. We see how the two cousins ​​choose different paths in life (also possible). Then we cut to Jerry Lee who plays the piano as an adult (now played by Dennis Quaid) and it is exciting and a bit scary. Cut to a scene where he first met his second cousin, Myra. From then on, the whole thing makes an overview of certain events that come out in a style that contains a high-speed news roll. <br /> <br /> Not that the movie is a bit entertaining and it's nice to hear new versions. of the songs Jerry Lee made. Alec Baldwin as Jimmy Swaggart is also a reason why you should at least take a look at this, an indication of his greater success in the years to come. Winona Ryder and Myra are the most notable characters in the movie. His plague, she sobs, she throws gums and plays cookies and that's about it. There is never a reason for a moment why she eventually became the third wife. Lewis became and talked about women, where are the first two? That's why it can't really be classified as a biopsy, but more of an inaccurate news rule. We see Jerry playing his first song on the radio, we see his second one going in the top ten, we see his third go to no. 1 and so on. Then comes the inevitable downfall. Absolutely, no basis in fact. <br /> <br /> To close another small quarrel: The movie takes place from '56 to '58 and still Myra says, 'I'm just 13' to the end.
