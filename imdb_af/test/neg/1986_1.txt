It's one of the worst movies I've seen for a while. <br /> <br /> The problem is that it is not an intelligent political film, "artistic" or an exercise is erotic. As a result, it fails on all accounts. <br /> <br /> The play is horrible, the narrative of sitting and the supposed symbolism is useless. <br /> <br /> Klaus Kinski is probably the best aspect of this movie. But this is not a good thing. Certainly, he has an intense and 'unique' appearance, but ultimately he can't actually act. Just look at how he responds when his mistress leaves ... <br /> <br /> Don't really look at this movie, some say it should repeat it. I say one is too much.
