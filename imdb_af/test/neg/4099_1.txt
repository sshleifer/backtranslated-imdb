This picture is a bad and bloated coaching of the Michael Pohl short film EXTINCT from 1995. While Michael Pohl's idea was original and perfect for a short film environment, a sound of Thunder's plot was poorly adapted from Pohl's story and not suitable for a full-length feature film that one would expect from a large Hollywod studio. The tragic flood situation that destroyed the sets in Prague was in this case just a bad link in a long rusty movie chain. For a studio to release such a product, it's a pity. Especially for Warner Brothers, a studio that broke new effects grounds with shows like BABYLON 5 in 1993. TELEVISION. Visual effects for television programs that outbreak BIO in episodic television in the mid-nineties were more sophisticated than what was brought to the screen on this screen. In such cases, sad as it may be, the movie can.
