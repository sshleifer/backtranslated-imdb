A group of young adults refugees open to the spirit of Elizabeth Bathory when they repeat her poem from a video game that presumably represents a serenity. The only one dying in the game is Miller (Adam Goldberg) who is also found dead as he died in the video game. While the others' characters did not die in the video game, they repeated their poem, but the video game was in fact unleashed with the run of CGI characters, killing and killing each one by one. They have to follow certain methods by using a mirror and nails to defeat Bathory and save their skin. <br /> <br /> If this assumption sounds silly, it's because it's. The characters are rejected from bad World Cup television shows, this time the profanity may be voiced. This movie follows the shooting rules, but does not show much violence or gore. It remains PG-13 safe with most of the death occurring outside the screen. There is a scene where the real hero and heroine run out of video game characters they follow. Yes, it's so bad. Nothing to recommend. Good views, including Sophia Bush as the appropriate October name.
