OK, so I cool in my room when mother knocks on the door. I open the door and what do I see in her hands? "SLEEPY HOLLOW HIGH". I think it should be an older horror movie, because there is now someone who can be stupid enough to name a movie that played The Blockbuster 'Sleepy Hollow' with Johnny Depp. But to my surprise, the movie is at least two years older than the original. This alone had to stop me from doing so in the V.C. to place. But no, I had to take a chance, I had to believe that this movie could have a little ray of hope. Little did I know that the rays where no where to see are. <br /> <br /> Number one, the story line is so ridiculous that it's probably true in a bump town. Two, the actors look more like people real life people who just happened to wonder at the set when the director shouted. Three, about any movie that is directing, is always terrible. But the funny thing is that it's another movie directed by Kevin Summerfield. I went to rely on his movie to bring me to the floor with the split of the laugh. <br /> <br /> Where do I start with this movie? I know, let's start with the jogger in the forest. The camera lighting was so bad I was led to believe that the jogger was silent and the camera man ran. I love how the woman stops to eat a candy. I mean it's just about dark, or just about the light, which can tell the camera with relief. And she stops eating a delicious pastry, I mean a CANDY BAR WHAT THE HELL. So she eventually becomes the first victim of stupidity, and even though I'm ready to break the band, the director finds his little hands on fire. <br /> <br /> Nowhere are some guys trying to fix it. a car that has probably been broken for years. Then comes the false Mack 10 and a very real prostitute, which is part of our main charter. <br /> <br /> The part of the movie is about a group of children who are all in trouble. And get the choice to pick up garbage in the Sleepy Hollow Park or face suspension forever. One of the teachers (E.K. Kevin Summfield) was sent in the bush to look after them and make sure everything goes according to plan. The funniest thing is how undeveloped the charter really is. I mean who's with the fake Mack 10-man and who ever heard of Hacker trying to kill himself. And some how one of the students had a relationship with the teacher Mr. E, before all this community service crap even came up. Yet the school still thought it was a cool idea to let him go. There is also one student named J, whose purpose in the movie is to keep out annoying, where the audience is trying to jump, when everything he really does contributes to the cheapest of the film. The sound was so terrible in this movie. I mean there was one seen when two guys were fighting, and the man hit the other guy in the stomach, and from the T.V. This sound effect comes as if someone is bumping an old wooden box. It started terribly and became dangerous, even my taste. I would say, the music in the background made the scenes look tolerant. But not so tolerant. My conclusion is if you want to go to another movie that Kevin Summfield has taken seriously. Sleepy Hollow High. <br /> <br /> PS, I'm still thinking of shooting myself to remove the images of the fake Mack. R&D DIRECTORY |
