4 realz boy my game iz crazy tietie i can't wait 2 come on it's wise and roll in da club n do it really 905 style white crazy models n bottles, boy! No, I'm just joking. It is a sad show, created by, and for the enjoyment of sad men. Men who are so manipulated by modern life that they send out their frustration in the clubs, where they prey on self-validation on chicks, hoping to touch their little friends to try and drown the sting of loneliness and they to feel like just for one night, as if their seat on the Toronto Worsfees Council was a bit less permanent. <br /> <br /> I read a few comments on this and say that this show represents the Canadian TVs, which is ultimately aware of American TV or something else. Well, it does not strive at all. It's like, yes! Fit yourself back, Canada - you've finally cracked the elusive formula for such groundbreaking American content as "Studs", "Change of Heart", "Elimidate" and "The Fifth Wheel". See, the real brainchild here is a "Candidate Camera" on the side. Genie. And there's nothing beyond the thin line between fratboy camaraderie and latent homosexuality like a group of grown men tapping each other on a hidden camera and admiring each other's "game" in the club. The man-love shown here is so tangible. They really should consider re-ordering it 'Keys to the Steam Bath'. <br /> <br /> On a side note, how interesting it is that the people who gave this show seem to be such glowing reviews for registering an IMDb account for the express purpose of doing so (I think is guilty of using the same way to do the opposite here.) My personal favorite is the one enthusiastic reviewer who claims that he from the United States who thinks "Now it is clear that the talent in Canada has the ability to make American quality television. " <br /> <br /> Happy. <br /> <br /> But why even save online buzz? You Can't Really Be Canceled - You Are On The Comedy Network In Canada, Baby! The viewing public will ignore your performance the following year. In all likelihood, you'll just be fine, with ease over the proverbial level of mediocrity with most of the Comedy Network's original programming.
