A renowned NY lawyer (George Segal) is slowly going crazy. He promised his father on his deathbed that he would never send their senile mother (Ruth Gordon) to a nursing home. Years later, he provides a senile, dangerous psychopath. He meets a beautiful nurse (Trish Van Devere) and they fall in love. But his mother scared her. Segal is ready to kill her. <br /> <br /> Ummmm ... THIS is a comedy? I have nothing against sick, black humor, but come on ... there must be restrictions! This movie goes out of its way to throw every tasteless sick joke he can think of and rub your face into it. Sorry, none of the jokes is funny. The jokes include rape, nudity, public humiliation, senile old people, curse and racism. Actually, it's a movie that thinks it's smart to shock people and think they'll laugh at them. I was disgusting and didn't even laugh. The film is melancholy, disturbing and (surprisingly) boring. The throw is the only thing that made me look. Segal and Gordon were both wonderful in their roles - especially Gordon. And Van Devere is also pretty good. But the writing is against them. The only interesting thing (not funny) was a senseless courtroom scene with Rob Reiner Jr. (and trying to see his then wife, Penny Marshall as spectator). <br /> <br /> Actually, this movie could be worse - The original end got Segal in bed with his mother and thought he was puppy! It was (thankful) changed. <br /> <br /> A real, bad, sick movie. Bottom of the walk. I give it a 1.
