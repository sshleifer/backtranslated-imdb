"Tragic Hero" is a film that definitely tries to emulate the classic Godfather films, focusing on family, crime, loyalty and revenge. It is also part of a two-part series such as The Godfather was also (then). However, this film is nowhere near the level of those classic films and actual festivals worse than other Triad thrillers released in Hong Kong at the time. <br /> <br /> One reason is the play. With the exception of Chow Yun Fat, the play is usually over the top and incredible. The audience tends to find the performances humorous simply because the actors' inability to maintain some degree of seriousness. As a result, we do not find the film really emotionally involved or intense, as we do not particularly care about what happens to these characters. <br /> <br /> Another reason is the lack of focus. The story tries to capture many different story elements in the movie, but it causes parts of the movie to be underdeveloped and there is no real coherence. The audience sometimes gets lost at the proceedings we see, without knowing what the character's motivation is. <br /> <br /> The movie's climax contains a decent rifle battle, but again because we don't care about the characters, we don't care who lives or dies; The scene loses it due to intensity and tension. The other action pieces are quite commonplace, with the feeling that it is controlled rather than free flow. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a strictly average movie and is not recommended for the general film. viewer ... Only hard core genre lovers and fans of Chow Yun Fat should see this movie to watch.
