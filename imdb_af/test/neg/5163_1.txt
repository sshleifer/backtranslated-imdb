What was the purpose here ... I started watching, but then I realized that it had no purpose ... poor acting ... no action and no story .. I finally listened to it while navigating the web read about David Beckham's $ 250 million US football Galaxy contract. Don't borrow it. Don't borrow this. Not a drawer. I saw so many movies that I could feel it was going to be naked. <br /> <br /> War movies must be accurate. and if possible, have some artistic merit and not actually Christian melodrama. This movie flashes compared to any I've seen before. I must say that Iam is really disappointed with this movie.
