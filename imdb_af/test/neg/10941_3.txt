Oh, my goodness. I would never have thought it was possible for me to see a player who is worse than Household Disorder soon, but here it is. Armed with rotten plot, horrible editing, stationary acting, and headache-inducing 'style' (sorry, I have no other words on it), Sanctimony is the kind of movie that forces you to evaluate an entire genre; That is, this movie is so bad that even the thrillers I condemn as complete failures look a little better. <br /> <br /> Now, not only Sanctimony is a terrible movie in itself, but also the tough task of ripping better movies and doing a pathetic job with it. From the main titles - nothing but a blatant attempt to reproduce those from Se7en - I was under the impression that something had failed. As soon as the movie started with a series of cricket-like, will-be-hip cuts full of stingy images and bustling colors, I knew where that smell came from. <br /> <br /> It appears that two policemen, or police officer Jim Renart (Michael Par√©) and policeman Dorothy Smith (Jennifer Rubin), are investigating a murderer in Vancouver. A serial killer known as "Monkey Killer" (which is a threatening, cold nickname, uh?) For his work, killed a whole lot of people. You see, this nut work believes after the saying "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil" and cut eyes, ears and tongues from its victims. So far six eyes, six ears and three tongues. In a very ingenious way, Renart and Smith find that the Monkey Killer is likely to kill another three people. Well, because he certainly wants to finish the number 666. So suddenly, the film focuses on Tom Gerrick (Casper Van Dien), a young, successful, beautiful businessman, with a terrible temper. And that's where American Psycho coaching kicks. <br /> <br /> We follow the lives of the two police officers and the young psychopath. Not one of them is at least interesting until they finally meet. Along the way there, a disco where Renart continually fails Gerrick, we offer one of the funniest scenes in the recent reminder: Renart goes to the back of the disco club because ... well, just because the script tells us it's " a suspect place; Then, with a single bump in the stomach, Renard gets rid of a big guard that blocks the road and the guard is never heard again? Anyway, because of another murder, Gerrick was named a witness, but Smith and especially Renart immediately suspected he could be the killer. In the typical Basic Instinct mode, Smith gets dates with the young businessman, assuming she can discover his true identity. <br /> <br /> I won't spoil the end, but it's simply an embarrassment. ; there are contradictions, some plot holes, issues that are never resolved, and especially there is one last scene where a cruel mass murder, which must be shocking and sad, as such laughs excessively and stupidly that I really can't imagine how anyone don't laugh about it. <br /> <br /> At 87 minutes, Sanctimony really pushes it. You never care for a single character, because they are all so flat (not boring) that you know exactly who is the first time you meet them. You are never dragged into the story, because the screens are connected by poor plot devices when not fair and unnecessary. The actor ranges from average (Van Dien) to straight horrible (Rubin, and most of the supporting role); the music is uncomfortable generic techno, and photography is one of the worst things I've ever seen. Of course, like every fiasco of the genre, we are provided with some free nudity. <br /> <br /> 3/10
