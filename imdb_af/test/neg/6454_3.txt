Ugly heartless Hollywood shit expecting nothing but ugly and sad from his audience. The screens WITHOUT Spacey reveal how really the movie really is. But the screens WITH Spacey are just as entertaining as you keep up there. Yes, he can play this part in his sleep, but he does so well, he's so happy to look, so credible and amazingly monstrous. Enjoy it for its performances, but expect nothing else from this movie. If you want to watch a good movie about the horrors of modern Hollywood, check out Robert Altman's "The Player". This sad little pot boiler is not remote in the same league.
