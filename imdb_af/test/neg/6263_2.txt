Cheerleader Massacre was supposed to be the fourth installment of the Slumber Party Massacre series; If that's what they were doing (considering playing one actress from the original quizzes in a small cameo role), they failed and made the worst installment of the quadrilateral. . Cheerleader Massacre seamlessly combines bad acting, a horrible plot, a stupid offender, boring and boring deaths, boring scenery and spectacular camera work to make it one of the worst movies ever made. Did I mention how bad it was? Don't get me wrong: this cute and delayed excuse for a horror movie is nowhere as bad as Napoleon Dynamite, but it is undoubtedly a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Cheerleader Massacre is a precise polar opposite of the original Slumber Party Massacre. Stay away with all the meanings! This movie is utter garbage!
