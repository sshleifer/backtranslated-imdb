After I had more than a few friends, I suggested that I look at the foot of the Footsoldier, I finally got there last night. Undoubtedly, the story that Colton Leach has to tell (and did it in his autobiography) is a compelling story of a man climbing up from Terrace boat son to connected underworld villain. This film unfortunately struck in quality by dreadful, frightening actions and malicious acting. Ricci Harnett in the lead role of Leach does a reasonable job of transporting the transition from serious to serious criminals, but his accent is everywhere in the place. As his voice tells the story, it is something that drives my nuts after ten minutes. Terry Stone as Tony Tucker presented the unintentional comedy with a badly tailored wedge (or the worst Barnett) dialogue so staggering that it went on the youthful border and an evil line of delivery, which Tucker to parody. What bothered me most This film was that the events that led to the shooting in Rettenden, Essex and the forming years of Leach are of utmost importance to crime friends and supporters of soccer hooliganism, to have this story sabotaged by lack credible accent and acting, has left me. An opportunity was missed. Roland Manookian and Frank Harper only give the films a source of authenticity. On the positive side, some of the pacing and construction films flow well and pay attention. The violence was well choreographed, and apart from an over-reliance on projectile, red bread for blood splashes on the whole was realistic. If you enjoy the movie, it's worth finding out Essex Boys to tell a similar story of fictional views and also Billy Murray.
