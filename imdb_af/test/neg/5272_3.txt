Kevin Spacey is my favorite actor of all time, he is also undoubtedly on others' lists when it comes to big actors. He even pulled off a good Irish accent in Ordinary Decent Criminal. But Kevin Spacey, as a Mafia leader? Or even a burglar? I'm not so sure he could go that far. The movie for me just didn't make sense and the part of the story just didn't fix me. <br /> <br /> Once again I know that IMDb will make me write ten more lines. But I'm not so sure about what I could say about this movie, because I'm still trying to figure it out. Silly, isn't it? But I'm pretty sure more than a few of you IMDb users are in the same trouble as I am now, where you just want to say a line or two about a movie, but now you have to do ten rules? Wow, that must do it. : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
