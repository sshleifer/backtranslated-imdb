This story of Ted Brice, an American pilot who is the only survivor of the accident of an allied reconnaissance plane in Belgium in January 1944, is a lot of a mess. The title will make you think it's mainly a story about Belgian armed resistance groups, but it just seems to be a backdrop to addressing a stupid love story between Ted and Claire, the woman who enters Ted. Claire's husband Henri is a dedicated resistance member, but it is Claire who decides to give Ted refuge in Henri's absence and against his wishes. <br /> <br /> Important plot details don't make sense. Central to the story is the recycle of the recorder on the flat level that contains navigation codes and the positions of targets. But in the opening scene we see Belgians plundering the plane, resistance members among them. Why didn't they get the valued items at that time, instead of waiting for the Nazis to protect the plane? And the whole thing about Ted's transfer from the area was done using secret instructions and code words when the transaction could have been an easy exchange. The painful music tried, but failed, to give some weight to this clumsy business. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous part of the movie is how the love relationship between Ted and Claire develops. Initially, Claire is devoted to Ted's nursing back from near death and when Ted recovers, they are physically involved (while Henri is conveniently away from running a business of resistance). Julie Ormond does a pleasant job as Claire, but she influences a French accent that I often understood impossible. Her reaction was sometimes poor - when she told the story of the death of several townspeople, she responded as if she had just been told that the local groceries were peaches. As Ted, Bill Paxton just seems to offer his lines; his performance is so uninspired that it is embarrassing. A true American pilot can prove such a flat personality, but it doesn't make for convincing theater. I didn't feel any chemistry between these alleged lovers. <br /> <br /> The most idiotic thing is the way Ted and Claire act like lovers on holiday. Perhaps sexual release from such heavy situations is understandable, but being completely unaware of the seriousness of the situation is difficult to understand. For the first time, Ted is sent to a loft room and Claire worries about even coming into the house. But if things develop, he doesn't just come home, he's dancing with Claire for loud music, entering the adjacent barn to have a game of baseball with a local boy, and eventually going with Claire to a nearby town . br /> <br /> The young boy seems most dedicated to his role, but he is undermined by writing. He has an incredible ability to be on key events without being noticed. And when he lines like: <br /> <br /> "Have you ever seen someone hang up. They look like the dance, but they can't get the floor." <br /> <br /> You feel it's the scriptwriter who speaks and not a thirteen-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> And oh, there are scenes to show that the Nazis are pretty bad. guys. <br /> <br /> It compares this movie to the brilliant "As and Diamonds" about the Polish resistance, or the same stars "Lacombe, Lucien" about the French resistance, and realizes what a truly dishonest relationship is.
