.... so why on earth would I see 'sex life of the potato men'? Answer: Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook. Vegas I saw and enjoyed live alive. I think he is an intelligent and unique intellectual cartoon that manages to retain extreme oafishness. Crook I just know of probably the biggest comedy of the past 10 years with 'Alan Partridge', 'The Office'. Like Gareth, he was simply hilarious, and I was interested in how he would switch to another character on the big screen. <br /> <br /> OK. So I and the boyfriend went down to the plywood last night and the movie was very funny, just because the mediocre nonsense dialogue and banter, Ferris and Dave, provided the talent of Vegas and Crook with aplomb and enthusiasm. They're destined for better things (better done already infact) and I even believe Vegas would make a decent live actor. The tacit scenes where he says he misses his wife almost came closer to touching. Although the ** SPOILER ** was tied to the scene on the scene where it was taken back, it had to be extended, it just wasn't credible. And through the movie, Vegas just looks his wife 2 or 3 times. <br /> <br /> The movie has become largely unfriendly and is old, good, grotesque when sex is called. Not, I add, when it was shown on the screen. Tolly's free explanation of what was in his sandwiches and why it wasn't even funny and just made me feel a bit sick. Also completely unnecessary was the inclusion of the character of Jeremy who picked up his nose before pointing a close up of the thug at his finger. Only he chose his nose, would have raised a smile, he was a pathetic character and it would have made him look as low as possible, but the snot was not only necessary and was rank. <br /> <br /> One scene I thought was hilarious with sex, was Vegas in the threesome. His blue conversation with the second block just emphasized the fact that dreams always cause endless ecstasy. Not what I want to know <br /> <br /> It's about everything I can really say. I will end with this, and this is actually my main criticism of the film. It is supposed to revive the British film industry. It's not a Trainspotting that is certain. It's not even a "Love Actually" (you have to have a heart of stone not to throw on that one) and 3 million pounds can really be put into a better project. "Mike Basset England Manager" was a wonderful little-known British comedy and was made for less than 3 million. I just hope the BFC will learn from 'Sex Lives of the Potato Men' and not become so free in the future. Although the horrific reviews this movie gets, it only improves cash register awards. :-)
