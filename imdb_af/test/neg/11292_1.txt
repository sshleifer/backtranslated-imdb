The only reason I didn't fall asleep during this movie is because the seats were not so comfortable. Hannibal LIVE> USE> RENTAL AND RENTAL !!! This movie is just scary, not because of any violence or graphic mutilation. This is pretty straightforward. The story moves at the speed of a lazy snail. I have the feeling that director Ridley Scott just called this one. The actors are all fine, they just need straight. The music score is also very annoying. This is especially noticeable as there is so little in the film. It looks good, but it's not enough reason to see it. Incidentally, I mentioned the fact that it USED? <br /> <br />
