The main premise for this movie is every woman's fantasy: a vagina that kills and eats men. Well, that's at least a fantasy for every woman who ever had a fight against a man. What is 99,9999% of women? But don't worry, it's not a greedy kind of men's eating. It's more like a comical slurp in them, like a drain plug. There was no blood or parts left behind. So for blood, guts & gore fans, forget about this movie, not much gore here. <br /> <br /> The two main characters of the movie are somewhat unrealistic. Helen is a good girl who becomes a prostitute. Meanwhile, Dennis is a good guy who steals Helen. <br /> <br /> The story is a bit stupid at this point, but then they throw in two equally dull sub-stories that just send this movie into the bad. B-movie territory. The first new sub-story is about Dennis to find new love with some compound twins; and finally one of them killed and a fugitive bank robber. The second new sub-story is about Helen getting new love with a nice policeman who freed her from a prostitution-related bad date and decided to marry her. Dennis and Helen finally meet at the end of the movie in totally incredible circumstances, and magic is healing Helen's murderous vagina!
