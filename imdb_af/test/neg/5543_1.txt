Well, they made it a new pumpkin head film again, the first pumpkin head movie was perfect for his time, a stupid, greedy and cleaved monster movie. so know how it goes, someone loses their loved one, goes to the witch in the forest, gets her to collect pumpkin head and kill it. Unfortunately, the filmmakers considered it irrelevant to do something different, for the films fourth outing, which is much more appropriate to add a lame romeo and Juliet subplot, with an idiotic family error (about a car! !!!) and surprise a few spicy pumpkin toppings so far so formal, but it doesn't stop there. The acting talent in this movie is bad ... oh so bad, half of them can't even stop a southern accent. glide in their native and often posher accents. Lance Henrikssen is on board so sure that he would bring a few gravitas into the film proceedings ... but no lance just on the screen, let the words fall out of the mouth with absolutely no emotion or apparent direction, and walk off again , I honestly think he just turned up for the money, then went to his trailer to get drunk and remind strangers. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely shit. There is no redeeming function other than ending with credits that indicate the whole signal. /> <br /> despite the flaws of ph: bf ... if you want a nut that will make you laugh for all the wrong reasons, watch it. <br /> <br /> If you want something that avoids abit more meat and originality.
