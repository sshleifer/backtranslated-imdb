This * had to have been an incredibly funny movie ... but it fell flat on his face. (In fact, I looked it halfway through, something I rarely do ...). - Bill Murray plays Jack Corcoran, a second-level motivational speaker who bequeathed an elephant by his father (who he suspected to be dead before he was born); He then has one week to get the pundit pachyderm across the country. His adventures on the road are almost at his best almost amusing. Janeane Garofalo's considerable comic talents are largely untapped. Anita Gillette is impressive in her little role as Jack's mother (who has explained much), and Pat Hingle stands up as a former circus fellow of Jack's father. - Maybe the second half of the movie was better than the first, but I find it hard to believe ...
