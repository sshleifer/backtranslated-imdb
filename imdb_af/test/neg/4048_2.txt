When I first saw it, I thought it was a joke. All I could think was: "You get the 8MM camera, I'll get my little brother's monster toy, we'll make a movie!" Why would anyone in a modern era such as 2001 make a sci-fi movie like this, it looks like it was made in the early 80's. Featuring actors acting as a cigar, Indians are a script written by the director's 4-year-old son, a camera stolen from a burning pawnshop, poverty-row special effects, and to take it off , a director who thought to make this crap will make them known. The end result was not spectacular, complete with intense dialogue and continuity. From Venus had to have been fun, and I'm sure everyone involved was having an explosion with their crazy little movie. <br /> <br /> A 2 out of 10 for a brave, hopeless attempt. <br /> <br />
