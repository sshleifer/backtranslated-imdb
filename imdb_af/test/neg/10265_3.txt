(Spoilers more than likely ... nothing really important, you couldn't have figured out yourself) Yeah, it's really weird. I rented it at a Blockbuster because it had absolutely NO description of the movie on the back of the box, just a list of the bands that had songs in it. But after that I had a big time finding it, even here on IMDB. I confused it with the night of the demons, but you know it's basically the same. <br /> <br /> The parts I loved most about this movie were the whole thing in the garage. That black gymnast was hilarious as he shouted ALL the time. Even when screaming wasn't really needed, he had a "LISTEN NOW VOLTAGE! And so, they'll drive cars in other cars. But then he got balls and trapped a zombie with a broomstick. I believe it was. The other part that caught my attention was the part of the accident outside the building with the guys that their girl didn't want to come in. To what important part of the movie did we give it? What was it? Why was it there? Why did the movie end with a man who broke the TVs in a studio? I saw that there was a zombie running to the screen, but he was so far away. I mean, he could just shut down the TV. Yes, this movie was shot on a whim and yes, I hated it.
