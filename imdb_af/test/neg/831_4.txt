First, let me say I wasted Halloween movie night by watching this garbage. Secondly, let me know that the current DVD available from Shriek Show is not unsalted, so your gore dogs will be very upset. Thirdly, that one scene is the highlight of the movie and since it's cut, you see where I'm going. <br /> <br /> I know many horror fans dig this movie. It's atmospheric, shot in the woods with some very beautiful scenery, waterfalls and so on. But to kill the opening, which is a very brutal shot of a machete trapped by a hunter's cross, you do not get any real brutal death afterwards. And with a slasher movie, you want it. At least, I do. The director and co. Do nothing new with the killer in the forest idea, and several of these kind of movies were made around the same time in the early eighties. The only thing that matters is that you don't hate the actors as much as you can in other movies. They are so nice. The children have a reason to be there: one of them owns an act on property on the mountain. But what is not explained is why his family has property there. There is no cabin or house, so why buy property in East Jesus, especially if you are not a hunter or what? Well, I'm sure some people buy land for camping purposes, but it just seems unusual. Anyway, the two camps come out and shout the campers and pack them one by one. And, as I have already said, you almost get nothing in the way of decent deaths after the master killed in the beginning. The end has killed some kind of murder by Connie, but even it's not enough to save it from being almost equal to the completely forgotten movie, The Forest, which is meaningful. <br /> <br /> If Shriek Show could get a real rough print, this review might have been more forgiving, but it's the day and age of rough / indefinite DVD releases of old obscure cinehound movies like I. If you relieve us, you get the crud review. Unfortunately, the presence of great paternal George Kennedy is the only highlight of this movie to distinguish it from the other garden waste recovered in that day.
