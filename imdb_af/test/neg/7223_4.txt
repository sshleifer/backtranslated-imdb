Richard Donner highlights his liberal credentials with this ridiculous overcooked simplistic attack on South Africa's politics. It's not as if America is the cradle of racial education and brotherly love - and further irony is added by the fact that the movie in the city that was home to Rodney King and glorified the police department that has done so much towards community relations with their brutal racist behavior . So, Donner's salt and pepper pairing, which clearly has a late-developing teenager's beloved one, does their own thing with due regard for the rule of law or the rules of evidence and nobody's worried, because the bad guys are white South Africans - surely a worrying example of police racism in itself? Inside Rudd's (Joss Ackland - equally hissable) office was designed and illuminated to look as far as possible at the Fuhrerbunker and just in case some dull movies miss the point, he and his men are referred to as regular "nazis". . For me, the only light spot in the movie was when Mel Gibson turned up against an anti-apartheid banner with a banner titled "End Aparthied Now". The intensely annoying Joe Pesci is being introduced into the franchise to take some of the boys' shoulders off the weight by following them to be ceaselessly like a poorly trained puppy. It will be bearable if there is the worst possible chance of being overcoated in a concrete, but unfortunately he survives to irritate for another day. Miss. Patsy Kensit seems to be in her own world, perhaps her happiness does not seem to be against Mel Gibson. She had little trouble rubbing her in bed in his stall, which was washed up on a beach somewhere. They are burning a number of helicopters burning enough laps in Mel's caravan to hold the US military in Iraq for six months. Fortunately, he has a pet dog who is not afraid to cause Coitus interruptus, just as they go for seconds and she barks warn them of the imminent attack. I hope he has a special leg as a reward. The film climax (without interruption of Mel's dog) on ​​a cargo ship prayed to Nazi Germany (sorry, South Africa). Mel and Danny killed so many members of the master race I lost. Despite a bit like Bonnie and Clyde under The impact of a hail bullet, Mel survived, curled into his partner's arms like a little child with a wise and benevolent father. Take it, Apartheid!
