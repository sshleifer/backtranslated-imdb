This is a relatively viewable movie (+1). After looking at UKM: Ultimate Kill Machine, it looks good, compared. There are no clear technical favors, although the vampire teeth seem strange. <br /> <br /> The story line makes no sense. Let's look. An American GI is fighting vampires. Come back to the states and be rehabilitated to see ... Vampires. His commander is the aunt of his ex-wife. Who is now researching the biodiversity of the South American area where the vampires are. Huh! Don't accumulate too many accidents. Who cares about the head vampire? Or, his daughter? Or, one in this movie? The only originality in this is that most of the myths about vampires (allergic to crosses and garlic, cannot come out in the day, etc.) are wrong. But they cannot be murdered, except by lumbering or a wooden wound in the heart. Yes, right. It's obvious they didn't want a dark movie, as it made a TV movie. <br /> <br /> It would have been fine for the viewer to hire actors. Oh, they have Lynda Carter (TV's Wonderwoman), and a big, black man with a deep voice, who is right to show his vampire teeth prosthetics. But otherwise you will never know that they actually paid people to read these lines. <br /> <br /> There are more than enough fighting scenes, and a little vampire-bite neck blood, but no real violence.
