A friend of mine rented it once, thinking because Peter Fonda played in it, it couldn't be bad. WRONG! It is bad as anything can be. There is so much to laugh about and it's not the jokes. For example, in one scene, Hawken walks in the woods and when he comes out, he suddenly wears a whole other outfit! Where was the director's brain when he shot that scene?!? Probably the same place Fonda's was when he agreed to do this movie. It's really a shame that one should see such a good actor dumb in this poor excuse for a movie. <br /> <br /> No one's performance in this movie can be mentioned. Jack Elam is only brought in to bring the star count here, but everything he does looks in a very dark and horrible scene in a bar. Not to mention the "Indians", the girl was so filthy I wanted to shoot her just to end her misery and mines. If I could give it a 0, I'd like to do it. Shame that the point doesn't exist here. It really reminds you of a bad joke or amateur movie just made fun. It should serve as proof of how bad B-movies can get.
