Gamera vs. Viras are lazy and many suffer from it. <br /> <br /> Space Aliens tries to take over the Earth and is stopped by Gamera. So they send another ship that manages to kidnap two young boys. The strangers then take control of Gamera and let him attack humanity. <br /> <br /> First, I must say that I enjoyed the monster fight at the end between Gamera and Viras. Viras look like a large squid with a beak. He has no energy weopons and does not shoot any rays, but he can close the shows on his head to make a sharp, pointed weopon. So overall, it's not a bad monster for Gamera to fight and is decent. Viras seriously injured Gamera by sticking his bottom of his shell with his pointed head and I'm surprised. Gamera could survive it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Gamera vs. Viras decided to use footage from previous Gamera movies to fill time for this movie. They again show the battles between Gamera and Barugon and Gamera and Gaos when the strangers look at the previous battles. But when they show Gosas's fights with Gaos, they first show the battle between Gamera and Gaos in the city, then show them the last battle between the two. After showing their used footage of the last battle between Gamera and Gaos, they show the first battle between Gamera and Gaos !!! Talk about showing the battles in non-chronological order. They didn't even need the first fight they just had to stop after showing the last battle between the two. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that they decide to show pictures of Gamera attacks again when the strangers command him to attack Tokyo. So they show the scene of "Gamera vs Barugon" where he destroyed the dam. To the scenes of "Gamera The Invincible" which is a big problem for me. Mainly because "Gamera The Invincible" was black and white !! The use of a black and white film stock in a COLOR film is really lazy and not a good thing. <br /> <br /> The dubbing is again bad. The two little kids are not so annoying, but it would be nice to see a Gamera movie that does not involve small children. <br /> <br /> Using other footage from other Gamera movies is a deterrent to this movie. The final battle is great, so I recommend jumping for the last ten minutes and watching this movie. The rest is something that has been seen before.
