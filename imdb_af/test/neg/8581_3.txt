A woman in love with her husband (he is suicide) decides to have a baby to save his life. She is in a fertility clinic - like the beloved she takes - so both know how artificial insemination works; But instead of using the method, thousands of people use the coitus every year around the world (the $ 5 turkey hybrid). We also have to believe that although the immigrant is in love with his fiance, it does not represent the obvious alternative to intercourse. Furthermore, even if it is a business arrangement, the first time she is with her sperm, she takes off all her clothes, as if it were a temptation. Plus, her husband doesn't notice when $ 30,000 of their bank accounts are missing. Does all of this think more willing suspension of unbelief than even the most Hollywood fare? Enrich at all points.
