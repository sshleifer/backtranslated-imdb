The adventures of Sebastian Cole are about a boy named Sebastian (Adrian Grenier) who makes him a writer at one stage, as he is really struggling. This movie is probably the years when he wrote his material for writing, the adventure years, hence the title and the previous quote. In it we experience the very typical upcoming stories and warnings of love, drugs and sex ... changes. Yes, there is a little twist here, which is very interesting. And it's that Sebastian's stepfather (Clark Gregg) makes a rough decision early on to get a sex change that has a big impact on Sebastian's family and his relationship with his step. -Dad. <br /> <br /> Clark Gregg plays Hank / Henrietta, Sebastian's stepfather and is very good at the part, very credible without being over, which is a route that this movie could easily have taken. . Fortunately, they didn't. Adrien Grenier, who I only know of Entourage, is also very good in his role as Sebastian, and together he and Gregg have a good relationship on the screen. It is always very pleasant to look at these guys (?) Relationship as it develops and is actually heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> And this is the best of this movie. Unfortunately, it does bring some mediocre camera work, direction and cinematography. It's not bad, but it's far from being good or memorable. The characters are also thinly written, and it is clear from the beginning that most of the bows will protrude. The only true captivating character is Clark Gregg's Hank / Henrietta. I have said Grenier did well, but Sebastian's character is not only doing, but is completely disagreeable. I don't honestly see why someone in the audience will erase his character in anything he does. He sneaks, sneaks, cheats, lies and has no other aspirations than to be a complete slacker. It would be different if he were a side-character or comic relief, but to have him as the main focus and asked to take the character seriously? Come on. <br /> <br /> And I don't really like this movie, but I just want to say ... choose another song in all these movies, Hollywood! No longer "Where are my thoughts" from the Pixies, we all know it's a good song, stop it with every other movie! <br /> <br /> I feel like I can break down more and more of this movie, but I didn't hate it. I just don't really care about it, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The adventures of Sebastian Cole is not a bad or boring movie, it is not just a very good or pleasant one. It is very uneven and the writing could have used quite a bit of work. I think the point of the movie is to watch a loose look at the writer's life before he made it, and it worked ... if that writer stuck out pieces of fiction I didn't want to read.
