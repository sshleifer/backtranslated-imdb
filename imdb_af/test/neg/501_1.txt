I recently saw the Heaven Gate. Having watched epic westerns for 3 hours 40 minutes, it's not western, I read the book by Steven Bach. After considering all the events and the movie itself, I still think this movie is a total waste of time. I believe that when someone tells you to see it, they are actually trying to kill you. If for some reason you can enjoy this confident about thought, truly bad movie, then I have to ask. Although it's not a reason to hate it, it's historically far away. It seems to be about a situation that happened in Wyoming, the Johnson County War called. Usually the pigs of the time wanted to kill all animal husbandry and claimed they were all immagant. You find that you don't just care about these people and hope they are all killed because at least something would happen. Everyone in the movie talks about things that are happening and it is never shown. After you have already put this huge waste of time, you wonder how someone could actually make a 4-hour epic in which nothing happened. Oh, and with the way the Johnson County War was not a war, it never happened. The Johnson County War was actually called because it almost happened. In fact, 2 people died. I can't warn you enough of this movie. However, if you are like me, the idea of ​​seeing a movie that ruined careers and putting United Artists on the "buy" party seems like an interesting thing to study, and look at this anyway. horrible, narcissistic, movie with no sub-text, and many photos. (what is sometimes nice)
