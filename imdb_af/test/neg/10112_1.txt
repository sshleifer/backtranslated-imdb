Hey guys and girls! Never rent, or may God forbid, buy this piece of garbage. I rarely saw a movie in any genre, as bad as this. Actually, the acting is worse than my friends and I did when we were 7 and had to perform in the first grade before all parents and brothers and sisters. In fact, we would have been evaluated for the Oscars if we had to compare with the actors in Darkhunters. The story is terrible, the makeup is terrible, the filming is terrible, the set is terrible, the direction is terrible, etc. Actually, I can't find the money to spend watching this movie. Maybe besides all the cats my friend thought was cute. Please, use your money on things other than this movie .... I couldn't even see the last 15-20 minutes of the movie, it was so terrible. If someone really likes this movie, I'd really like to hear from you and I'll try to see if I can get you to a psychiatrist's office near you. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10, actually below as possible. The DVD or tape is not worth it. this is up to ..
