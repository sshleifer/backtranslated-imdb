The ABC tightens its repertoire company for another unrealistic representation of rural Australia. Yes, that's all there. Baca Bourke (Jeremy Sims, a little talent actor) Fire Hero, Lill (Libby Tanner plays Bronwyn Craig in the bush), Fifi (Nadia Townsend) town, pregers by Baca's brother Joe (I think). Then there is Uncle Geoff the Big Daddy or Lost Springs. Uncle Geoff's scenes are like Tennessee Williams at speed. Only savings are Russian actress Natalia Novikova as Baca's loony missus. She is wonderful. I can't understand why John Waters took the concert as Lilly's psychological man. Need the money I expected! Still, he doesn't go long, because Lill and Baca will unpack it. Just look at this lemon to see how bad an Aussie show can be. Frankly, I'm ashamed.
