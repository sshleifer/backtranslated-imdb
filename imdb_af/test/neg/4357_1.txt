Killjoy 2 surpassed the first movie with just a little bit. The things that improved here were the play, the Killjoy makeup and the story. This one is more of a gore festival, but it does not have the supernatural elements like the first one During this installment, Killjoy kills his victims in more normal ways, he sets them alight, and he does not shoot them dots in his mouth. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was that the end was half a claim, it was actually half-finished. They killed Killjoy in a very cheap way. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves horror movies. The first movie is good, but the second is better. 10.
