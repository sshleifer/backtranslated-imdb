There is a difference between a "movie" and a "movie." A film, regardless of quality, is ready for public use. A movie is what a group of friends come together to make a video camera over a weekend. In my time as a viewer I saw both examples from both. <br /> <br /> On September 19, I attended a performance by author / director Jon Satejowski's "Donnybrook". After reading the script and seeing two different tracks (a rough cut and the "finished" product) of this piece, I can safely say it's a movie. And a student movie. That is, due to a better word, capable, that is, the director knew how to push a record on a camera and capture moving images. The visuals are mostly static and unimpressive, and dialogue scenes are reduced to mostly long shots, with little or no near-shots to enable the audience to establish a relationship with the characters. I understand that this is a modest budget, but a visual flair would have been appreciated, and it would have been a long way to get the audience interested. <br /> <br /> Permitted, there are standalone pictures that show that limited camera work can come with a well-written, boring story and some sharp dialogue. Steven Soderbergh's "sex, lies and videotape" comes forth immediately. However, this movie does not. The main story is poor and unfocused. As the main tomb is that Davie is trying to restore his relationship with his father, then I feel this movie misses the point. What I come up with is that Davie's main aspiration is to change the face of rock and roll. "However, we see very little activity on his part to show it. While there is one dream sequence at the beginning and an impromptu performance of her at the end, everything we want to see is Davie's scenes to listen to music or" A guitar is released, we are simply told that Davie has played a lot of performances, but we never see him in full rock, next time SHOW will not count the audience, anyone who has taken a creative writing class knows it. Davie does not look like someone who was big in the glam rock era of the 1970s, he seems to be more comfortable in the early days of rock'n'roll, pretending to be James Dean's less talented brother. rest of the movie events are random, rather than clich√© characters, and story threads, which have little or nothing to do with the slim main story, are generated and abandoned with an alarming frequency (ie the subplot with which Terry's dad ) If I want to see a movie with this kind of random construction, I will look again at "Napolean Dynamite", a movie I could barely make through the first time. <br /> <br /> As for the above-mentioned dialogue scenes, I think I have to mention that they are few and far away. Is it too much to ask for characters talking? I don't think it is. When the characters speak, it is short, sleeping sentences; collections of oh so informative questions, anger grunts or wild-over-the-top outbursts. These characters simply don't wear like ordinary, rational people. Working with stuff like this makes it easy to understand why there is only one good performance in the film, Al Hudson's, and that's just because he does a poor simulation of Sam Elliott's time on the screen . A good director, or at least one ready for the challenge of a director, could spot these issues and the writers and camera could help people fix them. However, with Satejowski being so close to the material, he doesn't see them, or if he does, he's not prepared to take the necessary steps to fix it, as it will hurt his creative vision. Impossible or unwilling to handle criticism constructively is the hallmark of a self-reliant, deceived fool. Just ask Rob Schneider. <br /> <br /> Eventually we are left with a poor, high school set, turning off Zach Braff's wonderful "Garden State", combined with the equally incredible "Velvet Goldmine", two films much more appreciating your time. <br /> <br /> Now before any of the governor or the crew comes out of the word to take me for the review, allow me. The best thing I can do is to Satejowski complimented on the ambition to make his own film and put it out for an audience to watch. The hope that this film is picked up and distributed, however, is merely deceptive visions of grandeur. It's a student movie, nothing more, nothing less. If the movie has a promise (and let's face it, it won't come from acting, writing or directing), this is this: If, if, the people associated with this movie are willing , then learn from this movie, put it away, and use the lessons you learned during your next attempt; Don't attack your critics or make friends or relatives it for you. If you can do that, the next one is worthy to distribute, worthy of being called a "movie". <br /> <br /> I'm hearing you, and I'm ready to watch.
