I watched a movie called Dark Talon, dated 1974. The credits for this movie are exactly the same as Dark Star, so I will assume it was an alternative title. Dark Talon was nowhere as funny as everyone else here says. The acting was lame, the editing slip and overall stupid. In the beginning, there is an annoying 1970s truck song called "Benson, Arizona" that has absolutely nothing to do with the movie. Actually, the plot turns to a small crew of an interstellar bomber going around unstable bombings. The bombs are sentient and respond to people. The compulsory disaster disrupts communication between the bombs and the crew. One of the crew members went out and had an absurdly idiotic existential conversation with the bomb that didn't make sense at all. The movie I saw was done within an hour and a half, with ads being thrown in. I suspect Dark Talon is an inherited version of Dark Star. <br /> <br /> The stranger is an inflatable red beach ball spray painted with some sample hands on which it runs. It was stupid and unconvincing as a stranger. <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that John Carpenter had a hand in here. His other movies were so much better.
