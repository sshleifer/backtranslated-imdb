The only good thing about Persepolis is the shadows created in the German expressionism style of animation and a hint of history. This movie bored me. It was about a woman who was unhappy with her culture trying everything and then going back to her roots. Here she again finds a great dissatisfaction and finally ends for final to make everyone in her country find out what the situation is going to do and what they will do now, because she is not there to support them. It comes to no conclusion and lets us feel that this woman has no loyalty. Remember, she is torn between cultures and doesn't have enough background. It seems important and real. She listens to so many voices and is likely to be a world citizen of some kind as one with any links with her birth culture of Iran. The only thing I received from this movie was anxiety.
