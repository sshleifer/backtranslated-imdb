Beautiful music. Beautiful photography, some of the screens are breathtaking and influenced. But the dramatic tension is lost in a movie that is so poorly edited. It's hard to know exactly what is going on. Sometimes the dialogue is incomprehensible. Then there's Richard Gere. He is supposed to be a factory worker in trouble and getting a job on a farm. We see dozens of farmers' hands sweating and dirty in the hot sun. Then we see Gere, and seems to have just fled from a Calvin Klein ad. Sam Shepard, another celebrity press, must be sick. But he looks good. Nice try, but it just doesn't work. Brook Adams tries hard but she gets lost in the landscape. The real star is the girl.
