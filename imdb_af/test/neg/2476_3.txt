Nothing about this movie comes out as if it's big or terrible. <br /> <br /> In the end, that's what kills it. The blend is just not good. I can't say I expected Will Smith better, but I definitely did Kevin Kevin of "The King of Queens" - but hey, I'm used to saying a lot lately. This movie tries to make its mark a romantic romantic comedy, but it never touches the bull's eye. In fact, it never gets * anywhere * within the target. The allergy scene is disturbing; The fact that Kevin James can't dance is something that nobody gets out of the wheel and is therefore (in a movie like this) not funny. This movie is constantly trying to win your heart, but always with the wrong trick at the wrong time. Some parts are good (but I'm looking for my brain for examples), but I really think this movie should be avoided.
