There is only one thing I'm going to say about the cat in the hat ... as a KIDS movie and a good comedy movie that sucks it ... I have tracked the horrible jokes in the movie that didn't just suck did not, but knew it was not correct. Oh yes and with the way the cat spoke in the hat was annoying. As for the plot, I completely forgot. Anyone who cares, sucks it anyway. I'm not sure why Mike Myers joined, but I think the authors tried to make it sound like Austin was in power without the swinger and it went too far - but so, what was it annoying. don't see it - it belongs to the bottom 100 ............................. the jokes are so rude, it's funny
