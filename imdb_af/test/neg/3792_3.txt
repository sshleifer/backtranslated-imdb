It's a movie with a great storytelling concept, but it had a sidetrack, but a large number of clich√© sub-plots, clipped and unrealistic depictions and performances, and some honestly unconditional (and highly coincidentally, and not to say, convenient as plot points to the story being moved to its relentless finish.) The lack of anything that starred as actually gay, except some casual references to Crow Bar or that he gay was disturbing. It won't hurt to actually show that he is doing something, even if it's just a drink friend. <br /> <br /> It is worth checking out and this is merit. There is not much, even a few years after the release of the movie, in the movie of movies that contains both a gay or a significant gay plot line, as well as African Americans. For that, it's worth checking out. I will not make it too difficult and I will not waste my time to own it. It's a rental, and not a premium rental at that.
