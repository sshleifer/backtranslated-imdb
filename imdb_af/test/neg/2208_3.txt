Poor Casper Van Dien, his career went far from Tarzan and Starship Troopers. <br /> <br /> In Meltdown, he is a policeman who only happens with TV reporter Stefanie Von Pfeten, and her brother is a scientist trying to deal with a speed commentary placed on Earth. But in the runaway comet business, even nearby problems are causing the Earth's orbit from the basement. <br /> <br /> From the survival of Earth we are going to the survival of Van Dien and his immediate family. . His daughter's banger boyfriend, Ryan McDonell, actually proves useful, especially if he suspects that a man he knows as a crooked head can damage the Van Dien squad. <br /> <br /> My only question here is why didn't they have Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton and the rest of the crew to handle the nasty comet? <br /> <br /> Pass this one on people.
