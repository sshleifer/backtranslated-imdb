An Aging Roger Moore is again as Bond, this time trying to figure out why Agent 009 was murdered, and why he had a forgery of a Faberge egg with him and where it came from. He ends up in New India India, then in East Germany after finding out that a Russian general is trying to deploy a nuclear bomb at a circus, and hopes that NATO will push for complete disarmament. In this way he can take control of Western Europe, then the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Despite the sound of it, it's actually more of a romance, what I think, between Bond and Octopussy as an action movie, and long, but rather somewhat fun. But there are too many attempts at humor in this one; Sometimes it looks like it was a comedy. Also, Timothy Dalton would have been better than Roger Moore in this, so there wasn't much of an age difference between Bond and Octopussy. <br /> <br /> Improper trivia: Bond's small plane used in the precursor, now hangs in a Quaker Steak and Lube restaurant in Clearwater / Largo area Florida, USA. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 out of ****
