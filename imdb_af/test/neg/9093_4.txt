I really couldn't get into this movie. The plot is an old woman who is so long so long that he is deformed. She dies and he stays in the basement to starve. Months must pass and a family move. The daughter is blind due to an accident caused by the father. Well anyway, this man in the basement, who must be dead for all right, is still there. He eats a cat and is now superhuman. He now wants to eat people and have sex. And if a hooker dies, he gets the blame. I always like movies where someone else is blamed for the murders because you always here the typical lines "I didn't do it", "I could never do such a thing", blah blah blah. And the family story can be a lifelong movie story.
