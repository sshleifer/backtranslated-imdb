It's a bad movie, but oh well, this movie is not as bad as the third Ghoulies movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a bad movie in terms of his writing, directing, acting and basically everything in between. It has such a poor, simple and ridiculous story, which has little to do with previous Ghoulies movie entries. It is trying to connect the movie with the first movie "Ghoulies" of 1985, but if it really wants to link the movie with its predecessors, are the Ghoulies in this movie? Instead, we now have a few small people, played by Tony Cox and Arturo Gil, who are dressed as demons. Not that the Ghoulies were classic characters from the previous movies, yet they were the heart and soul of the movie and also provided the movies with a certain amount of fun. It's like having a Gremlins movie without the Gremlins. <br /> <br /> The movie is not really interesting to watch, because it has no tension, good humor, intriguing characters and basically everything you can think of, because it is joined by people who, of course, are not the most talented are in their business. Just like director Jim Wynorski resumes, with movies like The Hitches or Breastwick and his successor, Alabama Jones and the Busty Crusade, House on Hooter Hill, Scream Queen Hot Tub Party, The Bare Wench Project "and the sequel" The Bare Wench Project 2: Scared Topless "and" The Bare Wench Project 3: Nymphs of Mystery Mountain "and" The Da Vinci Coed "on it. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is pretty stupid, but it's not Really enough to improve this movie and give it even more entertainment value, you know, it's the kind of cheap movie with some special effects, costumes, makeup and actors who have never heard. <br /> <br /> However, this is not the worst movie in the series, because of the fact that "Ghoulies III: Ghoulies Go to College" is by far a worse movie, as some or other terrible lame had attempts at humor This movie is at least another attempt to be serious and professional, although the end result that is far from perfect. <br /> <br /> Bad movie making and maybe just viewable for those who have seen the previous Ghoulies entries. <br /> <br /> 3/10
