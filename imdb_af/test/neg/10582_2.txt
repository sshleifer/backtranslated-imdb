Superhero Movie (2008) is the most recent in the long line about "parody" movies I despise so little. I wish this movie could be the death of the genre, but I know it's not terrible enough to put the final nail into the coffin. <br /> <br /> As Meet the Spartans is considered the bottom of the barrel as far as Hollywood movies, as Superhero Movie is probably near the top. Unfortunately, the Spartans actually encounter miles below the barrel, and this movie just makes it scarce. <br /> <br /> Superhero Movie has a decent cast of C-list celebs. It distributed Drake Bell (Disney's Drake and Josh Child), Leslie Nielson (Airplane!), Tracy Morgan (SNL and 30 Rock), and a few others. Although it has the power to light a 40-watt light bulb, the movie doesn't use humor. <br /> <br /> This movie is about 80 minutes, most of which is dedicated to the Spiderman plot. Not one joke is funny. I didn't laugh or visit or cut all the time. <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie. Do not even think about it. For the love of the theater, just skip it and maybe they won't come up with another. <br /> <br /> ... who do I estimate? They will probably come out with another one per fall.
