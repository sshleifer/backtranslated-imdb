I'm usually a fan of "art" and "strange" movies, but when I saw this one, my response was "it should be called experimentally because it doesn't make sense." The "action" is static, but at the same time it jumps from one place to another. There aren't enough titles to make it clear who is who and what their relationships are. Apparently, the main point was to show that in the face of murder, adultery and, generally, strange and dissolute behavior, the healing offered by forces banned a totally innocent black man.
