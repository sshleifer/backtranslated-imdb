If the league was unfamiliar with placing this script, the backers would simply turn around and say "no - you don't have the money - it's terrible". As a fan of the League of Gentlemen, it's their poorest outing to date. Not very funny, not particularly entertaining, there is little laughter aloud moments. They do not exist, but they are few and far between. I felt the format was tired and really dragged. The film refers to the authors who are bored with the characters and show them. Like being a movie. I felt that Christmas had a better production value; The FX is generally quite poor and it is clear that they are not in the original Royston Vasey movie (they filmed it on the cheap in Ireland). The musical score is poor and the dialogue is terrible. Also, the accents of the characters were largely off their TV equivalents. Tubs and Edward, very underused (again), just didn't look like themselves. Disappointing, because I was hoping for something more entertaining. It was actually the league's equivalent of the comedies of the 1970s where the throw to Spain goes ...
