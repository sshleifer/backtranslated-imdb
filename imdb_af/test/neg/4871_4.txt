1st watched 2/25/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-George P. Cosmatos): Predictable action thriller where any regular filmmaker can guess what's coming next. Charlie Sheen is the good old boy for the president who just doesn't like the rest of the presidential staff. Of course, he becomes involved in a situation where he is hit over and over and he has one friend in the White House, played by Sutherland, who of course does not stay so long. His other friend is a reporter who is played by Linda Hamilton (who has little to say or say in this meaningless role), and of course, his biggest and best friend is the president himself (Sam Waterston) who speaks to his end until the end. stay away from everyone else or he will be killed. Brainless, but action-packed, meaningless tripe despite many and many actors (everything is pretty messy.)
