I am proud of the ability to sit through everything. I think "If I paid the rent, I would at least look." I found the exception to this rule - The Planet. I don't know what the exchange rate is, but by reading the other comments, I can only guess that Â£ 8,000 should be about $ 150. I will date myself, but this movie reminds me of the old Steve Reeves movies of the fifties. He was a bodybuilder turned actor. He was in these really horrible Italian print films that Reeves knew as Hercules or another muscular hero. If a child looks at them, you can't say well why these movies are bumping - you just knew they did it. Mike Mitchell is the new Steve Reeves. This is it. That's what it really was - a new story of an old Italian "Spaghetti Sand and Sandals" movie. And I don't kid you - where was Reeves born? Glasgow, Montana. This movie is not so bad that it's nice to watch - it's just bad.
