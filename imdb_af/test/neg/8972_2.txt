Stage Grace Hayes stars in this obscure little movie. After years on stage, she will visit a small college town to check on her son who is raised by his grandfather. The child does not know who his mother is, and when she sees him in a local malt shop, he is a drill. Part of the problem is that he is a college clown. The other part is that he is really spoiled. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, it seems Ma is really rich and not just funding her son's life, but is a keen contributor to college. So, she has the idea of ​​forcing the young man to mature. She talks to the man who raised Peter and cut off his allowance, hoping he would rise to the event. It also appears that she puts the screws at school because she thinks all these children should stop playing and be more responsible. <br /> <br /> Now that's true. To show that they know the value of hard work, she rents a bunch of them to sing and dance at the shop she just bought. Talk about contracted !! What happens next is like a long and not very good talent show or maybe a poor man's version of a Judy Garland / Mickey Rooney musical! I suggest the kids try to do something else to make money ... or maybe sing and dance until people pay to stop! I know I'll pay them. <br /> <br /> Since the talent is far from talented, Peter is a bad actor and his change from naughty to responsible adult is almost instantaneous. The whole thing is a little difficult to take. Not a very good movie by any healthy standard, it's an obscure movie that had to stay dark! <br /> <br /> By the way, it's interesting that Mrs. Hayes' son in the movie, Peter, is actually her true life. The only problem with this is that Peter Lind Hayes is a really horrible actor. He is not attractive enough to be a leading man and he comes down as either dull and uninteresting or straightforward unpleasant. In particular, all the stupid impressions he does are really bad and he has the charisma of the gelatin that you scrape off Spam. Despite this terrible performance, he started on a reasonably successful stage. Who would have believed it if you saw him in ZIS BOOM BAH - because here he is as welcome as the Bubonic Pes!
