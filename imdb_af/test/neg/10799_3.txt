First, I read the comments further by the director and thank him for his opinion. I have always wondered what the makers of the movies that died on MST3K felt about their works being cut (not to mention how the best brain got the rights). However, Rissi's remarks make me curious about how much Sci-Fi the movie can cut to make it look different (I think now I can rent it from NetFlix). Of course, I've never seen the uncut, non-MST3K version of this movie, but even after I saw it on MST3K, I never thought of it as a bad movie or something irreconcilable (though I thought it was " a very funny MST3K episode); Certainly not, as Pearl describes it, "terribly terrible"; not the appearance of "Future War" and "Hobgoblins". <br /> <br /> As far as cutting the movie, it's been done at least once on MST3K. Case in point: the Joe Don Baker movie, Mitchell, in which the sub-plot of John Saxon's character is cut in the MST3K version. Yet Joel and the Bots say of Saxon absence to his appearance in the beginning of the movie. If I have to criticize MST3K, if you have to cut the movie for time considerations, it's good, but justify the movie being cut (even if it's a movie like Mitchell). Of course, such a criticism is quite useless as far as the performance is over, but I think that aspect of the show was kind of unfair. But anyway, if so with Soultaker, it gets me sympathy. <br /> <br /> However, I maintain that this is a pleasant MST3K episode, although the movie itself, even the version hacked in MST3K, is not close. <br /> <br /> As a final note, in a strange coincidence or perhaps a case of Synchronicity, I saw the Hudsucker Proxy the day Soultaker broadcast, and if you didn't know, the man what Vivian Schelling's father played a bit in that movie; one of its three other credited roles, actually. I thought it was kind of weird.
