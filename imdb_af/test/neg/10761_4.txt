It beats me how someone can judge this movie very high. It is not understatement to mention it far. How the man managed to build a wooden maze of underground rooms in such a short time is pretty ridiculous or maybe he was the greatest carpenter since Jesus. The obese sheriff played by Hoyt Axton looks like a refugee from the Jerry Springer show and I found the blonde female lead, Jennifer Jason Leigh, quite clear. We have an expression here in the UK. "Sheep made up like lamb" that suits her perfectly. However, it was not bad, but I really enjoyed it when the end credits rolled up and "The End" came up, was quite brilliant for this movie of a movie that would have been released as a movie. In discount stores in no time.
