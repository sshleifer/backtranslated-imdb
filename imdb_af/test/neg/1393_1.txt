I absolutely love stand-up comedy. I like to hear the mourning thoughts of the uprising on stage, as they appeal to an audience of their peers different life experiences they had or things they thought or saw that they thought so , so **** was foolish that they had to share it with someone. <br /> <br /> There were stand-ups tackling a persona that everyone can link to (Rodney Dangerfield arrives) or was just as fake that you can't help but laugh. laughed at others (Richard Pryor). And then there were the deceptive comics like George Carlin, who, despite the pretense of being a wage, was the smartest man in the room, calling on people to reconsider what they saw when they walked around and realized how screwed things were and how easily they could change things. <br /> <br /> Now it seems nothing to do with "Mind Of Mencia", which, as I agree with most commentators here, is Comedy Central's terrible solution to the loss of "Chappelle's Show," but it mean. Carlos Mencia spends half the show up for his audience, sometimes on popular topics, most of the time on only racism and racial stereotypes. He's trying to be all three of the above-mentioned stand-ups. He makes a stage character, an everyday Mexican named Carlos who, despite stereotypes, is just your running-normal-man. He then continues to laugh at others, people he calls racist, or just those who do not disagree with his opinion. And then he finally gave sketch to the studio heard and the viewer, and told them it would help them to see his point of view. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia always says he is pointing out that people are not seeing, but what he really does is not only promote racist stereotypes that already exist and have been killed, but he Encourage people to immediately hear them and do the one thing that helps them keep them around. /> <br /> Promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest, but easiest way to laugh at stand-up. The best comedians I fear are that Carlos Mencia is in good company, doesn't have to rest with them. They speak universally and ask you to laugh at absurdity rather than on it, as Mencia encourages. Because he creates more sketches or "real" situations using racism or bashing others, he uses it, rather than asking us to laugh and actually represent these absurdities as truth rather than just extremes. <br /> <br /> His performance is an insult to the minds of those who see it. Mencia does not give us comedy and ask us to digest and take what we want (something that, just as I hate to compare the two, was "best quality of Chappelle's Show), he tells us exactly how to look and responding to it - which, in his opinion, should be a stupid face and saying, "Dee Dee!" This show is appropriately mentioned, which is indeed a show on "The Mind of Mencia." The show is tailored to give life lessons to its core audience, 14-24 year olds, about how stereotypes are bad, but racial bashing is good for Carlos Mencia. it must be good!
