I saw this movie thinking wrong that it was the other radio station zombie flick. The sharp production values ​​and low rents quickly made it one of the inexpensive sci-fi channel style knock offs. <br /> <br /> The central performance of Bill Moseley is initially quite busy as the dubious radio shock jock, but as the film is in progress, is becoming less convincing, as he actually has to act. The rest of the role player has nothing but care and has no depth. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is boring, flat and completely uninspired, like so many of these movies. It doesn't even mean a decent bit of convincing gore, the zombie format is literally pathetic, apart from a notable exception to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The film seeks to inject originality and message This is a fusion of half-baked ideas that somehow resembled the outbreak of intolerance to Islam and the war on terror. It's handled with all the intellectual complaints of a 6-year-old. As the characters and seemingly, the authors cannot distinguish the difference between race and religion - which describes all people of a certain skin color as "Muslims". Usually one character is revealed to be Muslim by skin color alone. At the same time, the "Muslim" terrorists who cause the outbreak are the usual psychopathic stereotype. <br /> <br /> The distant Pontypool presumably had a similar budget as Dead Air overshoot where this movie fails.
