Dennis Quaid is hard to prove to us that Jerry Lee Lewis was a stupid man. And he does too much to prove it. TV series are very good, like a photocopy of old black and white imagery. Music is also good, because Mr. Lewis himself singing. But the rest is just Hollywood B-Movie style, with the fifties Happy Days complex. I think the only good thing in this movie is to see young Winona Ryder.
