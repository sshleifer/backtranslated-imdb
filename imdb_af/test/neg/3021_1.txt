GAME .... Huh ... game. I'm not even sure the bloody hosts of that particular reality game know what the term "GAME" means, let alone the bloody PLAYERS! <br /> <br /> An aspiring PUA will think and think ... Hmmmmm ... What the flying FORK was, was it useless to apologize for a demonstration of seducing women? I've seen my neighbors seduce DOG women with more panache than this! And it's a UGLY bloody dog! And its main approach is to bend the legs terribly! <br /> <br /> I challenge the frustrated chomp hosts of that show to a SHOW down; a demonstration of their so-called takeaway ... Can they deliver? If one sees that piece of unreality, then you will realize: No, this great-minded, mentally-masturbating, sucking-my-dear friend, wants to host Queer Eye or something similar (not that there is something wrong with it). ..), cannot shrink their penises long enough to give a demo of a REAL bakkie. <br /> <br /> As you say lovely North Americans: "..." Nuff Said! ... "<br /> <br /> a message from Down Under ... with Love ....
