It's hard to tell the actors of the non-actors. Bad American movies can be traced by all the youth through every dialogue with "You know what?" Bad Canadian movies can be seen by all young people who have every dialogue with "Eh?" End. Didn't we learn anything in a century of filmmaking? Can the whole weight of millions of wannabes descended on Hollywood not with scripts and rules in our hands save these horrible TV movies made to order?
