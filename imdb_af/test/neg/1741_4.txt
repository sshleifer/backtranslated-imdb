Uzumaki, translated into "spirals", comes within this new wave of Asian Horror movies following such hits as Ringu, Ju-On and The Eye (two of them with remakes .. and much more like Dark Water and Tale of Two Sisters), do not fall off the haunting, supernatural thriller element that is so characteristic of the other movies. The only thing left is strangeness and not similar in Tim Burton or David Lynch, but in an irrelevant and boring way. <br /> <br /> She starts with a girl, another child with a loved one, her best friend and his father who is obsessed with Uzumakis! Everything that happens is about Uzumakis, people die and you see Uzumakis. So okay, it'll go with it, I'm a little amused by spiral myself, characters don't look anywhere, but I play along. We find out of the village is cursed by Uzumakis, people start screaming at Uzumakis and the point is Uzumakis is everywhere, the movie is a disaster, it doesn't know where to go except to show you the power of Uzumakis !! !!!!! There are some cool concepts like when the mother cuts her fingers because she sees Uzumakis on her fingerprints, but then there is another scene where she hears her husband from outside the tomb!) Tell her she also has Uzumakis in her ear , the way she handled them That scene was just laughing, not even fun, there is also some cool footage, such as the collection that father of Uzumakis has, and the girl with the Uzumakis hair. Yes, Uzumakis hair, she's out of context, but it looks like it was taken from a Fruit Snack commercial. If you eat a Uzumakis fruit pie, its taste is so amazing that your hair changes in Uzumakis, now that it wasn't bad enough, suddenly, out of nowhere is snail men .. or mannaels ?? everything ?? And you know why? right? Because in their shells they have Uuuuzuuuumaaakiiiis ??. It just left enough time for a crazy anti-climate end and by that time I was sick of friggin 'uzumakis .. uzumaki here uzumaki there, be sure about you, how much Uzumakis can you find? If you want to see a movie about spirals, check out PI (3.1416). There are now some nice uzumaki concepts between the meaning of life and Dark City also has a little spiral. <Br /> <br /> This movie could have worked as a music video, it has already followed a cult and so I had to see it, but I don't know why it's good for people. I was really disappointed.
