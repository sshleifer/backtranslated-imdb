And again, Columbia Pictures decides to simply make hash with the original version with Curly and without any gags or jokes to get started! By the end of this pitiful movie when Joe is being held to drive the bull, the studio didn't even bother to record the sound again. If you listen carefully, you can still go curly here. "Woo woo woo woo". Even when Moe and Larry throw the arrows to lower the bull so that he can get away, it is lifted straight from the original because you can actually see that Moe and Larry look "magic" 15 years younger. Why, why did Moe make it happen? It is a burning question that can probably never be answered, because as far as I know, in real life he was quite sensitive to any kind of criticism and he had quite high standards for his work, as well as Larry, Curly and Shemp. Don't waste your time on this one.
