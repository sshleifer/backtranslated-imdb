Rigoletto is Verdi's masterpiece, full of drama, emotion and powerful, memorable music. The maestro should have thrown into his grave when this bawdy travesty of his work was released with his unnecessary obsession and cheap copulating and his portrayal of the naive, but mostly Gilda as a horny tie. Opera can definitely be customized for the movie. Look at Zeferelli's wonderful La Traviata --- but if a job is as wonderful as Rigoletto, it doesn't have to be cheap gimmicks. It would have been acceptable even if the named music was good, but it is a mediocre version of the libretto with the second sound sound quality.
