Let me start by saying that I never wanted to see the movie in the first place; I had to see it one day, and I thought I could relieve and enjoy it for what it was, and apparently it might be entertaining. What I was expecting of that was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. First, there was nothing at all a little humorous. The creators expected humor to be laughable / sensible if they included sarcasm in every line that came from Underdog's mouth and used scene to a mere scene, playing aspects to "charm" the audience's light while still "oh" "and" ah "for more with boring action scenes and careless, scary performances that have shouted to everyone in the audience who enjoyed it. The play was dull, the humor was boring and the characters / plot felt like they had spent about 10 minutes creating their entire personalities, which gave the uninspiring actresses / actresses no play on how to put their characters with the least depth picture. This movie is simple and just awful in every field and really only children under the age of 10 can enjoy it, even if it is the age range for which it is aimed, which does not excuse it because it is so bad and I have to feel so feeble. Parents, spend your money on Up, Wall-E, The Spiderwick Chronicles, The Water Horse or Hotel for Dogs for the best, recent family / kids flicks, or even Alvin and the Chipmunks are better than this filth!
