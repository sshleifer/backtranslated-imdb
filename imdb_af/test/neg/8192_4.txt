It's skemaltie, but then what did you expect? The heroine is Cinderella's younger sister, with an evil mother, sister and brother-in-law. the hero (if you can call him) is an inefficient putz; and the competing love interests are full of melodramatic villain. <br /> <br /> The cast, institutions and wardrobe were all very attractive, and I thought the actors did an excellent job considering how poor the material was. The film is nicely filmed and has created a soundtrack that has been carefully crafted to visit the viewer over what emotions he has to experience throughout. Megon McDonough sang sweet and provided the movie with some of his best moments. <br /> <br /> If you like Danielle Steel, you'll love this movie. If you like archetype romance, you will love this movie. I didn't. I could sit there, but it was close.
