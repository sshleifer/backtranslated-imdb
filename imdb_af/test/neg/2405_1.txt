This film has the distinction of being the worst movie I've ever seen, and the only movie I've ever given 1 of 10 on imdb. I was foolish to rent it because of the cool H. G. Giger cover art on the box. This cover art is the only thing that is least good about this steaming hope of ... <br /> <br /> It was about frat boys who "freaks" in a strange but not least interesting post-apocalyptic world where the cities are in ruins / chaos, but apparently the suburbs are still a safe and wonderful place for young men to devour other men in brainedad organizations. The most uninspiring performances by boring characters, not so special effects, sadness, non-original beauty, and usually generally extremely poor quality in all factors of production, make this lemon lost all the time on my list. <br /> <br /> FINAL RATING: 1/10 I wish I could give it a zero. <br /> <br /> Noob Aalox
