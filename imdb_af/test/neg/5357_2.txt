What can you say after watching this movie? That is, if you had the interest and concentration to see it to the end. I was left speechless because of the incredibly boring story, annoying situations where one American is the same as that of a fifty or more Iraqi, and boring dialogue. I think if this movie has something to teach, it's probably like: "Don't screw with the US, or we'll kick your butt." Plus, this movie really encourages and votes for the deaths of masses of foreigners, in the name of the war. I got the picture of tackling chess pieces from the board. Besides, it's fast and there's not much to think about. And on top of it .. no character there is any spirit; then, how can you not care at all about any of them. With the exception of war movie fans without taste, I would not recommend it to anyone. There should always be something more interesting to do.
