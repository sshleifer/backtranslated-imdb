This film captures the short moments between a mother and son in rural Russia, as she dies. <br /> <br /> I was so torn that I was beautiful about the movie or it was a test of patience. On the one hand, the film is beautiful, with the sparse dialogue capturing the essence of their feelings. There is really nothing to say, because everything that has to be said is conveyed over words. The boy shows so much care, love and patience towards his mother that I think it is a celebration of unconditional love for your family. It also reminds me that I can be in such a situation, sitting in a joyful place, caring for a very sick person. "Mat I Syn" is a cruel reality. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Matt I Syn" is moving too slowly. Do I really need to watch a train over the horizon for more than 1 minute? With my previous experience of "Telets" and "Aleksandra", I was so seduced to place "Mat I Syn" among them as a total drill. <br /> <br /> I think you should be in the right state of mind to appreciate this movie. I do see its beauty, but maybe I'm not in the right mood.
