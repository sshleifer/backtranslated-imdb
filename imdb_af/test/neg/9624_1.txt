This movie is really very bad, it is not very well done and is a lack of effort to do something, but I do not know what. I watched it and was very disappointed. It promised a lot, but nothing at all. The characters are level and wood, and the music, if you can call it, is terrible. There are, of course, all the creatures and animated creatures, but they are so badly done that it does not come as anything but a three-handed movie. It is really a pity that more attention cannot be paid to the special effects, not the only one, and it all ends up being a movie I vote for, but in a movie based around them, it is a very important factor. For me, a very sad effort, and should be avoided.
