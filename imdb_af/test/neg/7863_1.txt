This movie is so bad it actually gets funny. One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. The funny thing was that the trailer had scenes that weren't in the movie. Just by looking at the trailer, I would have saved a lot of my time. It actually showed everything that happened in the movie, except for the conclusion and it was so obvious. <br /> <br /> It is frankly difficult to think of a reason why this movie was made. It's just as bad. Horrible. <br /> <br /> I'll give it 0 out of 10 if it were possible. There is nothing else to say about this movie.
