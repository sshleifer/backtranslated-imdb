In order to eradicate excitement to stir up fear, tension or any emotion, the story must be credible. There is nothing credible or realistic about this movie. The protagonists have several opportunities to escape or to turn the tables, but they can screw it up every time. The antagonists who supposedly plan it and have adapted their commute specifically to attract people, have certainly left many improvisational weapons. There is actually one scene where the "smart" girl has a gun at the head of the bad guy and decides to scold him instead of the trigger. It was a very predictable, brainless "thriller". Each character was one dimensional. The "victims" were the common, deadly, brainless sheep that had to be earned. Is there anyone on this planet who is able to write an intelligent thriller?
