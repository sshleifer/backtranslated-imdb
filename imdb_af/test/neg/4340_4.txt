The only thing in the "Sudden Death" that constitutes the amount of non-stop action is the incredible number of plot holes. With that, and the sheer amount of controversy, one can hardly mention what left a storyline. To say that the script from "The Hard" borrowed it would be to make the world's most blatant repression! <br /> <br /> Here's a troubled hero working in the great Pittsburgh Indoor Ice Rink as a Marshall fire. On the night of the seventh match of the final series, he gets tickets so he can treat his estranged children to the decisive game, and of course spend some time with them. The game also captures, but for political reasons, is the vice-president of the United States (Raymond J. Barry). When a lot of incredibly well-organized mercenaries catch the VP's box and claim hundreds of millions in government funds, our hero Darren McCord has postponed his plans more than slightly. <br /> <br /> Every time a new one of This Formula movie has appeared, everything we get in the way of innovation is nastier bad guys, and more and more spectacular and horrific ways in which good guys destroy them. Director Hyams and his screenwriter have gone over the top (not that it is an original sin) to try to get rid of the unfair terrorists from us. The terrible bad things are about shooting the secret service, the security and the civilians (old and young) leaving with gay, and with little respect for the relative threat of each victim. <br /> <br /> Van Damme does a lot of things about fisty cuffs and weaponry, heroism and stunts. The script does not require much of the European Union. Almost everyone left, except Powers Boothe, who had ever experienced his written, shallow role as the cruel, meanest old ringleader. There are lots of clever cinematography and enough explosive special f / x to keep anyone awake. But really, it's all this action movie, action. Although there are a few fine rows, nothing can be shamefully brilliant. <br /> <br /> Saturday, February 10, 1996 - Greater Union Melbourne
