This movie found one dollar ($ 1.00) and the movie was a total waste of time. Reb Brown, (Mark Hardin), played a military adviser in South America and was successful in capturing the leader of rebel soldiers moving out of the dense jungles. However, Mark joined the opposite side after some terrible tortures were inflicted, or women and men. In one scene like Mark drinking a drink in a hotel bar, his eyes glance at the sexy long legs Sandra Spencer (Shannon Tweed), "Dead Sexy", 01. Mark and Sandra have the extreme hots for each other and even make passionate love on some very hard rocks, without time for the comfort of a bed. It's a horrible movie and it's not worth wasting time to even look at IT.
