SKELETON MAN was good for the first 5 minutes, but as soon as the so-called "Special Force Agents" hit the screen, it went down hill faster than a thick child on a sled. <br /> <br /> The opening makes us think we can have a weird but fun, horrible movie on our hands, but no ... the filmmakers destroy any hope of it when the "Special Force Agents" appear . I wish the writer had taken a different route and the "Skeleton Man" followed some dull teenagers until one of them finally got the upper hand. Instead, the "Skeleton Man" chases down some dull "Special Force Agents" and divides them until their Captain finally gets the upper hand. <br /> <br /> I know the whole "stalking of dull witted teens by a killer a thing like before, but it would be more suitable for a movie like this. <br /> <br /> When the "Skeletman" finally meets his "so-called" downfall, in a building that inflates, the captain of the "Special Force Agents" is asked by a police officer outside the building by the following: "What happened to hell there? "My answer to the question:" Who's the hell caring? "
