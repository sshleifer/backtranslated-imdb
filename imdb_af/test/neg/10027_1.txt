Even through the reduced standards of '80s slasher movies, this one stinks. The ordinary trousers of crowned teenage heads for a "forbidden" part of the forest, which burned in the 1940s and apparently left an only evil survivor. Fast forward (actually, you will want to go through many of this mess up) until today, where some campers are slaughtered; The teenage years follow in their wake, while a semi-worried parker (a sleeping hiker Jackie Coogan) and his healthier cohort (who spends a lot of time swapping his banjo) partially succeed in getting our attention from the meter run-of-the-mill nature-footage padding. Lastly, more murders - but nothing you haven't seen a few times before. If you want to see the kids gender, choose SLEEPAWAY CAMP or the first FRIDAY THE 13th above.
