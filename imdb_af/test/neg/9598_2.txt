An unintentionally hilarious early talkie melodrama with Kay Francis as Countess Balakireff chases everything into pants. At the beginning of the movie she threw the governor back because she was too young before sitting down for the driver! The high-tinted English set she moves in is such a claw-bunch of harummpfists that it is ridiculous. But the top is Basil Rathbone as an Italian violinist with a Chico Marx accent! "My violin! How will I ever eat again!" "Patreecia, my milk is cold!" It is out of faith.
