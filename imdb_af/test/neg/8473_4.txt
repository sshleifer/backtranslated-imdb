"I remember waiting to be born ..." <br /> <br /> "Vision quest that the American West was." <br /> <br /> "We went to a psychic ..." <br /> <br /> "I'm sure their first reaction is that she is cuckoo." <br /> <br /> "The place is ghost ..." <br /> <br /> "I think there's another dimension here." <br /> <br /> An artist (Marta Becket) and her husband, many decades ago, left the hustle and bustle of New York and moved to a godly village with a population of 10 in Death Valley. There they renovated a theater - painting it is a very homemade / folk art way. And as soon as she's finished, she starts dancing for almost no one. In many ways it is highly reminiscent of the Werner Herzog movie FITZCARRALDO or DREAMSVELD - although AMARGOSA is a real-person documentary - not a mystical madman such as Klaus Kinski or Kevin Costner. Her husband eventually leaves much of it because of the lifestyle she chose. So, today she lives with her ten cats and a burros sanctuary eventually with her new male companion, Tom. <br /> <br /> What you think of this documentary depends on your perspectives. If you're into New Age ideas and open to this sensitivity, you'll probably appreciate the movie more. Her talk about how she remembered her birth, ghosts, vision quests and psychics honestly made the psychology teacher in my circles and that would certainly be the case for many people. In addition, her burro shrine and trying to preserve horses in the desert will probably appeal to PETA and many other animal lovers, but with my background in environmental concerns and biology, I see the burros and horses as a rust that will destroy the native plants. and animals. So on two different accounts, I tend to think the opposite of Martha - which is more of a feeling and feeling. Depending on how you feel about it all, your opinions will definitely color - and I'm pretty sure most people either think she's a genius or a nut! You just have to guess what I think. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the movie is interesting and Martha's life is definitely not boring - especially since the past year, people have actually started traveling to the desert to see her perform. There is a definite consequence for her and her unusual little world. While I wouldn't be nearly as positive as most reviews, I couldn't be as negative as the one review as there is definite merit for this strange documentary. I love movies about unusual people and Marta is definitely unusual! I also appreciate her love for her art and happy life - this is a rare gift. <br /> <br /> I teach psychology at an art school and it would be interesting to show it to the staff - where I'm pretty sure we'll get a strong positive and negative reaction to the movie - probably depending on whether the teachers have learned the art classes or core curriculum! It will certainly be interesting. <br /> <br /> By the way, and I'm not trying to be sarcastic, but when Martha's husband had business with whom did it happen? After all, they lived in the middle of no place and I was left to wonder where he would find partners. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you want to see and / or stay with her hotel, this can be found at www.amargosaoperahouse.com/. The website is in English, French and German and hotel rates are fairly reasonable as ticket prices.
