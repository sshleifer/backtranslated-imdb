What's wrong with Disney over the past year? Are there any good running ideas? Where's the magic? Where are the good animators, the good songwriters, the good directors, the good ... Well, I know, Walt himself and the famous "nine old man" can't come back. But is this a reason to eliminate countless cheap persecutors and slowly destroy Walt Disney's ideas? I never rented or bought a Disney sequel from which movie. Because I have read enough about his (absence of) quality. But "Atlantis: Milo's Return" was broadcast on TV in Germany today and so I watch it. This confirms my doubts about prosecutions. It was absolutely boring. Flaw animation, primitive color rotation, simple characters, some unsuccessful attempts to simulate the famous Multiplane camera with CGI, mediocre music and a patchwork of different, simple stories. It absolutely doesn't look like Disney! Not like Disney I don't know! It looks like one of the countless, inexpensive and simple animation series such as "DragonballZ", "Beyblade" etc. What is sown on TV every day for children. <br /> <br /> My first response after showing this crap was to load "Bambi" into my DVD player to see Disney's immortal magic, depth, spirit and charm again to get Disney back to see the wonderful art of handmade animation. "Bambi" was the first (and to date the only) movie I give 10 out of 10 stars. But "Atlantis: Milo's Return"? No magic, no depth, no charm, no spirit. It only earns 3 out of 10!
