We rented the movie and it may be the worst movie ever. The box they had in the video store had a cool sample on the cover, but in reality the monster was a creature of the black lagoon mask. Terrible, terrible, terrible ... you can actually rent it, it's so bad. It feels like you're watching a bizzare-o-house movie.
