I would have given this movie a one star vote if it wasn't for the laugh I got out of there. Some of the windows were just as lame as they made you laugh! How can anyone actually talk about it? Not to mention the fact that Guards Majors (Antonio Sabato Jr.) flew a 747 as a pro and Michael Pare's team of whiners were able to dig a ditch full of petrol and a huge bunch of heat to blow up. Have anyone seen the lame tribute to "Fantasy Island" with the man who said "boss, the plane !!" to Michael Pare, just as the 747 comes in. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace was the cute girls and even better female hijackers. Not to mention that the headdress deserved the lame he did to be such a joker !! Imagine you are escaping to be tied only by a "crossbow". Hello. <br /> <br /> The poor pilot probably died in the plane while everyone was eating steak and rum! Just for the laugh, they have to make a sequel to show us how they all spend the night in the middle of a hurricane on the Neptune Atoll. I heard Michael Pare call it the "best honeymoon resort in the Pacific Ocean." Now it would make an interesting movie!
