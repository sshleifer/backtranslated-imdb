This film is thought to be about three young idealistic people, two of whom join the Naxalite movement and blah blah. It's just another movie about some beautiful, rich people who are trying to decide who should lie next to them; the farmers and the naxalites and the political struggle of the era serve only as a picturesque backdrop. Literally, as we do not hear the villagers say a word, they never learn someone's name, so they have the same 'role' as the 'native' in old Hollywood movies. The movie is also boring, and the story doesn't get us anywhere - except for several bedrooms. We are apparently supposed to admire its art, which simply means no good song and dance routine, which obviously did not save the film, but at least relieved the boredom. <br /> <br /> My friend Japna was irritated by the immorality of the whole story, not the bedroom, but the whole sense of the story. The message seems to be that ideals are not worth pursuing.
