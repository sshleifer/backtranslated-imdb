When, oh when, will Hollyweird write a decent movie based on computers? I can't believe that people really regard this movie as a credible story. <br /> <br /> No computer operating system can ever survive the kind of annoying scrolling interface. It may look good on a movie screen, but if you have tried to use it for a long time, you will go nuts. <br /> <br /> Just like finding people, the way she did it simply can't be done. . Network security alone would prevent this from happening. The keystroke logging was laughing to say the least. <br /> <br /> With regard to the software that is supposedly installed, no system administrator will allow such critical software to be installed on a production system until it is tested, tested and re-tested on a sandbag system. <br /> <br /> But probably the worst possible part of the movie was the "virus". There is no way that a virus operating on one operating system will work on any other system. And for a virus that can take out a mainframe is a few seconds, which only beggars believe. There is no way an open external connection would have the necessary superuser access that would allow the system files. <br /> <br /> I can go on, but I can't be bothered. <br /> <br /> A porn has a better thought-out plot that this stack of garbage.
