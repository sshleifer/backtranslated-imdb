With various names actors (Lance Henrikson, David Warner, Joe Don Baker), why was Jeffery Combs given the lead? Henrikson would be a perfect fit for the head, such as Warner, Baker or even others in the movie Charles Napier. Combinations were missed, and a poor job was done. Everything he did was like or confronted. <br /> <br /> The writing is poor. This meant that if Lance Henrikson (or another) had the lead, he saved the movie (removed from my "waste time" category), but it would have been another bad movie. The screenplay was completely missing. The director had to recognize it and helped the movie.
