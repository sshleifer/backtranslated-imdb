I watched the 219-minute version and have to say that dollar-for-dollar is probably one of the worst movies ever. Now I'm not saying it's the worst movie ever - but if you look at a cost ratio about how much an average person will enjoy it, it's a very, very bad movie. <br /> <br /> I would say that the single biggest factor making it a bad movie is author / director Michael Cimino. Rarely can so much debt be placed on a single person. If he wasn't so self-sufficient, a movie could be made so badly in about 90 minutes - to save the studio millions! <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a completely unnecessary prologue that is supposed to be at Harvard. The scene is BIG, but totally without context. You have no idea what exactly happens or do you know why the students (especially John Hurt) act so well. I find it very difficult to think that it started like this in 1870 - and it looks much more like 1970. It's half an hour where you don't know what happens, who the characters are or their motivation. <br /> <br /> The next scene is 20 years later. Inexplicably, the two Harvard degrees (Hurt and Kris Kristofferson) are in Wyoming. So, they went to the best school in America and now one is just a law man in the middle of no where and the other is .... Well, what is John Hurt in the movie?!?! He just appears here and there and looks as if it is a push (the prologue) or a pathetic and senseless drunk that hangs with murderers - even though it seems to them! His whole character doesn't make sense. They never explained why he was a British living in the middle of nowhere (it was impossible to hide his accent), why he was bothered to come with the hired army. If he was so against their evil plan, or why he would risk his life for a reason he didn't believe at all. As for Kristofferson, his excellent acting and better-defined character made his character more credible, although he moved to Wyoming. And the risk that his life made for a prostitute had no sense. <br /> <br /> This brings up the worst aspect. from the sky. While the screens are too long and need to trim, the worst part of the movie is that the characters were like cardboard. John Hurt (a great actor with nothing in the movie), Jeff Bridges and many other big names are there, but you have no idea why. In fact, apart from Kristofferson, Isabelle Huppert (as a hooker with a heart of gold - quite the clich√©) and perhaps Christopher Walken, each one is completely one-dimensional. It's hard to imagine a movie THIS long where you don't know or understand the characters. <br /> <br /> Much of the movie also looks anachronistic. Who would have thought a giant racetrack was built in the middle of no where in 1890? I'm sure only the basic stock in this region in the West would have been, very, very difficult - and yet we are expected to believe that the trains are full of roller-skates and wood instead of FOOD. Perhaps if they didn't spend a bazillion dollar building and traveled the rat, the farmers could afford to buy food and avoid this war over stuffed cattle !!! And what is the man on roller skates with the violin? What did it have to do with a land war? <br /> <br /> The most obvious problem you're left with is that it is a movie where very, very little actually happens until the big battle leaves in the movie. There are many scenes of filth and flat nothing. Nothing much had happened to the audience by the time the battle took place or was hostile to the movie that nothing could save the movie. <br /> <br /> As far as the final battle is concerned, it's been pretty well done but had problems. First, this little skirmish on the prairie lasted longer than the D-day invasion !! Secondly, while details of the actual events of the so-called Johnson County War are somewhat sketchy, we know that the characters played by Huppert and Kristofferson were never actually there, since they were both in the fight. Thirdly, I can't believe that Cimino killed animals throughout the film - especially during the last battle. Being far from a blooming heart on animal rights, its need to use animal bowel and kill some of the horses is a low point in film history. To watch and know that some of the horses are dead to achieve Cimino's "vision" for the movie is very sad. <br /> <br /> Finally, after the big battle, we have an epilogue. While it is blessed short, it also looked completely unnecessary and vague. We see Kristofferson on a fine yacht, so we can assume that he will eventually make part of the Harvard education to work for himself. We also see a woman who seems to be one who watched Kris several times during the prologue. Most importantly nothing is said and you have no idea what the final outcome is. I read about it myself and found that the film was often wrong. <br /> <br /> Overall, to say the movie is long and needs. Ton more editing was like saying World War II was a "tiff". Well, I definitely saw a lot worse, but if you bring the production cost, I really think it might be just one of the worst movies in history. <br /> <br /> Finally, when a movie This very explicit nudity I warn parents. However, as a child, this movie (even with a promise of sex) can not be warned.
