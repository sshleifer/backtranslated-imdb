I'm afraid I just stayed to watch this movie for the first time, because it was really a stupid TV waste and a waste of talent. Liv Tyler plays a beautiful beauty, but her acting skills have not yet been sufficiently developed to give the part a real kick. As she slowly seduces a bartender into a crime scene, it is difficult to feel any real concern about any of the characters. Even John Goodman delivers his bad cartoons with an absence of panache, as if the whitish humor is to be asked slowly if someone misses the joke. The end is supposed to be good, but the starter and main course left me without appetite to find out.
