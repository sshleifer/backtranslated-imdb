It says a lot about the UK when television programs like this are not just made, but also run for three series. Indecent, politically correct to diseases and poorly acted and written. Meera Syal is not funny or in everything she was in, tell me, I'm wrong, and Jasper Carrott, funny guy like him, is past his eighty birthday. It's such a bad comedy that ITV could be made, but even stinkers like The Upper Hand and one with James Bolam as a parking clerk look like Fawlty Towers compared to this litter. I would like to sit with the author / director of this show so that they can point out the humor in this program. While most of the British population consists of poorly trained chavs, it won't tickle their funny legs. This is when they can move away from Big Brother or their phones, but that's another story. Full and total dirt!
