The plot: Four people are caught in an elevator. One is a businessman, the annoying kind who is aggressive and complains about everything and everyone, and is an ongoing example of distilled stress and hostility. Then there is his colleague, a woman who is much more pleasant in her character. A teenage bubble that just broke into a coke machine, and through its mere presence, drives the businessman to anger, and an older guy who only stole 100,000DM makes the rest of the cast out. <br /> <br /> The movie is all about how they handle their problem, as time goes on, unsuccessfully to reach the outside world, as the lights go out and the cables start one after another to understand. <br /> <br /> And yet it's not too exciting. The characters are stereotypes. The story is stupid and unlikely (how can so many things go wrong in just one lift?). You don't like many of the characters, you just hate one of them. And all the twists in the plot do not contribute to the excitement, but they are just stupid to fill up a few minutes of dialogue, as the scriptwriters keep the full length inspiration and ink in a lift. <br /> <br /> Let's just hope "Phone Booth" will be a better effort ...
