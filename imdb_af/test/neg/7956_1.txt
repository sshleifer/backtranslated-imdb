Deepa Mehta, Arundhati Roy and an army of other so-called intellectuals get the title of intellectuals because they like to portray India and Hinduism in a bad light ... and Deepa Mehta in any case makes her money out. Anyway, Hindus are too soft or scared to protest the way Muslims protest so anyone can take any freedoms with Hinduism. And it's a fact that women in the west were also badly treated during the 1930s when they were widows ... just that no one likes to show anything bad about the west or anything other than India and Hindus. She paints an incorrect depiction of India and the situation of widows there. No mention is made of child marriage being illegal. She finished the film and said there were 34 million widows in India. Of course, under one billion people, there will be so many widows. But how much does the life she portrays live in the movie? Deepa Mehta eventually sells India and poverty to make dollars. How pathetic ....
