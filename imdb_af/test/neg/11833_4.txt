Everyday movies are often the most interesting of all movies for me, in the hands of an informative artist who has all the distorted little details of everyday research. The French cinema often looks great for this kind of thing, and I love the French theater. <br /> <br /> This movie is about everyday. It didn't have much of a plot. It was just characters living in a village, very ordinary people, and things just happened. But that was not very interesting, and it was not very informative. The movie caught a little mood, but it wasn't a very exciting mood. And while I can't think much about the movie being specifically wrong, it failed at just about every level to do anything right. <br /> <br /> There were many characters in this movie. Many of them looked similar, so it was hard to find out who was who and what their relationships were. I don't mind any effort to understand a movie or even watch a particularly complex movie more than once to iron the details, but this one was a puzzle that wasn't my solution. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can really say about this movie is that cinematography was nice - functional, not brilliant, but enjoyable. The camera has often captured some pretty postcard-type shots. But it seldom found the very interesting little details. <br /> <br /> I've seen such a handful of non-good movies at the Seattle International Film Festival, but that was the only one that couldn't find. any applause when the credits rolled. I felt a great collective sigh of relief when the film was over. But I suppose there are probably some people out there who would like it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
