"Take Familiarity" and "You Served" and rally yourself and what do you have? This God horrible movie adapted for dull normal adolescents. The plot follows very closely: "You served." Three ghetto afro teenagers, this time living in John Water's Baltimore ?? not far from 'Peckers' house? Spend their time getting high school non-degrees and dancing in dilapidated 100-year-old buildings with hoochy-mamas. To finance their expensive baggy hip-hop clothes, steal their cars and deliver them to the local bracket. Not different from John (Tony Manaro) Travolta who worked in a Brooklyn paint shop so he could buy his polyester disco clothes. /> <br /> Tyler Gage, one of the black three musketeers, is being captured to establish the local Fame High School and is required to perform business duties. He meets Nora Clark, a 26-year-old white high school student, and discovers he is Irish-American, much to the chagrin of his black mates Mac and Skinny. <br /> <br /> As you pay in 'You've Got Served' crime and Skinny, the youngest member of the trio is shot by a Bad Bad Leroy Brown type, but it doesn't stop the music and heartfelt final.
