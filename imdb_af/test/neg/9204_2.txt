A spacecraft in an unspecified future where people are equipped for space tourism and have guns for weapons, crash lands on a strange young planet where dinosaurs also happened to evolve and have not yet died out in this world. The survivors of the accident, roughly ten naked characters wearing blue, white and yellow suits, are fighting for survival against the alien prehistoric monsters. <br /> <br /> "Planet of the Dinosaurs" is a peculiar movie. As I mentioned in my summary above, the stop-motion animated dinosaurs in the movie are the only colorful actors. The models are rough but effectively animated. And they are much more fascinating and intriguing than those characters portrayed by inexperienced actors and speak of a script that needs to be written overnight without a review. Clearly, most of the budget is placed in the dinosaurs, and although there is a fair share of them, there is not enough to save us from our boredom. These human characters are just there to scream, run around, and mumble these poorly written and verbal speeches on survival. And unfortunately not nearly enough of them are eaten by the dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Planet of the Dinosaurs" is not a movie I intend to see again. Some people will simply like to be so cheap and so poor. Sometimes I enjoy movies like this. But this particular movie is just too long, too sowing, and very exhausting in the mind.
