When a lost teen is bitten by an insect, he becomes the superhero ... <br /> <br /> Superhero Movie is the latest show movie to hit the screens. Unfortunately, despite the presence of David Zucker (who was involved with Airplane!, Top Secret and The Naked Gun movies), still the most recent spoofs have been ... mostly, it's more stupid than fun ! The mistake lies mainly with the gags. It's simply not funny enough. Some of the jokes work, like the nail gun scene, but other parts just fall flat. For example, the X-men spoof or the whole speed sequence. Blow Saddles It's Not! One of the most important things about the best show movies, such as the plane, is that while the dialogue is extremely funny, the role play is mostly straight. It makes it even harder. Even when there is a simple dialogue in the foreground, wonderful things can happen behind the cast. Again funny. The other important thing is that they all have a plot of sorts, to hang the gags. <br /> <br /> The recent trend seems to be to take screens from different movies, then try and spoof them. As a result, the so-called plot of these movies rarely exists. Another mistake this movie has is that some of the screens were actually funny in the original versions, and in most cases even more beautiful than the spoof zone! Throwing tries to get into the spirit, but with lots of dialogue and scenes it is difficult to work on it. <br /> <br /> Like recent movie films, it's not as bad as Epic Movie. , Date Movie, or the Terrible Meet the Spartans, but given that some people are involved here, good, funny movies have been made in the past, it is nowhere near enough.
