Well, anyone who wants to see a good work of art should NOT watch this movie. A sophisticated filmmaker will undoubtedly be watched by the terrible production values ​​and the view of an excellent actor (Josef Cotten) who harasses him for a buck. Mr. Cotten really needed the money, or he was too nervous to realize that the movie was crazy. The same phenomenon happened with Dana Andrews, who appeared late in his career in the camp and terrible FROZEN DEAD. I know Mr. Andrews was in the hair of alcoholism, but why did Cotten do this mess? <br /> <br /> Regarding the plot, it is a rework of the Frankenstein plot. The first half of the movie really looks as if they are doing a serious but seriously flawed version of the original Frankenstein story. Then, inexplicably, they set up a daughter. It wasn't a bad thing. Until then, they decided to stop making a horror movie, but made a soft pornographic movie! The change was dramatic and bizarre. It was almost as if they had said, "Okay, Mr Cotten was doing his screens and went home .... now ladies ... STRIP!". <br /> <br /> The problem is at every level, the movie is just awful except for the monster's makeup. Although not good, it is pretty nice to see. But bad writing, acting and a $ 17.46 budget conspired to make it a deadly and terrible movie. One who is so bad at throwing in some nudes shouldn't be enough to seduce anyone to see it.
