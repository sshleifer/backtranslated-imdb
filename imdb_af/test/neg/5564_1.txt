I hate this movie !!!!!! I have never seen such a complete, complete trash in my life !!! I live in France, so it seems that I was in the front line to watch this horrible movie. At first, it seems to be similar to something about a cursed forest that separates people. Unfortunately, it turned out to be something VERY different: a good start to a girl who meets a guy and everything that doesn't, then the girl gets threatening messages in the form of the ravens locked up in her bathroom cabinet (ridiculous) of that bit And on, the movie starts slipping very quickly down with many desperate conversations in the process. The movie ends with sacrificial grapes in general and ancient ugly stinky creatures that come from the past to kill a few people. Many questions then rushed to my head: why did they bring the rogue monster back? Dream grapes such as maniacs dressed in beds? Why did they even bother to make this movie? The "climax" of the movie was so goofy, I laughed all the way through: the "terrible" stinking monster struggling with the two young women (who are knowledgeable kung fu masters) and the professor cut in two or something. What surprised me was that the monster was so slow and unholy in the fight, was it not a war god or something? Anyway, throwing the film in his death was a pitiful sight. A brief condensation of the contents of this movie: Kungfu Mayhem + Gravestones + Mysterious Murders 'A la thriller' + antique prophecies + Shabby ravens + Old, clumsy boneless War God + Nutty professor = Completed and sick, oxless, Worm eaten, GOD FEATURES , GODDAM, RECYCLING, FAKE, WANNABE, LUDICRO SH * T !!!!!!!!! Things I learned from this movie: - Ancient war gods are common to kung fu. -All young women studying archeology at the university in France are kung fu experts. - Professors are so resistant that they can survive in two by a saw-mass watchamallit without any injuries.
