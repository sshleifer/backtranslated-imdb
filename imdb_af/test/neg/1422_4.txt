This is a standard action movie as we have seen it many times. Not much action in this one though. Again it is about the man who protects the president. He is macho - as usual, and at the same time soft and melancholy - as usual. Does he bother to take a bullet for the president? And then there's the girl and the usual conservative flirting. Stereotypical and predictable until the last crumbling minute.
