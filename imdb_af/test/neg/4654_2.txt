Pretty bad. This movie about a grizzled (and honestly rock rock) old prospector and his dog'Shep ie Lassie, as well as an annoying kid whose name I can't remember at the moment. At the beginning of the movie, the old prospector DELIBERATELY buried himself in some sand, so that the poor dog should excavate him. Why? Did he hate the dog? Anyhoo, somehow or this idiot managed to beat gold, and is going to tell his mate. But the man died, and his brave other partner is happy to help old Jonathan dig the gold. The geezer is trying to go, is a dog with the dead boy's son, but not even the delayed mutt wants to stay with this child. There is a beautiful old preacher (for good reading), and the oily guy surprised the old man (surprise, surprise) and tried to steal all the gold. Plus, he poisoned the dog and also tried to kill the child. So I think it's good that a devilish and mad Lassie ... is ... SHEP does it the guy in the end, though it's pretty disturbing in what is basically a children's movie. There are extremely stereotypical (to the point of racial obsession) 'Native Americans' who speak without using verbs (as in, Me makes campfire-type speech). And this is almost the scale of the cast, because Lassie's salary was apparently too large for them to hire someone else. Kind of dull. Not very interesting, and a little too dark. Not a good movie in any way.
