This movie has been advertised in Greece for more than three months as the largest Greek production ever. Well, it can be, but ... If you hear of a big production, you expect to see something new, something else. What you see here is a movie without reason of existence. George Corraface looks like he doesn't really enjoy making this movie. His acting is so simplistic, it almost looks amateur. The sound, especially when some of the Turkish actors speak English (bought?), Is full of the gate. The grateful few special effects of Istanbul and Athens in the late 50's and early 70's are more like digital paintings than computer graphics. Eventually we saw the same son from 1959 (age 5) to 1968 (14 years old), but in a miraculous way he became a teenager five years later. <br /> <br /> So much for "the greatest Greek production". At least one would think there would be some kind of interesting writing to qualify for such an expensive production. And all you get is a love story between 7-year-olds who meet again 40 years later. Oh, there's also a political side. Some ironic remarks about the Greek "junta" from '67 -'74, as childish as being almost forced. <br /> <br /> There are, of course, some good things in the movie: most of the actors are great, especially Ieroklis Michaelidis, the very good scenery and the wonderful music by Evanthia Remboutsika; but they are so few for such expensive production. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Is it so bad a movie? To tell the truth, I don't know. I just know that it in no way justifies its big (for Greek standards) budget.
