One of the worst movies I've ever seen! After I watched it, I run out as happened? I'm confused to this day, can anyone explain that movie to me? Both the acting and the image quality are so bad, you will think you're looking at someone's school project made with a home camcorder. First, I can't believe how some people can give 10 stars to this movie. Because it is his incredibly bad movie! This movie is not scary at all! There are even no typical horror clich√©s as well. The plot and acting of this movie was terrible. It is not fantastic, surreal or abominable. It's just a scary Turkish feature film. And finally there were many unnecessary scenes and unnecessary characters. Looking at 'Gomeda', I became so hopeless, so sad for the young Turkish filmmaker. Please don't make a movie!
