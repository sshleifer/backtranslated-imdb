The English translation of the title on the DVD version of this movie is "Church Court of Horrors," but I think it should be a mistake. It had to be called "Horribles Cemetery." Terrific acting, horrible editing, horrible story and terrible music all make it a terrible movie that is best left in a terrible cemetery. <br /> <br /> Horrible.
