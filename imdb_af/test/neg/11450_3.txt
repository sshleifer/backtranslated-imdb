I had to be in a good mood to even give this shameful, predictable, embarrassment to the movie a 3. What's wrong with that? Let's start with the free sex, although I admit that the rotating style of bonking was something I haven't seen before. And I think they also saved a few bucks by showing the same sex scene three times. Then there are the contradictions. The "Oakville Tribune" seems to be in a green part of whatever town it would be. (Hamilton Ontario ???) In the scenes on the roof it seems to be in an industrial area with a steel factory boasting smoke and flames. Also the inside of the building --- the newsroom --- the stairs --- looks much bigger than the outside. SPOILERS HERE Then, when our fearless reporter finally gets fired, she comes back to the building a couple of times. Hardly likely. The end is also pitifully predictable ... the classic bait and linker in which the good guy seems to be the bad guy. But my major concern is the fact that it is another movie funded by Canadian and Ontario tax credits that are ashamed to establish themselves in Canada, and again prove that the Canadian film industry is craving and opportunistic. A country's movies need to do more than just work. They must reflect the culture. It's bad enough that the US studios use Toronto as a New York standpoint. But it is embarrassing and polluting when Canadian producers (in this case, CanWest Global) do so with the help of federal and provincial governments. In a word ... BAH!
