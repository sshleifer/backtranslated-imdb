Diane Lane is beautiful and sexy, and Tuscany is beautiful, but this movie is no better than mediocre and it is generous. The story line is implanted on a travel guide and remains thoroughly tireless. <br /> <br /> Set (we say) a Newark suburb, the plot will be considered ridiculous. All that preserves the movie is the Tuscan countryside and occasional plays in Florence and Positano. And a movie from the scenic sunset-slow-in-the-west would have been better served by showing what it certainly is one of the most beautiful places in the world.
