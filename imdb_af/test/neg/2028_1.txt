The wind. Easily one of the worst movies ever made. The only good thing that comes from this kind of relentless fool is the fact that movies like this are distributed, making impressive horror film makers like me confident that my upcoming feature will also make the cut. I mean, if it represents the market for intimate horror, I can make a fortune video taping that I use the rubbish for 83 minutes myself. <br /> <br /> A complete list of what this movie lacks will take too long to write. But the highlites are: no story, horrible acting, terrible cinematography, and virtually no editing. The last one bothered me the most. As an editor myself, this movie has absolutely been crazy to me because it has hardly had any editing. Each scene was shot in a master. They had absolutely no cover. For anyone who doesn't know, "cover" shoots a scene from multiple angles to have cutting options when making editing for a desired reading experience. Yes, this movie had nothing of it. I even talk about the simplest scenes. For example, an ordinary conversation scene between two people sitting at a table will typically start with a master who determines who is in the scene and where they are. Then, as the conversation goes on, you will move back and forth to over-the-shoulder shots while the conversation continues. You can even throw a screen or two of something on the table or in someone's hand. Anything. It's "movie 101" stuff guys. These people seem to have no idea this is how movies work. Each shot was a camera lock. No movement, no cutting, nothing. If I was a filmmaking course, it would be the visual tool for my "What to Do" lesson. <br /> <br /> In the lock, you shouldn't waste your time. The only wonderful thing about this movie is that it has ever been distributed. <br /> <br /> <br />
