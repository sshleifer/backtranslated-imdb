One of the few reasons to make these Pointlss movies is to give some actors a chance to hopefully die in better movies if they act, it's fine. The only good thing in this movie is the play, the three female leads are better than most horror movies like this. There are 2 scenes that can cause an unexpected jump. <br /> <br /> Young little children are used to crawl through holes and lay dynamite to explode mines. When one causes a cave to die in all the children, it becomes zombies. The adults in the mine stay dead, no reasons are given as to why the children become carnivores. When they were still alive, they were terribly innocent in front of the cave, so they had to be furious with any adult they had mined in the mines. That's just the reason for that. <br /> <br /> A mother and her 2 daughters move into a house near the mine, along with a countryman who wants to build a resort and another of those creepy people who look exactly what goes on, but no one don't believe him. <br /> <br /> Nothing new here, you are plain clich√©s, predictable, very negative for this movie, very little positive.
