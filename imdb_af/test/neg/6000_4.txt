"Thunderbolt" is probably Jackie Chan's worst movie since 1985, "The Protector". Yes, I know no one is watching their movies for their stories, but the plot of this one is exceptionally lame, even according to its standards, and while fighting choreography IS to its standards, the fighting tones (the whole two) are as others said , ruined by the frenetic, distracting camera work. Even the most serious Jackie Chan fans shouldn't really bother with this striking random, stunt-and-stuff-filled garbage. Anita Yuen's cute and beautiful performance is one of the few redeeming virtues. For a good "serious Jackie" movie, I recommend "Crime Story". (* 1/2)
