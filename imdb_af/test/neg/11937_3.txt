I had high expectations for this movie when I saw the presentation and decided to watch it on TV, uninterrupted by commercial breaks. I liked Lee Van Cleef from many movies, but I'm afraid the other characters call him Chris repeatedly, not change him into a reasonable facsimile of Yul Brenner's Chris. <br /> <br /> I found this movie to be a complete disappointment - the music soundtrack was trying to portray the wonder of the original, but it also failed to bring the movie to the standard . The rich textures of the characters in the original were mostly missing from this movie. I think if you didn't see the original, it would be good. Too many cliches and too few characters in the characters. I missed the humanity and compassion and the three-dimensional characters of the original.
