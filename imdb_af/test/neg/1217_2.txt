Zzzzzzzzzzzz. This one comes directly from the "Jaws" cookie cutter, with some other bizarre cliches being thrown in well. I was interested to see it after I found a silence in a book about Italian horror movies, and wow ... I think I have what I deserve! <br /> <br /> Very slow moving and talky, much of This killer shark movie takes place on land, which is not really that surprising. It looks like the only method they have had to show a shark is through sharks in an aquarium. The shark is never in the same frame as any of the actors, and it's too bad. Most characters are so annoying that you actually want them to be eaten. <br /> <br /> The "plot" is about a group of four children who one day meet with a mysterious Indian on the beach while they roast. For some reason the Indian gives them an ancient artefact that will allow them to follow an old evil that has taken the form of a monster shark to attack their tribe ... presumably because they are too good was around the sea and the oxgod was worried they would take all the fish. Or something like that. <br /> <br /> It's also a good thing, because you won't know it. Years later, a monster shark appeared and began to contract people in the sleepy marine community. When one of the four guys is eaten by the shark, the remaining three are determined to kill the thing ... especially since (big shock here) the authorities killed a shark and they think the threat is over. Yawn. <br /> <br /> The mandatory deaths are incredibly boring, and you can see them coming a mile away (my favorite was the girl who has a fight with her boyfriend while sitting in a bus jumping out and says, "I'm going to swim," is thrown immediately by the guard shark). They have a lot of nerve that calls this movie "Deep Blood" as you hardly see any, just cloudy water. The actors handle their cleaved roles as they are all thumbs, and there is even a hilarious subplot that includes a greasy rocker-type bad boy who threatens our kind-hearted heroes, and finally good at killing the shark. /> <br /> It took me a long time to find this movie, it's pretty obscure, so I don't think there is a danger of too many people wasting their time. But if you have to be lured by it ... don't say you're not warned!
