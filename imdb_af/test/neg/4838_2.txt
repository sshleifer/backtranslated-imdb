I don't understand why someone would waste their time or money this way. Don't get me wrong - I love a good western note I said "good" - it's just rubbish. <Br /> <br /> The acting is terrible. Val Kilmer must know someone or have a favor or something for them to just use his face and name in this ridiculous piece of crap. <br /> <br /> For those of you who enjoy this movie, I make a list of your names to ensure that I do NOT see what you are suggesting - our taste is definitely different, but it is your right to you vote, no matter how far from the base it is. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 2 just if they throw all the ones and don't count them. Just bad all over ...
