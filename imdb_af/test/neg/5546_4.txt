This succession of "In the Heat of the Night" will inevitably suffer from its infinitely better predecessor. Instead of watching a television movie movie, Mister Tibbs looks suspiciously like a TV movie released for the release of the scene, featuring grainy photography, cheesy opening titles and plywood-like sets. made. The murder sequence has a sharp continuity error: the camera shows two hands choking the girl, then a shot of a hand that comes for a statue, then a shot of the girl is struggled with two hands again and eventually the figurine for the fatal blow. Solving the case should be easy: find the only man with three hands! But the rogue production values ​​cannot completely obscure the film's considerable merit: Sidney Poitier's performance as the cool detective has decided to follow the evidence wherever it may lead, even if it implies a friend. Martin Landau is also convincing as the governor-preacher activist who allegedly brutally murdered his prostitute friend. Except for the ghost, Tibbs is confronted with his home life, but the issues of race and Tibbs's barely hidden sense of social outrage are absent here. So the complex murder mystery that made "In the heat of the night" so compelling.
