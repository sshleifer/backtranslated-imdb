I love the Star Wars series. I also love a good, inexpensive sci-fi movie every time. Very much, I even love the Roger Corman-produced nickel and dime work. <br /> <br /> I don't like "The Ice Pirates" though. <br /> <br /> For one, it just looks too cheap, you know? For a movie that is supposed to be in outer space, it feels cramped and closed, as filmed in the front seat of someone's Mazda. And the special effects, while being properly cheeses, look more than anything like foam rubber painted metal gray. <br /> <br /> Usually, I won't be that hard, especially if the story and the characters are worth it. <br /> <br /> They're not. <br /> <br /> The whole storyline, about these ne'er-do-well space pirates who decide to find a planet with ice, can melt and sell them like water (a hot commodity in the future, I think, is about as original as the jokes, which is not a compliment. <br /> <br /> The humor comes in at about the crossroads (like the castle machine you see early), and everyone looks a terrible attitude. And who told John Matuzak he was funny? Everyone who did this is ashamed of them. Good old Robert Urich tries, but he is a trusted actor aboard a heavy sinking ship (or star ship, in this case). <br /> <br /> I watched this one about three times and felt the same every time - Shanghai. <br /> <br /> No stars. Despite the presence of Huston (one year before the "Prizzi's Honor") and Carradine (at the end of an even higher career), this "Pirates" must run the board.
