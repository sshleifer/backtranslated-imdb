After I was born and raised in Odessa, and graduated from Odessa High School in the late 70's, I had mixed emotions about this movie. I no longer live in Odessa, but will always be a Texan of heart. I didn't like the way this town of 80,000 plus is portrayed as a dirty poor little town. If I am wrong about this, I feel free to correct myself, but I believe OHS also plays in the stadium stadium, and the "Home of the Permian Panthers" that appeared at the stadium was at the practice field at Perm. I'd like to see some recognition for the cross-country rivalry of the big game in town every year, OHS vs Permian. But I'm curious why the outcome of the game has changed, but I think it would be as dramatic as the real outcome. Overall, the movie was okay, made me a little homesick, remember the "good old days" of MOJO.
