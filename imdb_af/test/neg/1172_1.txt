The story of Ed Gein is a disturbing and frightening story. Ed was truly a mischievous character and his legacy inspired such greats as The Tooth Fairy, Norman Bates and Leatherface. How is it that such a fascinating man inspired such a boring melodramatic piece of drift? Ed Gein made ties from the nipples, scales from skulls, lamps from the skin, turned under the moon in fit with human skin. None of these made it into the movie, because they had to give us a fictional story of a ridiculously horrible deputy and his homemade, sex-enhanced friend. This movie looked like it was going to fake history. What surprised me is that most movies are in the way of truth to exaggerate history; this one seems to do it to reduce it. I just can't get it.
