On the recommendation of a friend and my admiration of Philip Baker Hall, I hired the first season disc of the race. This is a typical TV comedy featuring all the clich√©s that the genre employs the "wacky" scheming brother (Sully), ditzy blonde (Lizzy), draws unsurpassed love (Piper), sarcastic Asian helper (Darcy, reminded me of Arliss, as if someone had to be reminded of the show. The plot deals with various accidents (usually by Sully) that Sam overcame, endangering his work in the plane, just to save him, with "hilarious hijinks" taking place in the middle. I didn't find a particular episode. I described them ALL to a T. In it lies the problem, as it seems to be even entertaining entertainment, but it becomes unusable when the episodes are seen in a row and over-aged over the endless repetition. Sully will do something 'wacky', Mimi Rogers will say something completely sexual, Russ will tell about his gay boy. Darcy will blow her image of Sandra Oh on Arliss blah blah blah blah blah. The only positive is the lack of an annoying laugh track. But don't let yourself be foolish to think it's good. Check out a much better comedy. Arrested Development, Always Sunny in Phillidelphia, two name two of the top of my head. Surprised that this one is still on the air. Oh, that's right, Fox just canceled the good performances, I forgot. Needless to say I no longer trust my friend's taste in tone. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D +
