I saw many bad movies in my life. Date Movie. It was bad. But this ... it's just ... it's not good. Home Party 4 is the worst movie ever. It's as simple as that. It's basically Ferris Bueller with black people in it. Oh, and it's not funny. It's terrible. So terrible. Chris Stokes could be a superstar at BET, but he's an idiot. He can't write a comedy. Or a horror movie. I like to refer to him as a blacker, lesser-known Uwe Boll. Besides your Boll's films, funny is terrible, if you know what I mean. You can invite a few buddies, pop in Alone In The Dark, and have a good time laughing and eating with your friends. Chris Stokes is so, unless you invite friends to watch House Party 4 with you, no one will laugh. Not even the biased token black man or the illiterate jock. I'm serious, I didn't even laugh at this movie. The acting is terrible, and the movie looks like a bad indie movie. What was the budget for this movie? 5 damn dollars? I mean, what the hell? This movie just sucks; Don't waste your time with this crap. It's disgusting.
