Even for my unashamed love for the first two films in the franchise, and to sweep away any kind of prosperous handrails I might have for Max's character, I can't just bring myself to waste this cartoon waste of space so nearly land that has gone before. <br /> <br /> Gone is the rugged nasty line that felt for character Mad Max Rockatansky, gone is the impact of devastation in an apocalyptic world, and more essentially away is director George Miller's passion for the franchise. The terrifying score fits into the cartoon heart of the movie. It seems as if the makers do not really know what to do with the amount of cash given to make this third (and grateful last) installment. Certainly, the stunts are at the point expected. And of course, Miller can paint an unfinished desert landscape by purely lifting what he had done before. Still, he clearly struggled for fresh ideas with the action as the Road Warrior's coronation rejoices from the Petrol Tanker quest here, but rather uses a train! <br /> <br /> It's just a very poor performance that may have been an ambitious event in the mid-1980s; But if the three movies look closely together, Thunderdome just as a director loses his edgy approach while grabbing sadness between the combination of comedy and fantasy action. And the truth is, none of those genre slides worked in the context of this series anyway. I give the movie 3/10 a purely good Thunderdome battle order, while the stuntmen here at least earn some credit. But this is the third time I've tried this movie, and as a punishment for punishment like I'm sure, I'll never try again.
