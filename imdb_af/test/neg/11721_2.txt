Ahh, nuthin 'such as stockings, exploratory, semi-porn, masquerading as horror ... This one star Jaqueline Lovell (sometimes Sara St James), the nubile starlet also seen in "Femalien", "The Erotic House of Wax" and that family favorite "Nude Bowling Party". She is now a match in Surrender Cinema's list of talented tuckers that stare into the useless, soft-porn exploitation cuddles. "Head of the family" is actually trying to be a real moovie. A king man and a tramp are trying to get the man from the said tramp. They turn into a wheelchair and a family of moronic abuse, which uses spiritual control to send out zombies to make its relentless bid. Saying genius has a huge head, hence the clever title of the movie: it's about the scope of the movie's humor. But basically, it's an excuse to show the many talents of Lovell and Dianne Colazzo (Ernestina). With some of the funniest dialogue being able to be a herd (what's the plow?), And just fool, this titular thriller would be like calling on the Drive-In Theater's breast brokers, but no one else. The MooCow says avoid the missing unless you are looking for a rental on a cheesy T & A / horror night. : = 8P
