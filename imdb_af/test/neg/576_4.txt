This film is about a mysterious love letter that turned 4 people's love life upside down. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the movie is interesting, and the movie could have been funny. However, this movie is simply what a romantic comedy shouldn't be. The characters are initially insufficiently introduced, so it becomes so confusing.

The pacing is very slow, making it 90 minutes more like 180 minutes. <br /> <br /> It could have been romantic and funny, but this movie has also failed spectacularly.
