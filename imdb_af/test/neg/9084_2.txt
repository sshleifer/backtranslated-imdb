Nevertheless, director J. Lee Thompson joins actor Charles Bronson for a violent and uncompromising action movie. In fact, it's probably Bronson's most brutal movie (a good thing for a man who appeared in Death Wish, Ten to Midnight and Chato's Land). Brutality, however, does not in itself make a good movie, and The Evil That Men Do is finally a disappointment. If you wanted to take away his cruelty, the film wouldn't be very interested. <br /> <br /> The story is about a retired Hitman (Bronson) who lives a lively life on a Caribbean island. He is convinced to come out of his retirement to find out and eliminate a sadistic torture doctor who has let down his dirty trade over several South American heroes. Throughout the film, especially at the beginning, we are treated with some graphic torture scenes to see just how a nasty piece of work he is. <br /> <br /> These themes are actually pretty serious. Torture continues in oppressive Latin American dictatorships, and everyday people are made to suffer some painful experiences, simply giving an unpopular view. But the evil that men do - for all its worthy attitude - is not really bothered by the fate of these poor people. It is utterly bothered by Charles Bronson to apologize for blowing away some unpleasant scum bags. It's just an exploitative action that hangs his jacket on real issues. The torture sequence makes you, the viewer, feel like a dirty, sick-in-the-head voyeur, rather than someone who likes to watch snuff movies. The writing is full of terrible dialogue, including some excessive descriptions of torture. The evil that men do not explore his disturbing ideas ... it serves them as entertainment and asks us to enjoy it. Sorry, but it's just wrong.
