Tim Burton was named by fans for his particularly charming creativity and by Hollywood for his softball, user-friendly movie techniques. He added the scales too far in formula's favor with his new dismay of a movie, Sleepy Hollow. Following the quest for Ichabod Crane ?? played by Johnny Depp, delivering this dry film's only bright spot? In the heart of the mystery around a town's seemingly random and horrific murders by a famous headless rider, the story is as if deliberately trying to be contradictory. Named as a childhood story, the humdrum character introduction is sown with meaningful, exciting, non-engaging hunting scenes that, with undeveloped characters fleeing for their lives, produce about as much terror and excitement as the Nightmare before Christmas. <br /> <Break into an endless bunch of old trees for the atmosphere and a wide eye, great busted blonde love interest (Christina Reechi) and Burton herself has a movie that takes the age-old legend of Sleepy Hollow in it managed to make it. like a Disney movie without the charm or fascination. Dialogue was sloppy and ridiculous, torn heads were plentiful, and there were plenty of plot-revealing monologues to embarrass James Bond's love. Even with the support of Emmanuel Lubezki, Hollywood's most popular filmmaker today, the wonderful play of Depp and Burton's astonishing name recognition, Sleepy Hollow is nothing to lose your head.
