If rich people differ from us because they have more money, then filmmakers are different from us because they think the world cares for every thought. It seems to be self-sufficient. just because the director feels it's time to make another movie, and someone will fund it. Not every trivial idea or reflection is worth a movie (unless you are a college film student who wants to complete a course). If you have nothing to say, it is sometimes best to keep quiet. <br /> <br /> The visuals are not breathtaking. They are very ordinary. The dialogue is inevitable and incredible. They speak words no one will join each row in situations beyond imagination. Germaine Greer's zipless f ** k is finally brought to the screen. Even if you believe in love at first sight, nobody falls as easily as these characters in bed. They screw before they talk. Even more incredible is an aging chalice director who immediately finds sex with the most beautiful chick in the town, although the gravity is already at a young age. Marceau's coming.
