** Can contain spoilers ** Horrible. Just awful. I loved Stephen King's novel, and it's just a horrible adjustment to it. They change the end. They change the plot. They changed Alan Pangborne's character from a sad man to a happy fiance. If you're a fan of Stephen King's novel, stay away. Even if you are not, stay away. <br /> <br /> The book was awesomely dark, even for Steve King. An 11-year-old killed himself in the novel. A middle school is found with child pornography in the novel. It is nowhere as good as the novel. <br /> <br /> This movie is my least favorite movie of all time. I hate this movie with revenge.
