Child mortality and horror movies will always remain a sensitive and controversial combination, and so it is my personal opinion that every film that shows the courage to turn to this topic needs extra attention from horror fans. Of course, as in the case of "Wicked Little Things", controversial themes do not always ensure a good movie. Despite the potentially interesting plot, the atmospheric environment and the involvement of video-nasty director J.S. Cardone ("The Slayer"), it is an uninspired and cliché-run film that can not give a single scare or terror. After losing their husband and father, the remaining Tunny women (mother Karen and her daughters Sarah and Emma) moved to a small and remote Pennsylvania mountain village where they inherited an old ramshackle mansion. Their new home is dangerously close to the old mine ruins where dozens of innocent children lost their lives in 1913. Strange things are starting to happen, like young Emma befriending an (imaginary?) Girl who lived in their home and seems to keep the horrible Lokals secret from Karen and her daughters. It quickly turns out that the undead leave their mining excavators at night to avenge the descendants of the owner of the mine, Mr. Carlton, who was responsible for their death. "Wicked Little Things" is fairly soft and extremely predictable. The script scarcely serves an awful cliché to the other, such as car wheels that have been captured in the mud at critical times, torch losses and hearing broken dolls. There is very little tension, even less gore and the makeup effects are disappointingly poor. The zombie children are not at all threatened. In fact, they all look like miniature versions of Marilyn Manson, with their black outfits, pale faces and dark eyes. The excitement-free finale is stupid and just as distant as the rest of this senseless production. Lori Heuring is very unimportant in her leading role as the mother, but Scout Taylor-Compton (currently a big star, thanks to the Halloween remake) and young Chloe Moretz is sufficient as daughters.
