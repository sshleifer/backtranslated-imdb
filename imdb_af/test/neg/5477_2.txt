It had to be a lethargic, eager movie that was in memory as an outline of the relationship where the dominant personality only survives because the personality that is dominated does not see hope for change. <br /> <br /> The acting was intense and skillful, the dialogue worked, but the film was annoyingly ineffective: too many shots suggested that the focus was rather a broader picture. Poor flow. The first 5 minutes could be completely missed. <br /> <br /> I suspect this movie could force another change. <br /> <br /> In its present form it is flat, formless and extremely disappointing.
