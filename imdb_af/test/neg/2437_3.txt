It's hard to tell who this movie is aimed at; the characterization and style slips of a "Children's ITV" series crossed with an Aussie soap, but the subject, nudity and language purpose of an older audience. <br /> <br /> For the first half hour, heroine Justine philosophy about losing her virginity, and is unnecessarily embarrassing to anyone over the age of 18. A complete rip-off from Ferris Bueller, from the talk-to-the-camera bit to the screen graphics. <br /> <br /> Her nerdy friend, Chas, brings her to a computer show, where an explosion using a virtual reality machine turns her into a man. Or actually, create a male alter-ego of her, called Jake. Don't look at me like that; I just like the way it was shown. <br /> <br /> After that, the movie is generously amusing for a while; Among all the drama school camps, only Rupert Penry-Jones brings a real comic touch to Jake's wife-trapped-in-a-man body role. There are some funny scenes with Jake dealing with his new body and new feelings. nothing you have not seen before, but then in this movie you will link to everything that is entertaining. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Justine and Jake, and hilarious antics ensue (I wish), meet the owners of the virtual machine that Jake wants to kidnap to have sex with, or to investigate, or something. Anyway, it's just an excuse to fill an extra half hour with some explosions and motor hunters; For such a cheap movie, the explosions are often and hard, indicating that the money has been spent in all the wrong places. <br /> <br /> In the end, the heroine realizes she can't fall in love with herself, removes her alter ego, and ends in a one-night stand with the nerd to lose her virginity (that is supposedly meant to succeed for a happy ending in the 90s). But only after he had removed his glasses and put some hair on and a leather jacket; God forbids that she actually has sex with someone who looks like a nerd. Of course, it's a little subversive - in these days of PC movies telling you to love and be yourself, and that everyone is special in their own way, it's refreshingly reactionary to have a movie that " CONFORM! " Shout. with you, and treat virgins and nerds with the contempt they deserve. <br /> <br /> Characterization is simply dire; The nerd is very nerdy (room full of computers, thick glasses, social retardism, virginity, no leather jacket), there is a slut, she is very filthy (blond, tight dresses, orange brown, vampire accompanying music), there is a jock, he's very ... well, you get the picture. You can get away with this kind of characterization in a broad comedy, but "Virtual Sexuality" is not very funny. It's just almost amusing in parts, and unnecessary in others. It takes a lot for a woman like Justine (played by Laura Fraser) to annoy me, but she manages it. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the title; there is absolutely nothing erotic about the movie and it is not about the topics of how the new communication technology changes the way we see and relationships change (unless you actually think about it, it's a chance that your PlayStation can blow up and change your sex). <br /> <br />
