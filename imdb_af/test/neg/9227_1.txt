Terror in the Jungle is a real find. If you saw it, you're one of the few lucky ones. It's hilarious! <br /> <br /> The story is about a plane crashing in the middle of the South American jungle. The scene of the accident must be seen to be believed. Everyone dies in the accident or they are later eaten alive by crocodiles. Just a young blonde boy survived. A nearby tribes brings the child to their village and they (all men) honor him because of his golden hair! I don't kid you! In the end there is a lot of wrestling between the native and the man looking for any survivors of the plane. All the time the child is sitting on a throne and his blonde hair is surrounded by a golden halo and he does not shout quietly !! This is a hoot !!! <br /> <br /> Very dark and contains many questionable sub-texts. A must if you are in darkness, it's so bad - it's good movies.
