Although I watched this movie myself (grateful), I still felt ashamed as I watched it. I was invited to rent it through the reviews on the front page, and the bloody / eager camera was still sitting on the back that led me to believe it was a kind of documentary. These actors are laudable throughout the film, not convincing at all. The story involves an Italian Australian (?) Gang, fighting only other gangs and then running, fighting, repeating. Sometimes they lead very hard, which makes them better than other gangs. For some reason, I don't think they can actually beat those other guys who are twice as big. I can be wrong ... no I'm not wrong, this movie is not nice at any level. The prison fitting looks like it was a summer camp, just instead of kids, it was a sausage feast of horrible actors, just hanging out and laughing and trying hard. This movie is not worth your time, saves you money, or throws it in the garbage, it doesn't waste on this movie.
