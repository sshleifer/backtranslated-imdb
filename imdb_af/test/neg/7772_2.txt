Lazy writing, bad plays and woodwork lead us to a Canadian TV movie called HUSH, which does not get confused with about eight other movies of the same name. Tori Spelling and her doctor's hub move from SanFran to his small hometown, where they walk in his old galley, deciding that she still loves him. She gets pregnant with Tori's baby (don't ask) and starts beating anyone who can get in her way while reuniting with her old flame. The actors playing the old gal and the doctor are not worth mentioning, as they act flatter than flat. Tori is not much better, but at least she is something to focus on, as the plot deviates here and there before coming to a lot of lame and well-known confidence. Rather look at the hand that strikes the crater.
