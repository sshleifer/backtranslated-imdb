This show is terrible. I can't talk about the complete waste of the great talent this show contains. It's not an entertaining improvising play, it's just an inexpensive attempt to throw famous, well-known comedian actors on stage and they have a poorly-enhanced scene. I actually did improvisation as an actor, and this performance was not improved. <br /> <br /> What the audience actually laughs at (if they actually laugh at this show, it looks rather fake) is the embarrassment of the guest being lost like a deer in headlights. The stupid, totally unrelated things they are emerging are what people laugh at. And if it's not part of the scene, the actors will tell them it's wrong! I find this show is disgraceful for the art and makes me go for programs like Whose Line it is. Anyway, with great talent, great improvisation games and everything else I didn't change the channel.
