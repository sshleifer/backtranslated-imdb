While I agree that this is the most horrible movie ever made, I am proud to say I have a copy because I and a lot of my friends were extras (mostly in the dance club screens, but also a few others). had the potential to sign Bolo and the director of Enter the Dragon, but as someone who was the best every day, I can tell you that Robert Clouse was an old and confused individual, at least while making this movie. wondering that he could find his way to the set every day. I would also have thought it might have been a better movie if many were not destroyed in the Morning Calm studios. I can't say it would be sure, but it would be nice to think so. I was actually surprised that it was ever released, and that someone like Bolo would attach his name to it without a fight. Oh yes. Also check out the extras for the pro wrestler Scott Levy, AKA Raven. He was a wrestler in Portland at the time. Nice old, very smart.
