Ok, where to start. I can't believe how many good reviews I've read here. I watched it (year 2004) and I had to fight not to push the stop button. I decided to continue just because of all the good reviews I read. After looking at it, I felt it was my duty to let the world know about it. First, the movie looks like it will never start. The plot line doesn't actually come to about 30 minutes before the movie ends and lets the viewer wonder: "When will it start?" Never ever call it a 'revenge movie' because revenge doesn't even begin until more than half of the movie is over. Furthermore, the film is trying to make you believe it's a post-apocalyptic Australia. It is a pity that if I show dim rural roads half of the movie and a crooked letter on a board, I did not convince myself, even for 1979 it was not science fiction. So, put it together with randomly placed homoerotic subtext and you have yourself a crappy movie (I have nothing against gays, there was just nothing needed). The only good part was the first chase scene, good directing, as it was 1979, and yet another good part is how to kill the last man. So basically I recommend watching the first 10 minutes and the last 5 minutes and you'll enjoy a lot more of you than sitting in the middle, which can lead you to throw your own eyes out. Don't say I didn't warn you.
