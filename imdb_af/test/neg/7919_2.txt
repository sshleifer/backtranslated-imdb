I think this is a disappointing successor. I miss many old characters (King Gator, Anne Marie, etc.), and I don't like it because half of the original voices are not the characters again. Many Charlie lost a lot of personality, and the villain Red was not even as bad as Carface in the first. If you are a big ADGTH fan like me, it's worth seeing just how the story goes on, but don't think it's 5 stars in your book.
