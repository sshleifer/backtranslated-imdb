Well, this latest version of Mansfield Park has tried to take the nobility of the 1999 theater version (it has indeed copied some of its ideas), but shows things slightly to bring it more in line with the original story. Unfortunately, the result is a rather slender and schizophrenic production. And as with all the other versions of Mansfield Park out there, the character of Fanny Price is not true. Instead, there is a strangely childish, bleached blonde woman running around who never really developed as a character. At least in the 1999 movie, the character they call "Fanny Price" is firmly established as a rebellious tomboy who is too clever for her own. This "Fanny Price" is a complete riddle. One day, I really want to see a dramatization of Mansfield Park, which actually includes Fanny's character, as written by Jane Austen. A sweet, friendly, compassionate girl with a sly personality and poor constitution. She is readily and painfully honest, but also strong in her beliefs, indecently loyal, extremely intelligent and remarkably clever. A bit of a late bloom, it is only until her eighteenth year that she finally begins to make the transition from uncomfortable adolescent to self-controlled young woman. And she wants nothing more to live than to really make use of those she loves most. It is a wonderfully complex character that I look forward to depicting one day.
