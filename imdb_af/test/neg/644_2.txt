Some plot spoilers for. <br /> <br /> The Nashville network's so-called rebirth as "The First Network for Men" is a complete disappointment, as does its block of adult cartoons. The new Ren and Stimpy were really only terrible, "Gary the Rat", mediocre, and "Stripperella" is unavailable. This cartoon is usually boring; If "Ren and Stimpy" suffered from a great look, "Stripperella" had no decent shock gags, funny, inexorable gags, clever gags or gags, time. The concept is bad to start with: Pamela Anderson, a stripper-cum superheroine, saves "The City" from a variety of goofy supervisors. This cartoon looks like a tribute to superior wacky superhero spoofs, such as "Darkwing Duck" and "The Tick", but without the cartoons' white and good writing - or even good storyboarding. "Agent 0069" is trying to flee between goofy and sexy, but she is not, and this cartoon's failure to make one or the other brings this series off. <br /> <br /> Watch your bound episodes of The Tick, "and see what a true superhero gossip is.
