OK, so I recently collected a lot of vipco and tough titles on DVD and I have to say that this one is one of the most disappointing ones. A more recent movie compared to other titles in the Hardgore catalog was a straightforward DVD version. I've always been interested in the myth of el chokeberry since I've seen a documentary about it as a teenager. but this movie is a terrible lay shot on sticky because the storyline and acting is terrible, it has my three going to watch this movie all the way. While the cheap 80's and 90's horror movies are good because of their cheap budgets and comedy, this movie isn't. <br /> <br /> Look at other titles in the hardware series. For example, Boneyard is older, but much better.
