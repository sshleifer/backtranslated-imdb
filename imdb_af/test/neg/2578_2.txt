It's a well-known fact, Mr Seagal can't smile, he can act, he can kick, there's dull smiles, no real smile, laughs out loud and no real point to watch this confusing movie. We see an overweight Mr. Seagal as dr. Wesley Maclaren, in desperate need of a hairstyle and his true daughter Ayako, appeared in his office assistant. Story: Well, Wesley lives in another darn-outback with his lovely daughter Holly. They sit and enjoy their red blossoms and omelettes and on the other side of the town, an overweight magician decides to make the whole town sick by spreading a virus traveling in the air and killing in a matter of 2 days, thinking he could survive if he had an antidote. Problem, there is no antidote and the one that exists just holds the virus back for a while. The CIA is contacted and even they cannot help and only one person is not sick, Wesley's daughter, Holly. So she gets hunted and thinks the healing is in her blood. Wesley manages to grab his daughter and take her to her grandfather, who is a native Indian. Along with his son-in-law Ann, they go to a base where there is a hidden lab to find a cure, but even the soldiers die slowly, and so others will not find a cure in time. And to shorten the moment, neither Ann or Wesley is infected by the virus ... hmm. A weak battle scene. Terrible movie and all the men in it are in urgent need of a treadmill.
