I ordered this movie on the internet as it is very difficult to get Turkish movies where we live. I have heard so much about the TV series of my friends and almost everyone in Turkey. I expected to see a breakthrough in Turkish theater. What a disappointment. <br /> <br /> My husband and I (an admirer of any movie with a bit of Turkish landscape and Turkish dialogues in it) just went through it because we paid $ 20 for the DVD. Well, it was a boring way to waste it. <br /> <br /> It was confusing, sometimes exaggerated, while others were doing. The storyline was not only confusing, but the addition of a gay man who was with his dog on the beach, and using a toilette in the writing to make it 'Hollywood,' didn't work for me either. no. <br /> <br /> The American characters were almost too stereotypical that it wasn't funny or realistic and, like another user, the Turkish customs and lifestyle were irrelevant. <br /> <br /> The camera movements had no meaning. A few Dervishes (never seen with them in Kapadokya) and broken plates -Greek style - made the film even more confusing. <br /> <br /> I am ashamed of this movie and all the noise the press has made about it. There are surely worthy movies made by Turkish directors who deserve more attention and respect. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 1 out of 10.
