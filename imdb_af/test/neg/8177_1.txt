I don't care for some mature humor, but this feature was just dirty. The first 10 minutes consisted of Pryor who asked some guys to take pictures, followed by me even more profanities. I don't know what happened between that time and the last 5 minutes, because I went out. After I saw it, I never looked at Richard Pryor again. And to think he actually did a children's show. <br /> <br /> If profanity and tasteless, unfriendly dirty jokes make you laugh, you'll probably enjoy it. But if you're an "old-fashioned" type, don't bother it.
