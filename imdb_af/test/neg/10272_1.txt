Simply, this mini series was terrible. Let me count the ways. 1. Absurd plot. 2. Overworking. 3. Scattershot approach to characters. 4. Annoying narrative. 5. Inability to create viewer interest. <br /> <br /> This movie cannot even pass the "Soap Opera for Dummies" test. I'm sorry I didn't read this award-winning novel, so I only judge it as a movie, but it really stinks. Imagine going to a party where they show you dozens of appetizers. You look at the wide variety and want to taste, but suddenly they are withdrawn, and you wonder where they went. It's like this movie, with too many characters introduced and never taken out. There are plenty of stories and characters in this movie to create a 20 episode series, but we get less than four hours to digest it all. <br /> <br /> There are more facial expressions and reaction shots from Ed Harris if you will find at 10,000 monkeys. The pace is extremely slow. <br /> <br /> Dennis Farina and Helen Hunt are so far on top that their characters aren't credible. Joanne Woodward's character is one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> The persistent river metaphor becomes thin. <br /> <br /> And probably the most absurd part of the movie - the cat. This evil and shaky cat chasing the hero to scratch him and his seat cover - well, come on - it's not even good Stephen King! Probably the most interesting character in the movie. And one that is not well-signed is John Voss, the disturbed boy whose final act of despair is responsible for the only plot device that works in this movie. <br /> <br /> Just about everyone in this movie is incredible. <br /> <br /> To summarize, there's little here to inspire. The play is poor melodrama. It's just a terrible attempt.
