I watched this movie for the first time a few weeks ago, and it was probably one of the most boring, unusual movies I ever had to see the accident. First, Matthew Modine is a terrible actor and has devastated most of the movie. In addition, the plot is just too stupid. The only reason one watched in this movie was because of Alec Baldwin, and his character was pretty quickly eliminated. Unless you are a fan of Michelle Phiffer, you should probably avoid this movie like the plague. Many people can't afford this movie enough, but I just can't figure out what people think so great. If it's supposed to be the black humor that makes this movie so fantastic, I think anything can be comedy these days.
