I watched this movie a few months ago when it first appeared on the Blockbuster shelves. It's officially the only movie I wanted to watch. Let me start by saying I love "B" Movies. I consider "Ice Pirates" one of the best comedies ever. I will also note that I am a writer and that I was the director / writer of this film. <br /> <br /> Evaluation of the play: If I were to choose a bright spot, I would have to point out that Dion Day had an admirable acting debut with its role in it. For those who do not know, Dion is a boxer not an actor, so we will forgive him his lame death order. Why doesn't he burn the shotgun he likes once? Budget? To highlight the bad acting will take pages, so I'll keep to the egoist, Ryn Baskin. Ryn (It seems a name chosen from a cartoon because it sounded cool) has maximum face time in this movie, probably because he was a producer. His appearance is quite good, but his delivery reminds us of SNL rip on soap operas. I think he can do as much with what was written for him, but part of the debt is definitely his. <br /> <br /> Special Effects: Not my specialty, but for a low-budget movie I suppose the makeup and gun play was acceptable. It didn't bother me, but it didn't impress either. <br /> <br /> Writing / Directing: Oscar for the best script is not something I can expect Gerald Nott ever won. Not only is the plot rudimentary, but the dialogue is flat and stilted. I understand stylized hokee ness, but it was just bad writing. The thing that bothers me the most was theft. Nott stole screens, shots, and Viggo's face hair from a bunch of other movies. The scene where Russel Crow walks through the wheat field in Gladiator, Whole series of good, the bad and the ugly, that kind of thing just doesn't cut it with me. I won't choose not to comment on the shooting because I don't know what it takes to create a good shot, etc. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Don't rent this movie, don't even pirate. This. It is very bad to waste any time. The good reviews can be completely deceived after Gerry has met. He seems to be more likely to place himself.
