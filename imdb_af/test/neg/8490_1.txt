Is there any reason to relive characters 10 years after the only reason they worked for the first time was the actors they play. <br /> <br /> Who can replace Jim Carrey or Cameron Diaz - or better yet, who can replace it at cut prices, as most studios know that successors don't bring in the same amount of revenue as the original, so they get the corners of the visit cut. <br /> <br /> Where the good movies are going to play if powerful Hollywood studios can clog 3,000 theaters opening weekend, with whatever touches they feel like the general public can be caged. <br /> <br /> Enough are enough people, this successor has to stop and the Hollywood people have to get their act together or spread the much better offshore product in the limbo. <br /> <br /> Wake up Hollywood because the people woke up and they didn't buy it Just because it's new and shiny. Give us the good stuff and send the rest to the DVD shelves because we take the theaters back once and for all !!!
