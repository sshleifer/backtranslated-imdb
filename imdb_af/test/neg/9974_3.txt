This HBO original is pretty simple and pretty stupid. Armand Assante, who again does poor stallone imitation, is Ray Wellman's ex-con on parole. All he wants is his old friend Lacy, played by a young Marcia Gay Harden. Unfortunately for Ray, Lacy is addicted to Stalwart Elliot, played by Sam Neill. Further complications are that Ray's old Cell friends want some favors and they deprive Lacy of making sure they happen. Ray and Elliot team, despite mutual dislike. <br /> <br /> What follows is violent and slow, but Marcia Gay Harden shows us why his Oscar will win in the future, she is not so polished, but her raw emotion, sincerity and some very explicit nude makes it almost worth watching. Almost. <br /> <br /> Renting "Fever" (no the title doesn't fit the movie) if you're a fan of her, otherwise skip it and be thankful. Stars did better things. <br /> <br /> Note: this is a hard "R" movie for language, violence and nudity.
