Start with the assumption that you will do anything to replace your lost love with a look. Throw your scientific knowledge of a distorting disease (it's not the things Leo G. Carroll contracted from the spin-poison in "Tarantula"). Throw in the fact that the main character, instead of finding the young woman, dressing in heavy hands stalking until he draws the attention to himself and hatches this crazy plot: If he can make the girl's father sick. help him recover, she will marry him. The problem is that most of the events are random and unpredictable. Anyone with half a brain would have seen things. There is a third party, a woman who treated the doctor, played by J. Carroll Naish, with great insensitivity. You know she's going to be a factor. There is also a gorilla kept in a loft that is occasionally used for heaven, knowing what. Oh good. There is so little sense to this thing that it plays itself and people just get their desserts.
