It's basically just a stupid storytelling, almost identical to zillions of other chronicles in terms of acting, tension, plot, dialogue, characterization (or lack thereof) and pacing. <br /> <br /> The one area that deviates from "The Net" from traditional hunting films is in its subject matter: Computers. Unfortunately, the authors did not understand the differences between a calculator and a Cray! <br /> <br /> Computer news should not see this movie, as it will make them paranoid about computers. No matter what Hollywood is trying to tell us, it's just not that easy to remove someone's identity by hacking. There is still too much paper documentation in the world, and there was more in 1995. <br /> <br /> Computer professionals should not see this movie. I mean, a magical virus that can melt your entire computer when you "escape"? Please. And the whole virus, including the cool multimedia effects of your screen resolution (what is it all about?) Can fit on a single 1.44mb disk? Yes, whatever.
