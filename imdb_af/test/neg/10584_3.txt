It's not fair. I really expected it to be a hilarious, entertaining movie. I mean, I like Drake Bell from Drake and Josh, and Leslie Neilson has nothing to think about since his earliest classic, airplane and naked rifle. But after seeing Superhero movie, I'm glad I didn't even have to pay for it. It would not have been near the $ 9 ticket. More like a dollar and a few pennies. Because it will sum up for hours and minutes. And as disappointing as this movie, I was glad the run time was so short, or not shorter. I can't believe how incredibly vulgar, unnecessary, and above all, STOP, some of the scenes were! And above that, I saw better because of a wooden dummy (without the ventriloquist). It's as if Craig Mazin deliberately wanted to make a movie that earned her 3.7, if not lower, and even worse than "Meet the Spartans". Very disappointing indeed.
