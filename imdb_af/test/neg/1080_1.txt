It's a turbulent Hollywood remake of a classic British film. All that entertained the original "Italian Job" was released from this film by Donna and Wayne Powers and flawlessly "directed" by F Gary Gray. I am surprised that Troy Kennedy Martin (the original film's screenwriter) used his name in the pig's ear credit. Martin has worked on some of the best film and TV projects of the past 40 years. Although it is vaguely associated with this stinker, it is not a good thing. <br /> <br /> The humor is being forced, the drama is complicated, all the characters are cookie cutters like crims (with the exception of Charlize Theron's amazing, beautiful <br /> <br /> (1) Three Minis ( the modern BMW versions, but Minis is) <br /> <br /> (2) Using the names Croker and Bridger for 2 of the main characters <br /> <br /> (3) Disruption of a city traffic management system to provide a safe route through it. <br /> <br /> (4) There is. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, what you get is a mere and indisputable US add-on number story movie in which a gang of chocolate pirates finally gets the best of their evil associates ... Believe me, it feels like a very long time before they do it, throwing their best with what they are given but they all seem to have accepted it as a polishing exercise after reading the script, none of the original film's peculiar nature and clear British fragrance survived in the llywood hamburger machine to be fed. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and look at the original 1969 movie instead of this suck breast. It is a wonder that Noel Coward did not do a Nelly aunt, jumped out of his grave and kicked the teeth of all those involved in these light remakes halfway down their throat. <br /> <br /> Italian Job? More like Italian Jobbie.
