For the first fifteen minutes, NAKED FAME's story is interesting: two late-thirties male pornstars in a seemingly healthy relationship decide to leave the porn industry and try for the world of singing and acting. The two very buff and preening men are Colton Ford and Blake Harper. With the help of Kevin Aviance and Marc Berkely, Colton makes a dance track that is then being marketed in New York, hoping that Colton Ford will be an instant star - a unique disco singer who exerts his background as a Pornetjie for PR . /> <br /> The rest of the film is merging and commenting and commenting by Porn Producer ChiChi LaRue and the film is slowly recurring and doldrums. Not a bad idea for a movie if there was a little more depth revealed in each character's drive to move away is a successful career (although one is largely influenced by the youth who lost both characters ) in an alternative one. It's just that a one-note song carries thinly fast. Grady Harp, November 05
