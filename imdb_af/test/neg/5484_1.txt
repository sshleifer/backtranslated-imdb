Remember when Rick Mercer was funny? 22 minutes was a good show when Rick Mercer was on it and Made In Canada was also a good show. Talking to Americans was also such a strange special. But as my friend said, "Rick Mercer one day woke up and was no longer funny." I think that day was when Rick Mercer's report was on the air. What's the point of this show? Rick Mercer reads wacky false headlines, shows photos of bad shacks that people email in and then goes about 20 minutes of the 30 minute show, go somewhere and just talk to people who hope to say something funny or clever to come on TV And maybe even make someone laugh somewhere. We must be interested in the view that Rick Mercer is visiting a gymnastics team and then trying to do their moves and then deliberately suck while trying desperately to be "funny". Rick Mercer grew old or just lost interest or just no more funny. Even his classic rantbits lost all their bites and humor. You can say it about the CBC comedy in general, but because they've been holding Air Farce on TV for years to deliver the same kind of useless jokes?
