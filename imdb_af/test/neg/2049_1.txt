worst. Movie. ever made. Ever. I have no words to say about it, others have no point, no plot, no ... anything. pure shit !!! I don't know how everyone in the movie shoots their shelves after watching it .... .... .... I love vampire flashes and mysteries, and alternative abstracts outside the boxing movies, and. ... it wasn't from that. I mean what the crap !!! I can't even tell what the film was about cuz, I still don't know and I just wasted an hour and a half of my life to see it ... bottom line. I think the creator of this movie just wants everyone to do drugs. that's the only thing i got from this movie. Please don't watch this ... I mean for a "sultry sensual vampire girl" there wasn't even the nudity you'd get from a vamp girl. anyway back to my point .... this movie is blowing. will set you on fire.
