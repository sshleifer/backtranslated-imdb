I only add to the chorus of people who considered it "incompatible". I would point out the following without clearly explaining the obvious FLAWS by some of the other commentators. The film was shot on video (what kind of camera I didn't know), but the cameraman had it all at AUTOFOCUS (!) All the time so that any light movement let it in and out of focus. In many of the scenes, the actors themselves are out of focus for their scenes. It only shouts "Amateur". <br /> <br /> I also heard that it was in the middle of the wheat field, you could hear the sound of the petrol generator that was lightening the lights ... loud. /> <br /> What's up with that single lighting source (and often the actors) when they walk around. It looks like a new writer with that 'on camera light' that follows the people like a spotlight. There was no 'credit' for lighting design / DP and I know why. The "filmmakers" didn't need to have someone who actually knew what they were relieving this picture (note, I didn't say a movie). So be prepared for a simple spotlight as the only source of 'movie lighting' for most movies. UGhhh !!! <br /> <br /> It's probably the most technically indecent production I've ever released commercially. I bought this title because I like bad theater. Usually it's so bad you can laugh at it. It's just as bad that it's unshakable. Planned nine of the outer space is "Citizen Kane" compared to this title.
