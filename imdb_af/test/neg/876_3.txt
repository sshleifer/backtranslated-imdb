One-time, disconnected, middle-class housewife in the midst of a divorce is seeking comfort in thinking about her immediate future. By a kind of bed and breakfast by (well, literally in the sea) the ocean which for some kind of strange reason she maintains for the owner. Give lonely, arrogant Richard Gere. He is a plastic surgeon. He is the only guest at the inn in the sea. Diane Lane is the lonely housewife. You will never fall in love with these two falls. A tropical storm makes them true lovers. <br /> <br /> The subplots in this melodrama make little or no sense. The places, photography is good. Gere remains one of the most over-rated actors in the theater and disappointed. Mrs. Lane needs the money, but call in her part with grace.
