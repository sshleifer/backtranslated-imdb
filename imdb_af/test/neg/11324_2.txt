Wow, I swear it never happened to me? I just watched "Golden Temple Amazons" yesterday and I have not yet the slightest reminder of anything that happened in this movie. That's how brilliant this movie is, I think! By this time, I just remembered it lured me to watch it because of the incredibly attractive DVD cover art, which shows a dry drawing of a lascivious Amazon that makes her bow to fire on an indefinite target. I am often deceived by attractive DVD covers? especially Jess Franco children ?? and I still haven't learned to resist even literally hundreds of terrible experiences. Oh, good? After reading the other user comments, some parts of my memory returned, although I am still presumably watching this movie with another masterpiece by Jess Franco, which I saw earlier that day, "Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro" (and yes, that one has a wonderful DVD cover). <br /> <br /> "Golden Temple Amazon" opens with a post of warm white African amazons ?? I'm aware of the contradiction but don't blame me ?? the parents of a fragile young girl slaughtered because they had the grass with the intention of stealing the golden treasures from the temple. Several years and hormonal changes later, the girl returns to the jungle to get her revenge. She is accompanied by a lot of crazy adventurers who are less interested in the act of revenge, but do not mind taking a few golden homes. The rudimentary premise is, of course, secondary to all the appearance of surprising female nudity and gratuitous sleaze. Anal√≠a Ivars, Eva Leon and the other unnamed Amazons are all regular Franco choices and volunteer with their breasts proud. You can look better at all these perfect feminine curves, as the rest of the Golden Temple Amazons is a boring and incompetent mess. There is hardly any violence or action and no less than half of the film is pure filler, pieces of National Geographic documentary that are in the story and that kind of stuff. The wonderful DVD cover would definitely be a good addition to your collection, but opening the box is completely useless.
