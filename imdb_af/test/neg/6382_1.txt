I got this movie from the library and see it has many actors I like in it (John Cleese, Ian Holm, Ralph Richardson, etc.), So I got it and watched. I expected Cleese to play a big role since he had the first bill. I was surprised to find out that he had about five minutes of screen time, with everyone I wanted. This movie is incredibly useless, the characters are nobodies, the plot doesn't exist, and the end is one of the worst endings I've ever seen. There were some funny parts, but that's about it. Stay away from this movie if you want to avoid going "What?" and "Huh?" And if you don't want to waste your time. Ignore the people who say this is a very funny movie ... it's not. Just keep away at all costs, please.
