It was one of the slowest movies I ever had the dissatisfaction to go through. After the introduction where we get a few people in a farmhouse, we tell a bit of a white loser family moving to a farm. And nothing happens for a long time. Then they meet this drifter who helps on the farm, and nothing happens again for a very long time. Then at last the family's girlfriend did some platter geistic things. Then more happens, the brave man goes nuts and the movie ends. In the meantime, it's about how this family had to move out, because the girl came back in trouble, and they have no money and so I care less about these pathetic people. I can't believe I actually went to the theaters to see it! Not only did this movie suck, but a few dollars a hole answered his cellphone, stupid morons made noise and sucked the movie. THAT THIS TEATER SUCK - Bad movies, excessive food, and idiots in the theater, I stay home and watch DVDs from now on, at least I can smoke when I was at home while watching this silly movie. Stay home and bake a little rather than go to a theater to see this piece of typical crap. Stupid silly crap.
