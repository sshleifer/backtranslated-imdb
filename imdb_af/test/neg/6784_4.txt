Visually beautiful with fine music, otherwise this movie has a fair hit for TV quality. The romance between two characters, which has a cultural and educational division, is simply not plausible. Of course, we knew from early on that we would relieve our careless heroine, win over locals and find true love, but it doesn't make it any worse that the movie had to take such completely anticipated turns. This film has a lot of promise, which makes it more regrettable that the promise is unrealized. Perhaps a nice shelter on a cold night-free cable, but I would definitely not recommend renting or buying. I'm sure the soundtrack is great.
