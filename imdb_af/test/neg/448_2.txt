Let's describe Larry as an interviewer: a complete sucker, in every possible way. He laughs at all his guests jokes, he asks the most boring questions and he never dares to contradict them. He strikes me as the kind of person who likes to be loved by ... everyone. Friendly, boring, unpredictable Harry. He's probably guilty of being a dream catcher for celebrities, because they aren't bombarded with what we, the people want to know and have the right to know. Let's put it this way: he interviews as if he's in a red country. 02/10, 2 for the guests coming to the show, but it seems senseless when Larry starts asking questions like "What does it look like a mother?" followed by the usual answer to the lines of "Being a mother is the biggest thing that ever happened to me: it's wonderful, but tiring."
