This is almost Ed Wood. Yes, the ridiculous wreck of a flying monster looks like a cross between a turkey buzzard and a bad day at the dentist's office. And the sound effect screams fingernails over a blackboard sound like Mozart. And why The Giant Claw when the goofy butter hits his victims with a mechanical jaw. We get great close-ups of the ugly chicken feet, but nothing more. I think the producers thought that a more appropriate title Big Mouth could suggest a Jerry Lewis comedy. And talking about comedies, all that "anti-case" gobbledy-gook is funny than anything in a Lewis movie. I think the scripts were stuck for a reason why an ordinary duck hunter couldn't take a 1950's flying threat, so they attacked a real killer - anti-matter from another galaxy. Yup, this refugee from KFC is supposed to fly in from another galaxy behind a shield of anti-matter, as explained in turbulent detail by one of the film's resident geniuses. In this case, it is Jeff Morrow, a pilot I collect in his hours, Einstein to the secrets of the universe. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's also Morrow who keeps the ridiculous proceedings out of the bad movie Hall of Shame, as he actually delivers his lines with a straight face. And he even sounds like he believes it. It's a first-order movie acting triumph. Morrow deserves a combat medal to play for the Oscars, in addition to the call of duty under the extreme bad movie circumstances. Look at the front lady Corday, then you can see his strength under fire. She looks as if she has just woken up in a bad dream and maybe she will see her up when she stands still. I barely did. Oh, the first time I've seen this invasion disaster, was through a cattle rage in the back row of what is now a housing development. I had learned my lesson and broke another 12 pack.
