After watching this movie a few times, I came to the conclusion that Milos Forman made a very daring decision to make a mug for Goya, when the artist led the most a stormy, passionate life would consider, while the French Revolution and the Napoleonic era raged across Europe, certainly one that would have enough drama to draw. Understanding that Mr Forman was devastating the world in the microcosm of Ines's tragedy at that time, I felt that so much of Goya was left out, so much of his humanity. The strongest and most eloquent point this film made was that each one of us is a potential villain in the stream of life. Each one of us is angry with us to fight us with the help of God. How eloquent as Goya says he must have helped Ines more, how true to all of us! We must defend and protect the innocent. The wonderful ironic scene in which the once-imprisoned priest is sentenced to death is Lorenzo, who originally condemned him, the death sentence. I left even more when the credits rolled. Perhaps less of the unreal coincidences, and more of the inner life of the characters.
