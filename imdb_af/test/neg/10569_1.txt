It's awful! It's like someone who gave a child a faulty video camera and $ 30 and said they should make a movie. Even then you get a better and more professional movie than that. The story is so stupid that you can say there is none. I don't think the man who made it knew what to do - look at strange art movies all day, is not enough to make someone a direct director. The acting is very bad, really nursery school and the writing is just awful. The only scene I didn't hate was the one with the caravan accident, but it just means it's just a little less horrible than the rest of the movie. How do people get finance for these things? I don't care about alternative movies, but shouldn't they at least not be a big steaming pile of cowboy? I call 'Price of Milk' amateur if it wasn't an insult to amateurs. It won't even be a good movie if you were drunk or drug!
