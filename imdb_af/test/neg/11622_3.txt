The plot sketch of this movie is similar to the original. Someone is kidnapped, the prince is saving her, Odet turns into a Swan, the tortoise / frog / parrot is the best "bad" wizard. And anyway, there's not much new. here. With the exception of a lack of familiar voice talent. Sorry, no Palance or Cleese and so Jean-Bob was a disappointment.
