I must say, when I saw this film on a 6.5 on this site, I thought it was worth having a view. I was very disappointed. From almost the opening scene, it is clear that the two alleged FBI agents are actually the killers. Could they have made it more obvious? If it's the intended "twist" in this movie, it's pretty sad. While Pullman and Ormond are excellent actors, even their talent is not a game for a reprehensible bad writing. Pullman instantly acts on the part of a sociopathic killer ... and that's the problem. There is no switch from "I play FBI guy!" to "I just killed 12 people and boy, my arms are tired." You can't blame the actors ... the story fails in much more ways than one. <br /> <br /> However, from the start of the movie I was sure I was wrong, no director / writer ever to be so obvious about a plot of twist. Ormond and Pullman should only act strangely to divert the viewer's attention from the right killers. I thought ... that gave the film's makers too much credit. I had to follow my instincts and turn off the movie before it even made it past the 15-minute point. <br /> <br /> For Lynch's credit, she managed to interpret many things that make a good movie: sex, violence, humor and well-trained actors. Too bad they were in the wrong setup. Hopefully, Pell James can get rid of this role ... I found her performance particularly impressive, as the astonishing drug addict will be saved. She had to rewrite the role so that the "crack whore" would win. <br /> <br /> The people who compared this movie to Natural Born Killers note: Tarantino rejects the characters of Mickey and Mallory, but sympathetic. The artworks of the film conquer the gore, and this is not even seen in Surveillance. Surveillance just wants it to be Natural Born Killers ... In fact, it has wet dreams to even be a fraction of what that movie is. People who haven't seen Surveillance ... stick to something with a little more intelligence. Like Camp Rock.
