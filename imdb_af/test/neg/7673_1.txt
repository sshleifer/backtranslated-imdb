The last of the "Airport" continued. It has Alain Delon and George Kennedy (who were in all the airport movies) as pilots; David Warner (!!!) as the radio engineer; Susan Blakely as a newswoman targeted for death; Robert Wagner as a brilliant scientist (stop laughing); Eddie Albert as airline president; Charo in a terrible "comic" bit; John Davidson as a newcomer (love how his hair stays even after the plane gets upside down!); arm Martha Raye is humiliated; Cicely plays Tyson a mother who flies a heart to her dying son (stop rolling your eyes!); Jimmie Walker as a clarinet player (what did I say to not laugh?); Mercedes McCambridge as a Russian gymnastics coach (OK you can laugh about it); Bibi Andresson as a hooker and Sylvia Kristel and Sybil Danning as love interests. <br /> <br /> Just pathetic. Full silly plots and dialogue that will roar you - watch Davidson get married on the plane near the end! The Concorde takes all these people to Russia. They are attacked with missiles, escaped, land safely in France and take off again the next day! Don't you think the flight would have been canceled or something? Most of the acting is horrible - McCambridge is a face that appears in a red horror and a terrible false accent. The only good play is from Kennedy and Delon (look fantastic) which gives a very interesting show. Yet it is not enough to put you through this pace. Too long and bad special effects too. It was a megabomb and (thankful) stop Universal anymore.
