It's really one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Rod Steiger, who is starring like the grandfather's grandfather, Charlie, is in full-working mode and hopes that the flash is, the better his performance (Cue buzzer sound). Rod Steiger is one of the last true film legends and to see him in this movie (although End of Days is the 2nd worst film I've ever seen) is really heartbreaking. From the bad story to the infinite direction, it becomes clear that the only reason this film was made is that the producer's name ended in DeLaurentis. The only good thing about this movie is that it's so bad, it's really hysterical. Look for the flashback scene where Rod is a Superman Jor El wig and a big black mustache. One just hopes that his succession film, I believe in America, will save Uber producer Kevin Arbouet and leave a good taste in everyone's mouth.
