As I watched this episode, I watched the watch and waited for something to happen. As the hour came, I thought they were going to give us a big doll, and then - nothing. The whole family is surrounded by the Christmas tree, like something from the Hallmark canal, then fades to black. Perhaps this is one of the poorest season finals I've ever seen. Nothing needs to be excited for any season. The only thing thrown out as any kind of incentive to watch the next season was the ambiguous nugget offered by Agent Harris while putting a sub-sandwich that the guys in New York were looking for one of the guys in New Jersey. Wow really? I'll never expect anything from mobsters, I'm on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> It seems almost everyone is trying to lose interest. They start more plot lines that eventually disappear than any show I've ever seen. They pest and hint, but rarely deliver anymore. <br /> <br /> What are the Arabs hanging from the Bing? They keep it in front of us and throw them in hand and magic happens nothing. <br /> <br /> Paulie knee picks up a kid after Tony promised his mother that nothing would happen to her son and poof. /> <br /> And how much more winding drug assemblies with Christopher should we endure? Please, let him be arrested or overdose or something interesting. <br /> <br /> It was one of the few shows I have ever seen before but now it is forgotten.
