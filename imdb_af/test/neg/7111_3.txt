One day I was sick and had switching channels and I came to this terrible rank. The plot and even the subplots (if you can find one) are done to extinction. BUT, as bad as the story, I discuss a special comment for Liza Minelli. Her character was absolutely one of the most annoying characters I ever had the accident to watch on film. Her only two rivals in this category are John Leguziamo in "The Pest" and Julia Stiles in anything she did (or half done). Perhaps she did exactly as the script suggested or perhaps (groan!) This is the limitation she has on her acting. Anyway, they had to rewrite and murder in the first 30 seconds of the film (eg like the girl who fell from the balcony in Deadly Weapon (I) (but at least she had nice breasts)) / > <br /> Mostly Humbly Submitted ...
