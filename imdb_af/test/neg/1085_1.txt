This movie was pure boredom from beginning to end. Okay, so I salute Boorman for increasing the worldwide recognition of events in Burma, but that's all he achieved. About 10 minutes into the movie I thought, "No, here we go again," and I could tell you exactly what will happen in the next 80 minutes. Patricia Arquette was in such a role in her depth, and her acting was wood and unconvincing. Note that you are being sown with such a very conventional script, perhaps boring and so reflected on the screen. Much of the movie was just nice. At one stage, Arquette's elderly companion was shot and he was put down on the ground. In the next scene he jumps through the forest, of course he tries to break the world 100 meter record! - or maybe he just tries to run away from Boorman !!. If you find it hard to sleep one night, Beyond Rangoon plays on your VCR and you will soon snore. I rarely criticize a movie so heavily, but in this case it is quite justified.
