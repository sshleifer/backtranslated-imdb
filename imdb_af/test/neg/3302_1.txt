What can be said about a movie that looks like two hours like three weeks? The hero starts in ninjaville, Japan, goes through an identity crisis (saves a shinobi), makes a trip to America (beats a slave named Sam) involved in a little wild west action (saves a French / Japanese Native American name Julie), hunting pirate's gold, and then back to Japan to fight a war. Of course, the movie has no idea where it goes at any time; I think the director modeled every scene after the last movie he watched. If you watch this movie, I suggest you rent the subtitles so you and your friends can openly discuss how stupid the movie is without talking about the movie, probably miss another stupid plot change. <br /> <br /> Movies The director watched this movie: an American Tail, Fievel Goes West, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, The Goonies, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Kung Fu, Vampire Hunter D, The Ten Commandments. <br /> <br /> Interests - Most fear inspiring line of all time. About 90 minutes (or 19 days) in the movie, the main character has just spent an American villain, and just as one of the chiefs goes to the VCR to end the pain, the hero states: "Let's go back to Japan . " another week.
