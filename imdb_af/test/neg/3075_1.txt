Years ago I caught a pretty well-made TV movie entitled "Linda". It was made in 1973, and played Stella Stevens in the femme fatal title role. Imagine my surprise when I unfolded the same story on the late night TV over ten years later. However, this was the 1993 version, with Virginia Madsen. Don't get me wrong, I can handle remakes, even unclear. But this badly written and poorly filmed correction made me sorry for Madsen and co-star Richard Thomas. Unlike the original, the dialogue was clicked here, which made me wonder, "Why did they bother to write it again?" Secondly, the work of the camera is very heavy-handed, and the movie stock is poor. Sometimes I reminded Christopher Guest's "The Big Picture" at the beginning of the student film competition. Finally, the cast seems either bored (Madsen) or suffering (Thomas). In fact, the only one who seems to be really enjoying the job is Ted McGinley. Of course, he really does work with his perfect work on "The Love Boat", with his perfectly dressed hair and shaved teeth. Bottom line, to borrow a criticism from Opus the Penguin in Bloom County: <br /> <br /> "This movie is for film that Jonestown did for Coal Aid." <br /> <br /> Thomkat
