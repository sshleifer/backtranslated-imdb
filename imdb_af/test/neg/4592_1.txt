This movie is terrible. A real hockey fan must assume that the people who appeared in this movie never played or watched a real hockey game. I hope it would be an "old movie", but the only people likely to enjoy this movie are women between the ages of 13-17. The booth screens are terrible, playing defensemen as they are 5 years old, goalkeepers dive on shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, and so on. It's so hard to predict the end of this movie, though! For those who saw it, who would guess? For those who haven't seen it, don't waste your time! <br /> <br /> I found it less than half way through the movie. Calling this movie is a drama ridiculous !!
