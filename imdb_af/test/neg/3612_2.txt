A group of tourists are stranded on a Snake Island after an unfortunate accident with their boat. They are forced to spend the night and, as you probably suspect, it is not called Snake Island because it's just as much fun to say. It has a history of people disappearing one by one due to the large snake population. happens to this poor stupid soul. It is a very boring and typical movie featuring tons of off-screen snake attacks and turbulent performances by NOBODY actors. The only entertaining scene was an absolutely unnecessary and forced strip scene that could not see anything, in a PG13-given movie, people. If you're in snake movies, watch SSSSSSS, but don't torture yourself with this crap.
