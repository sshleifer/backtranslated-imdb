This is a road movie. At least the movie is yellow and I think it represents a road movie (?). I can't say very positively about the delivery. It's bad acting, sure they are English. Camera looks like it's done by a child, there's a bomb with a counter, and suddenly a Beetle falls out of the air. Since it was such a click, we actually learned all the time - and that was the most fun of the movie. This movie has to be released in America, but I'm not sure you should go because it may suggest the quality we produce. The explosions seem boring. Basically, everything is at the top. Everything is just too much: the yellow quality, the sound, the babe, etc. Find all the cliche parts in other movies, put it together and you have The Delivery.
