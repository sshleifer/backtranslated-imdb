This show is like watching someone in training to offer a performance one day. There are some good comedy ideas and tons of mediocre. It does not seem like the authors know the difference between what is funny and what is just strange or coarse. <br /> <br /> It has moments. When Spike made a neighbor repeat her dog to repeat his grass, it peaked. But the hilarious moments are too little, and there are too many experimental comedy bits that miss the point. <br /> <br /> The show is better than saying a test pattern or watching the QVC network, but it needs some better authors. . <br /> <br /> Read the glowing positive IMDb comments on this show. I am convinced that most of them were written by the show staff and family and personal friends of Spike. <br /> <br /> It's just Most of the time isn't very good.
