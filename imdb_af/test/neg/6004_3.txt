A clumsy rip-off from Se7en and not suitable for cleaning his shoes. The word 'predictable' should have been invented just like this. Lambert is as always (his moments of 'emotion' are laughing, as is his accent). The 'climax' is not so, because we had so many signals, and by the end we are simply immune to flesh, rotting and otherwise. Quite a real mess.
