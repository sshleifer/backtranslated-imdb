I spent almost ninety minutes through this horrible movie that was waiting for some revelation about dance or spirit or inspiration or something! What makes the filmmakers able to do this? It is an old woman of limited talent who is obsessed with herself and nothing else. To fill in a story without a point, we get a few things about the other people in her gallery, her help to burros, and of course her ten cats! Don't see this movie. And nothing more to do with anyone who loved it - they have no idea. There are fascinating people in this world with wonderful stories to tell and insights to share - but Marta Becket is not one of them. The people I took to this movie said they had forgiven me - but they would never stop making me.
