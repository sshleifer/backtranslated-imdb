How many times do I have to write the words boring and not funny on this page until I get up to ten lines. George is originally an actor like Alfalfa of the little Rascals. Although it's probably a bit for Alfalfa. How many times have I played crappy movies in these overpaid actors before I learn that there is only one law in the film industry. Take the money and make a movie - even if it's a crap. They spend millions making this movie, but can't take a few moments to see the end result. And Renee GoAwayZigger should stop using the illegal drugs she is and seek medical help for the facial problems she is experiencing. At least I hope she is drugs because she is quite unattractive as she speaks to the side of her mouth. This movie wasn't funny or dramatic, and these hacks just have to stop making such things. George and Ren√©, you have to be ashamed of yourself and stop cringing greedy.
