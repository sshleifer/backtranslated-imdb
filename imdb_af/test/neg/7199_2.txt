This is the first movie I saw of Italian Ed Wood, Demofilo Fidani aka Miles Deem. The above title was added abundantly later, as there is another similar title in 1961 with Richard Basehart, who was Hammer Films' Michael Carreras an only stitch in the West; The true Italian title was originally translated as his name was SAM WALBASH, but they called him AMEN ?? although it was actually WALLACH in the Italian variant which obviously means a tribute to all kinds of Hollywood actor Eli! <br /> <br /> While it was definitely not uncompromising, there were ambiguities and inconsistencies, so I was often in the cry of laughter: an awful number by an irresistible French chanteuse; a completely irrelevant bar-room noise; actors do somersaults when they are shot; an elderly village doing an impromptu dance routine; inefficient use (indeed abuse) of slow motion; and easily, the most boring, since Gordon Mitchell and Lincoln Tate play two rifle fighters (who play the actors' own names!) designated by the villain to kill the title character and never appear in the rest of the movie not! ! <br /> <br /> Leading actor Robert Woods just whispers the Amens over the bodies of his victims. Supporting actress Simonella Vitelli (actually the director's own daughter!) Like the villain's broad one is quite a viewer, but unfortunately she doesn't get much in the movie? despite a change of heart to the end. The main music theme is actually pretty good, but again the title song is tough in itself.
