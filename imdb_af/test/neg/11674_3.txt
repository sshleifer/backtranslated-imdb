I feel terribly sorry! Where the Lubitsch peak was enchanting, wonderful, full of spirit and elegance, this one is just here - colored! Lana looks like 51 (actually she was 31, but of course depressed) and tried to play a shy and dull girl. Think of Jeanette McDonald, who gave the widow the role of double-grounded by playing with Count Danilo. That Lana had to play an operetta, though it couldn't sing - crazy! She sings only one song - the title role of a Lehar operetta, it's really funny! The only really good thing is the big waltz scene at the end: glamorous! And after watching this scene - watch the launch of the waltz scene in "Gentle Prefer Blondes"! Any agreements?
