I saw this movie today, hoping it will be a semi-intelligent story. I was very disappointed as it didn't. The plot, and the main character's decisions, were so far-fetched. I was hoping for a "Dog Day Afternoon" movie, but instead had something completely unacceptable. I was really hoping that the "hero" had to be turned off, and I had barely walked out of the theater on several occasions when it had to happen, but didn't. Heist movies are not a good movie, and one tried to be like that. Every few minutes during the second half of the movie I told myself, "no way". Without giving away the whole story, it revolves around an armored car guard who was occasionally financial and whose house was in negative. He was invited to come and accept a lift just to return after the action started. Poor.
