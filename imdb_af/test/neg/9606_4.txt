I tried to give this show a chance, but it's really not good with me. Although the performances are good, the writing is not. The two oldest step brothers, Derek and Casey, are equally irritating; I get the impression that we have to tilt with Casey as she is the main character, but I don't like her at all. The parents are constantly portrayed as completely clueless. The three younger children are the most visible things on the show; Lizzie and Edwin are as nice as they work together, and Marti is wealthy. The plot lines are a bit far-fetched and the whole assumption is mostly difficult to swallow - mixed families are common, yes, but this family doesn't really try to interfere with everything. Generally speaking, I think it would rate thumbs down.
