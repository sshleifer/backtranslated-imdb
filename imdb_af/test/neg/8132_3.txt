I really wanted to keep this movie, but it hardly picked a 3. It is surprising that equal votes are 10, the other half. 1. All the characters were entertaining and even talented, but overall the movie didn't pay off. . Sebastian Hernandez is attractive; charismatic and likeable (he even looks like Marc Anthony in a more accessible but ultimately conscious way of way ...), but even he cannot save this mess of a movie. Screens have been dragged too long and points are finally killed. The banana scene looked at self-absorption, which apparently showed how much movement was in its boxers. But in his defense it was his first movie as director (of which I am aware) and I appreciate his loving love. It just left me empty, despite what I said. Eventually I think the story would be better handled by a more experienced director. From what I've seen of the 'extras', there is a real story behind this and maybe I'll appreciate the effort more if I'm done watching.
