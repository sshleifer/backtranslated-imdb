Why are the forces that continue to throw Jennifer Lopez into incredible roles? She was excellent in Selena, and pretty good at Money Train, which both rolled her in roles where she could actually be. However, roles like this draw only the line. I could never see Lopez as an FBI agent (out of sight of that unbelievable performance), but as a psychotherapist? Give me a break! <br /> <br /> Basically, Lopez plays the aforementioned psychotherapist, involved in virtual reality experiments in which she enters the patient's minds to help them sort out their problems. When she comes into the minds of a comedian serial killer to help one of his victims, she breaks all the rules to try to crack the madness of his inner mind. <br /> <br /> Lopez's acting is usually below average. I can't get the highlight of a voice she has. She's not Julia Roberts, yet she appears on the screen as if she believes she's on the same playing field. Well, she's not even in the same stadium. Sure, she's a very sexy lady; However, it will not carry a movie, and it certainly does not carry this one. With someone else using her role for this movie, it would have been great, especially if it was thrown with someone who could give more credibility to the character. <br /> <br /> It all said, this movie is visually amazing. . The colors are fantastic, and the story line is not halfway in a B movie. The sound here is also fantastic. This movie wins points for the pretty original story, and key points for what it looks and sounds. Unfortunately, the acting and poor casting pieces bring a few hooks. <br /> <br /> My rating: 6/10
