Bad plot, bad play, bad direction. <br /> <br /> It has possibilities but has not achieved anything. <br /> <br /> This movie looks like someone started with an idea, a little googled information and then tried to thrive an hour and a half with lots of night shots and bad tension music. <br /> <br /> Others had to stop watching because they were 2/3 of the way through - I had to take a break just because I didn't care anymore. <br /> <br /> Remind me of an episode of Days of our Life with a little more tension. <br /> <br /> Not bad.
