"Many of the movies I made could probably have been just as good 50 years ago, and that's just because I have many old-fashioned values." - Steven Spielberg <br /> <br /> Some points .. <br /> <br /> 1. Although this movie is a loose remake of "A Guy Named Joe", it also lends a lot of "a case of life and death "and" wings of desire ". <br /> <br /> 2. It was Spielberg's second attempt to be Frank Capra. <br /> <br /> 3. Spielberg often said he wanted to make a "Frank Capra movie" in the action of "It's A Wonderful Life" and "Mrs Smith Goes To Washington". As a result of his recent efforts to get a Harvey remake out of the way, Spielberg still seems to like this dream, the director didn't really like his last 3 businesses in Capracorn. <br /> <br /> 4. Critics at that time were "Always" based, stating that the extended action series are derived from the movie's romance, but that is not the problem at all. The problem is that "Always" requires much more special effects to distract us from the fact that Spielberg can't run a line of dialogue that doesn't end on an exclamation point. <br /> <br /> 5. The movie is filled with comedy that just doesn't work. Spielberg's comic taste is not very sophisticated, and really looks like the 1950s screw balls and Looney Tune cartoons. This exaggerated ancient force works in a cartoon universe, but in a movie it just looks like a strange marriage. <br /> <br /> 6. The movie's main couple comes across as brother and sister, not lovers. Spielberg's films are always anxious about sex and intimacy, but this movie is going to be extreme: she's a wisecracking tomboy and he's a wisecracking old man. They are more irritating than engaging. <br /> <br /> 7. The movie contains one good scene in which John Goodman argues with Holly Hunter, but the movie's characters are too annoying. There is no subtlety, every emotion survives, every joke about design, every row filled with unnecessary business. <br /> <br /> 8. "Always" and "Hook" Spielberg learned how to listen. After their failure (and the double financial failures of "The Color Purple" and "Empire of the Sun"), Spielberg plunged the goofy color scheme of "Color Purple" and "Empire of the Sun" into favor of the more saturated "black and white "world of" Schindler's List "," Munich "," Minority Report "and" Saving Private Ryan ". From here, "less light" and "dark cinematography" are equated with "serious subjects". <br /> <br /> 9. Following the financial success of every "dark movie", Spielberg returns to his color kinematics and falls flat on his face again. "Amistad" followed "Schindler's List", "AI" followed "Ryan" and "Lincoln" followed "Munich". These "color" films are always tied up because they are too tough, sentimental, crooked and hokey, but the truth is, if you remove the desaturation, all these "serious" films will feel the same. <br /> <br /> 10. Since the 1970s, Spielberg has been trying to distinguish itself from the other brat pack directors (Scorsese, De Palma, Coppola, etc.), by pretending to be an "optimist" and "humanist". He repeatedly said it himself during many interviews at the end of the 70's. The reality, however, is that he is probably the biggest sadistic of all these directors, the form of his films, which often undermines their content, always showing their boxing performances in relation to their brilliant displays of massacre. <br /> <br /> 11. The failure of Spielberg to link with any of the characters in "Always" and the pleasure he instead shows for filming forest fires, crashing planes, etc. the rest of his filmography perfectly. People who like dinosaurs, sharks, Nazis, tripods, rocks, etc. Walk. This is what Spielberg enjoys. The moment his characters stop talking, everything is self-destructive. A movie like Amistad failed, in other words because there were not enough black people dying and talking to many whites. <br /> <br /> 12. The movie's flying screens are no more than the standard's set a few years earlier in the mega-hit "Top Gun". Of course, if your "enemy" is a forest fire, it's difficult to make theaters. <br /> <br /> 13. Failures such as "1941", "Hook", "Always" etc. are often more enlightening than Spielberg's more successful films. They reveal the steel skeleton under the technique. They show how the fun park ride looks like it doesn't work, revealing the vacuum under the broken machinery. <br /> <br /> 5/10 ?? There is a good sequence here (two actors in a room, just improvising), but it's usually an annoying picture with a predictable script. <br /> <br /> Worth watching.
