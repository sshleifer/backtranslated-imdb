I really don't know if it's science fiction or horror. It was confusing to say the least. What really upset me was the lack of story development between the characters. <br /> <br /> The 17-year-old sheriff (Clara Bryant) of the sheriff (Bruce Boxleitner) sits with him for the summer. they do not spend 30 seconds together. <br /> <br /> The hot Native American (Jennifer Lee Wiggins) believes in the heels of the Sheriff, but they also don't spend time <br /> <br /> The hot secretary (Kristen Honey) ends dead and she had more acting ability than the other two. <br /> <br /> The bad developer towards Native Americans is an over-exploited story, but I personally love the evil developers to find themselves as I live in Florida. <br /> <br /> The only reason I stayed with this was the creature. It was original. I have never seen anything like this and I am struggling for new creatures.
