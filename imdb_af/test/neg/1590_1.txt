This movie was on Lifetime Movie Network last month and I decided to check it out. I watched for the first 20 minutes and then closed. B / c. I'm sorry, but plot holes that are integral to a movie's plot make the movie nothing but garbage. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a woman who accidentally leaves a child on a bicycle off the road to get help, just come back to find out that it is a hit and run and there is a hunt for the "monster" that eventually killed her. /> <br /> It is a movie about a woman in a wealthy environment that has 2 smaller schoolchildren and who is an active, sociable woman and yet to make this movie work, it must be credible that she Do not do a CELLPHONE. Sorry, but it's a complete BS, especially if everyone else has one - they used to call 911 when they found the girl on the side of the road. When our wife left the scene of the crime, she paid phone. When the main lady returns, the ambulance is already on the girl's side and there is talk of how terrible the person is. <br /> <br /> Just DUMB. Sorry, but I'm not willing to buy that woman doesn't have a cell phone needed for the movie to work. Please, don't insult my intelligence movie, thank you. Perhaps if it happened in 1970 or 1960, I would buy it, but it is clearly a contemporary film (1999 at the moment). .. but wait, if she has a cell phone, there will be no movie. Pfft. <br /> <br /> The woman clearly knows about technology, as she had computers in her home, the kids played games so all the movies had to do was kill her cell phone and her resort. make another way to call the police. a cell phone has just created a ridiculous plot.
