It must be the most divine piece of film I've ever watched. This makes Mel Brooks movies Oscar-worthy in comparison. Jim VanBebber must be slapped in public to pass it as any form of entertainment. <br /> <br /> While some may say that this movie is true of the low budget genre of such classics as the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" or "Night of the Living Dead", the production value is not in doubt. It is VanBebber's ability to throw and present a likely story line. The casting is regrettable. For the role of Charlie, he must have chosen the first actor he saw with a beard and long hair. Remember that this actor's hair came halfway on his back. (Manson never went far beyond his shoulders). This actor spoke in a terrible monotone without much of a fraction of the personality Steve Railsback or even Jeremy Davies borrowed from their portrayals of Manson. . The actor chosen to play 'Tex' Watson has curly blonde hair instead of straight dark hair, a fact that anyone who even showed the most distant interest in the Manson case knows. He looks like a Minnesota farmer at 'Little House on the Prairie'. The actress who plays Susan Atkins has a butt wider than Oprah's. While those familiar with the family know that Clem was a bit delayed, the actor portrayed him. such a camp, Chaplinesque way, was like an old Vaudevile act. Instead of Sharon Tate looking like a beautiful pregnant woman, the actress looks like a bloated, alcoholic trailer. VanBebber is speeding up the filming in some places for artistic effect, but this technique has not been extremely useful since the "The Munsters". The end credits list every well-known family member but we are never introduced to the majority and those who introduce us are not sure who they are. <br /> <br /> Facts are also destroyed in this movie. . "Lotsapoppa" did not die in real life, Steven Parent was shot four times, not twice. Abagail Folger didn't have her throat gap. Where was Mary Brunner and Bruce Davis during the Himnan Murder? Patricia Krenwinkel never had a "Dorothy Hamill" hairstyle. <br /> <br /> The most surprising aspect of this movie is what the contemporary "freaks" have had to do with this movie? Why did the girl attach a rubber mask with a dildo? What was their problem with the journalist? What was the meaning or purpose of the final confrontation? Why were they included, period? The viewer never knows! <br /> <br /> Holy mackerel, I can go on and off, but space prevents it. Don't try to eat popcorn during this garbage, because your hand will be too busy scratching your head while you repeatedly say, "What's the f ---?"
