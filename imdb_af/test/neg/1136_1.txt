God bless Randy Quaid ... his delicious cousin Eddie on holiday and Christmas holiday stole the shoulder screaming screams. He even made the terrible Vegas Vacation at least a glance. <br /> <br /> I'll say he's trying hard to make it for TV successors, but the script isn't so funny that the movie never really comes anywhere. Quaid and the rest of the returning holidays (including the original Audrey, Dana Barron) are wasted here. Even the European holiday's Eric Idle can't save the show in a short comedy. <br /> <br /> Pathetic and sad ... actually painful to watch .... Christmas holidays 2 are the worst of the holiday franchise.
