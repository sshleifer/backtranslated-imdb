The critics were like "a movie that will break your heart" etc. Such a friend of mine and I had great expectations when we decided to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I'll make it short and leave it. To others to write about its contents. This movie is trying to touch you, to reach your heart. But it failed. At least for me. And also for my friend. <br /> <br /> Everything that happened just happened on the screen. It was always there, not here, where I was. I thought most of the time. "Hmm, something happens on the screen, but it's just on the screen. It's not really." <br /> <br /> Movies that have fared better to reach me: East of Eden (1955), Terms of Endearment (1983), Jerry Maguire (1996), Babe (1995), Mies vailla menneisyytt√§ (2002)
