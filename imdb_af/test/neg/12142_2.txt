"The Final Comedown" wants to "say something" about racism and urban violence; Unfortunately, the message is void by the nonsensical writing, the amateur-like production and the heavy-handed controversy. How heavy hands do you ask? To give just one example, a black doctor comes out of his hiding place, unarmed, with his hands in the air, ready to surrender to the police: one of the (white) police says, "Don't shoot him, he's a doctor ", after which another policeman replies," So, what? He is another **** r ", and continues to shoot him in cold blood. The police are portrayed as ignorant, racist murderers, although there are as many dead in the end as there are blacks who created the riot. And this whole event was somehow meant to sensitize the white people to the humiliating treatment of black people, if it could just reflect such hatred and violence on both sides. Pamela Jones, like Williams's girlfriend, briefly highlights the screen with her smile and body, especially in a soft sex scene, and elevates the rating of this movie from 1 to 2 out of 10.
