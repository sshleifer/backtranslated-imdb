This movie plays like an English version of an ABC after school, with nudity. It makes you wonder what the target audience was. It's not as if the authors were selling too much of an adoptive plot. Although it does have a certain viewability, Virtual Sexuality is fainter than dandelion gingers. It's a good movie to see if you've come in, the cable is out, and that's the only band you have.
