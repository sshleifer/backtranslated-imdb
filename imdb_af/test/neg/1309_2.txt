Disappointingly, very focused and horribly written, it is vigilant if you have an hour or two to kill or suffer from insomnia, but only. Robert Carlyle realizes his potential as an actor of highest mediocrity with only one expression of his repertoire (that of a chronically clogged soccer hooligan that aggravates a crippling inferiority complex), which he sometimes manages to change his nose and leave a row sail on painted yellow teeth (this indicates anger, tenderness, sadness, surprise, horror, hilariousness, compassion, etc.). In his role as "the best marine engineer in the United Kingdom" and son of a university professor, he is about as convincing as my neighbor's cat. Tom Courtenay, who is equally dumbfounded, tearing and confusing in each line, appears permanently on the eyeballs, and may no longer be able to tell a flood of a puddle of his own urine if he stands in it. All in all, another foolish attempt on the part of the British to imitate Hollywood pulp to its most rubbish. The dialogue is a series of badly rendered clich√©s; the action is incompatible; the plot is senseless and amputated; and the characters, if you can call them, do not even agree with the basic two-dimensional sphere of their American counterparts.
