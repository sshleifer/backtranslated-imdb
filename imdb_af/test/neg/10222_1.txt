Now I'm a big animation fan - love Svankmeyer and are usually in all applications of stop motion, so I have high expectations for this one. Then I came to IMDb and paused --- I'm always really suspicious of movies with a bimodal distribution of voices on IMDb. Here we have another --- a bunch of 10's (somebody suddenly) and then some real layers. I'm also suspicious of 10s with the word "visionary" in them. <br /> <br /> Certainly there are visionaries, but this character is not one of them. Despite my doubts, I saw this movie, and I had one. The stop motion animation was good, but the plots were banal and overall it was amateur. Treat yourself with the right thing, get some Svankmeyer and let it run on the shelf as well.
