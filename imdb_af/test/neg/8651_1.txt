This movie is worth nothing. I mean, if you want to see this kind of thing, turn to Hollywood movies! It's a shame for the Bollywood name. Neal N Nikki sucked seriously! Never see this movie. As for the actors, the acting genes seem to have skipped a generation. Tanisha could not have worn less and of course Uday Chopra was chosen only because he was the director's son. (All that Halla Re was incredibly stupid) The songs are eh, and I hope the director didn't spend much money on it. Bottom line, I hated the movie. Don't let your kids see it, and if you have it in your home, it's a silly movie so throw it away! Buy the CD if you need to. (As I said, the songs are eh.) At least it's better than the movie.
