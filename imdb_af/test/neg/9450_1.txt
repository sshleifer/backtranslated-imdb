Dreamland started pretty interesting, but never went except Tedium city. A low rental department without actors and ridiculous effects is not recommended for any reason. The best thing that can be said, it looks like they really filmed it in the Nevada desert. That's it, I can't even think of one thing about this stinker. The final is supposed to be a kind of revelation, but falls flat like the rest. Oh, I thought of another good point about this cheese, it looked just over an hour, but it has long been welcoming. When the girl walks around in the desert at night, it seems to be forever and only gets worse. The attempted abomination is at least not effective. The story is an attempt to feel a twilight zone style but fails badly. Have a look at "Retroactive" for a good science fiction B movie.
