My mom won't let me watch this movie if I was in Grade 2, because she said it's too violent. Well, years later, and the only reason I remember this movie is because of my mom, I got up and looked at PBS. Well, maybe the build-up after all these years has led to the great disapointment of this movie, but I got it. It did not get stale, and it made the tremendous, amazing holes in the screenplay, but there are a few cool scenes like car hunters and a big rifle fight. I will not come up for this movie again.
