A scientist (George Zucco) wants to create wolfmen from American soldiers to fight the Nazis, but is branded as angry. He uses a simpleton gardener (Glenn Strange) to experiment by mixing his blood with the wolf's blood. Strange, constantly embedding his dialogue with the scene of Lon Chaney Jr. in "Of Mice and Men", has no idea what's going on, just that he sleeps. The victims start accumulating (including a little girl, who may find the modern viewers disturbing and two of Zucco's competitors). There is a good dialogue about how man should not waste nature (still prevailing today) and play God. Zucco's motives can be honorable, but his methods are the most dubious. And then there is his daughter, Anne Nagel, who is sympathetic to Strange, but has no idea of ​​her father's actions. Johnny Downs is a reporter who comes to Zucco's bad side by questioning him, but wins Nagel's heart and thus creates the usual and always dull romantic subplot in classic horror movies. At 77 minutes, it is about 15 minutes longer than usual for a horror movie of the early 40's (especially one from the UK that released this one) so the romantic story could be tinkered for cost and things could speed up slightly. Zucco, fortunately, is never hammy; He left it to Bela Lugosi (who always kept a wonderful play that helped audiences) and England's Todd Slaughter. But try not to think of the "Bride of the Monster's" lab while working on one Zucco, or some of Lugosi's dialogue in the now classic cult film. "Mad Monster" lacks a cult for more because it is not bad, just has a dull pacing in more than a few places. For PRC and Monogram lovers, I would recommend "The Corpse Vanishes" or "Fog Island"
