This movie is an abortive, dead-born attempt to conceal various bad movies and make some kind of bad movie. It even fails here, as there is too much "plot" and not nearly enough goofy dolls and ridiculous gores. Seriously, the dolls are sweet, and the guys in suits beat me well. The performances are at their best C-degrees and become throughout, with special props to the Spec-Ops man who spoke a bizarre East Coast / Venus dialect that was almost impossible to decipher. Not that you really care what he says, because only the swear words are clear. Cinematographically, it is non-offensive, exactly what you would expect from low-rent straight-to-video waste (just like writing). The fact that New Concorde uses footage of the "Carnosaur" pictures is offensive and very confusing. For shame, New Concorde. For shame. "Carnosaur" is one of my favorite horrible movies, and they somehow screwed it and made it irreconcilable. See the "Carnosaur" movies if you want to see your dinosaur chaos. <br /> <br /> I give it one star because I love the movies it steals about, and also because the scale isn't zero.
