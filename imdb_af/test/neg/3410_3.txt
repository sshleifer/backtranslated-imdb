As a science fiction of my early childhood (long ago) I always hated indescribable plots. It is a pity that most children of science fiction writers do not show this kind of respect for their audience. I always thought they were thinking, "Children should be stupid to realize, so we should not strive". The author of "Science Fiction (2002)" is no exception. The story is about a boy being introduced by his new friends to explore his parents, because they think the parents are strangers. As I thought, I had so much to do. I was bored by her realization. It seemed to me that the filmmakers had this one idea exactly and tried to stretch it over the ninety minutes by thinning it in a dark, attractive and laborious atmosphere. The only thing that kept me in my seat was the question "how can they get rid of this indescribable rubbish"? And then - scared - they didn't even try. So if you are looking for good entertainment for both children and parents, check out "Klatret√∏sen (2002)" instead.
