Some people may be mrs. Russell remembers movies like "Black Widow", which had a call and critical speech. Boy, she really needed a rental check when she signed up to do this dog. Yes, there will be those who enjoy the free violence and nudity. But one has to sit back and wonder in retrospect that someone had to spend money and time to make it in the first place. I just saw this movie on one of the "HBO's" and I can't believe they picked it up. <br /> <br /> In 1996 Mrs. Russel did not have the physical appeal she did earlier in her career. . But come on! With her playing Ma Barker ??? Her "boys" look like they can be her brothers. It's also creepy because you think there will be narrow relationships (thank you, there's no hope, it's not a spoiler). Featuring Eric Roberts and Alyssa Milano in the movie, this one B-movie is "straight to video" entirely. <br /> <br /> The scenes between Purvis and Ma Barker, personally or telephonically, are a primer in horrible, horrible acting. Oh, wait, I also forget terrible, terrible writing. Get this one to experience. A bad experience.
