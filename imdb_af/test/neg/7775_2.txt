It's one of those movies that you can drive on a Sunday at a few hours - other things can do without any complications to understanding the proceedings, and get a little fascination to wonder why such mediocrity has acquired the manpower. and financial resources that need to be produced in the first place. <br /> <br /> Of course, with all the cable channels, as well as the lifespan's need to fill its slots with 100 or so hours of movie per week (along with incessant "Golden Girls" repetitions), this type is price a TV stack food now. It also seems that this flash offers lifestyle to the most Canadian places, as well as host of Canadian actors appearing in them. <br /> <br /> Tori Spelling, like the fret face Paris Hilton, is someone who - if not for family connections and resources - is likely to work at The Gap. But at least Tori has become a C + fighter, appearing in occasional representations that fit this level. <br /> <br /> This story is one that has been seen in life and similar places. God knows how-many times. Devil's wife, a total sociopath, who tries to screw everyone's lives, working during the initial stages of the story, with more cunning than a CIA operation, can evade, commit murder when needed and the life of the movie's "heroine." <br /> <br /> As usual, the male lead is a completely clueless hidden. And in these types of movies one finds, say, characters about who one can really give 10% of the time. This one is in the other 90%.
