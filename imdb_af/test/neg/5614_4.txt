"Kick in the head" is about the Corrigan character, a twenty-something man looking to find himself, and his involvement with a handful of peculiar characters. This thin and ambiguous story, written by Corrigan, has an exciting feel and a script that smells like an uninspired low-budget indie. In spite of this and some annoying Hindenburg scene interjections, the film beat a downward, kind of charm that can appeal to people with a similar sense of humor in a small way. Not for everyone, not for most, but for some. (D +)
