K Murli Mohan Rao made the much better BANDHAN in 1998. This movie is a terrific repetition of the marriage bonds. Basically, the movie consists of: Salman Khan who at the time played the role of a deceitful lover who lost his girlfriend, and also had his comic scenes where he hung heavily. Today he does well, he does it all here and also loses his shirt in screens. Jackie Shroff Destroyed, Bored And Tired, his role is so stupid. He is shown as a lover of Pooja Bhatra. In one scene is he shown as a female man? <br /> <br /> Inside Kumar's confusing characterization <br /> <br /> Rani Mukherjee-sow, overweight and worthy of nothing special Pooja Bhatra tall, just and actress, but has no talent <br / > <br /> Kashmira Shah - says a knob as if poetry <br/> <br /> Mohinish Behl poor fellow, the 2 kids were also terrible. <br /> <br /> The story is the same and has terrible comic scenes, a sudden love story and boring drunk scenes, plus a forced cartoon of Shakti Kapoo r <br /> <br /> Direction is poor Music is decent <br /> <br /> Salman Khan just goes through the moves, Jackie is bad, Rani is as usual, Pooja is bad, Mohinish and Kashmira are nothing good. Inside is terrible
