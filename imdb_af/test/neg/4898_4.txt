The brilliant Australian comic genius Barry Humphries had a rare failure with this uneven, and occasionally uncomfortable, comedy, which returned from release after only a few days. Drunk, arrogant Australian diplomat, Sir Les Patterson, accidentally set an Arab pencil on in the UN and is being sent to his small country as a punishment. He comes just like a palace coup on the throne a new leader (American soapster Thaao Penghlis). Sir Les, with the hesitant help of Dame Edna Everage (both played by Humphries), almost accidentally follows a scheme by the new leader to release a deadly, disgusting, AIDS-like virus on the Western world. Joan Rivers has a cameo as the United States female president, her writing magazine "President Rivers" is reading! Extreme bad flavors with slapstick and Humphries's regular satire in a film that is more enjoyable in its very funny parts than in a whole. Lady Edna's TV fans can be surprised by the presence of another Madge Allsop, unfortunately, one who misses Emily Perry's wonderful deadly comedy magic in the role. The film was written by Humphries & his third wife, Diane Millstead, and directed by the Mad Max man himself, George Miller. For the tough Humphries fans like me, essential. Everyone else, beware.
