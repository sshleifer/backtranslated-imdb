The film is annoying. <br /> <br /> Technically, there are too many times you see unfocused and very roughly edited scenes. One can easily get a cleaner movie with a decent amateur camera and 100 $ video editing software. To the ground, the man on the street doesn't mean messy editing. Unfocused scenes that do not contain important statements should have been. The same goes for making sure the object's head / hand / others remain in the frame. My 8 year old son knows it now. <br /> <br /> The movie is far too long. The main point (anti-globalization) is understood after 30 minutes, why save the rest. After the interview with James Suckling I pressed the "stop" button. What a middle time. <br /> <br /> The main theme just doesn't work for me. I saw too many small wineries producing mediocre, commercialized wines and very large wine cellars that produce large and unique wines. The film identifies the small producers as those producing wines with more identity, or terroir. The big ones are accused of producing "international" or "bought" wines. The film is trying to make a black and white statement in a world full of gray colors. However, the movie did not prove this claim. They look at some sporadic examples, "tie" some of the big producers (Frescobaldi) with fascism and provide "interviews" with key individuals. Well, did all the little producers spend World War II in resistance? Is it relevant to see that Parker has something with Bulldogs? The movie is very manipulative and unconvincing.
