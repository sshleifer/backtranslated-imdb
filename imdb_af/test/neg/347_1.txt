I just watched this movie because I was under the impression that I would be treated to a cheesy horror flick. I mean, look at the label line: "They're men who turned inside out! And worse ... they still live!" Don't you roll cheesy horror movie? And then there is the title itself - "Screamers." What a perfect title for a horror movie, I thought! Unfortunately I was not aware that the correct title was properly translated, "The Island of the Fishmen." <br /> <br /> So, about an hour to see it, I realized it wasn't a cheesy horror movie. anyhow - it was a cheesy "adventure" story about Atlantis clever fishermen. "Men turned inside out"? No. There was nothing like that. I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Damn you, misleading taglines! I want those 81 minutes of my life back!
