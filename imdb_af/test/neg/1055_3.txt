*** Possible spoiler, but probably not *** <br /> <br /> The game is called Donkey Kong, but Donkey Kong isn't even in it <br /> <br />! Diddy is also gone! <br /> <br /> The 1st Donkey Kong Country was one of my favorite <br /> <br /> Super Nintendo games. (The other is Super Mario World) <br /> <br /> The 2nd Donkong Kong has at least Diddy Kong and good levels, <br /> <br /> although it felt more like a game sometimes on pirate based. <br /> <br /> But this one is the worst of the lot! It doesn't have the feel of <br /> <br /> the original or 2nd. The enemy's look is stupid and the levels are even worse. It doesn't look realistic anymore! I didn't get his game, unlike the last two, the first had good <br /> <br /> background music and the 2nd was not bad, but the music in this <br /> <br /> game is terrible! /> <br /> Today, many movies, shows and sometimes <br /> <br /> video games that start out are ending with the fact that they are being destroyed by <br /> <br /> a stupid successor ! I'm sad to say I feel that Donkey Kong as a saga isn't that good <br /> <br /> now that it has Donkey Kong 3! <br /> <br /> They should be at the original or MAG the 2nd one.
