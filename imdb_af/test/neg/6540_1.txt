The "Puffy Chair" was an absolute waste of 84 minutes of my life, which can't be traced in a more valuable way (even the "Blair Witch Project" was a better use of the precious moments of life) . It should be called the "Puffy Chair" as only "puffy" chairs can accommodate the extremely "inflated", self-important brothers who threw it out for public consumption; And of course, they are so full of themselves that they accept that the public really wants to consume their lumps. "The Puffy Chair" made "The Wooly Boys" looks like a movie masterpiece! "Valley of the Dolls", "Beyond Valley of the Dolls", "Pink Flamingos", "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "Night of the Living Dead", "Urban Cowboy", "The Blob" Use Your Time Better than viewing the "Puffy Chair". The characters depicted are either too predictable or too low in normal emotional reflexes to be even close or equivalent. Also, at one point in the movie, while the characters in the same small town should be, one can see that one part of the town is apparently in the south of the United States, and the other half is located in Maine. It's a village, eh?
