The movie is ideal for Venezuelan tourism, birds, birds and more birds. Only 1 Piranha. Beautiful scenery. The only highlight was the crocodile seen during a very long and boring motorcycle race. The end when Caribe drowns is a definite Hollywood prop. There is no definite story. It goes from Venezuelan beauty to a rip of easy rider to diamond mining and a ruthless hunter goes for some reason who eventually gets it. A very low budget film that could have been filmed everywhere with outreaches from Venezuela. William Smith is a very talented actor who made very good movies. Like all actors, everyone must have at least one bad movie. Don't waste the $ 5.00 on the DVD.
