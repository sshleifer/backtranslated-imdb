My wife and children were billed as the 00s own Cosby show - but unlike the latter, it was unfit and incompatible. In fact, it is so poorly written and some of the jokes are about Michael Mickey, who is Michael Jr's stupidity and the fact that he is such a loser - which has become increasingly boring and annoying as the show goes on. <br /> <What was supposed to be a promising hit, eventually became a stupid, stupid game, after which the ideas became so OTT and ridiculous. And for the second Claire I eventually neglected this character so little: she became a spoiled, childish and groaning teenager in most of the later episodes. <br /> <br /> MWAK was not a Cosby show trend, rather it was just a poor black sitcom according to general standards.
