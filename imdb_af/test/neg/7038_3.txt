You must see this movie! It's so bad it's really big. <br /> <br /> You've got your crazy but crazy captain who obviously exhausted her relationship was a beautiful copilot. And of course, the middle air crash occurs when the captain's enemy and rival goes along for the ride. You've got your ex Vietnam Fat that can't handle the pressure of another air crash and crash landing. Then you have your old crazy Army Air Corp buddy flying the hunting plane and trying well, I can't tell you what he's trying to do. The plane keeps on and off, and then you have your greedy and immoral corporate engineer and then you have your zebra ice station cold and then Lucky saves the bad man to drown so they can land the plane! and it doesn't end --- it just goes on and on! You have to look at it. It's great! YOU HAVE HISTORY! HAVE THIS ON COMMERCIAL TELEVISION AND ALSO CABLE THERE.
