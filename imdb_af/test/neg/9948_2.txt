Two little girls stop a friendship. One tries to convince the other she is a witch. The other one is a pushover that bends to be the witch's will. On and on the movie, with the meaningful interaction between the two little girls, dragging on with a dramatic cut-off because they ask "shocking" questions. You know, the kind of lovely little kids shouldn't ask, like, "How do you make a deal with the devil"? Oooh ... creepy. <br /> <br /> In the end, the pushover is sick to be controlled by her witchy friend. Her belief that her friend is a witch leads to a tragic end. But by the time it comes, you won't mind. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that this movie might be scary for a very religious 1960's Mexican movie-maker, but it doesn't even look like a beautiful relic. It just goes on. It's boring. It's useless. It shouldn't be looked at. <br /> <br /> There are many here who have many good things to say about it, based on their knowledge of the director's other works and, of course, that the common denominator tells everyone about senseless movies: "Ah, the cinematography is wonderful! " These judges probably have a point. But for those who have found this movie without prior knowledge, who doesn't care about his "photography", his "atmosphere" or she ... whatever it has - for those viewers then, who just wants a * good * movie that will entertain them for an hour and a half, do yourself a favor, people: <br /> <br /> Skip it.
