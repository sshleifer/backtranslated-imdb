I always say, "There's nothing like a good movie." And I have to say, it was nothing like a good movie! Killing, boring and boring. It was like one of those bad dreams that never seems to end, no matter how hard you try to wake up. I do not care about the concept of a film without words (that is, entering a fantasy or dream world), but there must be something to capture your imagination, not just empty images, that is what this film does. is. There was no character development and it jumped so fast from scene to scene that it was difficult to distinguish any story. (Was there even a story?) You could say the actors tried their best, but unfortunately the poor direction sabotaged all the actors' work. It really looked like a kind of movie masturbation ... just for pleasure the director and no one else. Great waste of time.
