How many monster tree movies can you see in a lifetime? Well, I'm going out on a limb and say one. This movie is better watched late in the night, with a 12 pack of beer, the sound off and you and your friends making the dialogue. <br /> <br /> On a Pacific Island, a young man is condemned to death to work with the "evil Americans". (It seems his loving wife slept with the witch doctor and set him up to die so the doctor could be a king.) He promised to come back and take revenge. <br /> <br /> Before you can shake a stick, the goofy natives walk to the American scientist shouting "Tobanga comes!" <br /> <br /> It looks as if the young man did just like Tobanga, the runner monster. Yes, his revenge is terrible (and so is this movie). It seems that these natives can't run from a tree, so he throws them in scuba sand, rolls them down the hills, and so on. The new king will soon trade his wife or kingdom for an ax or a chainsaw. <br /> <br /> General problems with this movie are numerous. The comedy relief is an unpleasant woman with a Cockney accent (as this movie should be comedy). You want her to die on her first appearance. The front lady is whiny. The front man is a drill. The play is wood (pun intended). The dialogue is stiff and lumbering. The natives have Brooklyn accents. The monster pack is pure giggles. <br /> <br /> While it's a bad movie, it's still fun to watch. It gets a 3 on unintentional laugh alone Your dog can only calculate it a little higher, but only if the tree was not cell phone.
