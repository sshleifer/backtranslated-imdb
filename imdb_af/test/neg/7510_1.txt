I work at the video store renting this video in Lexington and I have to say ... it should never have been done. I even know some of the people who worked on it, regretting it. Bad effects, scary, especially bad writing. I swear the dialogue would not have passed for the original PSX Resident Evil; it's so bad. If you want to know how not to make a movie, look at this movie to learn something or something. If not, don't waste your time. And even the director knows it's sucking, because he keeps trying to help us clean up the movie. No, sir. I watched two-thirds of the horror section and these rates are even lower than plan 9 of outer space. Even Ed Eood would have said, "No, it's too stupid even to me."
