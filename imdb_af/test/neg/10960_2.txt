I'm not a director or writer or anything related to a movie. But look at more than one movie every day, given me the idea of ​​what a good movie is or not. So here it is: The fast and the dead are a rip-off of the Quick and the Dead. I thought it might be a bit of a parody of a cool movie with many beginnings in it. But oh no, I was really in for a very big disappointment. <br /> <br /> To put it simply, the movie is sucking. I'm a big fan of gore movies, but this one just gives you here and there, but they're not so consistent. <br /> <br /> But I have to give them credit to create horrible characters that make me a little worm. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of zombies, watch it. If you don't ... look better for other robot movies.
