After 30 minutes .. very fast forward, remove it from my recorder. The first Critters movie was self-conscious, The "conversation" between the cattle, just before grandma blew them away from the stoep. This movie just keeps waiting for someone to shoot it and put it out of your misery. <br /> <br /> I can't imagine anyone working on this turkey being proud of it. <br /> <br /> One was fun, four were just awful. Don't bother, even if the alternative looks at a TBS "700 Club" fundraiser, you'll at least get a good laugh (and the "strange" makeup is more credible. Grin).
