<br /> <br /> Will not be on this movie for long. The first half of the hour was one of the most boring things I had to see as I started watching movies. The story didn't progress, nothing was explained about any of the characters. It felt like a non-movie. (Many people have already left the audience at this point). Much of the scene was totally unjustified and inexplicable. <br /> <br /> The director had to study film a little more to know that every sequence, every scene, should make the story progress. He never did it. <br /> <br /> The so-called funny moments have been confronted, and only a few people laughed (people with a strange sense of humor, I think). <br /> <br /> The jury's prize in Cannes 2002 ..... doesn't know what the jury thought ... probably the "politically correct effect". <br /> <br /> I would have liked it, so the disappointment was even bigger. <br /> <br /> You have to see it to believe it. But wait for the video.
