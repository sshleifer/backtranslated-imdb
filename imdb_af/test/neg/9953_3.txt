For reasons that I cannot understand, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco) injecting the wolf's blood into his dull handyman, Petro (Glenn Strange). The result ?? Petro has been turned into a horrible (as great as anyone with a bad wig and spiky teeth) can be murderous. Dr. Cameron used Petro to take revenge on those in the scientific community who mocked and mocked his ideas (and why wouldn't they, Dr Cameron's crap as a fruit cup). <br /> Overall, The Mad Monster is a dull and poorly made poverty driving thriller. There is actually only one positive I can come up with to write in The Mad Monster. George Zucco can be fun watching while playing the crazy scientist as well as anyone. His Dr Cameron is a regular loony. He has no evil to kill; he has conversations with people who are not there; and, as with most mad scientists, he messed up in "God's domain" (actually I'm not sure anyone is accusing him, but it fits). But beyond Zucco, there's nothing here to recommend. Everything else from the sample effects to the supporting role of the music is simply old. There are much better examples of poverty driving horror from the 1940s than The Mad Monster.
