Seriously! You just have to see this movie to understand everything that is wrong with it. It came out during the time when everyone was trying to make family movies that everyone could enjoy (the little rascals, Nanny, etc.), but it had no charisma or enthusiasm. Every single character in the movie is driven by anger, with the exception of Trixie's mother, who only shows aggravation and fatigue, possibly with the tired cliches that this movie enjoys. <br /> <br /> To put it simply, the biggest mistake in the movie was not the play or the filming, but especially the writing. The lines we receive are reminiscent of Disney classics, although this film does not have the whole heart, IL 'Walt managed to subtract. Junior's father (John Ritter) makes you angry without doing anything, simply because he allows Junior to run around unattended, and just gives him a strict warning when he deals with a 200-pound chalkboard . <br /> <br /> Junior's grandfather is also extremely rude. For those of you who have seen the first one, it has been found misleading and therefore not seen the second one, "Big Ben Healy", as he is mentioned in this movie, is still a complete shower. He basically beats John Ritter's house uninvited, settles himself in Junior's room, though he says he hates Junior and basically does nothing to speed up the movie's speed, or to support the movie in any way. On the contrary, he notes the audience by being a lazy freeman. <br /> <br /> Finally, we are introduced to a wide variety of new characters, such as the alley, unpleasant, Trixie, who wears dynamite in her backpack. , first she lights, then hands, to junior, who just stares. Also, Gilbert Gottfried returns to this film, this time the turbulent principal plays at Junior's new basic school. If Gilbert Gottfried isn't enough to make the point, I'll just say this: This movie series! <br /> <br /> 2/10 stars, because the actor's beliefs shine through the movie, although the writing sucks.
