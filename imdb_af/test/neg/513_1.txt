Don Wilson stars as Jack Cutter (Ooh real tough name!) A vampire slayer rising up against a vampire army, you see the story is a little different because vampires can't be killed with silver, crosses or sunlight but rather by snapping their necks (How convenient as it cuts on the budget) and that's here. Snyder walks in a reporter (Melanie Smith or Trancers III fame). Night Hunter's action ranges shake for no reason during the battle, and while aiming to accentuate the mood, just make the movie more. What's worse is that this controversy is dissatisfied, as Wilson's martial art is disguised by irreconcilable editing. Of course, most interest comes from the fact that it is indeed Blade, but the problem is that it was done on a small budget and that it had Don Wilson in it. It's from Roger Corman and basically this turkey is a movie most people won't pay. Unfortunately I am a bottom feeder and I supply the department of the store looking for jewelery. In this line of work you always walk in villages. With Night Hunter, I can only have the world's stinking thirst. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * out of 4- (terrible)
