Joan Crawford is convincingly defamed as our story begins, and of course she is tied up. But she is a bad egg, exploiting one man while still living an old man's antisocial philosophy. All these things happen in Sweden, which is really bizarre. It all makes anything unforgettable in the footage, which is being freed to depict Anytown USA, but it makes a viewer wonder why every remake has since been tricky and unspecified by the need to make everything happen. There is plot, plot, plot so chatty that you can drown, and to make matters worse, is a framework that adds zilch to the movie. The photography is occasionally nice, with strange corners and slides. But it has moved over without ever entering you.
