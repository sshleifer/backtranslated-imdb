There is something strange about the antisocial sentiment you can find in some Cheech And Chong materials. One of the songs in Up In Smoke, well, I often wish for more songs these days. But in this excuse for a video, the stoner duo shows us the videos for four songs from their current album, also titled Get Out Of My Room. You hear a voice over during the opening credits in which an anonymous producer describes the record as a novelty record that will only record on the cards. Unfortunately, this opening stamp hits the nail right on the head. <br /> <br /> Most of the recordings endorsed by the RIAA seem to be a rule to put the best material in the album early. Often, when one passes by the first song, the respective listener notices that the recording has little or nothing to keep their attention. Tires that dispute the mainstream convention, on the other hand, often saved their best material for the last, or evenly distributed it across the entire disc. In this case, Cheech And Chong seems to decide to entrench their commitment. The opening piece, Get Out Of My Room, is a hilariously-themed song with an incredibly bad video. Many viewers of a music video from 1980 will find the messy direction nostalgic. Cheech's view of British punk is also incredibly funny. <br /> <br /> When it's all down, the second number is, I'm not home. Nothing kills interest in a song like repetition, and it's hard to get more repetitive than this hearing. Honestly, one feels the desire to face Cheech and tell him that we get the idea, he is not home, so please continue. The next song, along the theme of love that is a strange thing, is the absolute rock bottom, not only for this collection, but also for Cheech And Chong in general. It is almost as if this song was made the only reason to expand the album's current time. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the Stoner Duo saved the last, but it's also curious to note that Chong is quite. absent from this track. Born in East L.A. is a simple number based on the old Bruce Springsteen number that mocks Reagan's view of multiculturalism. As one is arranged by Cheech's story, one has to wonder how many poor schleps who could not speak a word of Spanish, were deported to Mexico simply because their skin was not covered. Racism was an integral part of America's culture in 1985, and it remains today. If it's something, it's worse, so you have to wonder what Born In East LA will be if it's written in the current era. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, two tracks do not make an album, especially when there is so much boring filler between them. The interviews for, for example, getting out of my room are pretty funny. Not just like much of Up In Smoke, but funny enough to justify their existence. Unfortunately, the two middle songs are reflected in their making of footage. Boring song makes boring stuffing. If you cut out the middle half-hour material from this video, you'll have something much better. <br /> <br /> I got a three out of ten from my room. They are earned by the first and last video. I'm pretty sure the stars look at material today and wonder what they think.
