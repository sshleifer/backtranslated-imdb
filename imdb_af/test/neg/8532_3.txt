In spite of a completely misleading advertising campaign, it seems an annoying click, a sub-paragonal haunted house with a totally unbeatable ending. Consider clue 1 to see this turkey: Sam Raimi didn't do it. Although advertising for the film plays his involvement, he is actually one of four producers. It is too bad that someone who is as talented as Raimi has allowed his name to be used with such a poor movie. I don't think he would ever have done such a thing; This task was left to the Pang Brothers. <br /> <br /> The script for this movie apparently combined with many other "horror" movies, giving you absolutely zero original content in "The Messengers." What we get is a scene right here and there. Pulse picked, a few that came from the birds, one or two of the others, etc. Almost every scene, almost every line of dialogue, is one that has been lifted from any number of other movies. The whole thing makes such a predictable movie that almost anyone can find out the "surprise ending" long before it comes. <br /> <br /> Right here will be a good time to point out that the advertising campaign, centered on the idea that only children can speak, has nothing to do with this movie. In fact, everyone can see the ghosts. The teenage daughter and mother characters probably see them, even early in the movie. I'm sure everyone who was in charge of marketing entered into this campaign because the movie needed a unique angle to have any office, which is otherwise completely absent. Now you know, don't be fooled! Perhaps this film, which lacks most of all, is something like actor chemistry. It's just not there. All the interactions are so uncomfortable. Coupled with the clipped story and ridiculous plot holes (just what is a man who killed his entire family still walking around in the village where the murder happened?) Didn't anyone think of arresting him?), Add it all to A very unsatisfactory ghost fly that can only afford someone at the age of ten with cheap shots: loud noises, visual flashes and anything short of a piece of cloth that jumps out of a closet and 'Boo!' shout. All we get for our money is another poor film about spirits trying to turn people away from a home. If there is a message that "The Messengers" delivers, it is "Don't waste your time on this movie."
