This movie is a clear rip-off from Underworld USA with Cliff Robertson. You owe it to yourself to invest a few hours and look at the original. I found this one to be untouched and difficult to follow, with many scenes not making much sense. I am not opposed to violence in movies, but this whole thing was nothing more than an excuse to blow one person to another, many of which are only marginally related to the storyline. With everyone being killed, I wondered at the movie why Frank didn't just blow Johnny's brain. He certainly could and Johnny probably didn't act like someone who could be trusted. Another thing that bothered me is the sex scene; Why do these people have sex with their clothes? Should we switch it on? Certainly they didn't think they had a shot at a PG rating. Nothing in this movie seems to play out of course. as if you were watching people in real life, but it was done in a heavy and level way.
