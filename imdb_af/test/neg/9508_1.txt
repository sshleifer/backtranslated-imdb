<br /> <br /> The play is heavily edited and the sequence of the screens is completely mixed. The acting is terrible (especially by Helena Bonham Carter) and the cinematography poor. <br /> <br /> The result is a slow, confused, boring movie that Shakespeare will instantly post again from Shakespeare! <br /> <br /> If you can't see a play, see the Olivier version (1948) instead of this drive!
