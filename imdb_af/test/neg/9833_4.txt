I noticed that many movies that appeared in the "Mystery Science Theater" received a ton of low ratings on IMDb. But some of the movies that have appeared on the movies were not so bad and it is not fair to evaluate a film that received the MST treatment - with the hosts commenting funny during the film. Now I'm not saying "The Girl in Lover's Lane" is a good movie, but it's not bad enough to earn the current IMDb score of 2.1. The movie starts with Bix and Danny. Bix is ​​a veteran drifter and Danny is a younger man who apparently has no specific reason to wander over the country. As soon as they blow into a small town, Bix has to save Danny again, because Danny is rather naive - a good way to say he has the intellect of a tomato. <br /> <br /> Next to the road something happens to the confident Bix - he finds a nice young lady and finds the enticement to go with him. And in a strange subplot, Jack Elam plays a super-creepy sicko wandering the town that scares the shit of everyone - but strangely enough, the police don't seem to take much notice and nobody does anything on their own. . Eventually, however, when Elam puts the movements on a girl where Bix falls, things come to a full boil. <br /> <br /> Overall, though not a good movie, there were many interesting album elements in this movie - enough to earn a score higher than 2.1. The biggest negative is a simplified conclusion to the riddle that appears near the end, as well as the total stupidity of Danny once too often. However, given the tiny budget, it is a viewable small movie.
