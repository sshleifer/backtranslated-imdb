Journalist Bob Woodward's blundering, scattering and sometimes suspicious actor John Belushi's rise and fall becomes a totally indifferent film, a turbulent "fantasy" directed by Larry Peerce as if he were doing something edgy and vital. Michael Chiklis (years before his breakthrough on "The Shield") is portrayed in the petty position of Belushi and taken a post-mortem journey through his life. He recreates the Saturday Night Live sketches that are now part of TV history. It's like watching someone try Lucy Lucille Ball - it can't be done. The reason there was such a sadness at Belushi's death was because he was one of his kind. Chiklis makes a great effort to watch the part, and he is funny in an early scene trying to escape from the mortuary. Yet it is an uphill venture and no actor - however talented it could have saved it. * of ****
