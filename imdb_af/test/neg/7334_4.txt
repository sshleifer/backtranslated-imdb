The fun that was present in the other 'movies' has disappeared with this third effort, which means that the garbage production values ​​are displayed more than ever. Another 2-parties (The Chinese Web) have stuck together, one has too much padding, and that doesn't mean bad Spidey action is taking place in such uninspired places like a car park, apartment and printing press. Nicholas Hammond is as engaging as ever, struggling bravely against the deadly production and lame performances of the rest of the cast. The plot, in which Peter and Spidey accused a Chinese official of corruption during World War II by establishing three marines who testify to his innocence, does not scream "comic book to life," does it?
