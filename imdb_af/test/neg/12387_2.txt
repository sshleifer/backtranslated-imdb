I did not read this book and will not rely on this adjustment. I hated every character in this show - Miranda was messy, selfish and mumbling mumbled by the terrible dialogue, her sister was a total eyelash, and it was the worst portrayal of manic depression I've ever seen. I have a degree in Psychology and it was not accurate. In fact, until it was said, I didn't realize Troy was supposed to be bipolar. I thought he was a normal, slightly grumpy teenager. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace in this stupid show was David Tennant, whose brilliant psychotic performance was the only thing that got me to watch the second half. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the authors and producers of this show did not do any research. Troy's mental problems are not remotely accurate, and forensic involvement is also not involved in the "spinning" end (and if you are not a mile away, you are a big ole dummy!) <br /> < br /> Full garbage.
