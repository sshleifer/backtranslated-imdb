The German WDR showed both "The General" and the ODC. On Saturday I saw "The General" and I thought it wasn't very bad, but not very good. But yesterday I saw ODC and I switched it off after about an hour. Although Kevin Spacey was the main actor, the film was completely confusing and looked uneasy. "The General" has the story straight and ordered, but ODC just wanted to be cool. There is a reference to Guy Ritchie Movies "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "Snatch", but doesn't have the coolness of these movies. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, it's 3 out of 10!
