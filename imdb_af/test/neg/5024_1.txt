May or may not contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> Inuyasha is not a good anime. It's really overestimated. Why? There is absolutely no story line, no plot, and the show just pulls on ... and on ... and beyond ... That's because there are more side stories and fillers than episodes that progress the plot. And the fillers are just the same stories repeated over and over. The same episodes seem to be with the same plot: Kagome that sees a jewel screen, a worm / smart / tentacle demonic thing, says Inuyasha "Wind Scar", "Iron Reaver Soul Stealer" etc. And kill the devil, they get the jewel screen, and then we repeat this scene 160 or more times. <br /> <br /> In addition to repeating episodes, there is the recurrence of comic devices, and they are no longer funny. Wait, they were never. Sexual harassment is NOT funny. Viz evaluated the range of Older Teens, 16+. I have no idea why they rated it that way. There is nothing bad about it, except for the so-called funny sexual harassment, which is a bit suggestive, and it can arrest you today. <br /> <br /> Now we know that Inuyasha is overestimated. The video games. They all sucked. Especially the Mask game. I played it at my friend's house. It was nothing interesting. The game was slow, boring, and it has Nintendo 64 like graphics. In a magazine it received a score of 4/10, saying, "This role play is slower than milkshakes that are a sundowner." Then there are all these stupid Inuyasha toys, action figures, trading cards, stickers and coloring books. COLOR BOOKS! We thought Inuyasha was 16+! Maybe not ... But after I was a member of Inuyasha groups on MSN, about half of the people were 10 to 13. I think Inuyasha is a little kid anime. (I think that just a little editing can be done on this show, it can be shown on Toonami.) There are over 40 manga volumes. I can only help wondering how many kilometers of the forest was cut down to make them. Sad ... <br /> <br /> Then there's the music. The music is so annoying. We hear the same 5 songs every episode. After 10 episodes, the music becomes very irritating. In other anime they have music to suit the mood and we don't hear many songs. There are about 15 different Inuyasha soundtracks. Don't waste your money on that garbage! <br /> <br /> And how do you think I know it all? Because I was a fan of Inuyasha before. I'm ashamed of myself. I'd rather watch Kim Possible or Pokemon rather. Unfortunately, the two shows have more romance between the two main characters than Inuyasha will ever have ...
