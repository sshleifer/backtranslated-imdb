I really like Kinski, he's a good actor. I saw this movie because I heard there are autobiographical aspects in this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of symbols like a piano sinking in a river or strange shadows at the walls. Then the narrator always says abstract sentences like: "A child sells fortune, but her box is now empty." It's really disturbing and not really needed, because everyone understands what this movie is all about. The film shows how Kinski's character treated woman and how he kept it under control. If there were really some aspects of Kinski's life in this story, then he was really a pigs. So, it is not necessary to watch this movie unless you want to see Kinski naked or if you want to laugh at sick waste movies.
