The indignant premise of this movie is related to Argentina, which has overthrown the Falkland Islands, which failed in 1982, by European women residents with Argentine sperm and diluted ethnic purity until it benefited Argentina. Yes, right. The exploration is done by our hero / villa and cad, Fabian, who takes his pillar fish-eye video camera to secretly film his encounters with the Falklanders, including his court and eventual conquest of one wife, Camilla. An unfortunate indie and fraudulent documentary, this movie benefits us with many boring tourist shots from the hip .... yada, yada, yada. The film has no plot potential and starts to get interesting, as Fabian and Camilla turn their way through the usual moments of discomfort and uncertainty as they get off the handshake. "F * ckland" is only for cinema purists who can appreciate the dark, no frills, jigglecam sobriety of Dogma Indians.
