this movie is allegedly a comedy. So, where did all the laughs go. Don't forget to put them in, on the version I watched. As a soccer movie, it's softly entertained. I'm sure. It's just a stick in the mud, with no noticeable sense of humor. Or maybe this movie is just not funny. It's also annoying, that way over the top "you're a winner" musical score. And the weird thing is, the team sucked most of the season, only won the last two games, and the last game means nothing because they were not in the playoffs. So what's the point? is their celebration mediocre? I don't see it. If anyone knows, please let me know. Now, this movie isn't great or even very good. I give it a low 3 *
