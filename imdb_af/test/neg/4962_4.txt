I'm a German student so sorry for finally making mistakes (I'm working on it;)) <br /> <br /> The stylistically very interesting converts and with effective sound effects emphasizes the dreary-driven action in no way from the terribly bad actors (sincere and unnatural moves and expressions of feelings) and thus make the relatively strange and senseless story less effective. Just the typical slasher genre with very strange action in this case. Many by-games partially destroy the main story and leave the viewers in the dark in the dark, create strangeness and leave the senses of action and the point just as dangerous. For sure, this is a hit for treasure fans, but not for me. But although the interesting style of cinematography and proper use of light has shown well. <br /> <br /> Not the best ...
