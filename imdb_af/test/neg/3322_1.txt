I'm usually not inclined to write reviews about movies I don't think deserve a mention. But in striving to grow as a writer and film critic, I feel it is important to express my thoughts if I don't like a movie. "Queen of the Damned" is one of those movies. <br /> <br /> Anne Rice's popular horror stories of Lestat, a bisexual Vampire, only appeared in the successful Interview With A Vampire in 1994. With two of Hollywood's biggest heavyweights in Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, the film's stylish aesthetic and gothic mise and scenes, the audience caught. Although it may have been a case of style, there was something about it, despite its chess (I have never been so surprised with the Vampire genre in general). Since then, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise have gone on much bigger things. It would probably be both laughter if asked to appear in a sequel. They would even laugh harder when they saw the final result. "Queen of the Damned" characterizes the kind of cr * p. Hollywood is happy to offer at a low cost, hoping to earn a quick cash, thanks to an average soundtrack and a huge marketing campaign aimed at 13 to 17 year olds. /> <br /> Needless to say this movie has been terrible from the beginning. Lestat, now played by Briton Stuart Townsend of "Shooting Fish" boasting, woke up from his dark grave to the sound of ... you guessed it, Nu-Metal. He touches a few confused punk musicians and joins their band, provided he only appears at night, who burns his skin and all day with the sun ... <br /> <br /> Jesse (Marguerite Moreau), a student studying the paranormal (maybe Vampire 101?), Trying to find out if Lestat really is who he says he is. Along the way she falls to him (something to do with her strange past), but has some competition in Queen Akasha (Aaliyah), a Vampire devil queen returning from the underworld to acquire Lestat as her chosen king. <Br /> <br /> The movie is shamefully self-explanatory, but its campsite leaves room for its deprivation of humor. Anyone who sees this movie for nothing but a good laugh should see more movies in general! Looking at Townsend is pleasant. He knows that the role is at the top and does its best to follow the entry of absolute hamming and serious acting. The late Aaliyah is unfortunately terrible in the title role. She has a minimum screen time, and she does not fully use what she does. The arm makeup and special effects do not help; Sometimes she sounds like she's talking through a voice box. <br /> <br /> It is rumored that this movie was straight to the video, until Aaliyah's unexpected death last year. With the possibility for people to watch her final movie, Warner Bros put it in a general release. Otherwise, it would be one of those movies you see on the shelves at the video stores, but avoid being able to say it's going to be terrible. <br /> <br /> No doubt, movies like this will be made. Watch the wave of teen rom-com rip offs or the spoofing of the genre itself with movies like "Not Another Teen Movie". If there's a market to exploit, Hollywood will do it. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I have with this movie is not the movie itself. Hollywood is about making money, so if there is a market for this movie, they will pursue it. It's business. But as far as I am concerned, people are actively going to the theater and paying money to see it! I think this is the biggest argument in the world of theater: is cinema first and entertainment second, or is it the other way around? The only people who can decide are the audience. If you like good movies and are intrigued, stay away from this turkey.
