When I heard them making it, I was happy considering the first movie, it was pretty good, as a little on the short side. <br /> <br /> But then I remember a few of the Disney sequel disasters I had previously watched (I look at your Little Mermaid 2). <br /> <br /> Anyway, I watched it and unfortunately I was very disappointed. The best thing about it is the animation is excellent. It's really those special Polish that have the "real" Disney movies. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the rest is disappointing. The storyline is all over the place. One moment it is about something, then it completely changes to a different storyline and then changes to another completely different story. It reminded me how the Family Guy movie, like 3 separate episodes, changed into a movie. <br /> <br /> I may have laughed once. Kronk was very funny in the original film, but in this he is not funny at all. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie unless someone gives it to you for free. <br /> <br /> 10/04
