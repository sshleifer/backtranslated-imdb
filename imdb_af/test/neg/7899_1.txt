my friend made me look at this horrible movie. Ugh .. it was so stupid ... <br /> <br /> it's about a black man who gets an airline company and changes it into a stupid thing. <br /> <br /> With a snooping dog acting as a pilot. God knows why. This movie is white people from the start and has many racist stereotypical events that make fun. <br /> <br /> Breathe white people and try to make the movie look all black people are cool pimps and all white people are losers ... and black people get all the girls blah blah blah and so on. <br /> <br /> I despise my friend to look at this movie. I said, "GOD WORKS!" and he is like "NO I BETTER TO BE SUITABLE TO HAPPEN." Eventually we finally let it down halfway. Thank you, God. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to people with lots of poor in taste in humor.
