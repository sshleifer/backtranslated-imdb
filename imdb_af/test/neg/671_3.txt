I am surprised that so many comments on this film are positive. After reading the book several times (and all the other historical novels by Mika Waltari), there is no way to say very well in this movie. If I forget the origin of the story, I can consider it a pretty good epic. Of course, bringing such a brick of a book to the big screen is a task not to be envied, but it can be done with the class. I can't understand why even Nefernefernefer's name should only be shortened to Nefer. I love Peter Ustinov as Kaptah and Marlon Brando probably would have had a better Sinuhe, but the overall attitude is to Hollywood to ever fix the book. Do you think Mika Waltari left the Premier of this movie in the middle of the show. That's how much he liked it.
