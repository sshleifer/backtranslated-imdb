Yes, there is a "sleeper" to look at Sleeper Cell and that was me. After reading comparisons to "24" (as on the front cover of the DVD), I expected a quick action skirt. But no ... this series just sits together. In my rough half awake state I would think, "He's going ..." and poofing, it'll happen ... "Guess the bus will roll away from the side ..." and she's going. <br /> <br /> And so on. <br /> <br /> And why would Darwin, in an extra depth, pursue a baby? Could it be a little T&A? Hey, it works for me, so four stars rather than three. <br /> <br /> This view is not "24". I looked at "24". Sleeper Cell, you're not '24'.
