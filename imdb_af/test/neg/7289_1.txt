This movie was terrible, and it didn't even make a movie. The way I look at it is more like three mediocre Disney cartoon episodes in the day that were detached to make a single video pretending to be the successor to the first Atlantis movie. It was made much more good and pleasant. And where do I even start with the problems of this DVD? The story? The characters? The pictures / animation? For me, they are all bad and unshakable. First, the story in this direct-to-video DVD is ridiculous and useless. The only good thing about it is that it's consistent - it's consistently bad, from start to finish. After the film's ear, I still don't know why Milo came back and how the incidents in the three little stories relate to each other or to Atlantis. And all I could remember about this movie was how bad it made me feel after I saw it. The characters feel wood and lack of personality, and the drawings look very different from the first. You can say that they are obviously not the hands of the same animators of the first. While the DVD has been playing, I care more and more about what may happen to the characters and just hope the movie will end soon. Besides the story and the characters mentioned above, the image quality is also poor in this one, probably one of the worst in those direct-to-video products that Disney has ever released. As a fan of the original Atlantis: the lost empire, I could no longer be disappointed in Milo's return, which is a total waste of time and money. Thank you, I hired it first, instead of buying it. Still, I still wish I never saw this crap or even know its existence.
