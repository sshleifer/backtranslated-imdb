The funniest thing about Fortunes is that one of the main characters is Lewis (Urbaniak) writer block and apparently also the scriptwriter for the movie. It's also sad, as I think, it's a comedy or drama, but it's the funniest thing I can remember watching it. <br /> <br /> Three friends go out and drink one night. On the way home two decided to tell their fortune by a "gypsy", as they call her. These two lives fall apart while the third friend stands. Then nothing happens. <br /> <br /> I hope I didn't spoil the movie, but really, this extremely low budget, bad quality movie had some kind of idea when it started but quickly snowballed in the depths of hell. Yes, I'm hard. Honestly it wasn't that bad, it was just blue. <br /> <br /> The aforementioned author was annoying to watch, although he might have delivered one or two of the only two funny lines. The clich√©d "ladies man", the only one who didn't get his fortune, was just annoying. The only blind spot, the remaining friend, the married father, whose prosperity was told something would happen to his son and he had to be prepared. He was funny, real and clearly the best actor in the movie. Unfortunately, it doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too cruel. Heck, they have the ambition to make a movie, go and get funding and achieve something. Unfortunately, I can't recommend the movie at all. There are hundreds of thousands of independent films that have hundreds of thousands of better ideas and executions. This one was literally 10 minutes of an idea that stretched another 81 boring minutes.
