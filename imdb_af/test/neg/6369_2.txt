I recently went to the movie theaters to see the new (2007) version of Bridge to Teribithia. Then I went to the library to rent the older version to see it again without paying again. I must say I was very disappointed! I found that the older version acted frightfully, as well as Corny lines, including Jessie, who said, "I know Dad, but I've touched so much inside" after Leslie's dead. It was done quite awfully and the casting wasn't much better in my opinion. I was surprised when I never said they made it. The story is wonderful, but trust me, spend the money and see the new version, if you just see the guy, you can never experience the true magic of Teribithia.
