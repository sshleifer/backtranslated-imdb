God, I never insulted me in my whole life as with this shit. There are so many ways to describe this piece of crap, and I think if I said everything, I'd be banned from this site. <br /> <br /> How do I start? Well, for one, it doesn't notice the original series to know that this movie is a blow to the face of people who have seen it. The biggest victim of a theme song ever made is here, from a metal version, to a freaking RAP VERSION, what do they think? How does Underdog work and an electronic heavy musical style? The story is so basic that I will do something that I usually do not even give a summary. Just think about it: A dog gets superpowers, fills in the rest. That's how predictable this movie is. And then come the jokes .... please kill me now. This style of humor that can't even make the kids laugh, it's so bad, well, expect the punch line to sneeze. It was a little funny. <br /> <br /> But what surprised me most is why Jason Lee (New Name Is Earl), Patrick Warburton (Emperor's New Groove) and Jim Belushi (according to Jim) are all here. In the shows / movies I mentioned, the actors, in my opinion, do a good job, and, besides Lee, are the best actors in this movie, but it says very little. The rest deserves Golden Rasberry nominations for this crap. I'm very sad to see such good actors buried in this disaster. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's just as bad as Doogal, which I also reviewed, and again my head would explode if I saw anything worse than that.
