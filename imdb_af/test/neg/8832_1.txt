I looked at the root of all EVILS with the alleged object to refute this so-called scientific atheist. I don't know where to start, as he is such a rich source of stupidity. <br /> <br /> Of course, he is not a statistician, otherwise the chance of 2/1 of him who burns forever will have put his faith in God <br /> <br /> He regards science as a religion and expect us to believe him if we do God. One should only look at the language used in his postings. <br /> <br /> Regarding Faith. This commodity is used extensively in everyday behavior. Just think about it. When in an electrician, it is believed to be properly wired and reliably turn on the switch. When he comes in a plumber, he pulls the chain in his bathroom and expects the water to flow in the right direction. With regard to belief in science When I was in the chemistry class, I believed and taught that the atom was the smallest particle and the onion skin theory of electrons that were both now discounted. I learned it when the atomic theory "wrote in stone" to speak like that. So why should we believe any scientist especially if he goes beyond the parameters of his field? Dawkins says religion will be the downfall of civilization. Religion is civilization. Can he or any other atheist tell us what civilization is and is nurtured by atheism, barbarism or cruelty? He now lives in the last stages of a Christian-based civilization and takes all its benefits without any recognition for his source. I found Dawkins to be arrogant, dictatorial, judgmental, an obvious believer in eugenics and a Nazi in his attitude towards the boys. How dare he say what a parent can teach their child. The child is theirs, not the nation, and if the parents bequeath their genetics, bequeath their beliefs. His resignation from Adam as "he never existed" as he has no evidence was an example of the same attitude. So I have no evidence that Joe Blogs lives in New York, but he can do it well. I haven't found the evidence yet. It denies its existence. I note his argument with Oxford bishop that the prelate is selective with what he takes and believes in the Bible. Well, that's what Dawkins does. Where does he draw the line between it as a historical document and a religious statement? He is also selective. I heard the fate when Dawkins got the ALTRUIST gene. What a hoot. He is desperately looking for evidence for his wackiness and, as the Piltdown Man has been invented, so now we have this so-called ALTRUISTIC gene that we predict to look after our young and other members of our group. The problem is that all animals do it - not just monkeys, and with evolution it is the survival of the strongest. not the best and if he really thinks we are a child as a race, he does not read the same newspapers, because I have exceeded his arrogance to declare that if we only have this life, we must fully enjoy. So how does he compare it with his obvious position as a wealthy European to a needy in Africa who has wiped out all her family and is probably raped and hungry. Will he help her? I notice that all his opposition to religion is that they go to war. Well, G Chesterton stated that the only war worth fighting for is a war for religion. B) We are against the use of contraception and abortion and homosexuality. Everyone sin against the 6th commandment. Funny that. <br /> <br /> As a Catholic, I find his resignation of Pius XII's Dogma of Assumption ruling in 1958 to be erroneous. He, Pius, never said it was revealed to him while sitting somewhere by himself. If Dawkins didn't know, Revelation ended with the last Apostle. Pius would have taken years of advice and studying documents given over the centuries to reach this verdict. Also, as a Catholic, I find his dismissal of all religious people so satisfied. What anxiety We, every day, fight the world, the flesh and the devil. We are the Church Militant. We can also glory at the sunset and admire the beauty of nature even if we believe in God. The problem with Dawkins was that he had an interview with whacky zealots and extrapolated it to us all.
