It seems to be a common thing to play with cliches in the 90s. Some do it with great talent. Herve Hadmar. However, in the paper, the film became interesting: the poor plot could be saved by great moments of comedy, dark humor and a lot of "decal" style. Director Hadmar unfortunately murdered his direction with his camera angles and his absolute lack of rhythm. Every joke is embarrassing because no one responds to the theater. The movie is incredibly slow, and the actors seem to wonder how hell does them in this ridiculous mascara. What could have been an attractive, funny mindless comedy is ultimately a boredom cathedral.
