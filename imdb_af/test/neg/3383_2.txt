What an absolute joke of a movie. The case for this movie will believe it is Duel met Jeepers Creepers meet Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Three good movies in their own right and you will think, using their blueprint, MM can't go far wrong. Well, that's what I thought, and I was very, very wrong! <br /> <br /> We follow two college students while traveling the desert to reach a wedding mile. They pick up a girl (no she does not get her clothes off), then they are driven down a Leatherface rip into a Monster truck, finally calling them F ** kface (AKA Monster Man). <br /> <br /> The monster truck I will recognize is a very cool vehicle, but the less-than-tracing chases are ruining its potential. <br /> <br /> So MM decides he has a little grudge against these guys and chases them for a bit, they lose him for a while and stop at a bar full of amputees, then they go to a motel where the main character Adam sleeps with hitch-hiker Sarah (though they both wear underwear!). Then they are caught by MM, taken to his home where they escape death and try to kill MM, but fail, so the set-up for the successor. Apart from a minor 'twist', it is. <br /> <br /> If you can get the first 2 minutes? where Adam's friend, Harley, appeared to hide behind Adam's car trying to scare him without explaining how Harley had come to it, how long ago or how did Adam not even realize? without thinking you already hate it, then you can just enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Monster Man has very poor cinematography and direction that are immediately separated. This is the kind of movie you can pick up as one of those movies in a box containing 20 horror movies you've never heard of. <br /> <br /> What is so annoying is that Blockbuster stock so many of these poor quality movies shot by some amateur film students on digital, which is exactly what MM is (although IMDb mentions that this particular director was born in 1961 ). <br /> <br /> The acting throughout this movie is horrible. The writing, which the author obviously sees as funny, is annoying and childish. You get the impression that only one concept was written before they started shooting. In fact, the screenplay is really much like the film improvised, full of boring, memorable conversations that are just funny or important to the real people involved. Imagine that you have filmed yourself and your friends have a conversation, sure, points are funny ?? To you, but mostly it's trash. This is how the writing is for MM. <br /> <br /> Don't see it for the gore? it is pretty minimal and there are much better gory movies out there (Bad Taste, Evil Dead et al.) <br /> <br /> Even with their cheese and plot holes, Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2 is much better than this film. Compare the intro of Jeepers Creepers to the intro of Monster Man and you'll see what I mean.
