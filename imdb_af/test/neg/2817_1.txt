Kill the screaming queen may sound like a good gunshot, but it is terribly dull and very stupid. <br /> <br /> Killing the screaming queen is about a crazy filmmaker who should be audition girls in his sniff movie. He raped and tortured them. It is garbage that is not amusing, exciting or entertaining. The murderer has no motive, okay maybe just sick ... and very boring. Maybe they can give a victim a story of their own. Anything can be an improvement. It needs a lot more. <br /> <br /> They could just put a little more into it. I love horror / slasher movies, but it's ridiculously bad.
