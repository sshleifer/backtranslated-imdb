I haven't seen many episodes of "Family Guy" and it's a pretty safe bet that I won't see too much in the future. Some people say comparing this view with "The Simpsons" is unfair. I absolutely think this show wouldn't exist if "The Simpsons" didn't even come and I absolutely think it's so much to be "The Simpsons". I don't understand what's so funny about this show. In the episodes I watched, I understood where they wanted me to laugh. I understand that someone thinks a joke is just telling, but the joke is not funny. I find the whole show ringing: the title, the "jokes", is a complete lack of inspiration throughout. <br /> <br /> The best performances on television (cartoon or not) are created in this way: Script is written, it goes through several revisions, things that don't work, are pulled out, inspiration is applied, good things are added, there is more rewriting and then filmed. <br /> <br /> I think a "Family Guy" episode should be created: a script is written and filmed.
