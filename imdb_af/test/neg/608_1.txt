It's a lame comedy. <br /> <br /> Here's why: A man and woman sitcom. Good. <br /> <br /> The man is a voting bag. The woman is the Einstein. <br /> <br /> How original is it? <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller is the same guy in Seinfeld. <br /> <br /> The gags are lame. No spectacular one-liners. <br /> <br /> I've had enough. Stop it now. <br /> <br /> The Last Word: Mute. The destruction of the average white man continues on ABC. The worst part? Kevin James is actually a funny comedian. He's just not here. Leah Remini is a wonderful candy but is unlikely. Destroyed talent is the word. Bad sitcom.
