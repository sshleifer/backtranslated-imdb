It's an entertaining movie. I suggest you rent it, buy a few quails from rum, and invite the whole crew for this one. My favorite parts were. The gunfights that were so good choreographed that John Woo himself was jealous. The wonderful special effects .3. the academy award winner and .4. The fact that every single gangsta in the movie was a bad "Scarface" character. I mean Master P as a Cuban godfather! It is a groundbreaking area. And with a well-written dialogue, including lines like "the only difference between you and my Rico, I'm alive and dead," this movie is truly a masterpiece. Yes right.
