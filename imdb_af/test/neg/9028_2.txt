This movie is a big disappointment. Director Vicente Aranda provided many interesting films during his long career, some of them highlighted by strong and powerful performances by Spanish actress Victoria Abril. In JUANA LA LOCA, he also relies on a talented actress, newcomer Pilar Lopez de Ayala, but it is hardly the only positive element in another terrible mess of a movie. While Lopez de Ayala tries to portray Juana as a romantic and passionate young woman, completely obsessed with love for her handsome man, it seems she can't develop her character over this one-dimensional feature; Juana was an important figure in Spanish history, and the politics of that time were essential in her storyline ... but here she was introduced as a romantic leading lady from a soap opera; It's a real pity, and the movie is a missing opportunity to show how personal lives can influence history and vice versa. The worst of all Italian actors Daniele Liotti and Manuela Arcuri appears in really bad performances, which in the case of Liotti is a real problem, as he portrays Felipe el Hermoso, a key role in this story. It seems a clear choice to attract young audiences, as both of them look like top models of this era. On the other hand, talented actors such as Giuliano Gemma and Rosana Pastor are wasted in supporting roles that are clearly underdeveloped. Even if it was a grand movie, little care was taken to make a good screenplay or to create a period on the screen. Costumes are particularly grotesque in some of the group scenes, as if taken from stock, without any real coherence. All in all, the biggest problem with JUANA LA LOCA (and that's what makes the difference with far superior historical films like LA REINE MARGOT or ELIZABETH) is the lack of a director's position. This is a strange turn in Aranda's career, as he could develop it into other works (LIBERTARIAS and AMANTES come into my mind), creating very personal and interesting movies, while this JUANA is really just a routine academic historical piece. . And it's not very good!
