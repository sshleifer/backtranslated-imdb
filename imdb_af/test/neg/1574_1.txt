This attempt to have a "thriller" would have nothing at all! Some may mention that this movie has "everything?" Autism, arson, robbery, lost love, a bag of money, knotted cats, murder, blood, a snub nose revolver, cut teeth, cripples, boobs (various definitions can be used), big flashes, tribes, a brother duo trying to portray "dumb and duller," white wolves, battle scenes that resemble "happy slapping," snow mobile (s), a large railroad vehicle and a refurbished motel? All this, with an "Enyanesque" melody to the end ... Maybe my score is a bit difficult, but one look will probably be enough for the healthy cinemaphile, with nothing else to do. <br /> <br /> Yeowza!
