If you pack all the clichés about city firefighters in 105 minutes; you have Ladder 49. <br /> <br /> It has a story but is highly clouded by all the clichés. It changes it into a movie associated with each event; Being so predictable is not worth looking at. There is no depth to the story and even the play looks superficial. <br /> <br /> It seemed like a tribute to firefighters, but eventually became boring and pretentious. The parallel between Jack Morrison was fatally trapped under an inaccessible part of a building and firefighters trapped under the Twin Towers litter were all too obvious. <br /> <br /> It doesn't compare to movies like Backdraft and certainly not. do not set an example for future movies about firefighters.
