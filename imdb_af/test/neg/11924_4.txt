While Aeon Flux was generously entertaining and a slightly better way to spend a Wednesday night than the bar, I was delighted to buy one, one gets one free ticket. I didn't know anything about the movie when I went in. I didn't even know there was an animated series before I read this site, I was ready for anything, and as other viewers noticed, the trailers had a well-filmed, good-looking, and interesting movie that made me moved in. Halfway through the movie, although I was so disappointed, it reminded me of the fifth element, but I also feel that it lacks only the little bit of depth and got me empty. feeling. and plenty of useless and slightly boring rifle battles, if you are going to do it, do it with some style, not just many explosions and unsafe guards who fall. Personally, I would rather have seen a little more about the story and the people in the city or know more about how the chairman is undermined, than another long and hard rifle battle.
