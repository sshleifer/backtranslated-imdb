I had to realize it was a sign of things to come when the trailer made this movie bored to me. <br /> <br /> Having watched several indie films based on the reviews on this, and finding that My view is completely against this other reviewer. I began to wonder if it was possible to watch completely different movies from these people, or maybe they were friends / family, etc. of the filmmakers who are trying to make their work big? Hmmm. <br /> <br /> Are you interested in an amateur's tribute to Pulp Fiction and 11:14, except with worse actors, a fool count (undermine different scenes) and incredible jumps in logic? If not, skip this movie. <br /> <br /> Here is my open letter to two of the players in this movie. <br /> <br /> Please, please, please try to be "Samuel L Jackon a La Pulp Fiction." No one can do what he does as well as he does. <br /> <br /> Director, please come up with something original. It is an inconvenience to sniff out these things as if they were Quentin Tarantino. <br /> <br /> Simple, and I really can't see anyone saying it's a good movie. It's a shame that somehow somehow managed to set a score of 8.5, the same as films like Pulp Fiction or Goodfellas. This is not true near these movies; A 4 or 5 would be a more reasonable average rating, I give it a 3.
