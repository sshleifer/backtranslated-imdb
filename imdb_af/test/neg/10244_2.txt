I'm not a movie snob. I got a lot of movies that critics hate, and I hated movies that love critics. However, I have to agree with critics here - "Galaxina" is just substandard. It was clear that it was a comedy, but it has only a few scattered layers. "Galaxy" is poor photography; it has poor special effects; it has a little bad acting; and the production values. Well, the sets can be made of cardboard as well. <br /> <br /> "Galaxina" tells the story of a spaceship whose crew is looking for a magical object called "The Blue Star". After a long journey (and some very unconvincing space fights), the crew comes to its destination, a kind of wild west alien world. There is a painful unfunny cantina scene (clearly designed to be a ghost of the famous Star Wars scene), a chase in space cyclists, and a final resort. <br /> <br /> Trying to throw, but can't breathe life into this turkey. Stephen Macht and Avery Schreiber did better work in other movies. James David Hinton is quite good as a member of the spaceship's crew. It leaves Dorothy Stratten stars as the robot of the title, and while she looks good, her role doesn't give her much chance to act. <br /> <br /> You can catch this movie to see Dorothy Stratten. However, if you're looking for a good movie, you'll probably want to hit this one.
