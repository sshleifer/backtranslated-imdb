When Operators become evangelists, they still exploit in the name of poverty! <br /> <br /> My first response after watching the movie is ?? God bless me that I don't eat fish or any non-vegetarian products! <br /> <br /> The documentary is about the Victoria Lake of Tanzania, where many species used lovely fish to live. And one day in the 1960s, someone injected the mighty fish pork, which became the feasible commodity for Tanzania to European and Japanese markets. The consequences were serious? firstly, all local small and large fish are extinct; Secondly, the plane that took the fish was not empty because it didn't make commercial / business / capitalist sense. It's filled with weapons and ammunition (that's what Europe can give this world); Thirdly, pilots (like all immigrants and travel populations such as truck drivers) must survive their sexual needs by thriving on flower-free local local prostitutes for them; Fourth, the brokers, merchants, middlemen in the chain (mainly Indian origin business people) become richer and Tanzania's poverty remains the same; Fifth poverty drives the children to crime, drugs, etc. <br /> <br /> The point of departure for making this documentary was excellent. But did the director Hubert Sauper succeed in making a good documentary? It's a big NO. <br /> <br /> I say the reasons: As in India, it requires a higher caste Brahmin to stand up and project for the world, Indian poverty and untouchable things. Similarly, it requires a European documentary manufacturer in Austrain that tells the world the story of Tanzania and its crumbling and devastating economy and poverty. It is the pathetic motive of unconscious breeding of that rich class (which has never seen poverty or well-known poor), which survives, lives, deserves, and boasts like pestilence suspended to project poverty to the world once they see it. There is nothing more than despised by poor people in Africa and India who see such images of them. <br /> <br /> The intention and motives of the Hubert seem completely unilateral. The images, characters, places, interviews are grave and dark, dark and disturbing. He uses exaggerated ignorance as a voice to present his case. What we finally feel is sorry and sad for Africans. We also start to see the government of Tanzania and people as villains. May some Westerners sit in their air-conditioned rooms, find time to discuss and debate the pathetic living conditions of Africans, but there will be nothing more than that. <br /> <br /> Does the director stop showing himself once on the screen ?? so it cannot be identified among the Europeans who exploit this poor country. <br /> <br /> This director Hubert can only survive as exploiters himself, as today's CNN and BCC media giants. Hubert did not have guts or common sense to talk to any Europeans who eat or companies that import these fish products. A completely run-sided flimsy effort! But I understand the reasons for the same? Hubert just wanted to express his fame, sit and smile with awards in his European comfort. <br /> <br /> No more words to save for this pathetic effort. I give the documentary a higher score of 3.5 stars out of 10, just because the theme is correct; but was pathetically exploited and blown away by amateur bad pregnant director made exclusively for intelligent Western audiences! (Stars 3.5 out of 10)
