My Tasks: Another crippled PG-13 horror movie with predictable scare tactics and a derived plot. <br /> <br /> The spirits move. The walls cracked. There's something wrong in the basement. This, along with several other horror movie clips, haunts the walls of another country house in the Sam Raimi-crafted THE MESSENGERS, a lame pastiche of the most predictable scare tactics thrown into a plot that regains justice. is of better (and sometimes even worse) horror movies of the past. <br /> <br /> When the Solomon family moves into an old South Dakota farmhouse, in another effort by Dad (Dylan McDermott) to reconnect with the family, especially with their former drunk driver daughter Jessica (the underrated Kristen Stewart), in the more subtle countryside than their home in Chicago. The horror occurs when Jessica begins to get surprise visits from the house's goblins. Think she's a teenage girl who called wolf, her parents don't believe her. How can they? The real horror in THE MESSENGERS is waiting for what horror movie will fear next. Will it be a fierce herd of crows who want more than the family's crops (a direct cut off of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece THE BIRDS)? Will it be the haunted house with a history dating from the AMITYVILLE HORROR or POLTERGEIST? Or will it be the grotesque fantasies taken from your well-known recent horrors like THE RING and THE GRUDGE? Heck, the movie even managed to snatch a scene or two of some really bad horror movies such as AMITYVILLE 3-D and the mediocre COLD CREEK MANOR. Maybe all the Pang Brothers really wanted to do, was a B-level horror movie, but got it so bad? Couldn't they be the best of them? Avoid it. <br /> <br /> Rating: * out of 5.
