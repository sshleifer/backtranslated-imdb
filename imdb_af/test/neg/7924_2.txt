This movie is ... terrible and wonderful at the same time. I only saw it when I was about 13 or 14 years old. It therefore has very nostalgic value to me. In this movie, Cesar Romero actually plays the character of Octavio, the man who discovered Santana. There are also two other actors, Monte Markham (playing Sam, who is trying to save his daughter) and Peter Mark Richman (playing the priest), who has great film cartoons, and these are the only shows right. The rest of the play and the movie itself has all the B movie features some of us cherish. <br /> <br /> I have been trying for 2 years to get a copy of this movie, and it's almost non-existent. I assume it was very shortly after the release. But I finally got a copy and paid a penny to get it. If you come across the Day of Judgment in a video store (unbeatable with a cheese-green "satan" on the cover), count yourself among the blessed who live near one of the few video stores who still have a copy of work. A must see for those of you who love laughing at cute scary movie attempts.
