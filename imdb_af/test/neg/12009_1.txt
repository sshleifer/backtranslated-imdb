When someone tries to tell me they think a movie is the worst ever (and it's usually a movie that is "cool" to hate, such as "Manos, Hands of Fate" or "The Avengers"). I ask them, "Is this film a comedy about an orphan who is constantly trying to kill adults? Is there anyone who's the rule" I would rather eat a maze "in that movie?" <br /> <br / > This movie is MANIE too childless and moronies for adults and WAY too violent and irresponsible for kids. Is there so much money in the Beavis and Butt-head demographic to make such a series of movies? There is a Problem Child 3, but I didn't see it, I'd rather eat a turd.
