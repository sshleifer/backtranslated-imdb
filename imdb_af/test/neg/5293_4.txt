Travolta, Thurman, The Rock, Vaughn, Keitel and so on. One should think that this star parade of great actors could really heat this movie, but no. Travolta once again takes on the role of Chile Palmer, but this time we have seen all the gangster making his luck in the harsh world of movies. It's no longer funny. It's a typical problem in Hollywood, they think if the first was good, the second would be twice as good, NO, the first was original, the second couldn't be. Hey Hollywood is trying to understand originality, you can be duplicated. Give us a new twist, not just the same movie made with a bigger budget. I found myself constantly. I almost laughed when I watched this movie, yet it has many cool actors like Harvey Keitel, James Woods, Vince Vaughn and The Rock and just for that! <br /> <br /> 4/10
