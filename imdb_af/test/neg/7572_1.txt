and abysmal, over-the-top acting, you can enjoy this rubbish flick. Many atomic bombs change life in about a day or two (or other viewers wake up). Or so it looks. And apparently massive nuclear explosions on the coast of Spain allow no one to ask any questions. To think about it, the plot does not make sense in any way (why would bad sock tracks attack fires?), So that the nukes didn't stand out for no reason whatsoever. <br /> <br /> OK, beyond that, and the fact that the "monster" is a glorious thing that makes you socks in the nursery, you can actually stand it. But for once the total lack of gore did not help, leaving the monster attacks in all their bare rock-bottom budget "glory". <br /> <br /> I doubt you can see it, so better stay good.
