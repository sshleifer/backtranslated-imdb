It was the worst movie my wife and I have ever seen. The only concessions are that we didn't pay to see it at the movies, as we rented it on DVD from the video store. Simple - No plot to mention (I just watched it 5 minutes ago and already forgotten), annoying characters played poorly by two-bit actors and if it's a comedy, I'm still waiting to laugh. In fact, the only laugh we got from the movie was that we were joking with each other. We agreed it was really awful. <br /> <br /> This movie was quite pathetic and I warn others not to waste them time. A Travesty of the National Lampoon Name, Rating 0/10.
