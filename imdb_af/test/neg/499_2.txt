You must recognize Cimino's contribution to cinema. He both gave us the most estimated film in history (The Deer Hunter) and the worst movie in history (Heaven's Gate). And before you start the 'It's bad but not the worst ever' let me explain. <br /> <br /> For 20+ years I listened to the critics and avoided "Heaven's Gate". Actually, it wasn't hard, because you're almost bombarded with opportunities to watch this movie. Then I watched the Final Cut: The Making and Unmaking or Heaven's Gate documentary a few days ago, on a used $ 9.99 DVD of the long version. My advice after 229 minutes is to search for the most negative review ever written on this movie (you'll find a wide variety), and imagine that the judge is Cimino's dedicated mom and that she does everything she does can be positive to her dear son's movie. Then you will have an idea of ​​how big a mess Cimino made. <br /> <br /> While pretty much everything is wrong with this movie, which eventually wins the scale to make it even worse (and a classic 'less than zero' example) is its shameful distortion of history. Although the cattlemen's association sent a group of regulators / armed men to Johnson County and had a list of targeted names, the real facts of an interesting historical event are hopelessly exaggerated. On the morning of April 9, 1892, Nick Ray and Nate Champion were besieged and eventually murdered by an army of about 50 cattlemen and Texas guns who came to Johnson County to clean up rustlers. The nation's citizens then besieged the regulators who were (or were) arrested by the army. Women did not actively participate in the fighting. Apart from Ray and Champion, there were minimal casualties. After all, it wasn't promises of assault - and there were no wagons of immigrants in the circles around the campsite. (Earlier, it was a movie maker and not a real Indian tactic). And weeks before the arrival of the regulators, a number of Johnson County residents were hanged without trial, including Jim Averell, the modest road keeper, and his wife, Ella Watson (who raised Cimino as his two leads and he even shows Averell's life to a mature age. <br /> <br /> There is no movie sin bigger than fictional history, if you are going to play the historical facts quickly, then change the names and places to protect the unsuspecting audience who might get away from a movie that believes what they saw was actually happening. Fortunately, so few people saw this movie that the damage was low. Perhaps it is difficult to blame Cimino for his distortion of history. He can probably never escape with a mental defense. The movie offers a lot of support. If Cimino were ill during the production of the Hemelspoort, it would explain many things. But my voice goes to a lack of talent 'instead of madness. <br /> <br /> There are some good things about the Hemelsek. You can actually see on the screen where the big budget went; expensive sets-beautiful epic camera shots-artistic dance series. Isabelle Huppert (a weird decisive choice that really worked) gives a pleasant and enjoyable performance, although most of her scenes are extremely boring (it tends to happen when the director forgets to give the viewer any reason to talk about it) to care for the characters). The dialogue is generally solid if it is rather ordinary. <br /> <br /> But do not fall for the crap that this movie is experimenting with storytelling by blending the accelerated carefully formed moments of character interaction with cross-sided joint action blasts. This implies that there was a method for Cimino madness. "Experiments" is another word for when a filmmaker in his project gets so lost that a coherent story is no longer possible. The simple fact is that there is no evidence. Cimino wrote a single play or made any attempt to establish control or organization. What it looks like is that he detached his DP for the stage action and to get an endless choice of colorful shots - 1.5 million feet of stand-alone plays. Then he (without success) tried to refurbish it and gather everything in the post-production. <br /> <br /> The final battlefield is actually hilarious, as babushka bearers (perhaps from a Fiddler On The Roof touring company) borrowed many sticks dynamically at regulators. Unfortunately, every explosive falls short of the target and explodes it innocently. After seeing it 50-60 times, you can relate to the woman (the one that looks like something from "The Grapes of Revenge") that puts a big gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger. That's probably what Cimino's mother did after writing the review. <br /> <br /> So believe what you've heard about this movie since 1980. It's a messy, disconnected, slow pace and historically distorted mess. Worth just as a "how not to make a movie" example for film historians and as a source of entertainment for those who know the real history of the American West.
