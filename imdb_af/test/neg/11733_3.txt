Honestly, how difficult can it be to make a good remake? This is of course quite difficult! I was so excited to see it because I loved the original, and my friends are seeing it and saying it really sucks. Well, I finally saw it and I was so disappointed. Okay, the shower scene was more realistic ... that's why I gave it a 3. Otherwise it sucked. Vince Vaughn does a terrible job playing Norman, he's just too tight or something. I don't know, it was just awful. Don't see it!
