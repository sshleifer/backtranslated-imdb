Porno legend Gregory Dark leads this cute horror movie that Glen Jacobs (WWF / WWE / Kane he also calls today) in his film debut. He plays Jacob Goodknight, a blind series of murderers whose forts are people's eyes. The plot, whichever it may be, has a group of troubled youths cleaning the historic hotel on which GoodKnight lives and is then offered by him. Hemmingway this is not. Start as a fun, dull B-movie, but soon become too boring to be enjoyable. Glad I went in with fairly low expectations, but even those were not met. How can you direct a porn king and still suffer from a lack of nudity ??? for shame. <br /> <br /> My Degree: D- <br /> <br /> Eyebrow: Samantha Noble briefly bursts her ass
