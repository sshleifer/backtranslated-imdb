this movie is so bad and Hellraiser part 1 to 3 is so big. Nothing is a good bloodline ... very gore but without meaning and most of the time without originality. The film is about the past, the present (1996) and the future of the puzzle. The creator of the box and his progeny battle a few demons, but nothing seriously closes the 3 stories. Pinhead is in the movie ... but it's not Pinhead, he's just a boring bad guy who kills kids and kills bird and the worse ... he's talking too much. One thing I really didn't understand is why the dog from hell ????? He can't be a cenobite, because he didn't have any people. Why can the dog be killed by pressure if the other creature can get out of hell without problems ????? Bloodline is in many ways incoherent with the film series. For example, Pinhead and Angelique are an old friend in this movie, but it is impossible for Pinhead to meet Angelique because Pinhead is just a World War One soldier. Angelique is an old devil and she has been living in Paris for some 200 years.
