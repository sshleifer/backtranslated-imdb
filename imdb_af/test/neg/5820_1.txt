Thank God, it's not renewed by ITV. <br /> <br /> This series, while popular (God knows why), has a very simple: 'Look, I've found another body behind the flowers / bushes / trees / everywhere they work - for the sixteenth reverse this series plot. The dialogue is so simple. It's as if it's written for kids - talk to the viewer and explain each plot point. <br /> <br /> It's just 'happening' to be around when someone does something out of the ordinary - and no one gets to know them. <br /> <br /> Every time they look at someone's murder, they get in the way of everyone else - destroying everyone's lives - including those who are completely innocent. <br /> <br /> They break and act in people's homes, and steal items and evidence (even firearms) are nosy and come in people's lives, spying on them and going through their stuff. They never apologize to them, are never caught or arrested (and if they do, they can express their way out, although another character who does the same goes to jail!). <br /> <br /> They're always coming up troops. Now I know it's an easy series, but I think it realistically it shouldn't have passed the first few episodes! This is simply unrealistic. <br /> <br /> I think they've found enough bodies in the undergrowth, both here and on the continent (where they are every other week), so I hope it never comes back. br /> <br /> ITV needs action on the screen instead of all the years of humdrum - "someone is murdered at the town screen - again type of series.
