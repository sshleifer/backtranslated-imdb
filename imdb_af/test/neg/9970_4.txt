Touch me as a routine, as far as TV movies are concerned. I can believe it's based on a real story, because the plot seems too clumsy to be written by someone with storytelling skills. <br /> <br /> For example, good old John Ritter (now a rather big and heavy villain) poisoned his wife enough to make her sick, and accused her of being psychosomatic and immediately with another young woman get married. Fourteen years pass before the story reappears. Why fourteen years? I guess though the story doesn't claim it, do history. <br /> <br /> However, some of the particular scenes are so physical that they are almost certainly dreamed of by a writer. Pawing through her attic, Helgenberger, Ritter's first wife, bumps over an old electric appliance and has one of those black-and-white flashbacks with stitches on the tip. Suddenly she reminded her when she discovered Ritter's shaving selenium filing fourteen years ago. from a rectifier, carefully collect them, and put them in her shampoo and her eyelashes (or whatever it is called). Later it developed that he also put it in her coffee. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I don't believe. I also didn't believe she had that particular epiphany on the attic, or that Ritter had put her in her shampoo or eyeliner. Selenium is called a "toxic metal" in the film, and I think it is in sufficient quantity, but it is also an antioxidant that is sold and swallowed in drug stores. Someone will have to demonstrate - as nobody in this movie does - that it is a topical poison. Many people have tried and failed the nicotine spot. So how does selenium get into her shampoo, does Marg Helgenberger give immediate and drastic headaches? And her eyes become as painful as cooking when she uses makeup? I think the anthropologist E. B. Tylor called this simple idea "sympathetic magic", but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> Mais je divage. In any case, Ritter tries fourteen years later the same stunt with his second wife, although no evidence of fraud is ever produced when she becomes ill with the same symptoms. Woman number two is taken to Mexico and apparently healed, but suddenly his death falls shortly after her return. Almost evidence falls against Ritter, who plays the villain with all the sticks. When his first trial was released, he sent SMIRKS to Helgenberger, who asked for the investigation. <br /> <br /> You see, Helgenberger were good friends. with Ritter's second wife and was terribly disturbed at her downfall and his way. (I'll bet.) And she wants to prevent the same thing from happening to the rich young woman who looks third in Ritter's marriage schedule. (Sure.) The best performance is given by the guy playing Detective Mauser - Lawrence Dane? Everyone else acts through the numbers. They project emotions and thoughts with the subtlety of a warning at a railroad crossing. But Dane does small things that are original. "I am told you want to report a murder. (Long while he waits), his face suddenly pushes to Helgeberger and asks in a reasonable and curious voice," So who's killed "? bones of historical events, nothing prevents characters or their actions from being drawn differently than they were in real life, I mean, quite completely, Ritter is still in prison, found guilty of murder and Helgenberger's character is dead, so who should i want the forensic stuff made clear .. Ritter used so many toxins and poisonous metals - let me see selenium, cyanide, a massive dose of chlorine, and maybe something else i was confused It's not that i Ritter not root Here is a mathematician with a Ph.D. who insists that people call him "doctor." He even improves people who only address him as a professor. Most Ph.Ds get that narcissistic problem behind them a lot fast.
