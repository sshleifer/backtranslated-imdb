Who really care about whether the show goes on or not? The score here is also a lot. Of course, the movie's big number 'Lullaby of Broadway', which accompanies a long fantasy dance song about a New York socialite's ultimate downfall of too much partying - doesn't have exactly the same effect as the forgotten 'Forgotten Man' number used. as the final in '33.
