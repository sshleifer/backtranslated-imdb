While everyone is doing a decent job in this movie, I agree with the other comments: it's too loose and scattered, too much like a script-less experiment with many talented actors. As such, it is not enough to keep your attention. To say that, there are a few very funny moments, including Dylan McDermott and a flaming lap glass that I think anyone who was so drunk would find as funny as I did; the other is a split second with an inflatable dinosaur. Crispin Glover does his usual bridesmaid and is fine, Harry Dean Stanton does his usual nut patriarch (Repo Man, anyone?) Etc. Good throwing, not enough to keep it going. Just a few gems, seconds long.
