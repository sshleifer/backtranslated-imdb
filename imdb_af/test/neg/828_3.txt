MAY BE IN SPOILERS. Over the past four years, I have been a keen fan of Ali G. Sacha. Baron Cohen is undoubtedly a very funny and intelligent guy and I think his best creation is Borat which is as funny as hell and shameless. in what he does and says to people. <br /> <br /> Anyway, after the movie. I didn't bother to pay money to see it in the theater; I suppose I didn't expect much, but when I rented the DVD recently, I found the whole thing very sad. The best part of Ali to take the mickey out of others was largely missing and the script was a beautiful condemnation. Hook up all the car batteries to blow a safe - LOTS !! ?? <br /> <br /> This movie will show I think some things can run too long and certainly not translate on the big screen. The movie also had that poppy sweet end I expected from British movies. Where did all the good British filming ideas go? It was said that there were the strange, very funny moments like the dog in Ali's bed and Ali's hearing with HM the Q with the "Shaven Haven - RESPECT" comment. <br /> <br /> So, in short, I'm an Ali G and Borat fan and I enjoyed a lot of his interviews (especially the one with Anita Roddick from the Body Shop), but this movie was really flat with me was. If there is another movie, I hope it is much better than these very old steps. <br /> <br /> Canberra, Australia
