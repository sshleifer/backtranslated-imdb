I went to see with 3 friends Random Hearts, and first I thought it might be just me who doesn't enjoy the movie. After all, I didn't warn as well as it did and that movie won all sorts of awards. Well, it wasn't just me ... not one of my friends looked. It was incredibly slow, just like getting teeth. The only action in the movie is what is in preview. We didn't walk out of the theater, because we all assumed something would happen. We weren't as smart as the 7 or 8 people who went out. I've never been to a movie in my life, but I definitely have to. It is hard for me to write, as I am relatively easy to please when it comes to movies. It takes a lot for me to think a movie is great, but not much for me to just love. This movie didn't even come in the same category. Not only was the movie about two hours long, but it was like two separate trite stories in one, but they were not cut together at all. Plus, the "soundtrack" if you could even call it so annoying. Like Seinfeld, the same riff played over and over (difference is that I like Seinfeld). This movie had this jazz riff that keeps it playing, which sometimes sounded inappropriate, especially when people were killed by the plane crash. Hard to explain what I mean, but trust me it was terrible. I can't say enough not to waste people their money. After leaving the theater, I honestly wanted to write to the movie company and claim my $ 7 back. He went, or I could have thrown bowling or something for that money.
