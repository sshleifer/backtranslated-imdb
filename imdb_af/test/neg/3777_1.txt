The parallels between this film and "Captain Walrus" (an independent film shown during the 1994 Team Film Film Festival) are so blindly obvious that any praise for Sally Marshall is not a stranger, should be seen with the knowledge that It drives the success of another job. <br /> <br /> In Captain Walrus, two young boys (Geoff and Roger, respectively Dean Turner and Brett Allen) play the bizarre behavior of their new neighbor, Britney (played by Louise Farley). As the two boys watch through their telescope, they see the repeated visits of a man in uniform calling them Captain Walrus (played by Peter Sargent). However, the emphasis in Captain Walrus is on the useless and somewhat stingy actions of neighbor Britney, and less on the friendship between the two boys. <br /> <br /> Critical success at the film festival, the plot of Captain Walrus has, of course, been dedicated and rearranged to give the Australian Film Community another edge on the band's product. Although Sally Marshall is not a stranger, it's a fine movie, and a credit to his producers, makes his indifference something to earn.
