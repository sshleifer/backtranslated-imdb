Wow. Not Wow. Never before have I seen a horror movie where it seems like a bad self-insertion fanfic is that someone wrote one day in 20 minutes. And then I came across the "Lady Frankenstein". This movie takes everything you know about Frankenstein and turns it all upside down ... and not in a good way. If you've seen this movie, you've also stumbled on Italian TV, or you have the print version on the 50 Chilling Classics Box series like number 24. And we can only say there's a reason why these movies are here. Because they are not very good. enough of it, but on the movie. <br /> <br /> It starts with dr. Frankenstein trying to make the monster with his assistant whose .... of course not for any reason. His college graduate daughter (?) Points out and says she's just graduated with a medical degree because yes. Then there were so many female doctors. So she says how she wants to help her father with his work and he says no. And then he makes the monster and it kills him. So she grieves for exactly 7 seconds and then makes a story with the assistant how it was a burglar. The monster escapes and goes on a rampage. <br /> <br /> OK, I really can't believe dr. Frankenstein killed so early in the movie. he dies like ... 20 minutes. And then his daughter took over. what .... doesn't make much sense, but sure. <br /> <br /> So Lady Frankenstein decides the best way to kill the monster that is now destroyed ... is to make another monster! oh how i love her logic. so her new monster gets her body by killing someone and putting the assistant's brain in it ... i know. nod and go with it. So meet and meet the monsters. I love how the assistant asks, "Why don't we just kill the crowd?" and she replied with "They won't know how to kill it!" and in the end he killed it with an ax on the head. haha. Oh, no one else could have found that one. so in the end the brain killed new monster lady frankenstein. The end. <br /> <br /> This movie was just .... strange. It was serious that someone wrote a fanfic self-adhesive. There is no other way to describe this movie. there were also strange bare scenes. As this girl has naked sex in the park with her boyfriend, the monster picks up the girl and the man drives away. haha. good guy. She then struggles a bit and dies of ... being honest, I really don't know what she died of. But whatever. This is Lady Frankenstein. It doesn't have to make sense. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of "Why?" had? moments to the point I just gave up. Movies shouldn't do that, but for some reason I see more than I probably should. <br /> <br /> So final word, it's not the worst movie I've seen on this pack, but it's a bit boring, and full of many holes and random stuff. <br /> <br /> So Lady Frankenstein gets 3 Frankenstein porn screens out of 10
