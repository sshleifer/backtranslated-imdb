For the record, I hate spoofing movies. Except for Mel Brooks and AIRPLANE! because they are classics and make fun of the cliches, not the real movies themselves. I think that movie films are the bottom of the course for both comedy and film. I especially hate things created by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the "genius" behind DATE MOVIE, EPIC MOVIE, and meet the SPARTANE. <br /> <br /> I decided to take a look at the COMEBACKS. Since Friedberg and Seltzer had nothing to do with the production, I was as objective as possible. It was just like one of their movies. It was basically every single movie that was played in one role, with preschool jokes, and bodily injury disorders that were supposed to make me laugh and fail. <br /> <br /> Only those who are tall will laugh at these jokes. Toilet bowl? Who wrote it? an 11 year old? I was surprised to see that it was the creation of WEDDING CRASHERS producers, which was actually pretty decent. But there was an attempt to be the spoof genre about as funny as a burning orphanage. The only reason I gave these two stars was because Friedberg & Seltzer had nothing to do with it.
