I walked into a bookshop in Brentwood, Tennessee. I'm not going to say the name, because I'm a dedicated client. I was happy with every item I bought before this one. The Bell Hitch Haunting was on the front of the store. (May I mention this is the only store I saw in sales.) I heard somewhere from the story and remember that it would really have happened. I was very excited and couldn't wait to see it. I had great expectations for that. I couldn't believe what I saw when I looked at it. It doesn't look like a real movie. It looked like a home video. I was under the impression that it was supposed to be a horror movie. I mean the movie was supposed to be about a witch finding you. It's not a horror movie. You won't jump out of your seat to watch this movie. I gave the movie all the chances in the world to get better, as it went along. I swear I did it. It never got any better. There were a few scenes of this little child who got naked and thrown at him. I didn't find it at all. I watched the whole movie with disbelief that the store would actually sell it to me. I think that's how bad this economy is. I have to say this to the cast and crew. Don't show this movie as material to get other movie work. Don't do this. I mean it sincerely. I recommend you to try. For people who bought it. I say so. Don't sell your copy to anyone. They can get very upset. Have a nice day all.
