It just shows how terribly the WB network has been in the last few years of its existence. Of course, as a home teacher, I regret this show for his ridiculous, fantasy land, obscure and unfriendly stereotypes about the kids who are "strange hippies who are so clever that they are alienated from super-cool high school students". Sorry TV writers, the world as seen from within your ass (who apparently made your heads when you wrote this show) are NOT the world our talented people see with our eyes as we mentioned in a little thing reality. As for those who actually liked this show ... please, dearest, sweet Jesus, please consider the statement that you really kept this crap over a very long life. The acting is even more hollow, pale and wood than the stereotypes the whole show is built on. Thank you WB for the right thing and doing this horse out of its start-to-end misery. This show should never have had the privilege of being made, no less than eight terrible episodes. I really hope these actors finally got an idea and stopped playing movies in rubbish programs like this once this show ended.
