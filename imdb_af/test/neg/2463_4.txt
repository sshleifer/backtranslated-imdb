"Again, we have a movie about 20 minutes of entertainment, with a 90-minute package that includes the band's occasional funny lyrics." For anyone who is old enough to remember, this is in line with the first "Bill and Ted" WITHOUT the story. If it doesn't say enough about how brainless this movie is, think of Jack Black for about 20 minutes of the movie and it's his point of sale. If you really want to listen to Tenacious D because of their musical skill, knock yourself out and buy the soundtrack. Don't waste your time with it. If your stoner is looking for a good bad movie, full of laughter, you're still blowing the wrong tree. No matter how strong your knobs are, you'll still be left because you'd rather be in Ouma's Boy again.
