It must be one of the absolute worst movies I've ever seen in my life. The writing and acting are just pathetic. It is right there with Uncle Sam on the very worst movie ever made. However, if I see a shit, I can make it on video, and it inspires me to make my wild dreams of making movies, because I know I can do a better job than the makers of Killers.
