A friend of mine showed me this movie yesterday and I was very surprised that someone could make a movie this terrible! <br /> <br /> Mix the most horrific clich√© dialogue, with the most woodworkers you've ever seen, with the bareest special effects man knows, and you'll have this wonderful animal! <br /> <br /> 'Vampire Assassins' is more fun than most comedies I've seen, it's really awful! <br /> <br /> I was in stitches during the scene where the ex-cop / vampire killer has coffee with the internet journalist. Just look at it and you will see what I mean! <br /> <br /> I honestly can't believe anyone made it with serious intentions. <br /> <br /> Tragic, but very good laugh. It must be seen to be believed.
