This is a movie from toilet photos. If the name of the production company is any indication of how smelly a movie is, then this is the case. I don't think I'm really a fan of horror movies, not that I'm chicken, but rather this year alone, I'm not really thrilled by what has been offered so far, whether it's from the West or Asia. 9:56 is no different, good point of departure, but poor performance, depending on clich√© techniques (I think these are the only tools available on the market?) To provoke a few heart-blowing moments. <br /> <br /> Se -jin (Ko So-young) is a lonely career woman, who one day remembers that some apartments in the apartment block are simultaneously undergoing at 9:56 am every day. No, she's not a voyeur, but a series of inexplicable deaths in the area, including the one she meets on a subway, begins to pull her deeper and deeper into the mystery of these deaths. <br /> <br /> With horror movies, there is always a pseudo-logical explanation in the movie about how the proverbs occur. It's all about the most interesting thing that happens in the movie, the unraveling of the Truth, though it won't take new film lovers to guess the plot halfway through. Of course, this makes a very unsatisfactory experience of watching this movie. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of characters like the wheelchair-bound girl, and the neighbors taking turns taking care of her, as well as a schoolgirl, detective, a mentally challenged boy and a haunting train commuter. But because of the genre formula, these people are usually feed for deaths, or in this case, inexorable red herring characters whose only purpose by the filmmakers is to deceive the audience, never mind if they pass or add little to sending the plot. br /> <br /> And don't let me start with the techniques used here. Quick cuts, sudden appearances, long hair ghouls (ahhhhhh, so over!) Who can't move properly, lots of blood, as it flows free in the mountain, and the list goes on. But credit to the sound engineers for creating a few overblown clatter sounds is moving every time the spit moves, but it looks like a one-time pony. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time, even if you're "A horror fan. It's a complete waste of a promising premise, and in the end you feel you've just been taken on a ride. A very long and painful one to endure. It's high time for a little innovation in this genre, otherwise one movie will look like another, with ugly long-haired monsters moving funny, but with the ability to make sudden appearances accompanied by loud noises. Oh, and can anyone put those doors in oil while they are so good.
