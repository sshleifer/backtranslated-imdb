Being a great fan of Conte d'ete (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115940/), I expected to be through another French romance, with a lot of honesty, realism and humor. The same director, the same actress - what can go wrong? Unfortunately Pauline a la plange is a huge disappointment. It is very slow and talkative. It would be good if the dialogue conveyed insight into the characters, was meaningful or original. But it appears as a typical soap opera that varies between irrelevant cushion talk and jealous accusations. The only thing this movie saves to be a complete disaster is a small amount of character development or at least "character change" to Pauline. The source material is standard money (sexual awakening during a beach holiday), but it can be a decent movie if any of the characters were interesting enough. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Event although there are other shortcomings with Rohmer's season cycle, most of its later films are definitely higher than that.
