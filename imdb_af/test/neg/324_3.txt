In Halloween, three friends are looking for an old cemetery in the suburb for pleasure and removing a cross from a grave where Jack-O was buried many years ago by farmer Arthur Kelly. The evil creature is being released, killing the trio and revenge the Kelly family. <br /> <br /> The cheese-like Jack-O is a combination of a horrible story with terrible acting. I was curiously named John Carradine in the credits and I can't imagine how a family member authorizes the use of archival material in such a bad movie. It shows a complete lack of respect with the name of this great actor. It's impressive how bad the acting is, and move the movie to a comedy instead of the proposed horror genre. This is the kind of movie that is good to see with a group of friends, drink beer, comment and laugh. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Jack-O? Dem√¥nio do Halloween" ("Jack-O? Demon of the Halloween")?
