I found this to be a watch, even though it is a very predictable movie. There were some good stunts that gave the story a fair amount of excitement and excitement. However, one had to suspend the credibility of the plot on a number of occasions. For example, despite the loss of their transmission cable, couplings and harness when the pilot manually withdrew the hand vehicle, they fortunately found an extra aboard the caravan plane. According to the plot drill a hole in the ceiling of the safe would turn off the alarm system in the safe when the system is reactivated (I can't think why). According to Daltry, the battery in the battery will not be drilled. ceiling, but they have just had a hydraulic drill with hoses and fittings to fit the equally convenient take-off points in the aircraft's hydraulic system above the safe. Since the aircraft has a closed hydraulic system, it is difficult to see how it can be achieved without affecting the control systems or at least setting the hydraulic pressure alarms in the cabin. Accept it for the sake of the plot, it takes them a few minutes to drill a small hole through the top of the safe (tension will be able to pierce them before FEDs get there to check the false alarm), but from time to time that the safe closed and before the FEDs walked the few feet to the second security door, they cut a hole in the roof of the safe, big enough to pass through. One can accept all the theses and other inconsistencies for the sake of a good yarn, but what the movie was spoiled for me was when it was an attempt to argue the writing writers to discuss what until then " was a fairly predictable end. Ketchum & Brooks were shot dead and thrown out of a 747 at 10,000 feet. The other wildest slips the cable between the two planes that the villain Daltry manages to release. the cable carries the weight of an adult man with the air pressure of a few hundred miles per hour that pushes him and causes him to fall to his death. And yet, in the following order, these two survived the 10,000 foot miracle without any explanation (how disappointing or impeccable) and had time to set up an extensive scam to get the money. The only comment about it was for Sophie that her brother was a bad shot. Don't expect an Oscar nomination for this one.
