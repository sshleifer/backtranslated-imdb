This conglomeration so fails at every level that it is difficult to decide what to say. It doesn't make one rule, much less ten, but to comply with the rules of IMDb, go here and I'll probably not succeed for the first time and have to type more to make this submission accepted. LOL <br /> <br /> If I saw this shock during the 70's as I was going through my mushroom phase, I would consider it rather ungrateful and level. The most exciting shot for me was the long shot when the elevator door was opened and closed. I was on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> One person here writes that he met the creator of this mess, as if it were a red day in his life. One can only pray that something more exciting takes place in those posters. Grab a grip, amigo.
