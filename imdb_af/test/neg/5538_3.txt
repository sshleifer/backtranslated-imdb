Artist Daniel King (Chris John) and his partner Laura Peters (Lara Clancy) are invited to travel to an old home in Cornwall, Britain, through his childhood, a rich friend, Natasha Carlton (Carol Kentish). Natasha is in love with Daniel, who is an ambiguous man about his sentimental life. While alone in the house, strange things happen and Laura is scared and scared. When Laura meets the old, crazy priest Gabriel Norton (Brian Blessed) on the road, she is advised to leave the house immediately, as the evil lives there. But the couple remain and have tragic consequences. <br /> <br /> What a messy script and terrible and cheesy movie this devil's harvest is! The cinematography and camera work is not bad, but the amateurist performances of Chris John and Carol Kentish and James Shanks, along with the horrible story, ridiculous situations and dialogues, make this movie one of the worse things I've ever seen got into the genre. I have occasionally seen in YouTube a few short shorts from the cinema college that are better and better than the useless and terrible "Devil's Harvest". In the end, it's not a horror movie, but a horror movie. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Colheita do Diabo" ("The Devil's Harvest")
