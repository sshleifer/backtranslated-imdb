It's an ominously boring, slow-moving movie. We can feel sympathy for the social and sexually inexperienced and uncomfortable Tomek, but Magda's motivation is pretty hard to see, and the end, at least for me, was impracticable. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's about how we all need love, but I'll get more from a good Busby Berkeley. <br /> <br /> I'm told that the comments should be at least ten lines, so I'll add that in the background are some interesting shots of the relationship between Polish citizens and government employees and institutions. I wonder if it is supposed to portray it before or after the fall of the communist government. <br /> <br /> Finally, pay attention to the clever way the men of the gas company investigate whether there is a gas leak in Magda's or not stove.
