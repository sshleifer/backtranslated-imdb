"Hoods" don't deliver the goods. This half-baked mafia comedy boasts a star cast, including Joe Mantegna, Kevin Pollack, Joe Pantoliano, Jennifer Tilly and Seymour Cassel, along with a number of faces familiar to those watching crime movies, but this is really a burned when ever there was one. Author and director, Mark Malone, is best known for writing Dead of Winter for Bonnie & Clyde director Arthur Penn. He wrote a pedestrian pot boiler, which had a bad but inventive master boss Louie Martinelli (Seymour Cassel) who beat his son Angelo Joe Mantegna from "House of Games" to Carmine DellaRosa. It appears that a competitor mob bombarded one of Pop's warehouses (in the openingstone) and Martinelli wants repayment. Trouble is that nobody has any idea who Carmine DellaRosa is. In any other mob comedy, such a complication can be amusing, but here's just flat. Angelo and a carload of wiseguys, including his best friend Rudy (Kevin Pollack of "Deterrence") spend half the time figuring out who Carmine is. Both Rudy and Angelo don't want the hit, so they follow a crazy gang hit Charlie (Joe Pantoliano from "Bad Boys") to do the dirty act. Before convincing Charlie to make the hit, they have to find him, and Charlie's malicious wife Mary (Jennifer Tilly or "Bound") shows he's locked up in a mental hospital. Our awkward heroes go out to the mental hospital and break out Charlie. About half of the movie is over before they discover that Carmine is a child in short shorts (Vincent Berry) who is slim and innocent. Indeed, Carmine has the only decent line in the movie. As our mindless cluster of heroes go out of his house with him in the backseat to look after things, Carmine warns them to house him in time or his father will kill him. Charlie tries to ice the eggs, but he can't. Instead, he reconnects with his feelings and wants to go back to the mental hospital so he can report the good news to his doctor. Meanwhile, after Charlie decides not to shoot Karmin, the child gets his pots on the pistol and comes out several aimless rounds. Angelo and he struggle with the automatic. The pistol slips out of their collective hands and hits the ground, goes down and blows a hole in Rudy's chest. Keep in mind that Rudy never wanted to shoot the child in the first place, and Angelo and he argued about the wrong head of the hit. So Rudy winds on the ground with a fatal wound, while Angelo struggles to stop the bleeding. Talk about a dull death scene. Angelo confronted himself because his father ordered the hit and Angelo feared that Dad would do him if he didn't execute orders. There is a jump-back subplot about Angelo's father teaching him how to handle a firearm that gives insight into Angelo's reluctance to pack a gun. There is nothing at all about this depressing comedy with an end to an end. . Things get worse, and if you're going through this 90 minute nonsense, you'll see what I mean. The comedy is largely laughable. Good actors flow into sketchy roles that aren't even funny. Perhaps director Malone tried to do another comedy like "The Gang That Could Not Shoot Straight." If he was, he missed a mile. Big-bitten Jennifer Tilly shows gland and strings through some scenes with Mantegna, but she doesn't do much of anything else. She is the stereotype slut who doesn't even get naked. A paycheck is the only way to explain the presence of such a talented role, otherwise this picture is pathetic from start to finish. Initially, I hoped it could be a "Ransom or Red Chief" knockoff where the kid runs the wiseguys nuts, but not so much luck here. Of course, the biggest surprise is that they have to kill a child, but it's not the kind of surprise you want to see in their decision. <br /> <br /> I actually have this movie on a Canadian DVD label ?? Seville ?? and it contains only the most basic special features. If you hate previews that give away the plot, don't look at the trailer. If you ever meet Joe Mantegna, one of your first questions should be why he helped produce this yawner. It's not hilarious or dramatic. There are no quotable lines, and none of the characters appear as interesting or sympathetic. The Seville DVD offers the movie in full frame without captions or closed captions.
