I completely forgot that I had seen it within a few days, which in itself was fairly public. The umpteenth version of Gaston 'Phantom of the Opera' Leroux's home-locked doors, I heard it was an engaging and witty work. It is evident from the nice title series and some neat touches in the opening scene, but the movie has come to a standstill and is vaguely boring and totally unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> As a mystery, the biggest problem is It is fundamentally insoluble by the audience: like the worst Agatha Christies, it depends on a character acting in the final act, with a wealth of background information we do not have. As a movie, whether it is a comedy or a thriller, the critical issue is that characterization hardly exists. With the exception of the murderer, everyone is a visable version of the typical suspects in the typical country murder story - reporter, endangered heir, suspicious fianc√©, scattered scientific father (a surprisingly poor Michel Lonsdale), etc. There is no depth and little interest, and the regular overripe or offended actions do not help. You honestly don't care about anyone in there, so there's no danger or tension. Only Claude Rich and, in the final role, Pierre Arditi gets anything to work with, and only in the last line does the film come close to a resonance that is too short to be really effective. <br /> <br /> For the rest, we get endless exposition and some ineffective will-be-comic pieces (a promising one with a photographer trapped in a grandfather's clock is just too bad to think off), with Dennis Podalydes decreasing to Irving the Clarifier for the last third of the picture. I don't love rural movies or Agatha Christie-style whodunits, so those who might be sitting there are much more limp, but I found it a poor show. As Rich says when the riddle is revealed, "It's all rather a disappointment."
