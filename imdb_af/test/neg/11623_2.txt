the worst successor I've ever seen. many horrible songs that are disturbing in light of how fantastic the first movie is and story! Also, what spoiled my role is the fact that there is no John Cleese, so jean Bob can't even be in it and the new villains are scary. It's really annoying how the old woman can't cut a simple thing together without repeating her words over and over. But to be honest, Uberta is not a little funny. but the fact that it was her 50th birthday: why are they drawing her like an 80 year old? I would give it a 1, but now I think ... I can give it a 2. But still the story line is not as close as the first movie. It is similar without the humor of certain characters. Overall, I didn't hate this movie completely because of the disappointing music, the serious lack of voice talent: the voice of Prince Derek and Jean Bob, the new villains, the disappointing story, the boring habits of some characters, and the very simple animation.
