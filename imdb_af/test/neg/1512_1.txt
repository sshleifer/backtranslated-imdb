As a Christian I found this movie to be completely embarrassing. The actors sucked, sucked the writing, sucked the movie, and the story was so typical. I can't say this is a great evidence tool, because I will be too shy to show any of my unsaved friends. Hollywood has much better things, and that's because they invest the best in it. Christians have worked hard and think it's OK because "it's for the Lord". In the Old Testament, people spent large amounts of money to offer sacrifices to God. David (or Saul. I do not remember) spending what would be about $ 50 billion in today's money to build a temple for God. But it is just pathetic to spend that would be about $ 30,000 tops to make a movie to witness to people. It's the person, not the product that touches anyone. Don't waste your time trying to turn your friends into wasting an hour and a half. If you want to make a positive impact with people, they show movies like The Matrix, American Beauty, Braveheart, etc. Movies that have something to say and really get it in you.
