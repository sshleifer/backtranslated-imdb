"Get Shorty", "Out of Sight", "Jackie Brown" (and even "52 Pick-Up") - eventually got Elmore Leonard up and made good movies from his work. So, despite my students' warnings about how bad this movie would be, I couldn't resist renting it. I thought, how bad could it be? Oh yes, what a mistake, especially on the heels of reading the book, which was also lame (and too round self-referring), relative to the rest of Elmore Leonard's books. Yet the book was better than the movie. Leonard again comforts the poor and unskilled screenwriters trying to take over his book. The dialogue written for Steven Tyler was painful to watch. And the lyrics for the character Linda Moon's first song? My middle schoolers write with more depth. Sad, sad, sad. Why does it even give a star? Because Harvey Keitel and Uma Thurman are still fun to see on the screen, Andr√© 3000 did not make a fool of himself.
