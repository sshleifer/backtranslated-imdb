This movie was not only disappointing for the horror / suspense movie lover, it was disappointing for anyone who saw it. Wow. I thought this movie might be funny because the man with the big head. However, it was filled with a long and protracted conversation that was not necessary. There was so much sex that I now hate women and men. This movie wasn't just boring, but there was no substance. Wow. Wow. In addition, every play looks like the light of a light bulb, and I think they used the same set for two different lawyers, a restaurant and an airport. This movie is not for the movie lover who loves bad movies, as it eventually feels wasted time. See the movie! <br /> <br /> Party
