The final frames of the original "American Graffiti" provide a summary of the fate of the movie's four central male characters. The end of the original movie has all the information about the people who would have even the most ardent fan of the movie, while it was somewhat sexist to leave the female characters away. But someone felt that mega-bucks could be made by describing the urgent lives of these characters after the original movie ended. Bad move. Making an insurance salesman and his wife, a northern private in Vietnam, a drag racing driver and an over-grown hippie in interesting characters in interesting situations, was far above the talents of those who wrote this almost immovable movie. While most of the original cast is back, with only Richard Dreyfuss having the good sense to stay away, 'More American Graffiti' is a mess of stupid situations that include protest, motor sports, countrymen and the Vietnam War. The use of divider screens, once renewable and constantly thought, is overused to the point of distraction and adds confusion to the already confused passage. It is a successor who demonstrates almost everything that can go wrong with a successor. Maybe it should be selected in film schools as a lesson. Even the use of period music, which was a delight in the original, was badly done here. If you want more "American Graffiti", see the original twice.
