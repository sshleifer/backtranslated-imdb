It's horrible, even for a TV movie. I can't believe it took three people to write this movie. I'm not familiar with the novel on which this movie is based, but it should be better than that. I'd rather watch a "Full House" marathon than this silly movie. I only gave it 2 out of 10 stars because it was made better by advertising.
