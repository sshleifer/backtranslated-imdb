This movie should have been much better than it was. Christopher Eccleston is an excellent actor, but even he cannot save this story of a young woman seeking the truth about her sister's death. Spoiler Warning: In fact, the truth is that the older sister (played by Diaz) is just a spoiled, selfish and shallow girl who used too many drugs. Not much of a twist and not that interesting. The movie is also overloaded with far too much flashback and voice loss and has dramatic pacing. All in all, it's definitely worth the trouble - not recommended.
