The story of "The Stranger" reflects somewhat the 1969 film "Travel to the Far Side of the Sun" (made by Gerry & Sylvia Anderson of Thunderbirds and Space: 1999). A parallel-universe earth is the premise of both films. But there is a difference. Where the world in "The Stranger" has a totalitarian regime to express the freedom of citizenship, "Travel to the Far Side of the Sun" has just shown a true mirror world where handwriting, roads, homes, machinery of all types and of course internal organs were all in reverse order (or reflected). So, the similarity of parallel Earth is the only connection of both films. <br /> <br /> Similarly, the television series "Land of the Giants" came before both of these films, which ran between 1968 and 1970. a world that was almost parallel to the earth, except that the planet was populated by giants 12 times the size of the people who collided there. The idea of ​​a totalitarian government to capture and contain the 'little people' was more like the representation of 'The Stranger' as the premise of 'JTTFSOTS'. Perhaps because of the similar "LOTG", a series has been moved to "The Stranger". If it became a TV series, it would have been a sci-fi version of "The Fugitive", with star Glenn Corbett hiding by the bad people week after week, hiding in different places, etc. BTW, a stronger script could have helped this movie.
