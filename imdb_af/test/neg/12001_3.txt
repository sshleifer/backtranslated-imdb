Of all the children's movies I've seen over the years, it was probably the worst. I took four children between the ages of 7 and 11 and nobody liked it. <br /> <br /> The writing was based on a Willy Wonka style story, but it didn't matter. <Br /> <br /> Considering that this movie doesn't waste your time, it's bad. <br /> <br /> They make a sequel, so it might be worth checking to see if they can get even worse. movie, but I don't think it's possible.
