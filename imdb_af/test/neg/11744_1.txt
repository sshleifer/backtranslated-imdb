Not just why? But "What did they think?" It had to be a kind of repayment to Gus Van Sant, because it is one of those strange films <br /> <br /> that should never be made again. It seems to be Hitchcock's movie <br /> <br /> frame for frame but without the magic or the tension or the big movie <br /> <br />. Rent the original instead, save yourself.
