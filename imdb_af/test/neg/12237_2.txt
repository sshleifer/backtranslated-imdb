Sometimes things just don't have to be made. And while the setup looked good enough, it's just to make the audience fear. But the problem is, it's not another Saw movie. It's just as bad that you wish you were punished by Jason Voorhees. <br /> <br /> I lost track of the number of sports movies and spoofs it included in the movie. And in general, it sank into its efforts. Sure to tell his team, they should miss every subject to be real players, was initially funny, but it got tired of watching. It and the joke about "Radio" and "IPod". <br /> Overall, I can't stand watching this movie again. Even Trantasia is worth more than that. "D"
