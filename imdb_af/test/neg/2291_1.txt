Actually, I feel that my review is one word. My friend, whose opinions I almost always trust about movies, especially horror movies, warned me NOT to rent it, no matter how seduced or bored or desperate to see a new horror movie, because it was " a total waste of time. Unfortunately I didn't talk to him for a while, and I was in a hurry to choose a movie, and thought, "How totally, how bad can it be?" WHY DON'T LEARN? What did I think? Did I think it would be a better movie for magicians, while sitting there waiting for years to be hired? <br /> <br /> The 'plot' is about a guy who changes movies for a company. His boss is a while. The man who had the job in front of him became insane and inflated him in the pre-credit series. One thing is, for some reason, "Ed" for the special "Los Limbs" platformer editing project. He never says what Ed is supposed to change, but I don't think it matters. Ed is upset about some of the outbreaks and is gathering on this house. The boss decided to move him for no apparent reason. He asks his boss if he can stop or do another project, but his boss doesn't mind. He began to look insane, presumably looking at the cuts, and wanted to do the greedy murders in real life. Or was he so long? Please note that I make this plot much more deep, interesting and coherent than it actually is. <br /> <br /> We don't care about the characters, or have any sympathy for them or even hate the bad guys. The plot is really boring and predictable. The plower is not even horrible or creative. It is not worth to just rent to see the gore, because what is there is not interesting or original. <br /> <br /> All the tribute to Sam Raimi just comes out like really bad ripoffs, and no one in the movie is anywhere near, good enough like Bruce Campbell, so you can't distract yourself. I think an "Evil Dead II-Dead by Dawn" poster is only prominently displayed in one scene in the hope that Sam Raimi will be flattered and not considering any kind of legal action. A trained chimpanzee could have written a better script. Every time I hear lines like: "Do we still have fun?" (which even the Re-Animator Bride could not pull without making me shake). I started to feel like picking up a deadly weapon myself. Characters appear only nowhere without any explanation, but to kill. It might be good if the movie was almost amusing or entertaining, but it was all I could do to stay ahead of most of the fast. Fortunately, I chose to pay a few bills and balance my checkbook while the movie was playing. Trust me, it doesn't need my full attention. I still felt that 90 + minutes of my life was wasted just by having it in the background. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it, no matter how tempted you are - you hate to waste your money. Horror fans will be completely amazed by how incompetent it is. Even those who have not seen too many films, should stay away, because there are so many movies out there that you can rent much more. If you want something brainless, low budget and fun, rent something else. Complete waste of time without any redeeming features at all. Be smarter than I was at the time and don't be fooled by the "Warning-Not For the Faint of Heart" box. You have been warned! <br /> <br />
