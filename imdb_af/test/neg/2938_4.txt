But it should be said that perhaps more in America than saying, here in the UK, can still be a pleasant subject. Just look at the whole gay debacle in the US military a few years ago. It is with 'In and Out' that writer Paul Rudnick taps into the small town's mentality of middle America and the way the press in the US (as well as in the UK) makes such a big deal to well-known person. You just have to look when Will Young and Stephen Gately van Boyzone come out of the closet. <br /> <br /> The movie is on Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline), an English high school teacher in his hometown. The locals are preparing themselves for Oscar evening, as one of Cameron Drake's nominees (Matt Dillon) came from their town and was a former student of Howards. Cameron, who plays a gay soldier in a Vietnam epic play, wins the award only to Howard as gay during his acceptance speech. It can't be a worse time for Howard to spend his day getting married to his fiancee and fellow teacher Emily. (Joan Cusack). If you'd expect the media response to be cataclysmic and turning Howard's life upside down. Not only does he try to convince his family and friends that he is not gay, but avoids the clever news agent, Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck). <br /> <br /> Although charged as a screw ball comedy, it is clear that Rudnick and director Frank Oz are also trying to be satirical. You just have to look at the early scenes at the Oscar ceremony and the way in which the people of Bracketts hometown as well as the school's board of education respond to his outing. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film does not meet the promise we see early in the movie. It's a nice effort to make social comments from a crazy comedy. A good throw is wasted sadly on a screenplay that never laughs at the niche expert and is not as close as insightful as it thinks. <br /> <br /> Kline gives us the same impressive performance he gave us in his earlier comedy. Dave, who makes Howard an instant enjoyable character. Cusack is also a good value to Howard's weight-controlled fiance while Tom Selleck is playing well against the game as a gay news reporter. Bob Newhart is also a joy to head high school where Howard works. It's great to see him on the big. screen for a change. It is a pity that this should be so. <br /> <br /> The performances as good as they can do little to save the movie from a fairly dull relationship. While some scenes do offer some entertainment. Just the inspired scene Howard tries to make himself look more masculine by listening to a self-help band. There is little to enjoy, and when things don't look like bad Rudnick resorts to a sickening finale come across the top sentiment. I can't help but feel my intelligence insulted. Malloy seems to be a character to become the man who puts his ethics before getting a good story while Cammeron finally comes to the rescue in the film's climax. Being a self has had a character to care for what happened to his previous teacher. After all, it was he who caused all the trouble in the first place. <br /> <br /> "In and Out" is not exactly, but if you think that Clines work better like a fish called Wanda, you can't help but feel a great talent here is sad. <br /> <br /> Robs Rating: * *
