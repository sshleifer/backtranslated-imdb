First, this movie leaves you in a limbo mood. You don't know what to feel. So much so that you don't feel bad about Caines character if his son is murdered (which was mostly due to poor editing). The writing was too vague. None of the situations are important when you see them. The soundtrack, or lack thereof (if it wasn't good enough to remember) doesn't help it once. Only good surprise for this movie was Andy Serkis's performance. It was at stake if it wasn't better than Caine. The story would probably have been better if Serkis had killed him. Because you honestly say, you don't feel a kind of salvation in the climax. Just a feeling of lack of feeling, if you feel me. Basically, this movie is largely missing out on drawings. Let the audience alienate the whole thing.
