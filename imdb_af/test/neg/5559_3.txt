It's a parody. This means there are no characters, they are all common stereotypes, and the movie is totally dependent on the quality of the jokes. <br /> <br /> Well, there are pretty good jokes in this movie. Unfortunately, they are hidden in a mass of real domes. If one expects all the dialogues to be absurd, the fun goes off. <br /> <br /> You see, there is American Pie 2, my favorite teen movie. It contains many real original characters. Perhaps the jokes are tasteless, but all the people have some kind of life. For example, they feel ashamed when something is given. That's what makes the jokes really funny! <br /> <br /> Not so this movie: every scene is clearly arranged as a pure parody, so there are no characters at all, so there is really no room for any sympathy. Also, if you know the original movies, you know in advance whole numbers. Add the fact that many jokes aren't funny and you have this movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saved me from getting bored completely, where the comments of some teenagers in the theater where I was watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and my personal highlight of the movie was the very short appearance of Melissa Joan Hart in one scene. Sigh. She's just too cool, she can't actually be. Hmm, a whole movie worth it?
