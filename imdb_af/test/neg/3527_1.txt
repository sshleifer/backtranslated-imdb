"Nuts in May" can be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. If Ed Wood was still alive, it would be the type of movie he would do. To say this movie is bad would be the understatement of the century. But how bad is it really? Well, here are two levels of bad I go through; "it's so bad it's good" or "it's so bad it's GOOD HOLIDAY". This film falls in the last part. Whatever little unintentional humor it has, does not matter for the slow, difficult to understand, boring majority of the movie. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY: SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Two middle-aged Anglos travel to the countryside for some R&R and camps, where they will soon meet Ray (I'll be later explain), whose tent is next to our main couple. During most of the movie, the two leaders are on the beach, at a stone groove and other exciting coastal spots. Between these adventures they talk endlessly about the environment, vegetarianism, fossil collection, the duty of a proper citizen and good diet, everything I want to see in a comedy. They carry everyone who listens to them. The dialogue is not only bad, but the pace of some scenes is so slow that I sometimes feel like being immersed. Screens go on forever and just as it starts to build up and something happens, the scene ends. Halfway through the movie I thought to myself, "Nothing is going to happen in this thing, it's really a movie about nothing." <br /> <br /> The characters are annoying and constantly repeating. In one part I felt that the director played a cruel joke on his audience. The scene I'm referring to is the "Sing Along" scene. In it we play two wonderful British music for us, actually it was the same 4 four lines over and over and over and over. The idea was to get Ray to sing with them, but Ray, as well as us, knew they were the worst songwriters. This scene was over, with the fifth time the song played, I started with the appearance of a gracious God. <br /> <br /> Words cannot describe the horror of this movie. The first thing that strikes you is the unambiguous British accent that most of the role players have. Remember the thick Scottish accent in Trainspotting? Draw it at 10. <br /> <br /> By the end, our tree knot, incoherent, couple in battle with some of Ray's friends who are completely disrespectful of the camp rules. Our hero is so upset that there is a climate battle between our hero and the main hellraiser. To settle their dispute, the two men enter into a fight. It's right to make a stick fight! Now that's where the unintentional humor begins. I laughed so hard at the ungratefulness of everything I thought, "It can make up for the other 80 minutes." After this hysterical battle, our hero walks behind some bushes to shout his eyes and the other man calls Ray by calling him for unknown reasons. <br /> <br /> A stick battle, a crying nature that is 40 years old. And a character name changes 3/4 in the movie, Ed Wood will be proud. <br /> <br /> Although I was forced to endure the last 10 minutes, ending with a long take of a pig. Why? who knows hell? At one moment we see a pig pasture and the next rolls over the credits. One of the worst ends is one of the worst movies of all time.
