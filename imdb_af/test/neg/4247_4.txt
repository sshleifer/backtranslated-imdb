Everyone I know loves this movie, but I'm afraid I won't. I hated this movie so much that I had to turn off the middle film because of the repulsion. Too much time is spent on crying and emotional lamination. The point of the Bullock character destroyed by her divorce is excessive in the viewer's head. That's enough !! And why didn't we hear from her ex-husband anymore? He is portrayed as nothing but a suit that comes once in a while. Something made her marry him, what was that? What is it that makes her so devastated about their divorce? More time could be spent on it, rather than another Bullock shot that crumbled on the bedroom floor. The dialogue is stilted, cliched and terrible, much like one of those curly "ABC After School Specials" or something. There is no imagination or creativity about anything in this movie, it is all very predictable and therefore boring. This movie is also in the overarching factor, very stupid and not funny as it was supposed to be! It's just another of those terribly damn "I am woman, hear my roar" movies, much like "Waiting to Get Out". If you want to see "I'm a woman, hear my roar" movies that are really entertaining, original and well done, then see "Gas Food Accommodation" or "Ruby in Paradise". Skip this crap! I give "Hope Floats" 3/10.
