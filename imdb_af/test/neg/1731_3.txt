My summary refers to the fact that this movie has 1479 votes - just 21 short to be eligible to be on IMDb's infamous Bottom 100 list - the 100 lowest rated movies on the site. With a poor score of just 1.8, it will put the movie on the list at about # 38 and 46 - talk about a very questionable achievement !! My score of 3 is not that bad - but it brings the movie so much closer to the dreaded list. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, it dies the one-sided Aaron Carter - another pre-packaged and forgettable pop star of the 1990s. When he first broke into the scene, he was a cute kid with some songs calling on pre-teens and tweeners on Radio Disney. His songs, watch and image are all meticulously cared for and created by people marketing and doing the trick - leading to some great album sales. Unfortunately, sales in 2005 were unfortunate and Carter hit his awkward stage of life - something that ALL children should eventually handle his age. To put it unclear, he is no longer cute in this movie and is at a very difficult stage in life. I suppose he is now a beautiful young man ... but in Popstar he is no longer the heartbreaking one. Here he is just very normal ... a death sentence for a child in his position as a "pop sensation". <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the movie has a few appearances from some other ex-teenage drops. From the past few decades - including a role for David Cassidy and Leif Garrett - two guys who also know how to get rid of the spotlight. Cassidy succeeded in picking up the pieces and making a niche for himself, while Garrett is a good example of a pop star whose life after stars is a bit of a joke. Hopefully Carter will go to Cassidy in the future and so far, fortunately, he has managed to prevent the negative publicity and court performance of many ancient idols. I was far from the movie excited, but wanted the best in this section. It is not his fault that he was plastered over the radio and television during the early and mid-1990s. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Carter doesn't really have to stretch himself - he plays a pop star. Despite making millions and being worshiped by girls, he doesn't have "everything". He is pretty dense - mostly because he has little interest in learning. The problem is so bad that his mother decides not to go to school anymore - to force him to go to public school. The problem, however, is that it's rather phobias to take tests ... and making the degree at school is difficult. So he got the idea of ​​finding a smart girl to date - one that would obviously be obliged to help him at school. He picks up the cute but book-like Jane (Alana Austin) and suggests she really likes her in a sad effort to make this scheme work. <br /> <br /> This plot is still not bad and can even work even though it looks like an episode of a show like "The Brady Bunch" or a Nickelodeon sit-com. Certainly, it is predictable and you KNOW that the formula will eventually teach and injure its plot. He will eventually realize that he really cares for her. AND at the end of the movie everyone will be forgiven and they will be a real couple. But, with good acting and capable direction, it can be worthwhile for his teenage fans, as predictable is not always bad. And as it turns out, it's NOT exactly where the plot went ... but it was terribly close. <br /> <br /> There are some good things I liked about the movie. As Tom Bosley and Stella Stevens play Jane's grandparents, it was very nice - their role was pretty sweet and it was good to see them again. Also in the 1970s for the television filmmaker Andrew Stevens appeared in the film - it was nice to see him again - although part of me hated him, as he looks so good after all these years and I have always looked at me 45 year! He did a good job and it was nice to see him in the same movie as his mother (Stella). <br /> <br /> As with Carter, with his many past experiences on TV, he wasn't surprisingly beautiful. While his relationship with Jane was not very credible, he and Mrs. Austin did it their best. The movie was not good, but they tried and I think most of the problems with the film were in the writing. With a better and less formal plot, it could have worked much better. Plus, the whole "testophobia" angle was reasonably confronted ... and rather insignificant. Who cares if a mega-millionaire becomes anxious to take tests at school? Overall, not a rotten movie as the current rating would imply, although there is not much to attract a wide audience here. People who grew up in Carter will probably enjoy the movie. Older people are likely to care less, as well as really young people who are unlikely to have heard of him. For them there is no nostalgia in the film. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie ... Leif Garrett advises Aaron. I felt like screaming: "Don't listen!" but didn't!
