This movie must be arranged with "Welcome to the Jungle" and "The Hitcher" and "Dream Catcher" for pure wickedness. You have the most annoying heroine in Gore history, spending most of her time crying and screaming. All the time in the most horrible resting place, toilet ever comes to the movie. Why she spends so much time in this terrible hell-filled bathroom is never explained. Even when the ordinary killer tries to kill her driver, she refuses to leave the crapper. When a motorcycle policeman comes to her rescue, the killer walks the truck driver over the police's legs while the heroine just looks. Instead of protecting his gun for protection, she dragged the poor sledge into the crapper and shut the door. Then the police ordered her to blow his brain out because of the pain. She does it - as he cries and sighs and groans - and blows off the back of his head. Then - the police, still alive, ordered her to shoot him again, because he's still in pain. He says it while the entire back of his head is across the floor. The creeping, screaming heroine shoots him again. The movie continues and so on, nothing makes sense. The heroine is so misleading that you would like the killer, she must be timely. I saw this movie on the Sci-Fi channel, so it didn't cost me anything to watch, but I still watched, from the fascination of how a movie can go so badly.
