Julien Hernandez is definitely an attractive and fun on-screen persona. In fact, his character carries much of this whole movie, or is worth it. The problem is, with the exception of his gal pal (played by Marisa Petroro) and Paul Lekakis (as a trick / date / boyfriend for some characters), no one else comes. Hernandez plays a 30-something director of Cuban heritage, and unknown sexuality, directed to L.A. come and get a job to make a gay documentary. In the process of meeting a group of gay people while they find subjects, he comes out ... but many s l o w l y. Of course, even at 88 minutes, the film is stretched and filled with various movie school devices, most of which just ignore the story (which is not much to start with) or the overall amateurity of the film. <br /> <br /> What's a shame because there's somewhere a love story here and the last three minutes, when Hernandez's Sebastien finally beats with a rich West Hollywood party throw (nicely underlined by Lonnie Henderson ) and they share some sexy psychologist kisses, it works in spite of everything that has come before. But we don't really care about any of the other characters or their situations: Why would attractive Dante have a Eurotrash prize for a boyfriend? He didn't want to. And don't even let me start Sebastien's friend Paulie's "rules" for dating - no gay man I know, hell no healthy person, period, such restrictions on himself or others. And please tell me how Sebastien gets a peeled banana (which is usually pretty shmushy, right?) Does his butt up and go to a doctor to remove it? <br /> <br /> I noticed that Hernandez won a film for this movie as a "short" - it probably had to stay that way. All this said - I look forward to seeing Hernandez again on the screen, in a better written comedy with more certainty.
