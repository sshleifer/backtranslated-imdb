It's been around for over 30 years, but I still remember that this movie was the worst I've ever seen. I would have thought there would be something worse filmed at this time, but I was wrong. I just finished watching "STARSHIP TROOPERS" and it came very close, but it was even more entertaining than "GREAT COW".
