We arrived at the theater too late, and that was our intention, and 'The Comebacks' was the only movie that didn't start yet. I had an impression of how bad a movie was after reading the short blurb at the ticket bank. The theater was empty when we arrived and only two other people entered before the movie started. <br /> <br /> The authors and directors throw every imaginable sportswoman at the audience without creating a single laugh, not one during the whole movie. . Think of all the football movies made and the millions of dollar schools and supporters spend every year on football and you realize how ripe it is to be parodied or lampooned. If you add Texas to the mix, you should get the sport version of 'Little Miss Sunshine', not a big chase. <br /> <br /> The first movie to be released when we left the theater was "Cannot stop the music". In comparison, it couldn't "stop the music," without Bruce Jenner, Valerie Perrine, or the Village People. <br /> <br /> If the movie had a single letter of mercy, Matthew Lawrence grew up.
