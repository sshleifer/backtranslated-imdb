Just above the box I now type in, I had to select a number between 1 and 10 and rate this feature movie. Unfortunately, there is no option for a number less than zero, and I have to post something. If I had my choice, I would not sit down, because there are no figures expressing the worthlessness of this movie. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch this movie even after reading all this horrible reading. reviews, make sure there are no sharp or blunt objects in the area. This will help you kill yourself in the middle of the movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know how this movie was released. For the public, it must be locked up in Fort Knox 24 hours a day. I'm angry that this movie was even available to me to watch. I feel deceived by humanity, I have no idea people can be cruel. Stalin, Saddam and Hitler didn't get anything on Cowell's poll. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the film's cover. 1) There are no scarecrows, no one knows why there is a legitimate scarecrow in front. 2) None of the characters on the back of the case are even in the smelly movie! 3) The tagline says something about "new moon, more victims", there were no victims of kidnapping, no one even died. We don't know if the policeman was dead, and I suppose the killer didn't kill because it sounded like he was hit with a flabby bat. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie, it has wasted about 4 hours of my life. It's four, it took me an hour to see it (I quickly go through the 4-minute zoom scenes that don't reveal anything in the plot). I watched television for about an hour and considered my life and the direction it was going to look, and then I started crying the next two hours because I know someone out there will unfortunately see this movie and there is nothing what I can do to stop it.
