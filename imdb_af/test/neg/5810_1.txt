It is difficult to know exactly what to say about this ever so dim and dim movie. The story is predictable when it is not completely laughable. It's all about "conscientious gestures" that, as presented here, carry absolutely no conviction. Yes, the MGM "production values" are beautiful, and yes, ma'am. Lamarr was beautifully beautiful, but she and the great Spencer Tracy have absolutely no chemistry together - and that is the only thing this parade of cliches would have done with everything effective ... It's my understanding that this movie has received poor reviews when it was originally released; over time it didn't improve.
