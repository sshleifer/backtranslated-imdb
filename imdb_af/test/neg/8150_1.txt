This movie has one or two slightly interesting gags, but they are NOT worth the wait. After an inexplicable argument between two guys picking up rubbish in a movie theater, we cut to a family that was leaving! Hollywood and driving drive their camper from the screen over and over as a fixed dialogue. At least I think it is null and void, the terrible song that accompanies this montage is mixed so hard that it is sometimes almost inaudible. <br /> <br /> Eventually the camper arrives at a petrol station where the family comes out, another spoken conversation, before driving it off. The camera then breaks to reveal the actor we have just seen. He talked straight to the camera and we realized he was the director of the movie we were watching over him and how he came to make the movie. <br /> <br /> A good idea that ALMOST (but not quite) makes the previous rows worthwhile. <br /> <br /> As the movie unfolds, he meets the two characters we met at the beginning of the movie, and they all form a movie company. <br /> <br /> All forms of not very funny and clumsy comedy occur when compiling a crew and trying to raise the necessary cash to film. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie is made up of a string and a promise. and there is a nice idea to get out here, but the performance is so inappropriate that the idea is lost. Comedy is more than just overcrowding and everyone is talking (or screaming) right away. Much of the dialogue is being shouted simultaneously by several actors - Robert Altman can do this kind of thing well because he has a script, rehearsals, decent sound technologies and editing facilities. Anyone shouting at the one mike hidden from its sound in a rubbish bin in the next room doesn't make it clear.
