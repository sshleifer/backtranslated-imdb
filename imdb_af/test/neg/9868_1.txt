Without a doubt, it is the WORSE comicbook movie each made. PERIOD !! Yes, this is worse than Dolph Lundgren (1989) Punisher. Yup .. worse than the 1979 and 1991 Captain America films. Oh yes, it's even WORSE then Christopher Reed wrote Superman IV: Quest for Peace movie. Sheeshh .. that movie was so bad that the guy who played Kernman just played in one other movie and it was just on T.V. = OP <br /> <br /> This movie is D-quality. I had the chance to see it on the sci-fi channel in 1997. I heard it was pretty bad, but I had nothing else to do that night, so I thought I was going out. What a waste of an hour and a half. I'd have been better off looking at the recipes of different strips. Besides having the most special effects and worse acting I've ever seen, the whole scripture was just awful and not well-aimed. Fortunately, a new Fantastic Four movie is being made and hopefully this version will do the hero justice. I hoped for a new SPAIN movie in the future, but it still has to be realized. <br /> <br /> Don't rent this movie. If you see that it is television on the cable, check it out. Be warned though, you will be the most turning the channel after the first 15 minutes.
