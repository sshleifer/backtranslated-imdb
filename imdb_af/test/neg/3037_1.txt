Unlike most reviewers here, I hated this movie simply because the author / director's bloated ego was in the way of an otherwise interesting subject. Too many movie lovers look like 'EXTREME self-indulgence' after 'movie GENIUS!' But I don't buy that cult of personality. A movie should be about its subject, not its director (unless it's a Woody Allen movie, of course). * SPOILER * (which is just as good, saves you time ...) There's nothing brilliant about showing you the footsteps of pornstar, you know what's in the last frame - it actually called a tough maneuver that SCREAMS movie school hackism. <br /> <br /> Did the film-making movie achieve good film status based on its leniency and pandering to the audience? which is primarily the author / director. But the rest of the audience should also look at the bad, brutal nature of the porn biz. The movie had a deviant angle for the porn industry, and looked down at every player who could bash it. No matter, just love your writer / director. Keep track of the four-minute steadicam segments, which are supposed to show the energy of the moment, but somehow have all the fading of a switch. Love the story, no matter how boring it is. But of course look at it too. While the subject has the potential to be fascinating ?? innocence, money, degradation, beauty - your worshiping writer / director has somehow managed to make it look, again, DULL. Partly due to his running time. Here's something your author hero didn't try: give the character dimension. Or soul. Anything just to cause, apart from Genius that Paul is natural. But I do not buy. I don't buy indulgent hacks with amazing hype. <br /> <br /> Another faint-haired author hack, with fifty times more hype than quality. I know some of you agree. The rest will probably see this indulgent flick again. Not my problem.
