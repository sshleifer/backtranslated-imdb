Clifton Webb is one of my favorites. However, Mister Scoutmaster is not one of his best. His patented curmudgeon roll looks forced and even unpleasant rather than funny. The film itself is flooded with mahkish sentimentality. In addition, the viewer is presented with numerous ham-handed references to religious beliefs and US patriotism that come as exaggerated rather than sincere. Clifton Webb does his best with a poor writing. Edmund Gwenn plays another cheerful minister and is not given anything to do. The leader of the children's actor is played by a talented child who has a flat influence on the entire film. His only claim to be known as an artist is apparently a bullfrog-like low voice that is unusual for someone of his age. But once you've heard it, you've heard it and you don't have to hear it again. Unfortunately, he is in most of the movies. I find this child so annoying that I quickly get ahead when he arrives. As he has many scenes in this movie, it means I move a lot through the movie. There were and are so many talented children's actors; It is a pity that this movie does not contain any of them. Still, Clifton Webb in the traditional broad-ball hat and shorts is a busy sight.
