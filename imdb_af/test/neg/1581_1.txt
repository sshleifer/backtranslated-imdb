Wings Hauser and son, Cole Hauser, are filming a neo-Nazi thieves filming a gay man and terrorizing a city. Wings play the hero, and his real son is the villain. Fairly low budget movie that doesn't have many redeeming features, and for some reason no one has seen it! Maybe because it's a laughing and ridiculous movie, and the studio realized it! Perhaps Wings Hauser himself prevented the spread of 'Skins' after seeing it himself! Maybe people just didn't want to comment on such a bad movie! Oh yes! I mostly like Wings and Cole as actors, but it was a movie they both had to skip. Wings directed, written and was the main actor in 'Skins'! An extremely bad and silly movie! 1/2 out of *****!
