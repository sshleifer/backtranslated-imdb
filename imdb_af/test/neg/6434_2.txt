Now the television schedules (in England, at least) are full of home improvement, bargain hunting, home hunting and cooking in the afternoons, the chances of any terrestrial broadcasters digging out a complete darkness, such as having a few hours of screen time on a Slow afternoon is slim, to say the least. But in the eighties, the BBC did just that and guessed what I was watching. And this is proof of the overwhelming strangeness of this Hungarian-American co-production, that I can still remember large pieces of it twenty years later. To begin with, the eponymous hero appears briefly during the opening titles, only to disappear at least half an hour. (Imagine a US TAIL being revised again, so Feivel is nowhere to be seen, and you will appreciate how confusing it is.) There is a bizarre little animation where one of the characters cut his elaborate mustache mustache and stretched, completed with a fascinating sound effect that causes him to head over. Probably hilarious if you are stoned, but after a child, quite disturbing. To speak of which the notorious "hippo" image is presented in an abstract way - clouds in vague hippo shapes are struck by lightning - but this is quite unpleasant. In fact, this movie is pretty cold and unfinished, a sad state of affairs, barely helped by the strange production design, all muddy colors, wobbly lines, bloated shapes and the unique European darkness reminiscent of Jan Svankmajer, but not just as compelling. . Then, to cut it all, we get songs at the Osmonds! It is not so much a horrible movie as a deeply deceived one, and not as much fantasy magic as a bad journey.
