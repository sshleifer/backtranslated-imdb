I can't believe I bought this movie! It sucks! ... Where I Live Mexican Movies Mexican movies are never advertised, or even available ... you can't get them in regular rentals ... so I had to buy it ... I love Mexican movies! They bring me closer to my roots and my people, and they are different from what you usually used ... but this one was so predictable !!! You can guess what's going to happen ... I'm not a terrible movie! It just wasn't worth the money I paid for it! yeah ... but if you have time and are really bored then you should see it. But if you love Mexican movies and love the theater itself, don't watch it, it'll be painful! lol
