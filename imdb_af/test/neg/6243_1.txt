I hate it when people play in the movie on the screen. This is one of the main reasons why I like DVDs or videos. I saw The Clearing on DVD, but if I saw it in the movies, I had to get up and SCREAM "HE IS NOT DEATH, YOUR MORON!" <br /> <br /> The Clearing is another long list of horrible movies owned by MrRedford. Legal Eagles, Havana, Indecent Proposal, On Close and Personal, Sneakers, Last Castle, and Spy Game. If Robert Redford told me to invest in something, I'm going the other way. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing you can do about an audience is that. Say you're kidnapped and your kidnapper has a gun. He likes it for most of the movie. You turn the tables on him and start strangling him. Whatever you do, stick to it until it's dead! Don't just strangle him for ten seconds. Stay with it! At least ten minutes. But Bob stops too soon, walks away and forgets about Mr. Kidnapper until ....... He gets up, finds the gun and keeps it on our hero again. At this point I wanted to Kidnapper Robert Redford shoots. More than a few times. And I wanted to shoot him too.
