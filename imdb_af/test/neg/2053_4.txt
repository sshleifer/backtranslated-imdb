I just watched this movie just because Sarah and I also give these 4 stars just because of her, on the other hand. This movie was easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Theater was terrible. The writing was oninspired. It was a movie that contradicted itself. The film was sloppy and inexorable. It's not like I expected a good movie. Just something to give me a jump or two. It didn't even do that. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is, the more I think about the overall plot, the less sense it actually makes and the more holes we find. I'm really sorry, because I'm pretty sure there is a good idea somewhere to be there ... <br /> <br /> I might be a little hard giving the movie a 4/10, But the actors involved and again SARA obviously write talent, this film had to deliver much more.
