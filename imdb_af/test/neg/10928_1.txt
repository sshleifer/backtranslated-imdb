People involved in this movie seem to be filling the poll to improve its ratings. The good news that apparently only 18 people saw it. I suppose it makes me the 19th. I have no involvement with the movie and know no one who has done and I am a long-term IMDb user (see my voice record and reviews over the past seven years), so I promise to give honest and impartial opinion. It comes to you from a 30-year-old horror fan who also appeared in a few low-budget movies. <br /> <br /> Apart from some interesting video effects, Frankenstein's Bloody Nightmare is incoherent, boring and technically flawed for all reasons. It was apparently shot on still life and the sound entered; Most of it sounds like it has been recorded with a can and a piece of string. More than three quarters of the dialogue is inaudible. <br /> <br /> I watched it from start to finish and have no idea what the story was or even if there was one. It seems as if the director is mostly impressed by long, shimmering shots from the corners of the table and dead black spaces that do not protrude beyond the film. It would be a problem if one actually developed a plot and made a movie that had a little sense of pacing. In this case, however, the rule does not apply. No matter how screens are shot, they don't make a story. <br /> <br /> Watching this video is an exercise in futility at every level. Whatever the people who worked on it were writing and trying to influence the ratings on IMDb. It's just bad, boring stuff. <br /> <br /> This is the honest truth. If you think about spending your money or time on this, think again. It's easier to find something better because you won't find much worse. <br /> <br /> And that's the unbiased, indecent truth.
