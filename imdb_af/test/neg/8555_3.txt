Get the CD instead. The show is tame, and the editing sucks. The crowd gets far too much screen time, as does Lindemann. The cameras spend more time on the same child moving his head the same way. This leads me to believe that this is exactly the same shot as Richard Kruspe's solo in Weisses Fleisch. The screens change so fast, it is impossible to know where the camera is, and the replays are simply superfluous. Not worth the band on which it was recorded.
