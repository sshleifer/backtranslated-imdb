This one and the one previously "Toulon's Revenge" and the next one looks quite different from the first two movies where the dolls were not so nice. It's basically your series, the first two go together and paint the dolls as killers, while the next three are a series of them the good guys. This one plays too much like a cute television series episode to be as good as part three and I never really had the urge to try to share five of the series. Basically, a kid gets the dolls while a strange dark gentleman or something sends out his evil dolls to kill. This dark gentleman looks like some enemy of one of those lively Japanese performances like Ultraman. The movie is over before you know it, but it must get credit not to give you a painful attempt to watch film. Just for many plot holes and things in it, because it is considered a good movie. You get the man who played Toulon in the last movie, but then you have a lot of anti-clash and the movie is over before it really starts.
