Jack Lemmon was one of the best actors who ever blessed the screen. He could effortlessly switch from dramatic roles to comedic, making most of his counterparts with envy green. While his performance in "Save The Tiger" is worthy of Oscar, I feel it has been given to him because he missed his other opportunities to win the award because of other, better roles that this present preceded. <Br /> <br /> It is also one of those pretentious movies that come out to basically display the talent of the cast, or in this case, one particular member. It's too bad that the author's output doesn't match Lemmon's. Don't waste your time with this one.
