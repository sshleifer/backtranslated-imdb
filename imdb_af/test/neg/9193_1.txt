Wow - Thanks, I was on a plane and could look out of the window. Bad Hollywood fires, predictably, acted terribly (who was the dreadful woman the woman played?), Heavily cast, terribly written. This movie is apparently used to appeal to the kind of person who is willing to kneel at the altar or firemen specifically, "Heroes" or gods in general, I think. I don't have enough bad things to say about this movie. It couldn't be cheap, with all the stars in it, plus all the special effects and firings. Must have cost a fortune, but it still sucks better than any movie I can even remember to watch. Funeral scene? Surprisingly bad. Hofhof between firefighter and aforementioned terrible woman? Corny, confronted, trite. Firehouse Pranks? Don't we all wish we could be so masculine and churlish at the same time.
