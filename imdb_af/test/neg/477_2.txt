My brain shouted, "Why are you holding on? Switch it off and go to sleep!" But a libel has won and I looked at the predictable end. I think when it is Bruce Campbell, I have to give it a chance. <br /> <br /> I find it difficult to complain about a low budget film purely due to the low budget. We see time and again a low budget movie that proves that a good story, good writing and good acting is enough to make a good movie. Ted and Bruce first started on such a movie, but they didn't feel like Sam, it took a little more than hitting it on film to make a movie. <br /> <br /> It's also sad. , because Bruce has always been a favorite. After the 70's and 80's, I just can't believe that movies are still being made bad. Bruce, I'm really disappointed.
