I can't honestly believe it's a sequel or follow-up to John Landis's classic 1981 comedy horror movie. I suppose you can't really describe it as an original werewolf effect, as the bare bones of the story steal elements from the one in London: an American tourist visits a well-known European capital. He survives a werewolf attack that kills a colleague. , he starts spelling on a sexual relationship with someone in the medical profession, he becomes a werewolf, he is visited by excuses from his dead, etc. and reading the previous line I just discovered how much the storyline has in common with the original that it looks very similar indeed. The difference lies in how enjoyable and entertaining the Landis movie is. <br /> <br /> With this Paris-based movie there are no scenes that really stand out. There is no naked man waking up in a zoo and wondering how to get home with no money or clothes. There is no bizarre dream sequence of Nazi wolves and there is no spectacular climax. AAWIP is trying to be funny, but is there anything more embarrassing than failed humor? I think of the scene where Andy McDermott has to convince someone that he has gum in his pocket and not condoms! Perhaps the biggest difference between the two movies is that there is no question of this questionable succession. You really feel sorry for the protagonist's fate and dilemma in the London movie, here you just feel Andy is nothing more than a cypher that goes through the literary movements of a screenplay. There are also a large number of plot holes visible. Is It The First Time The Moon Club Carried Out? If not, are there not large numbers of corpses torn with their hearts, have been reported in the world's press? Why did the police not lead? <br /> <br /> Everyone else mentioned it, and so I - The footage is poor. Look at the bungee jumping scene at the Eifell Tower, it is painfully clear that it has been achieved through a few blue screen projections, while the werewolf transformation is done by some very cartoony CGI. I'm not going to put Anthony Waller in the same box as Stephen Sommers as a director who totally destroys a movie because of too much confidence in CGI. The big problem with AAWIP is the script along with a high expectation of those who made the 1981 movie classic, but I'd prefer the Rick Baker type special effects used for the transformation. To be honest, it is reasonable to speculate that perhaps the budget did not go so far. But at the end of the day it's a pretty poor horror movie that didn't need it and DOG SOLDIERS are much better entertained.
