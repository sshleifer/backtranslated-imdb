A group of seven people fear that they are the only survivors of a nearby H-bomb explosion. Not only do they fear the radiation but also mutants in the surrounding hill. One of the groups is already infected, but strangely, no other threat to others. Just surviving the friction of different personalities at the near end is the sub-graph. Richard Denning plays the hero. Mike Connors is close to the edge and plays a hard man. Lori Nelson is the girl destined to begin populating a brave new world. Not one of director Roger Corman's best. This is predictable black and white sci-fi.
