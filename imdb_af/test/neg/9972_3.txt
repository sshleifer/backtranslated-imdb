This movie is about a woman who falls in love with a friend of her boyfriend. From then on, she should divide her time for the two boyfriends: Jack during the day and Joseph during the night. <br /> <br /> This movie feels like it's made with a minimum budget. The majority of the film is in a flat with minimal furniture. There are only three major players, all the other actors listed in the credits only make moments. The wardrobe designer doesn't look much to do, as the actors wear a lot of groundwear, and they are mostly naked. <br /> <br /> The movie is a lot of dialogue, which had to make up for the shortcomings described above. However, the dialogues sound too complicated and uncomfortable. In the beginning of the movie, most of the dialogue is a person who says a very long sentence, and then the person says 'I too'. After the madness of conformity, the dialogue falls into a mess of unheard-of and confused word salad. <br /> <br /> The only merit of this movie I can think of is that it serves as a feminist outlet, which means it's not just men who can be unreliable. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great disappointment.
