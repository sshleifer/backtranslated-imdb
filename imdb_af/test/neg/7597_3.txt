Since Roger Corman attached his name to this production, I had great hope for this movie. Corman rectified many memorable low-budget horror bells in the 1960s. I especially enjoyed his adaptations of Poe's stories such as "The House Of Usher" and "The Pit And Pendulum" and "The Raven" which featured late Vincent Price. These films had solid acting, atmosphere, tension, strong characterization, intriguing plot development and some cold moments. Unfortunately, House Of The Damned offers these features in place of the cheesy low budget special effects, free nudity and senseless gore, with quick clicks and camera angles. <br /> <br /> "House of the condemned" starts interesting with a few beautiful location shots in Ireland, but it is straight downhill from here. Unfortunately, instead of spending time creating an atmosphere, creating characters we can care about, or building up tension, the director chooses body figures. After a brief introduction to the main characters, a young couple and their daughter, the audience spends the balance of the movie being tossed from a ghostly event to another, replacing in this role coherent plot development. The main characters are so pregnant and acted so badly - the audience doesn't care what happens to them. To make matters worse, the "spooky" events are either completely cliché or unconvincing because of low technology - low budget special effects. The soundtrack was lifted from `The Omen. "The plot, which is few, borrows heavily from" Poltergeist "and" The Legend Of Hell House, "but has none of the features that made these films convincing. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in seeing haunted house kicks, I recommend watching classic like The Haunting (1963), The Innocents (1961), or watching Corman's early American international movies and "House of Convicted 'pass, unless you are masochistic or stupid. <br /> <br /> 3 ½ out of 10. <br /> <br /> Rob Rheubottom <br /> <br /> Wpg, MB.
