One of the pleasant surprises of this early 3-strip Technicolor brief was that a ballet dancer appeared here called the name Maria Gambarelli! I wondered if Blake Edwards called the character Every Summer played in A Shot in the Dark to this forgotten artist (though the spelling of the Summer character was actually Gambrelli). I especially saw it on YouTube to see an early Judy Garland look, as we saw her in profile with her two older sisters, singing La Cucaracha. This was the highlight for me who had other dances (such as those of Gambarelli) that were nice and a lame comedy between Andy Devine as a big bullfighter (yes right!) And Buster Keaton as a bull owner who apparently a man in the costume is. Only funny part of the two is when they cry - with Buster giving handkerchief to "bull" - during the sad part of "La Cucaracha". Ted Healy also did not see, without his strokes going with an accident, which Healy failed for other movie stars. (Healy himself did not know that Zeppo had left the Marx brothers, as he was "Four" between "The" and "Marx"!) In view of a Marx, it was interesting to see Harpo without his wig , although he wears a hat to hide his bald head. Also interesting was seeing Ida Lupino among the cows in the beginning, although last year I also recognized Toby Wing from her in Murder at the Vanities (at least when announcer Pete Smith identified her). Oh, and Smith himself was not funny with his wise male narration. Other famous stars you may also recognize are also in cameos and not all are M-G-M contract players! So with everything that has been said, La Fiesta de Santa Barbara is worthwhile for someone who is curious about Judy Garland's early film appearances or the early use of 3-strip Technicolor.
