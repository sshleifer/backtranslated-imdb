I could hardly find anything that was a rational human thought in this movie. For some reason, the writer has decided to have a lot of actors in random places, such as Cro-Magnon bipeds grabbing, grooving and screaming. I understand it's about gymnastics, but seriously, what's with all the roaring and human blooms? I also saw at least five actors with overactive terrorist syndrome and stage 10 syphilis. <br /> <br /> Although this movie has real human acrobatics, I have to say it's amazing that you can make such a movie without being understandable. form of human speech patterns. This is truly a milestone in the history of filmmaking because there was no conscious decision to express the characters a little more than a timely Urrrrr! of Rfff! sound. <br /> <br /> Incredible.
