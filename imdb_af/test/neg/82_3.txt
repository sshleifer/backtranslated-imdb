STMD! is not a terrible movie, but it is quite forgetful. The lighting is deliberately poor in many scenes and incessantly poor in the rest, so you will probably come out of sight with headache or eye pain. Special effects are imaginative, but obvious. The free nudity that is essential for teenage fanlights is, of course, with the archetypal teenagers, but the whole movie just doesn't sound like that. What was needed was some snapper dialogue and more humor in the cheek humor. <br /> <br /> I really can't recommend using your time watching this movie. I often give a wink to a movie based on just a scene or two that shows imagination or humor, but unfortunately this is missing in this movie.
