With a title like that, you'll be forgiven for thinking this movie is about the great painter, Goya. Then, after half an hour, you decide it's more about the Roman Catholic Inquisition. With even more latitude, perhaps it's just a snapshot of the period. With vague characterization, too many axes to grind and a scanty bill, Milos Forman makes a colorful but shambolic rattling mish-mash that fails on all three accounts. <br /> <br /> Milos Forman (who has lost his Jewish father to Nazi concentration camps) is the great director who painted the artist Mozart as a buffoon and got away with it. Won awards for it, in fact. In his life in Czechoslovakia, he had a trial of diverse, repulsive regimes, especially Communism. He also made the top of the top, but impressive, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. So, at the age of 74, how does he get us this debris? In Goya's Ghosts, Goya is one step away from the buffoon. The main character is Brother Lorenzo, passionate about Javier Bardem. Natalie Portman is as lively as Goya's model Ines (and later in the film, her own daughter). The determined commitment to Goya is that he paints both of them. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo tortures (and then rapes) Ines which he suspects he is a Jew. Her father tortured Lorenzo. Napoleon is hitting to free Spain (briefly). Ines gets out of the dungeon the church has left her and looks for her child. Goya paints but has become deaf. His main intention seems to be to help Ines. And so on. <br /> <br /> Historically, Goya was also a historian. As Forman left the idea of ​​a biopsy of Goya's painter sad, this one fact could be used to pull the whole movie together? a great piece of history as seen by Goya. But the painter is too tangential to receive any weight. Similarly, should a document of the terror of the Inquisition be done? Compared to other despotic orders throughout, the Holy See is forgiven with hardly any confession. Although one might ask forman enough to be familiar with a factual report of anything. <br /> <br /> "I thought it could be the heart of a wonderful story," he says in the production notes. "There were a large number of parallels between the Communist society in which we lived and the Spanish Inquisition." But the story is too hard to keep our attention. Against our expectations and with a backdrop of something great (the life of a great painter, the abominations of the Inquisition, and even the French Revolution), we are rather asked to engage in a confessed (if any) imagination of Goya's. The result is that we feel cheated. <br /> <br /> Background details are dealt with terribly. Goya became deaf in 1792 (when the film started), not 15 years later. Napoleon is as credible as a cut of a grain package. We see that the Church issued a death sentence (when the normal procedure for the church was to insist that the secular arm did that dirty work). Battles seem to choreograph and stage. A peppermint of rancid naked trees hardly makes it. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the production values ​​are usually good. The colors are alive, the pacing is excellent (at least until we give up to find any valuable storyline.) Bardem is excellent, and Portman is a joy until she goes into overdrive as a crazy woman. While it doesn't say much about Goya, it's nice, even if it is superficial and fairly irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Once I had a drunk conversation where my friends and I asked each other, if you could choose a director to portray your life, who would it be? On his record, Forman would unfortunately have to be at the bottom of my list.
