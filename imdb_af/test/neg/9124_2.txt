Like many people, I loved the original; "American Graffiti" was one of the big movies of the 70's. The sequel, "More American Graffiti", is a terrible, depressing mess of a movie. It wasn't funny, the wide eyes, nice characters became cynical and naked, and the stories were confronted (like Laurie's character with another brother because Richard Dreyfuss didn't do the sequel and Terry the Toad). "Pharaoh Joe" somehow managed to serve in Vietnam). They even have a police officer named "Falfa" (Harrison Ford's character in the original) who makes a "cameo". He doesn't even look like Harrison Ford, which was too big in 1979 to make a star even to bother with this garbage. <br /> <br /> The operative word here is "funny". This movie is not even amusing. Debbie (Candy Clark) is a stripper mixed with a lot of dope haunting hippies and tries to sponsor her merchant boyfriend out of jail. Steve and Laurie (Ron Howard and Cindy Williams), the love birds in the original, have two children and have become an annoying couple. Adorable little tomboy Carol (MacKenzie Phillips) becomes "Rainbow", another hippie child. John Milner (Paul LeMat) is a loser racing driver whose prosperity is at the end of the original forecast. Even Wolfman Jack, whose voice was such an integral part of the original and gave such a great flow, is only heard sporadically. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it was different writers, another director and the complete lack of a coherent story line that made this movie such a dishonest failure. <br /> <br /> The episodic charm and authentic nostalgia of the original is nowhere to be found. It was a movie not to be made and his best was just to remember what a wonderful movie "American Graffiti" was and avoid the movie with "More" in the title.
