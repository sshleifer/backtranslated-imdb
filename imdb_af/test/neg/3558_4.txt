A beautifully evoked 1930s environment offers much interest in a viewer in the early 21st century; Unfortunately, "London belongs to me" has nothing else to recommend, except to be determined by beautiful English charm. All the problems lie with the deeply unfocused story. The main plot relates to the actions of young boy Richard Attenborough, the problems he comes into and how the community in which he joins to save him from society's laws. Or something. The main problem here is that Attenborough's character brings everything to himself and honestly is guilty of almost every accusation brought against him. So it's amazing why the movie (and all the characters) has so much sympathy with him. He is treated as a victim of circumstances when he really is not; And he is not shown to be very upset about his actions, but just to get away with things he didn't mean to do. Alastair Sim gets a lot of screen time in a subplot that has absolutely nothing to do with the main plot and you're wondering what he's doing there (although Sim is, as always, wonderful). You know there is a problem with the structure when the main plot constantly impacts against the subplot, but not vice versa. And after a calm pace and a cautious build-up, the plot fell completely apart in the last 20 minutes with a deeply unsatisfactory and inexplicable conclusion that we didn't even see if Attenborough's character had evolved from previous proceedings. The movie doesn't end, it just stops. <br /> <br /> The acting, direction and general feeling of the movie can all be praised, but unfortunately the story and structure of the pieces is constantly on the move. A final point of trivia: Alec Guinness has shown his performance in the ultra-superior movie "The Ladykillers" based on Alastair Sim's performance in this movie, as well as the characters that have almost identical first scenes.
