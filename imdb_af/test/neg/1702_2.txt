I had a lot of hope for this production, which is one of my favorite works. <br /> <br /> Indeed, many are reasonable: Helen Baxendale is not a bad Lady Macbeth, but has the devil who is the original character infused with. Many of the underage characters are doing well, and the Scottish institutions are great. <br /> <br /> The big disappointment to me is Jason Connery in the title role: he looks like he has his lines of a cue card with the wrong reading glasses - surely for the first time. He can do so much better. Any production compared to sublime Ian McKellen (Macbeth 1979), who in my mind gave the gold standard performance, will struggle to be appreciated, but I actually fell asleep and had to rewind this one before I could get it - scarce a great sign. <br /> <br /> Honestly, one to avoid.
