If it is true that the movie only costs 150K, it explains a lot. But this does not explain why it has no real plot. Halfway through the movie I didn't really care if they made it up or not. I just wanted to finish the movie and go to bed. The end was really stupid and made me wish I'd just closed the movie and left early. There was not much to do with the fact that it was good. If you really enjoy bad movies with terrible lighting (even for a cave) and bad camera work (even for a cave) then you will really like this movie. By the way, if the boy's plane fell in 1980 when he was about 10 years old, how could he have forgotten how to speak and build up so much anger? Wouldn't he want to get help from the first people he saw, even though it was 14 years later?
