I love basketball and it was like an intriguing movie. But in the first ten minutes of the movie I knew it would be nice. It was poorly performed and very slow. In addition, it was very, very racist, sexist, antisemitic and homophobic. Sometimes racist, ethnic and other types of slurry points are used, illustrating the existing crossbeam. In this movie there was no talk of the terrible bigotry and no one learned from what was said. Part of the problem is that it was an adaptation of a play and a remake of a 1982 movie that dealt with a basketball team from the 1950s. To make this movie happen earlier in the time would have made a little more sense. It didn't translate well in modern times and the writing was terrible. I don't know how the play was originally written, but I can't believe any movie made as bad and as hateful as this one on television and video in 1999. It was disgusting. Don't waste your precious time on this one.
