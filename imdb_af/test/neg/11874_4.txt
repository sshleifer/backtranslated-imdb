Since Wesley Snipes crashed into the world of DTV action flies, the result was Miss, so-so, and miss.Unstoppible was weak.7 seconds were entertaining.The marker was the proverbial scraper of the septic tank. /> <br /> And what about the detonator? We would be anything to suffer from the Marksman again. But the Detonator has a small amount of merit that is hampered by a lazy star and low budget. <br /> <br /> Sonny Griffith is a non-for-the-book Covert banning illegal arms dealers in Poland. When his last assignment ends a bullet buffet, a heap of bodies leave, then Sonny is commanded to guide a witness; Nadia (the everyday Silvia Colloca) to the US. Trouble is; Sonny is muted by a traitor in his own organization. He keeps his route warm for Gangsters with Nuclier Ambitions. <br /> <br /> Snipes deliver in the action section. He is in half-blade fashion. He actually works well in the first 15 minutes of the detonator, before it runs into the pure sleepwalking mode that destroys the Marksman. Colloca looks more than beautiful. There is some conviction for her scenes. Many of the actors are famous, and were in the last 3 or 4 Seagal / Snipes movies. It's always good to see Michael Brandon again. <br /> <br /> The action is telegraphed here. But never boring. Running, motoring, Fights.Director Po-Chih Leong seems to have improved after the Seagal farce out of Reach. He does a credible job. But this is constantly being hampered by the low budget. Yet with the eastern Euro-places. It's cheap to see the movie's look. Vancover can't be that expensive? br /> <br /> The Detonator just ends on average. It does not have the bad aspect of Seag already being a mercenary for justice. But it's nowhere as entertaining as Van Damme's Second in command. Just as exciting as Dolph's Mechanics. Maybe Dolph Wesley has to target next day? <br /> <br /> The high time The producers are pumping a little more money and thinking about these DTV titles with the kind of money they make from them. It's just fair. The result may be a high seller. <br /> <br /> Snipes will be advised to make this one of its last DTV action movies. It is sad to see another waste of these talented actors talents.
