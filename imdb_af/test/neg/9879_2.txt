From the creators of the underworld we have by far the worst weatherwolf I've ever seen. It is basically a reconstructed version of the underworld, but still has no vampires (not a big problem), cool effects (a big deal) and generally just about everything that can be done right to a decent movie about lycantropy. of them all!). A twenty-something lycanthrope chocolate manufacturer named Vivian currently lives in Romania since his family was hunted and exported in America before her years ago. There she belongs to a small society (or pack) werewolves and is apparently chosen to conquer the pack leader Gabriel, whose son - a road with a British accent - involuntarily, to hunt outside the pack. They have apparently been discovered in other countries and want to stay in Romania by avoiding negative attention, so of course such activities are considered prohibited. Vivian ends up falling in love with an American artist who is unaware of her involvement with the group of bloodthirsty predators. When they finally discover the secret relationship, things become messy when someone is killed and man is forced to participate in a deadly tradition in which he is detached and hunted in the forest. This gives the pack a chance to be in their "wolfy" self. All this really consists of is a big leap before they light and land as a wolf. Many cheezy effects. The whole movie is like an underworld immersed in droplets, romantic settings and very little action. If I watch it in the theater, I can't wait for it to end. A devastating boring disappointment. Avoid!
