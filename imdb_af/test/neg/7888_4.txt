Leon Errol maintains his dual role of uncle Matt Lindsay and Lord Basil Epping, but I struggle to keep the "Mexican Spitfire" series because they are all planning to produce faulty identities, and that is pre-arranged on the telegram. Errol is funny like the stuffy Lord Epping, but I would have chosen much more and much less repetition. <br /> <br />
