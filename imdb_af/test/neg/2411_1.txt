I'm sure I've seen future death for the same reason as most people: the wonderful poster by HR Giger. And like everyone, I was disappointed to find that the movie couldn't live on the poster (Giger said that director Moore had actually asked him to do so). When I first saw it, I thought for 14 years it was the worst movie ever made. I'll still think if I haven't seen some movies on MST3K ever since. <br /> <br /> The plot has a bunch of annoying colleagues driving into the "mutant city" to kidnap a gang leader for their brotherhood. This is when they meet Splatter (Ed Neal), a mutant / cyborg / psycho who kills the gang leader and blows it on the freak as an excuse to hunt them and grab power. The rest of the movie consists mainly of chases. A handful of freaks are trying to make their way out of the mutant city (which I think LA is supposed to have been made in Texas). There are some pseudo-political things about the frat boys' society that is pro nuclear weapons and the mutant community is anti-nuke. There is talk of how Splatter has become a freak due to radiation. Most people develop cancer from radiation, but splashes only shoots nails and butchers girls. Yes, it makes a lot of sense. At one point our heroes rescue a mutant girl from two pro-nuke police, and they show them "how the other half lives." The other half, it turns out, are all punk kids dancing to a bad 80's pop band. So our little epic is both stupid and dated. It's really all there is. Frat boys run around in broken buildings while guys who look like bicycles try to kill them. Oh, and that's the future. <br /> <br /> I don't think you'll doubt why Ron W. Moore has never made a movie. This thing is a real stinker. If you like Giger, buy his books (they have the poster without the horrors of the movie) or just look ALIEN again. FUTURE KILL is a waste of time no one needs. <br /> <br /> If this description sounds good to the picture, there is another crappy movie that does the same, just bigger and better: AFTER THE NEW YORK FALL. It's shit, but it blows FUTURE KILL off the screen.
