There were nice characters here, played by pleasant actors and actresses, plus a well-known band and some well-known dancers ..... but the movie just didn't work. By the time it was almost over, I was bored to death. The dialogue was silly, the humor (especially Milton Berle's) was really stupid and the music just wasn't rising on me. <br /> <br /> I've never been a big-band fan, and if I hear "In The Mood" again, I'll break out. <br /> <br /> It was my first glance at well-known skater actor Sonja Henie and I have no complaints about her. Almost a part of the problem, at least with the humor, is that it is so dated that it is no longer funny. Berle, Phil Silvers, Bob Hope, Red Skeleton, Abbot & Costello, etc. Etc. was hilarious to the crowd in the 40s and 50s, but humor changed, and what was funny was not today.
