Hitchcock is a good director. Ironically, I mostly find his movies a total waste of time to watch. I admire Hitchcok on a purely visual and technical level. <br /> <br /> First, the positives. Hitchcock invented the idea of ​​the investigative camera. The curious eye that is able to withhold or search for information. It is not exactly a new visual grammar, but it was revolutionary. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Hitchcock played the thriller and the movie. He has an economic style and always thinks of the audience. He gives them regular excitement, regular humor and regular shocks. In short, he expects the audience's basic needs and plays them like a violin. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the basic needs of a person are mostly stupid. Food, sex, the thrill of danger and a little comedy. Hithcock caters to all of these on-screen needs, with the exception of food, which has its size, provided on-screen. <br /> <br /> It's this audience commotion that sabotages most of its films. A second downside is that most of Hitchcock's camera work and visual grammar is now commonplace. What watches his movies is the simple economy of his stories, the intelligence of his camera work, and his skill in crafting crews. <br /> <br /> So after "Saboteur". It's a light skirt in the year of "The 39 Steps". <br /> <br /> On an emotional level, the relationship between the leaders is not the same as Robert Donat and Madeleine Caroll in "The 39 Steps". Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy. The plot rubbish just like a machine, desperate, depending on the addition of new scenes. And new scenes just bring us to an end, because it's not clear whether the hook is the hero's escape from the police, the villains or his action to stop the plagued sabotages. <br /> <br /> There are the usual Hitchcock logic errors. For example, a man with handcuffs frees himself with a car fan belt, etc. (Why doesn't he just drive in the car? Certainly handcuffs are not so restrictive? He can swim in them!) <Br /> <br /> If you want a better Hitchcock war propaganda movie of the 40's , I would recommend looking at "Foreign Correspondant". They are both foolish chase movies with a catchy final, but "Foreign Correspondant" makes great use of umbrellas and tulips, something that Spielberg looks good in the "Minority Report". <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 - A good set of pieces. In addition, there is nothing more to sink your teeth.
