Federal agent Frank Poo (Andy Garcia) has discovered that the only person who can save his son's life is a psychopath played by Michael Keaton. However, when a serum transfer at the local hospital goes terribly wrong, a certain mr. Pooh does everything in its power to ensure that the crazy man stays alive to make the inevitable transfer possible. By the way, his name is not really Poo, I just feel like calling him. Despite the original concept on hand, it is an undeniable and fearless action thriller. I have never been a big fan of Andy Garcia and have given his charecter here, but it is not the incentive. Rows are treated with great disappointment, and the end sucks pretty badly. Having done a great villain in Pacific Heights, Keaton's psychopathic bad guy is a bit here, and a madman is too funny and charismatic. Brian Cox is also wasted as Garcia's firm and first-class.
