The basic idea behind "Dungeon of Harrow" is not bad. However, the acting is bad. The lighting is bad. The music is bad. The scenes of torture are without emotion. There really isn't much to recommend this movie. You know what a movie you are in when the credits "Special Guest Star" say and someone you have never heard of. Can also say, "Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln." because there is really no one in this movie you can identify. There are one or two decent moments, mostly at the end, and I think the basic plot sketch might have an original idea, but it alone is not enough to keep you awake through this otherwise unknown gift.
