This is a comedy / romance movie directed by Andy Tennant, featuring Will Smith, Eva Mendes and Kevin James. <br /> <br /> It's about a professional dating doctor-Will Smith - known as 'Hitch' who helps men to date Land with the women they are interested in. He is currently helping a wealthy, clumsy Albert who is obsessed with a very powerful, well-known and wealthy woman named Allegra. At the same time, Hitch was interested in a gossip columnist, Sara, - Eva Mendes - who was assigned to write about Allegra. When Sara's best friend has a love disillusionment with a man Sara thinks is a Hitch client, his revenge against Hitch and the misunderstanding lead the two couples to a conflict situation. This movie is not one that men should see if it has many male bashing and both subtle and blatant male hatred. There are also double standards that you should be blind to not mock. Hitch and Sara are both very protected from the opposite sex. Hitch still loves women, despite her burns in the past and teaches men to make them happy. But of course, Sara is a sexist bigot who regularly makes sexist remarks in the sense that "men want sex with anything that goes." She is self-obsessed and knows she looks like a goddess and knows there aren't 'real men' out there. What was my worst annoyance was the 'bad' guy who wanted a quick stumbling block with Sara's best friend, who is the classic example of a defenseless 'victim', and even after being physically fired by Hitch, Sara's pills, after which she says, "Now I'm happy." Add to that the "women are still suppressed". Vibes you get from Allegra are not allowed to spend her own money after permission of a table man has been requested. Despite all the rubbish assumptions and generalizations - Women can always tell you when you're not straight with them? - This movie does have the right point that love in America simply doesn't exist. There are some funny parts in this movie, such as Albert and his dance habits, but this movie in general, just beats the horrible movie, Honey, with a marginal amount.
