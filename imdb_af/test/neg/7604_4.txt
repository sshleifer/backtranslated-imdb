It was a real deviation for me. The original Bride with White Hair is a great kung fu fantasy movie, but this one was pretty poor. I didn't care about the new characters who unfortunately dominated the screen time and the story was not well developed. While the first movie was tragic and so far, it was boring (just as I counted the time to the end when the unbelievers would actually meet). The action was also poor in this one. The battles were not very well choreographed and there really wasn't much kung fu. Just a few bad swords fights between the highly unfair Lazy and one of Lin's loggers. Lin herself mainly uses a kind of telekinesis to throw people into walls and sometimes her hair, far from the impressive display with the whip and kung-fu she has shown in the previous movie. I still gave this movie a 4 because it was at least fast and I wanted to see what would happen at the end, although I (like most people who watched the first one) predicted that it would go as it did . And after I saw it, I found it anti-climax and also wanted to make a proper follow-up or just leave the story. I recommend the first one, but just as for the successor, only the fans of the genre and those who really see Lin as the bride must apply again.
