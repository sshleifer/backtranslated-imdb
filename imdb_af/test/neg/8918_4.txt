I just saw today you die. It's bad, almost very bad. <br /> <br /> 1) The direction and editing are terrible, just awful. Almost I turned off the movie, Fauntleroy (the director) has no idea what he is doing, he seems to be randomly filmed and some scenes don't make sense at all. I also hate it if the same scene is used in the same movie again. In this movie some scenes were used 3 or 4 times. Pretty bad. <br /> <br /> 2) The dialogue is sometimes good, sometimes terrible. I like the fact that they want to make Seagal's character and Treach's character look like they were in a similar relationship with the characters in Deadly Weapon, but it didn't just work because some of the dialogue didn't do SENSE and I speak a lot of English. Well, it's not that I don't understand the words, it was the fact that the jokes and dialogue lines had no meaning. <br /> <br /> 3) The writing is pretty bad. Why are they always trying to complicate DTV action movies? Seagal's wife in the movie has psychic abilities, why? Is it useful for the movie? NO. Seagal eliminates a lot of people working for the man who betrayed him and he knows these people without ever meeting them in the movie. Stupid. The story sometimes goes out of the way and it jumps back without any reason. The story is sometimes messy and pointless. They should have kept it simple and worked it out. <br /> <br /> 4) In some of the action scenes it's not Seagal, it's double stunt. You can tell because they just film him from behind and never show his face. He also beats the guys with filmmaking, not really like the aikido that Steven knows. The stunt double uses cute kicks and bumps. <br /> <br /> 5) Steven is good at the movie. 90-95% of the lines are said with his real voice. The rest is dubbing, but it's not that bad. It was good. Steven also seems to enjoy himself in the movie and is more in the action he was in Submerged. He likes Treach as a partner; At least he doesn't look like him. Also, he seems to be in better shape than in some of his recent films. I hate the fact that he wears clothes to hide his body, but in the same clothes he wears on the DVD cover, he looks more than OK and he had to wear the clothes for most of the movies, not the silly long leather jacket. br /> <br /> I really think Seagal was prepared to make a good movie. The fact that he came late and turned up early in the series ON TWO MOVIES led by Fauntleroy does not seem to me to be a coincidence. I think he realized that the crew were amateurs or just for a quick buck and he no longer gave a damn. <br /> <br /> In the hands of a better company and crew it might be a damn good action movie for Seagal. Something like out for justice or above the law. I believe it honestly. But the people who made the movie aren't very good at their job, or they didn't have enough money to do the job properly. Bad because I like Steven in the movie and Treach was cool (Ice Cool), but the rest was bad. Hey, it gives me hope for Black Dawn and Shadows of the Past. I think the mercenary can be treated just as badly. But hey, Steven seemed to be in the same mood again while making his better movies. At least, that's reason enough to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> I liked it, but it could have been much better. 10/04
