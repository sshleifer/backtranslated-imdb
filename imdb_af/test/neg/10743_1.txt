I enjoyed the Masters of the Horror series until I came to this kid. <br /> <br /> This anti-Bush propaganda piece, decorated as a horror movie, comes out as an episode of the original Batman done by Michael Moore. Political satire must be smart. However, it draws a ten on the simpleton scale with all the style and credibility of a L. Ron Hubbard movie. <br /> <br /> In his camp, it's a tough way to get Republican stealing elections, go to war for absolutely no reason and treat soldiers and women as mere gunfire. It even takes a whip at the Second Amendment and Religion. All that was missing was Caesar Romero, because the president was in the mood for how he orchestrated 9/11. <br /> <br /> I think the end would be the "We support our troops" moment, but I think they would be more offensive than happy with the whole effort. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the Hollywood elite are sitting in their Malbu homes that sit at each other for this "spicy" job while the misinformed anti-war drones catch it as a genius. <br /> <br /> Time to fit with new tin foil hats.
