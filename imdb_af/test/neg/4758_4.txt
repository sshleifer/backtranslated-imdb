This terrifying romantic comedy is based on the kind of story I loved as a teenager, but is now quite unpleasant. In the case of May-September attachments, it is undoubtedly what the mind of the parenting party is on the parenting party, or lust or inability to fight the reality of aging, or both. And the younger one is probably looking for the older parent she or she missed as a child. These underlying agendas look more pathetic than I'm now romantic; There is also something better about them. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell got a bit embarrassed - as good as he was - to play the older lover in this stupid story. He was at fifty, trying to play the role of a thirty-eight-year-old teenager-aging man. But young Debbie Reynolds was a knockout - beautiful and juicy and full of vinegar - as a seventeen-year-old assault that was presented as a "gift" to the morally upright and honest scriptwriter. Her enthusiastic performance gave me a better score than this movie would otherwise earn. Anne Francis was cast as Powell's beautiful but brilliant fianc√©, and handled her small role thoroughly. <br /> <br /> Some of the dialogue was also amusing, so it's not a total washout. <br /> <br /> 5/10
