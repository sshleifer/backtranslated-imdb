Sometimes it's funny to watch movies come in from your couch, but other times it's just terribly painful for your eyes and mind. Home Party 4: Until the last minute, one of those rare examples of when both your eyes and your mind plead with you is to eliminate the movie. This final installment for the Home Party series is by far the worst, not only sequel, but Hollywood-released movie. It becomes very early in this "feature" that director Chris Stokes loved Ferris Bueller's Day Off with passion. I say this because it becomes very clear that Stokes had no trouble lifting the originality of Bueller's John Hughes hands and completely emptying a movie. You would think you would steal "themes and images" from a more enjoyable movie, your own movie could at least generate a giggle or two. With House Party 4, Stokes proved that he didn't have the necessary to lead a successor, much less a Hollywood movie. Out of his confusing and messy story, the inability to make sense of his characters, and retarded old / tired clich√© moments, doing everything, stopping, a bigger nail is hit in the chest holding the House Party movies. It reminds me of the student who's forgetting about his project in an hour and throwing super gum, macaroni, cathar, chewing gum and straws quickly and predicting it as Hannibal over the Alps. It just looks terrible and you feel ashamed of the creator. <br /> <br /> So, where did this movie take the plunge into the kingdom of comic stupidity? Honestly, I don't think most places will allow me to talk for so long, so I'd like to hit some of the bigger topics that hit me the hardest. To start, I still can't shake the Ferris Beuller rip-off. It was as if director Stokes was ashamed to lead another successor to House Party and decided to introduce a completely random formula (of a cleaner film) and see if he could cut elements of the original series into the formula and place. It was a big mistake. When a director tries to do so, it is finally confusion within the audience. We think we are going in one direction, but instead we go in a different direction. This is exactly what you can see in House Party 4. In one case, John-John tried to have the "biggest party of the decade", while we were also trying to get a record deal (ok, remind me of the original House Party), but then we wander off to this Eternal Island where Uncle Charles is afraid to fly, Grandma gets drunk and some idiot-wise moments with an alleged killer. Again, we start a bit strong and end up chaotic. This is the confusion I am talking about. Director Stokes did not have the ability to keep his hand on the pulse or the ability to tell a successive story. He would rather cut corners, keep the jokes cheap and think the audiences are idiots than trying to relive a stone-dead series. One would think that when a director handed over the task of filming another House Party movie, he would go in thinking he would be the one to revive or resume it. bring, but Stokes just wanted to pay. br /> <br /> I realize I'm slowly getting older as the days go fast, but I still believe that I still hold my hand in the younger generation's culture. I listened to rap and R&B growing up, but the group "Immature" never covered it with my cassette or made my CD player. Why? I don't think they ever had another, but apparently to director Chris Stokes, it would be beneficial to cast them as leaders in his new House Party movie. Didn't anyone in a studio realize that it would be pretty fast in the red? Or how about Stokes' choice to play the comic car repairman, nothing like a director with no sense of comic timing that stands out as the only source of possible humor. It was one of the few cases when I actually missed Robin Harris, and I never thought I'd find it for any movie. Outside of a go-anywhere band that plays the lead, I also thought the rest of the cast just sucked life out of this movie. Uncle Charles was annoying when he tried to humor. Kim Whitely was completely wasted for her scenes (both literally and figuratively) while? good ?? everyone else falls almost in that category. <br /> <br /> Where did Chris Stokes spend most of the budget for this movie? Not for special guest stars, because while this movie might have been rest assured, no one was present at the "memorable" home party, nor the possible dream that might make Kid of Play a final look. House Party 4 did not follow a predetermined design, which ultimately ruined this function from the foundation. Can anyone explain why there was a need to use the "escaped murderer who was a licensed taxi driver," routine for humor? Stokes were deep in the bottom of the barrel and produced just more rubbish instead of dust. For once I can admit that there is no redeeming value for this movie. House Party 4 buried the series, and while I hear there's more in the pipeline, I just hope Hollywood realizes that this series has died. Hollywood must end this series, forget about the past and move forward in the future. I think a successor of Who is the man? they will start in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Degree: * Off *****
