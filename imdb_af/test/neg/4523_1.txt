I have never seen the TV series or the previous movies. Probably, that's why I didn't really enjoy it. Drilling and just not funny, sums it up nicely. <br /> <br /> Considering the budget the movie looks like, it is embarrassing that they couldn't do an equally acceptable job. <br /> <br /> We went to the cinema with no exceptions and hoped to see a somewhat funny movie that wouldn't burden the mind. My friend fell asleep halfway through the movie and I spent the next 2 hours hoping it would eventually pick up. A hope, which ended with dead end credits.
