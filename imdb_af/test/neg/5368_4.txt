The atmosphere in this show is wonderful. There is very good build-up, but that's where this show fails. There is way to build up too much for nothing. You will always see a creepy set that makes it feel, like something really freaky comes right out of the corner and then .... nothing. Over and over nothing. You hear many stories of people talking about freaky events, but you see nothing. They appear at people's doors, talk about their deep and emotional past, set up lame equipment and find nothing! there is nothing on this show that leads me to believe in anything paranormal. I laugh every time they have a "terrible spirit" that we have not seen as an audience. They get rid of the spirit that has never been and everything is put in a neat, small package. A show that looks so freaky and has such a great potential leads to one thing ... Nothing!
