If it is just days before the film's premiere, its author puts out of the project and asks for his name to be removed from the credits. You know it's not going well. <br /> <br /> The books on which "Wiedzmin" is based have great potential for a lively fantasy movie? "Geralt de Rivia is a witch, his only purpose is to destroy the monsters that bother the world. But not everything that is sincere is evil, and not everything is fair?" But all that didn't matter when a Polish film staff, with a low budget and no, or little appreciation for Sapkowski's work, decided to make a 13-part mini-series out of it. The two-hour movie is a by-product of their actions to maximize profits. <br /> <br /> It's not hard to show in this case, causing people to name this movie so badly. Plot (incoherent, thanks to making too many stories), acting (below average, except Zebrowski), dialogues (rogue), editing (bumpy), special effects (unbearable) and choreography (poor) film overall bad experience. Only the soundtrack, done by Grzegorz Ciechowski, brings out the beauty of the world of "Wiedzmin", which has never been brought to the screen. Even the grandiose flora and fauna of Poland (where part of "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" was shot), an important element in virtually any fantasy film, is not to their full potential. The more I think of this dead loss, the more I walk out of words. At least it's easy to know that Marek Brodzki, the director of "Wiedzmin", has since only had one movie (also in Germany). <br /> <br /> For now, we are left with top-notch fantasy stories and a fantastic computer RPG (released in 2007) that refers to the Wiedzmin books. But I am sure one day justice will be done for the Wiedzmin case, and we will soon be treated with an equally good film adaptation.
