I have no idea who this other is, but this movie is simply awful. They should watch Joe Pesci if he is a small character. Ace and link movies just as the studios did with Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey, etc. The DVD I watched, "This dark jewel revolves around Joe Pesci's MOB character who is a warhead starting a war," etc. Etc. Joe plays part of Joe, he doesn't even carry a gun, plays a whimpy character and gets SPOILER - (shaky). So much for the movie that turns to Pesci. The only halfway memorable scene was a bad comedy when they passed gas while waiting for a score. If you watch this movie after you read it, I have warned you. Please stop and do not lose 87 minutes of your life.
