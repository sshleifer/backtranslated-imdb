This is probably Wayne's poorest movie; at least the poorest in which he played a leading role. It's just incredibly bad. The editing is especially awful; It really seems as if the editor (if any) literally picks up bits of film from the floor and puts them together. The opening should be seen to be believed. John Wayne has to curl every time it is called! I know there are "B" movies - but are there "H" movies? If so, this is an example. And I say this as a dedicated JW fan.
