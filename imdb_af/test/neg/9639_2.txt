It is a pity that between this film, In the Elah Valley, Lions for Lambs and Home of the Brave, all are based on general stereotypes about veterans of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. The spit, the battles, the short-term insurance, the broken marriages, guys who eat and dig a fox hole in their front yard when they are drunk, etc. Etc. <br /> <br /> This is happening - yes, but not as often as you would think after watching any of these movies. I think it is a pity that these directors / producers / writers choose their ax against the political settlement to portray such atypical ways. In this particular movie, Kimberly Peirce didn't even throw us a leg, like showing the new kids born while a family member was deployed, or the child who grew up in a ghetto now able to afford the university , thanks to the GI Bill, or the couple who can afford a home, or start a new business, their citizenship, etc. worth it. Instead, we are treated to the stereotypes, because the people who made this movie just want to show you the bad side. /> <br /> Some problems with the movie itself: 1) someone screwed in by setting Phillippe for a Bronze star with V after he led his team in a solid alley after being led by an armed man a taxi is rushed. Pretty stupid, but yes, it happens. 2) The humwees had no tower weapon, so we have to believe this is a start of the war, but every soldier and their brother has an ACOG and every possible attachment for their M4? sorry, don't think so 3) Timothy Olyphant as lieutenant colonel? It's hard to believe, but I just checked that he became 40 in May, so the timing isn't too far. 4) He hit two soldiers to escape to be sent to jail after he said he would not return to Iraq (after learning that he was a cessation). So he is a refugee. Then, when he finally comes in himself, and they take him back, does he keep his rank and deploy with the same unit? Sorry, don't think so. <br /> <br /> I can only describe it as one giant army and infantry stereotype. Do some of the events depicted in this movie, with some soldiers, yes. In this movie you get virtually every stereotype in the space of about 100 minutes, and really things are just not so for most soldiers coming back. I wish the director made a point of doing a little better research instead of starting her agenda and then making a movie. <br /> <br /> Of the movies I mentioned at the beginning of this post, the best one is probably Lions for Lambs, which is more a comment on the sad state of Generation Y + as it goes about the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan or the Bush administration. If you really want to watch this movie wait for the cable or Netflix it, don't pay cash directly to rent it.
