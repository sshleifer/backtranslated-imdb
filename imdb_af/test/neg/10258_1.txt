This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen; it makes Plan 9 out of outer space look great. The play is wood, the plot stupid and the SFX does not exist. The only good thing about this is the fact that it is not a long film. The scenery is sometimes pretty beautiful, if you like trees, if it helps anyone!
