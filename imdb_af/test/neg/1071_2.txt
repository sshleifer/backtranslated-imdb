I don't understand how hard this movie is! I don't understand why high school children should see it! I don't understand why it should make me think of everything in the slightest! <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * <br /> <br /> When the unmarked girl is on her way to committing suicide, was I the only person who cheered her up? The cliché-classical music, long track recordings, melancholy emotion of the film at that time had me in reverse. I would just have been happy if she had penetrated the room and the whole casting was there with her scissors to slit their wrists. <br /> <br /> Why? <br /> <br /> Since I went to high school .... and honestly and I'm sick to death to watch film after film in Australia with teenagers, because it's solely based on terrible clichés. I've been waiting for a younger person to write a movie that I can talk to. This stereotype-driven piece of garbage is what I got earlier. It was like a dark version of sadness that needed a predictable end. <br /> <br /> Why are all teenagers in Aussie dramas depressed or are there really strange issues that just aren't likely to be told? <br /> <br /> On the positive side, it was more funny than 'Unclear'. And I needed a good laugh.
