Sorry for anyone not Lynch. <br /> <br /> My sister-in-law asked me how to make a disturbing movie. I told her that if the daughter and her father didn't do this movie, they would rather go and kill and cut people into pieces. <br /> <br /> After every Lnych movie I tell myself to lose myself one and a half hours of my life. But next time I will check the name of the director or producer. <br /> <br /> So you don't want to be angry with yourself and lose time, don't look at it. But if you think you should kill someone, watch it, it's probably a better medicine than spending your whole life in a prison for mentally insane people.
