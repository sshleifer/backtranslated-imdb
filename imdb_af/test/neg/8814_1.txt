I'm a big horror movie buff, especially from the 1980s subgenres. Call one ?? I probably saw it. Last year, a new little horror movie that appeared under the mainstream radar called "Saw" was about to hit theaters. I was moderately excited. After I didn't hear anything, I thought it was really promising to judge by the previews and posters (well, except the back and the white people with the cut hands and feet ... they just looked terrible!). It was one of the worst experiences of my life. This movie was literally spiritual and psychologically painful to watch. Because it was scary? ... NO! Being one of the most horrible movies, I have ever had the displeasure to see! First, the construction of the screenplay and editing was completely horrible, even by horror movie standards. Start a row in an interview room with a victim (Shawnee Smith) who recently survived a serial killer's attack, and then a glimpse of what she survived? NOT SCARY! It was impossible to feel any kind of tension, WHO ALSO knew that the aforementioned victim was perfect. Sure, the reverse thing was spectacular ... but WHY should I feel a little scared when it is clear, you just showed me that she survived the ordeal? Unfortunately, the whole movie was built up like that. It starts with two guys in a cellar. Then they show flashbacks on how they were abducted ... NOT SCARY! Why? As we already know what is going to happen to them, we see how we only get the result of the attack. They're fine! Keep up with the story! Even more sadly, the real story was at its best. I couldn't have been less for these annoying, pitiful excuses for characters and the acting didn't help. Cary Elwes was for the most part solid and then he started crying at the end like a lost baby while beating to keep his American accent intact (it didn't work? The audience I saw was in stitches). It made him a result and an idiotic decision, even the simplest would not try. He had other options. Better. SMARTER ONES. Even his intense emotional state (terribly communicated by horrific acting) was still irrational. I didn't buy it. BATH AVAILABLE! Furthermore, even when certain series were played straight and without backlash, they were painfully predictable. I constantly found my foot tapping impatiently for the dumb drive to end. It happened to the whole movie. I saw every single "twist". Twenty minutes into the movie I mentioned all the killer's identity, not his connection with his "accomplices" as big as they appeared on the screen. Better acting can overshadow the terrible writing. Instead, the actors may also have "RED-HERRING" or "ACCOMPLICE" tattooed on their foreheads. <br /> <br /> By the end of the movie, I was completely outraged. I even live a fragment of my mess on this movie, and the whole theater laughed hysterically on the straight horrible final. Seriously, you'd think they watched a Monty Python movie. I would also laugh if I wasn't so angry with the movie's total and total failure to achieve what it wanted to do. When we were away, there was (no joke) a line to talk to the theater manager to get their money back (didn't happen). I was absolutely positive. The movie would be a boxing bomb. The next week you couldn't have thought my shock to find out that "Saw" got the number one at the box office and everyone talked about it (mostly individuals who found "Napoleon Dynamite" to be an exciting epic story) thought "satire" was a kind of rubber). I'm so sick of hearing people praising this movie, which I often feel like I'm going to vomit. It is entertaining for the worst and simplest of mankind. Those who find some strange jigsaw clown dolls in a tricycle industry (threatening to pop it over and leave? What's so scary about it?) Threaten. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I have every "Friday the 13th", like my flattering movies, thought "Napoleon Dynamite" was hilarious, can't do enough of Freddy, Michael, Pinhead or Leatherface don't get a great appreciation for unknown horror gems and rank "Sleepaway Camp II: Unlucky Campers" among my Top 10 favorite slashers. However, I realize that these movies are not the most sophisticated American cinema. I appreciate them for what they are ?? Fast, easy fun. "Saw" is film refuse. The film aims to be a clever and semi-sophisticated, nasty little excitement ride, and nuts to an annoying, annoying waste of time, money, energy and celluloid. Horrible on all accounts. Every single copy should be burned, along with its poorly enthusiastic supporters. Shame on all of you. <br /> <br /> Will I see "Saw II"? Perhaps I will take a double shot of Liquid Drano before I protrude my own eyes and penetrate white-hot-shish-kabobs into my ears and colon. My rating: 0/10. Avoid at all costs.
