An old high school teacher of mine once boasted that he ever made every movie, so one day a friend of mine and I decided to make a movie called "Pacific Inferno". Later, we argued in the lead role by Carl Weathers or Billy Dee Williams. Our teacher found the argument interesting, and he informed us and told us that the starring role of "Pacific Inferno" was played by Jim Brown. We thought he was caught in a lie until we went to the library and discovered that "Pacific Inferno" was actually a real movie. This incident forced me to rent the movie ... it's terrible. Our made-up movie had a better plot than this piece. Weathers and Billy Dee would have been much better in the picture.
