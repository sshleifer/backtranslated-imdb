However, the complex script with three subplots is completely confused, which makes the entangled story a total mess. There are too many characters and situations, and at one point I was completely lost with the connected and fragmented story. In the end, I was totally disappointed with this confused, but also haunting film. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Grito 2" ("The Scream 2")
