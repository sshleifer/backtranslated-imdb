There is not enough room to explain the many ways this movie is a disappointing mess. Silly special effects and an incomprehensible plot are the least of the movie's problems. The movie looks like it was conceived in the mid-eighties and just stole until it could eventually be made in the early nineties. The mischievous "hero" (complete with the fashionable "Miami Vice" three-day shadow beard), the ham-fisted slams at Ronald Reagan, would make it funny if it didn't get so serious. As it is, the movie is just pathetic. I really feel sorry for the poor actresses who have wasted their fine nude scenes in this horrible movie.
