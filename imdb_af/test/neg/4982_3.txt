Good things out of the way first: <br /> <br /> Underdog's tuner was fine. But Jason Lee is wonderful himself, it's really no surprise. <br /> <br /> Peter Dinklage (Barsinister) also did well, for what waste was he given. He performed the part shockingly well. And so did Patrick Warburton, the moronic assistant. Now, it was an idiotic character, but he acted so well, I liked the character better than the protagonists. The lines given to him were childish but spectacular. <br /> <br /> But. Alex Neuberger did terribly and hopes he will never act again. His "Scream" was so disgusting. Silence. Silence. "Aaahhhhhhh". In the scene where he hears the dog talking, an "oh no, impossible!" would have been sufficient in place of the pathetic false scream. <br /> <br /> Then there was the girl and her female dog chasing Patrick's character Cad on the roof. Initially it makes sense, she is a "Reporter." A school reporter, but still an investigative thought regardless. But why, why did the HELL hold her dog? It was worthless and the damn dog didn't even say anything else like a heartless "oh! Her presence was very unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Overall, the writing was pathetic. The only reason I give this movie a 3 is Barsinister, his help and suspicion's voice.
