It's hard and I didn't expect it. But it's really the worst movie, my wife and I have seen. Terrible dialogues that are incomprehensible over time without any clear reason except filling time. The storytelling does not follow a comprehensive, understandable way? everything is a mess. The action and dialogs appear on jumps. The thing that disappointed me the most was to involve Dominique Pinon one of my French favorite actors involved in this? uh ?? I don't even know how to describe it without being polite ?? The rest of the actors were probably poor. Susan Paterno made a terrible interpretation of her character, which made a flat, inexpressible display. Poor special effects. I don't think it was a complete waste of film, but it's close? If I want to say, I would recommend everyone not to watch this movie. I think it will be a total waste of time. Sincerely, I never said I would say something about a movie, but ?? there is always a first time.
