I think I should be fair and point out that I do not believe in traces. That said, I'm very interested in the subject and I enjoy a scary story as much as the next man. I'm a fan of Ghost Hunters because they at least try to give their investigations a scientific angle. Even early episodes of Most Haunted had a camp entertainment factor for them. Paranormal state does not have these characteristics. The cases themselves have the potential to be interesting, but as with so much reality TV these days, they suffer from overproduction, poor acting and foolish scripts. The performers freely admit that writers "lead" the stories. I hear they are even going to shoe horn in a romance subplot to call on the young female demographic. The show also has many other errors. As others have said, the narrative quickly becomes nails in a plate. Over the upper visual and sound effects it becomes just as irritating. I'm willing to suspend some unbelief for the sake of entertainment, but this whole "demon with a vendetta" story bow is just ridiculous. As the producers of this show are also responsible for brain death foods such as MTV's Laguna Beach and Newport Harbor, I think it's really no surprise. If you're a hard fan of Ed & Lorraine Warren or a big reality show junkie, I think you'll find a lot in Paranormal state. For the rest of us .... I advise you to avoid.
