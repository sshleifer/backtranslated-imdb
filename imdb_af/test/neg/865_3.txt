I only saw a few nights ago at Caribe at the annual Vistas Film Festival here in Dallas, and I have to express my dissatisfaction. The opening headline is trying to tell us that the film is a reflection of the current invasion of South American countries (Costa Rica, in this particular case) by North American oil companies and the negative effects, both economic and environmental, of this invasion. The main characters are a married couple who live a simple, pleasant life that retains a banana farm. Suddenly a woman arrives and announces that she is the woman's half-sister. I'm not going to specify this in detail (and to be honest, I don't feel like spoiling something with this review), but another important point is that the company to whom they distribute their bananas drops them for claims demand in a poor economy. So, the main conflict that is supposed to be addressed in the movie is from the man between the rock and the hard place and trying to preserve his existence. On the one hand, the Reynolds oil company really and truly offered itself (basically a bribe) to use its public influence to encourage the town to enable the company to start drilling in their town (around his harm the community and the community itself). On the other hand, he is confronted with being dead, but on the side of his community, protesting the drill. Given the length of this movie, it would have had enough time to investigate the issues just described, but it just doesn't happen, and I'll tell you why. You will see that this movie has so far won some awards, one for direction and one for awards. I'm not going to divide Esteban's direction, it wasn't bad or good enough to give me everything that was passionate about writing something. The awarding of the audience was at a film festival in Spain, and to get an audience award, I have to imagine that Spanish people only dig soap operas. In fact, Central and South America also dig soap operas, I know so much. I suppose Esteban was either aiming to take advantage of it or that he was digging soap soap himself, because that is what unfolds in the course of this film, to the point of kicking the entire oil company's plot, almost as if they were halfway through the making of this movie that it was getting tired, as it appears that at least three of the supporting characters have severely compromised their back story and character development to make room for more sex and crying scenes. The only real villain in the movie is one of those three characters, and you can't really figure out who the hell is. It's almost as if they just cut his screen time to get him out of the movie. From time to time they play with the oil against the community, but it's at its best. What we see much more is scenes of passion, jealousy, betrayal, adultery, etc. These themes saturate the story to such an extent that the oil company's sub-plot becomes unnecessary. It's almost as if it was a stunt to legalize a romantic drama (soap opera) by throwing in some political relevance. Nevertheless, the film is so caught up in the romance that it does not finally know what to do with itself, leading to a termination so that you no longer know what you were waiting for, or if there was ever something to do with it to start. Here are two things I think could have saved this movie: either cut out the half-sister or cut out the oil company. It is clear which one of the two was more interested. Or maybe if Caribe was an hour longer, they could have done it all. Regardless, I would have been fine with an upright soap opera and I think the subject of oil companies exploiting foreign countries is the greatest need to address the movie community. Caribe is both and not. These two corners could have worked together if balanced, but with a romantic plot running in circles and taking about twice as much time as needed at the expense of a scarcely oiled site, both sides begin. . Best of all, the romance plot is never solved. I want to say I will see this movie again to see what I missed, but I have a strong feeling that I already know what it is. As for me, it doesn't matter if I saw Caribe ten times more. I missed it because it simply isn't there.
