Some time ago I stumbled upon this DVD while watching Netflix, and with such an impressive scroll I decided to let it go. <br /> <br /> Never before have I seen a movie, try a new version of an existing big movie (Scarface) and not so spectacular. <br /> <br /> The main problem seems to be a complete misunderstanding of what the story should be. In Scarface, Tony Montana was the self-proclaimed "bad man." His spectacular rise and eventual ruin were not sad, it was a great (and only logical end) to someone who lived such a life. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa, as director, writer and principal actor, sees Kilo as some hero, or at least a complicated man. However, he does not want to do the great job of creating a realistic, sympathetic character. He was raised by a white mother, except for the six months of his childhood where his father, a gangster himself, showed him his life. For reasons that have never been fully explained or even really mentioned, he decides he wants to be a drug dealer, and actually drives to the bad part of town, approaches two dealers and says, "Hey, I'd like to buy drugs." He dropped his father's name, and apparently no time they were not only rich, but the two guys who provided him were submissive to reasons, never again. <br /> <br /> Chapa wants you to feel bad when his character is sentenced to jail when a police informant lies over him. However, since he previously treated large amounts of drugs, why should one feel sympathy that he is going to jail this time? The most obvious case that Chapa wants to be the good man is in his jail performance of a White Supremacist / rapist by Gary Busey. In Scarface, Tony Montana kills someone in jail because he pretty much has to raise himself, it's done, he continues. But in this case they should not only make Busey a rapist / pedophile, but also a White supremacist. A little overlapping, don't you think? I will not go into much more detail about this, but their desperate message of "LIKE ME! I AM A CONSEQUENT TIMBER!" failure on each level. Try as they please, I didn't feel bad, conflict or sympathetic when his friends are murdered (after a shooting), his wife is also killed (shortly after she invited him to be a dirty father and during a attempting to escape when deciding, it would be right to ride a car full of armed men while his wife is in the car and his ultimate downfall. <br /> <br /> It is enough to say that his play can be reasonably summed up. He is just as mean, his only achievement that causes the term "wood" to die to new heights. Busey must be credited with actually making trouble in his ridiculous role. Tiny Lister did well. Stacy Keach plays his head of Prison Break role. Robert Wagner is deducting a salary. Faye Dunaway, while a dramatic touch, is still in a show better than the movie earned. Brad Dourif is in the movie for about two minutes and does what he can. And to give the movie credit, it makes one-off Scarface in one way. Jennifer Tilly has the title "Most Ridiculous Attempt at a Spanish Accent." (Sorry Robert Loggia.) In short, this movie had an interesting presentation, but a poor story bow, impersonal characters, and hits or misappropriations. I'll be Mr. Chapa recommends next time to relieve the forced sympathy - really, we don't need your character, we just need to be interested. Good luck next time.
