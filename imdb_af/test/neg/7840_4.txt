"Maximum Risk" is a step forward for Van Damme and just about the uninspired B-movie toys we've been expecting from movies with the macho-Belgian martial artist. The movie has gaping pieces of gates, a zipper, a messy merged plot, and a beautiful Henstridge who spends most of her time, seems to be waiting for a visit. "Maximum Risk" does not distinguish it in any way and will probably not have much appeal than the ordinary young male audiences. (C-)
