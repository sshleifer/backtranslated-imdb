I saw this movie while I was in France and I have to confuse it. It is a story of a jewel thief and a young singer, each arriving in Morocco at the same time, walking each other and forming a connection. Simple enough? Well, the problem is that it's the kind of movie that has ambiguity in both chronology (the movie isn't played in sequence) and in fact (did I just see it happen or was it just a dream?) . Given the parameters as well as the bilingual movie, it was very difficult to follow, and I wasn't sure what happened at the end. I suggest that some deeply artistic types can better understand this movie than I could, and it may require more than one viewer to understand.
