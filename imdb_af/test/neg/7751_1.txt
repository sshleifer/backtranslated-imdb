This movie is a bizarre fantasy story, which I'm sure doesn't appeal to anyone over 10, but is too strange for kids. The plot is stupid and the acting is the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Kathy Ireland, 25, plays a teenage girl acting like a 9-year-old. She got her character's voice by listening to Alvin and the Chipmunks. Her high stuffed, screaming baby voice becomes annoying the second she starts talking. All the other plays are bad, but really Kathy Ireland is by far the worst. The plot is also terrible and is a mix of Alice in Wonderland and Mad Max. Wanda Saknussemm (Ireland) receives a letter and says her father, who has long since left, has struck down a bottomless pit in Africa and if she is looking for him, she falls into an underground world of strange Australian accent. This is one of the corniest movies you'll ever see, with horrible lines throughout. <br /> <br /> It's annoying for the effects this movie uses for character development. Kathy Ireland is a nerd that will do nothing or go anywhere. She flies to Africa .... wow, what development! She dropped her glasses and didn't need them. Why don't the glasses of man's glasses become them, it doesn't become a nerd. It must represent her descent into blindness. It's just stupid. The only positive thing I can think of is that there are semi-good special effects and camera work, and the musical score sounds good. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a ridiculous family fantasy that will only appeal to those who have nothing of a movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 84 minutes. PG for violence.
