This unintentionally entertaining middle-aged TV movie is based on the assumption that Donna Mills (in a mostly horrible wardrobe throughout) is a neglected housewife, suffering from her sexy past as a cheerleader. She escapes her empty life by making fantasy about random sexual encounters with one of the many attractive men she comes across, ultimately in her fantasies and in a bit on the side, but all she really wants is the flames of redesign passion with her. boring man James Brolin. <br /> <br /> There are many ridiculous aspects of this movie, Mills's first collapse in co-production (later, after her departure from Knots Landing, she has found great success as a trashy TV movie queen. a victim of some kind of games, clearly determined to wash her hands from the miraculous and entertaining torch she has played on Knots for so long. The finest are the elaborate fantasy sequences, filmed as if they were meant to be softcore porn (wind and smoke machines, background lighting, porn music), but since it is a television television, the screens are all very cool and ultimately very sexy. The most amusing (and bizarre) scene has Mills a stroll on the wild side of the city center under the thin punks (complete with Robert Palmer soundtrack). <br /> <br /> Less ridiculous is the dreadful dialogue that carton characters are forced to declare (sorry, Cicely Tyson as the mandatory psycho-analyst, or Veronica Cartwright as the compulsory best friend, or even before Babs James Brolin with the daily soap style of knotted fist rage.) <br /> <br /> Of course, as in all these types of movies, we learn that all problems can be solved by psychotherapy and then the movie becomes silly, as we briefly explain the reasons for. Investigate Mills' "shocking" behavior (as if it wasn't just that she wanted a good shag!) <br /> <br /> Vacuum.
