What a bloody nuisance! You can't come up with subjects like this with TV budgets and a clever director who can't tell the difference between a Lanc I, II and III. All the stupid clich√©s are well in place; On the character and human level, the story is so slim and incredible it hurts. And all those responsible are taken away with joy for the brilliant ratings. Technical details: junk. Lancs flying that neighbor would have kicked each other out of the air. Some rushed night fighters attack line: ridiculous. As I said: drafted by a director I bet, the name Lancaster has never heard before that project and a few 3D guys who turned Lancs into waddling ducks. But these are little things compared to the overall mediocrity of this movie. Although it can be too hard, I dare say it hurt the memory of those who died on both sides. TV crap, entertain the stupid masses who don't mind anyway. Shame on those responsible. Use your brain next time. And enjoy the profit you made from it.
