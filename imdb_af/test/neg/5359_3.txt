Can anyone give me a reason why only one American dies in this movie, and when he does, it's supposed to be a very emotional scene, but when the Operation Delta Force team kills hundreds of Russians in slow motion action scenes or thousands of Arabs, also in slow-motion action scenes, you are supposed to brave and say, "Take it, you non-American monsters!". I know I used a lot of "slow motion action scenes" a lot, but that's because every action scene in this movie is, you guessed it, slow motion. Every last one ... And this group needs to be called "Inflatable Slow-Motion Bullet-Dodging Force", as they seem to have supernatural powers that help them avoid bullets. And if this supernatural power fails, they have a kind of super-power regeneration, which is all they need to kill the complete non-American army standing between them and victory. At this point, no one cares, as they are asleep by another, laughable, slow-motion action scene. This is if they don't laugh aloud at the bad acting, cheesy dialogues and incredible poor story. This is what I did ... The film is made of unfamiliar actors, who will probably remain unknown as they don't even play characters. They just play guys with guns (and can't forget, superpowers) ... The only quality is that the special effects are not surprisingly bad (although they are slow moving) for a TV movie. But it still sucks ... and at the same time it's so bad it's okay ... OK, maybe it could be a bit too repetitive ... <br /> <br /> 25%
