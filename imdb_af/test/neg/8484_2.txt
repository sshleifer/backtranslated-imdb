SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I love movies. I saw a lot of movies. I didn't think I'd ever see a movie I really hated. Son of the Mask destroyed it. Son of the Mask is so bad I'm not even going to do a detailed comment as I usually do. In fact, I'm not even going to write much. I think all of you should know that this movie is terribly dreadful. And poor Jamie Kennedy. He was wonderful in Scream, but now this movie is! Also, this movie takes a SMO-CAN movie and changes it into this goofy children's movie that won't even have children. This film also consists of very rude humor. Like the nostrils. She has a nose for a head and when she sneezes, spray white stuff from her nose. There is also an exorcist parody. Yes, a children's movie has an adult parody. Maybe they thought the adults would love it. Frankly, it made the movie even more cheesier and rough. <br /> <br /> Here's the basic, stupid plan. Tim Avery's dog gets the wonderful Loki mask and turns into a cartoon thing. When Tim pays more attention to the baby with special powers, the spotlight becomes a Wiley Coyote ripoff. Then Loki takes the baby with incredible powers and Tim and Loki have a very mysterious battle. Tim wears the mask. It all ends happy. Too bad this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> Overall, the original Mask was a fantastic Jim Carrey movie. It's basically not. Please, don't rent, buy or download this movie. I made a terrible mistake to rent it. I don't want you to make the same mistake. I feel terrible that I couldn't write a detailed comment, but really, what is there to comment on? <br /> <br /> 2/10 I want to give it one, but come on, it's basically a children's movie. . <br /> <br /> Recommended Movies: The Mask.
