It is a perfect example of the 90's mainstream horror rope. Nothing is scary here and the movie is almost bloodless. Yes, there is some violence, but everything is politically correct as in a TV movie. This is not a very bad picture. can safely say I found it very pleasant. But a lack of originality really hurts "Voodoo". Overall if you are part of the mainstream audience and pseudo-horror movies like "Scream" is your favorite, then you will love "Voodoo", but if you want something very gruesome, avoid this movie.
