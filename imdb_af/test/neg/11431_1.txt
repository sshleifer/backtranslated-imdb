With a humor that would appeal to an exclusive, small audience, the average viewer will find it useless and monotonous. When Cartoon Network advertised this show, it was made to seem like a great drama or event, complete with a real rain scene and government officials trying to catch the sheep. <br /> <br /> When it found The Air, I was disappointed with how all the characters were so one-dimensional and a completely thin animation. The only thing that puts it close to humor was the names of characters such as "Private Public" and "General Specific", some vague references to cultural aspects, and how Lady Richington Sheep pumped with her wig. <Br /> <br /> A bit of the subject but I don't see why Sheep will fall in love with the ball of dirty cotton balls called "Swanky." It was terrible!
