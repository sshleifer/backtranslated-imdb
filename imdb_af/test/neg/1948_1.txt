It's easy for a movie trying to find, just to be uninteresting. This happens everywhere. Not only is Dark Harbor uninteresting, but it is very poorly done. Scene after play is tackled on an otherwise exaggerated condition. An unfortunate couple just pack up an angry stranger to find more trouble. <br /> <br /> Some movies build tension by building the story. Dark harbor adds to the story, but never builds on it. I was hoping, like other movies, that the tension would eventually explode. It never does. Also, the characters have no continuity from scene to scene. They can somehow act in one scene, but then act differently in a different scene. Initially, you think they're just out of character, but eventually you realize they're not characters at all. They are just props for the final spin. The last ten minutes are trying to be shocking. Instead, it is rather lame and uninteresting. The only thing that was shocking to me was that the movie finally ended. In less than ninety minutes, the film still feels too long. <br /> <br /> It's not one of the low-budget gems. It's more like a fake watch that breaks when you take it home.
