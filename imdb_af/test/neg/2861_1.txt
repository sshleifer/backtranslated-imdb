It was really similar to the CHILDREN'S PLAYS except so much worse. A lawyer is trying to rescue a criminal, who was convicted of the death of his son, of execution. She failed. The attorney's daughter then finds a puppet that buried the murderer with his son and was immediately attached to it. Then, after several people were seriously injured, they found the little girl secretly talking to the doll and saying she hadn't hurt anyone. During this movie I asked myself, "Why am I watching this cheeze?" over and over. The end sucked so badly that I immediately followed the Disney cartoon version and slept with the light.
