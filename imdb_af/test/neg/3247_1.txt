A bad assault on viewer senses. It's a mish-mash of various Hindi and English movies - poorly done. It bears the name of a 70-year-old multi star cast, of which the 2002 version also boasts. The story was taken from the 70s "Sunil Dutt / Reena Roy starrer - Nagin" and visual effects taken (a horrible attempt) by The Matrix, Terminator 2 and Mission Impossible II. <br /> <br /> In " a college environment (Sunil Shetty, Akshaye Kumar, Manisha - college kids !!! ???), Manisha Koirala is the victim, who fights a deadly assault on her by two students as a collective effort on the side of our heroes As it turns out, Manisha is a Cobra (Night) snake resurrected as a girl in this life and her partner of past life, now a super-powerful all-and-all-form assumption (Ichadhari Nag ) - Munish Kohli, looking for her in this life. Manisha calls on him to commit her offense and murder. <br /> <br /> So start the crazy death buoy, where the angry lover starts every man singing of the group, with increasing forces and tricks with successive efforts, the effects are extremely cheap, with computer-generated skeletons, morphing The bodies and motorcycle stands that complete the farce. <br /> <br /> Moving from Nagin, Raj Babbar enters a Catholic priest who offers a temporary relief to our sons with a more "religiously correct" multi-religion lock (the original Nagin only has a " To "had". Sunny Deol plays Manisha's love interest in her current life and the ultimate savior against the mighty Munish Kohli. <br /> <br /> Music and songs are below average. <br /> <br /> Avoid if you don't fancy cheap voltage.
