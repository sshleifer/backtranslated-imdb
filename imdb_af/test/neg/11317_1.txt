I saw it with my kids, they love it, but I didn't get a reindeer in the song. But what's crazy about this crappy movie she hit through the sled, it's like the reason why, when my kids sunk, they thought it was good, but we watched it like this "daddy why grandmother "thought how my kids say grandmother, in any way my kids said," daddy, why did grandma hit me with a sledge "I told them the movie is crappy they agreed, it's sad why someone would call a dog "Dofas" that is just stupid and when everyone dressed in black that looks like that, I mean Daphne looks like a dong emo goth girl every one looks like goths and in the song they have grandma on the got land. I think she died in the song, but in this strange crazy movie she was gone. I think they should decrease this performance. Everyone will love it, I'll give it a 1 out of 10
