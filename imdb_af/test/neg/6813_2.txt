After reading the reviews, I decided to rent the DVD version. <br /> <br /> I like classical music and wanted to learn more about Bach. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed. I think I don't know enough about Bach music and the comments were not enough for me to understand the importance or music. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is appropriate with the guidance of an expert in Bach's music that can explain the film. <br /> <br /> I really did try and see the whole movie jumps that I could at least enjoy some of them, but I didn't. <br /> <br /> See it at your own risk.
