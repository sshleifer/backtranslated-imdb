I have no idea why people are so crazy about the show. It's so boring. The jokes aren't even close to what we usually say funny. It's like, Alex says something that is not funny or interesting and then there is suddenly a laughing sound background. My friend and I just looked at each other with a blank look as if we were asking each other, "What's so funny ?!". Seriously, every time we watched that show, you didn't hear any laughs or coughs. Just a shiny look. So we stop watching it. I'm personally a fan of sitcoms, so I tried to watch the show. But it shows us such a disappointment. This show may be one of the worst comedy shows ever ...
