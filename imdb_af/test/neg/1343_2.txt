The women (2008) by Diane English are unfortunately such a waste of talent. With Annette Benning, Candice Bergen, Bette Midler, Cloris Leachman, who I enjoy and enjoy in everything I saw them, and Meg Ryan, Jada Pinkett Smith, Debra Messing and Eva Mendes who may not be my favorite actors, but it's nice to see how the movie can be boring, predictable, embarrassing, messy and just bad? Created by Diane English, the author of the highly successful TV show Murphy Brown, it is her first film for which she has written a screenplay. The film is a loving love for English that has been trying to make it happen for years and I respect it. I even found the screens with supporting players, Bergen, Leechaman, Carry Fisher and Bette Middler in short but memorable cameos, funny, clever and enjoyable, but in general the movie is a second hand, "Sex and the City "months ago. I didn't find Sex and the City very good when I saw it, but next to the women, it was simply brilliant. Six and the City at least saved us the long and tasteless scene in the hospital's delivery room. One of the characters had a baby and her friends were there to support her. Poor Debra Messing, what did she do to earn that nightmare she worked through and us, the viewers with her? The movies like "The Women" give the whole genre, chick flicks, a bad name. This is nothing wrong with the genre, but why is it so difficult to make a very good comedy about female friendships and hardships, dealing with marriage, motherhood, and proving yourself professional? These are all very compelling and important subjects to which a modern woman can connect. Why make movies with the lines, dialogues and situations so clickable, predictable, not funny and insulting that they will be forgotten once the movie is over? <br /> <br /> After watching the new movie, I checked From my local library, the original The Women and I really enjoyed it. The story was much better told 70 years ago and kept my interest throughout. The old movie had a real strength.
