Recently I saw Shame, directed by Ingmar Bergman. The film was interesting and very unique. I liked how it was in Swedish with English subtitles and that it was also in black and white. These features made me better connected with the characters, the period and their stories. I didn't like how the movie was very slow in the beginning and how you didn't know what was really going on. Initially, it was mainly a story of Eva and Jan's relationship. The movie also ended on a very depressing note because nothing came out of all the conflicts and changed throughout the movie. I probably won't see Shame again, but it was a very cultured experience.
