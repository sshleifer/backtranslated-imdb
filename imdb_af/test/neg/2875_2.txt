I really like Salman Kahn, so I was really disappointed when I saw this movie. It didn't have much of a plot and what they had was not so attractive. However, Salman looked good in the movie looking young and refreshed, but the price of this DVD was worth it. The music wasn't bad, it was quite nice. Usually Indian movies are at least two to three hours long, but it was a very short movie for an Indian movie. The American actress who played in the movie is from the television series Helde, Ali Larter. Her play had a lot to be desired. However, she looked closely at the Indian dresses she wore. All the movie didn't have much to do and I hope Salman will do much better on his next film. Thank you.
