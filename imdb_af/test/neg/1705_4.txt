Apart from the appearance of the talented Austin Powers impersonator Richard Halpern, this photo was your run of the mill movie spoof. Dated movie references will not help audiences who will come to this end in the future. Look for the "groovy" Austin powers in the whirlpool. It's a dot and a half. <br /> <br /> Poor special effects are overcome by the appearance of many stars in skimpy outfits. It should be at least one entertainment (if it excites you). <br /> <br /> For my money, I would rent the DVD of classic spoofs like "Airplane" or "Lobster Man from Mars".
