I recently went to a free soap girl screening where the filmmakers were present. before the film they jumped around, laughed and took pictures. I was excited to see how they were dressed in real life, and couldn't wait to see the movie on the big screen. <br /> <br /> During the movie, the audience laughed. It was clear to me that they were not laughing at the photo, but on the photo. it is purely a grade B movie without logic behind it. throw some nudity, some blood and whala! you have a movie! <br /> <br /> After the movie I approached a lot of filmmakers and asked why they wanted to make this movie. They all acted so seriously, as they were serious filmmakers. they each told me something else: to make a controversial movie, a funny movie, an uplifting movie, a socially responsible movie. everyone mentioned something else. It was clear to me that none of the filmmakers knew what kind of movie they were making, and they tried to recover their money by disclosing this movie, in any way they could get to see people. <br /> <br /> Let me warn you: Don't buy in the hype! Unless you have nothing else to do, it might be worthwhile to take a film student's time to study how a movie shouldn't be made. Otherwise it is better to save two hours of your life.
