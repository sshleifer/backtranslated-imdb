The new WEAPON, which serves as the basis for this horrible piece of garbage, is one of the best techno thrillers to get into the pantry long ago. The character of SOLO, which is NOT supposed to look like a human, is a wonderful creation and it was just awful to see him diminishing to just another Terminator clone with Mario Van Peebles, who was terribly trying to act like a robot. There is nothing valuable about this movie. <br /> <br /> Why does Hollywood insist on improving the rights to excellent novels and then slaughtering them? There are so many things wrong with SOLO that it is so unfair to invite such a man who offers no legs to a fast-paced Hopscotch game. Avoid this horrible movie and search the 2 novels by ROBERT MASON that contains the wonderful character of SOLO. The books are WEAPON and an excellent sequel SOLO. But don't pay attention to this horrible drink from a movie.
