I saw this movie on a flight from Paris to Boston and it reminded me of the food on the plane: generic, tasteless and unclear. The French play now seems lost and this is a good example of how a motley disk can spill brilliant actors. While some may find the "playfulness" of the text in line with the prescriptions of Euro-postmodernism, the whole project looks more like a post-mortem on the death of the golden years of the Euro Theater and truly fantastic talents - - One is vaguely reminded of Bunuel, but without the charm or white.
