By far, this is the worst Halloween movie ever made. The acting is bad, except for Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasence. The girl Kara played (forgot her name) was ok, but overall this movie was basically a big fall. Nothing brought the story forward, it didn't have anything, and the horrors that made Halloween and H20 so good. Everyone and everyone, skip this movie, it's not worth the price of rent.
