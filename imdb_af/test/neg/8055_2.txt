This movie has too many things going on. Another reviewer commented on the deviant episodic nature of the film reflecting the director's memories - that is good, if that is how it was written and executed. Instead, what we get is straight ahead - some of the time - jumping, over and over again, in some cases, interrupting the flow with unnecessary deviations in other cases, otherwise it simply doesn't work. <br /> <br /> There are also some plot details that just don't work. For example, why does a body move to a beach in an urban area in broad daylight, as opposed to night time? Why leave your flat skin on the body? Why would an artist who knows the Joe character for a short time decide to leave him "everything" (even if it wasn't much)? This subplot was poorly developed to make that point. For the case, why is the man even an invalid or another artist than offering the money and free descendants? He could just as easily have been a photographer, or an opera composer? Anyway, how does someone determine an apartment in an Opera House - especially without a clear connection to the Opera? The coincidences are also too clear and unclear and inexplicable. Why would the guys take everything in the warehouse and "disappear." If Tim was a 10-year-old schoolmate in a town as small as Bangor, how could Joe turn away from him for 8 years, especially if they knew each other well that they would recommend the others for a job. <br /> <br /> Some of the other subplots (like the mother and her boyfriend (s) and the sister who want to escape felt like padding. There are some good ideas that might be a feature with full development) Could have been or could have been interesting shorts As finished, this movie has little sense and even offers less.
