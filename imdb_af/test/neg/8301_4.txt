Although I watched Italian TV this time around, I saw a surprisingly tolerable pot boiler this time, thrown by an international cast of familiar faces (including a confused Joseph Cotten as the Baron) and unlike many other film from the Euro-Cult subgenre, an incident mandatory plot rather than louverish pacing. <br /> <br /> The creature itself seems a bit dodgy and Cotten is a bit too old to take seriously as an avid scientist who is still dazed to create life forms from corpses (one might think he would now have made himself an army of them and not struggling to complete his technique yet, but Mrs. Neri looks good in and out of costume and trustworthy Herbert Fux is probably best suited as a nice tomb robber / extortionist.
