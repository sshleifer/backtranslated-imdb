For me, this movie was a disappointment. Somehow, I expected this to be the reason for Gen. Rommel's popularity and success as a military strategist in WW II will explain. But there is nothing about it, it's about the last year or two of his life and trying to burn him in some way. So I just have to think that Rommel was primarily an amoral and apolitical technocrat in the conquering and killing business, without any particular charm or notorious behavior. Such real people just don't make good movie material. I almost feel sorry for James Mason, really one of my favorite actors, who had to personalize a beautiful wood character. Actually, a good director and very good actors were messed up on this movie? with the exception of Luther Adler who gives a very unforgettable and strange natural portrayal of Adolf Hitler. <br /> <br /> There may also be a cultural problem for people like me who are part of the German speaking world. Famous British actors who personalize Germans are just not credible. For example, rubbish is not only considered a German but a typical southern Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. Immediately think of a certain dialect, a certain kind of white, a certain way to see the world (the totally opposite of, for example, a Prussian junker). I also think there are mixed feelings about the murder attempt July 20. Many of those who were in the conspiracy were not democratic and just wanted German troops to join the Western allies in the Bolshevik survival.) <br /> <br /> The best film depiction of an intellectual, intelligent military spirit is, according to me, still Patton (1970). By the way, General Patton can be seen in the extended documentary footage for this movie, a low angle shot while passing vehicles. The open holster and the revolver with the pearl grip are clearly visible!
