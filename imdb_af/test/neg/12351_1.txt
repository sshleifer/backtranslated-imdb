I saw it in a preview show and have to say that this documentary style movie is the biggest point I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Totally unfriendly, low budget, boring, rubbish, terrible play. the whole audience (young and old) sat down through the film without laughing most of it. There were literally just about 2 places you would laugh in the whole movie. Many people walked halfway. I don't blame them ... I kept thinking the movie would pick up, but it never did and I wish I would be gone. <br /> <br /> The humor was really lame and I am surprised that it ever made it on the big screen. I'm not someone who offends the adult content of this movie. It's just not funny. The people who made this movie really don't deserve your money, so don't pay to see this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not even funny enough to show on television, let alone the cinema. .. <br /> <br /> I wanted to give it 0 out of 10, but the system won't allow it ...
