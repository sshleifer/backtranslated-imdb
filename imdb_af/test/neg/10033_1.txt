Thanks, I didn't buy this movie myself! I borrowed it from a friend who bought it out of sheer curiosity and, of course, after watching it, felt they had to be compensated! It must be one of the worse movies I've ever seen! I realize they couldn't have had much of a budget, but I swear I could make a better movie if it stared at my pets! The acting was terrible, so was the editing, the dialogue, EVERYTHING! It was so bad it made me seriously angry as I watched it! I'm looking forward to the REAL movie about this story coming soon so people who are curious don't have to bend over to watch this joke!
