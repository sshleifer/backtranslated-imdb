... with a $ 500 budget and a bottle of ketchup. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of C-movies with no talented actors at all, a ridiculous story, cheap effects and bad camera work, this movie is delivering. <br /> <br /> All others are warned. You can probably make a similar movie with a few friends in your backyard and a home camcorder. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is good for some laughs. Keep it up with some friends and discuss how NOT to make a movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10 for unintentional comedy. <br /> <br /> Why should you write 10 lines? I saw comments with fewer lines and writing this is just a lame filler.
