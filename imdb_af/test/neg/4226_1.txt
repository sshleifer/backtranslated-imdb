L'Humanite is a murder mystery. These movies tend to be popular, <br /> <br /> and the 6.9 rating it currently predicts was also. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie has no reasoning at all. /> <br /> A few non-spoilers, for example, include a 5-minute scene <br /> <br /> where the main character eats an apple. And another 3 minutes <br /> <br /> where he breathes. <br /> <br /> If you're wondering, it's not really art. It is also not a <br /> <br /> comment on humanity, which of the title it seems is that it is trying <br /> <br />. It's actually boring. There are numerous efforts in this <br /> <br /> movie to say something about humanity. One might think <br /> <br />: "How will I comment on humanity?" And most <br /> <br /> obvious and boring answers will of course be sex, love and death. <br /> <br /> Not that these options are uninteresting when done well. <br /> <br /> They are the canonical options. For sex, make this movie the best to <br /> <br /> make it unattractive and disgusting. In your first five minutes - <br /> <br /> so it's not a spoiler - you'll see the bloody vagina of a murdered 11-year-old girl; It's a murder mystery, remember? Later <br /> <br />, a few people throw themselves at each other and have what the director wants us to believe is "raw" sex, but in reality it is <br /> confronted and too symbolic - but even worse, uninteresting. <br /> <br /> I enjoy being disturbed by movies. This movie showed me why: <br /> <br /> Disturbance of movies usually shows something inside someone, <br /> <br /> their humanity, which they didn't know, exists and is a little <br /> <br /> afraid of. L'Humanit√© tried to do just that and failed, and I went <br /> <br /> out of the theater, not disturbed, but disgusting, I thought <br /> <br /> my time the theater wasted, despite the movie being <br /> <br /> seen for free.
