I saw it on Sci Fi, and in retrospect I'm not sure how I could really do it. It's totally trash. It's not a B movie, it is indeed a D movie. <br /> <br /> Basically, this grim reaper looking at a horse (and sometimes not at one) will kill everything in its path somewhere in the middle-west. of America. A load of people missing (carelessly murdered) and a lot of mismatched spec on soldier types are looking for them. The best part of this movie, I'll tell you now, there are some very cute girls. Let me spoil it now by saying that everyone but the least cute one either cut off their heads, cut them together, or beat them so hard with a fleece weapon that explodes their heads. It's not a spoiler. The gore in this movie is over and really grotesque. It's not a real goal either. <br /> <br /> Here's what's good: The sets look OK, the actors sometimes act well. The outfits and props, some of them, are decent. <br /> <br /> All you can think of, suck. Much of the bad is in editing. Sometimes it just changes from a fast-paced action scene to a real quiet and dormant scene. Sometimes the characters do incomprehensible things, and they always break up, but not even in a way that the viewer can follow. They seem to be divided without realizing it among themselves, but they also seem to know they have been split all the time and it's good with them, even in a very dangerous situation and there are bodies everywhere and people die right and left. Nothing in this movie is the least credible, most of it is incoherent and confusing, and I really can't find out how this immortal, indestructible bad guy could eventually be stopped. Honestly, I don't care. . Too much dumb, hilariously bathing nonsense happens during this movie and I don't really list it all here. And they are all so right throughout the trial if it's almost legally bad ... just awful. <br /> <br /> This movie is a total waste of time. There is no excuse to watch it unless the only channel you receive is SciFi and you are stuck to a chair in front of the TV. But if you're not bound, you're better off doing a crossword puzzle, throwing a Frisbee, or even just thinking. There are much better B-movies you can see. <br /> <br /> My senior year in high school, my friend and I, in visual communication and leaving class, made a long movie car deal for our own movie (There was no full movie, just a very long trailer) and we have a better work of filming and editing the piece with premiere. It was better work than this movie. It really says something about this and I'm amazed at how Sci Fi will show something like that if there are so many good low-movie movies they can show. <br /> <br /> The only movie I "ever endured that was worse if it's Raptor Island (another brilliant Science work), though it smoother and more persistent than this movie has, but it comes very close and is definitely 2nd on my list of the worst movies I've ever seen. .
