It was shown on a premium channel, so I didn't realize it was made for TV. Still, I enjoy the movies of the lifetime (Lifestyle here in the UK), but it was terrible. The family was so cheesy, "Love your mom." "Love you even more honey." When they broke in for the second time, 10 minutes later, they were back on it, "Love your mother," great cute smiles. She called her husband and said he shouldn't go home. They were just broken in by a guy who wanted them dead, a utility farmer had next door, who needed help? She had her teenage daughter and a cat (not too long) to look at her. <br /> <br /> But as a comedy, I want to give it good. I can even show it to my friends. I have time around them. Can be fun after a bottle of Vodka or 10!
