I'm a massive fan of prison dramas that are reflected in OZ's favorite American TV show. I think the appeal lies in a kind of smug voyeurism to see that bad things happen to people's bottoms, but I found Don Siegel's ROT IN CELL BLOCK 11 to be disappointing. Okay, I knew since it was made in 1954, it would not be a bad language, graphic scam and gang rape, yet it is a rather poor movie compared to jail depiction in earlier movies such as EVERY DAWN I WHITE AND WHITE. The problem lies in the preaching of the movie with the riot leader Dunn who is a reformer reform. Yes, it sounds ridiculous, as he is a violent hero, rather than a limp joints that are on a salary, but that is what he is essentially. He wants prisoners to be rehabilitated to return to society rather than to suffer. There is also a problem making a B-movie with such radical themes. (Very ironic that Siegel would later make DIRTY HARRY where the only good criminal is dead) and that is the throw is not very good with Emile Meyer if the observer is particularly annoying in his performance. as I said a disappointing movie
