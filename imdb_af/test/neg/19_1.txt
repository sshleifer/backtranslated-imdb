This movie can't be serious, because it has a nerdy child, called Curtis, who kills people. The other two psycho-children are cute, but the Curtis child is just as ugly because he wears this big, brown, ugly glass. The actor probably threw the wrong set and he was really supposed to go to the Nerds revenge. <br /> <br /> Another thing I hate so much about this movie is that Curtis shoots his lovely time shooting people. I held my finger on the fast forward button because he took too long and what had his voice? He sounded like he was fourteen and not ten. Another thing I hated was that he kept smiling like an idiot, and there was nothing about it. <br /> <br /> Then they put that annoying child in the freezer and somehow found a flashlight in it. It didn't make sense and neither did the music. The music didn't match any of the screens. <br /> <br /> This movie is slow, boring and a waste of time. Watch another movie on your birthday.
