A handful of young college college sisters decide to go camping with a professor. A giant druid wants to sacrifice them to prevent the apocalypse from reaching the year 2000. They also have to argue with bikers, an Indian and a Loch Ness monster type thing. Worth watching for only 3 reasons, George 'Buck' Flower (an unfortunate unpopular B-movie staple), is an oboe and the other 2 belong to the beautiful Savannah (in one of only 3 non-porn roles she had). Both have very small roles. Badly everything else in the movie is terribly bad. <br /> <br /> My Degree: D- <br /> <br /> Retromedia DVD Extras: Original Trailer <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: 4 Pairs of Breasts, 2 Asses
