Watching "Baghban" is the film that is like eating one's way out of a barrel of salt water for up to three hours. This Indian movie is a tough sweet, sentimental soap opera that begins like 'King Lear', moves to Romeo and Juliet in the middle section and then back to 'King Lear' for its tear-off finals. <br /> Raj Malhotra is a bank accountant who sees everything one could possibly have from life: a woman who loves him, a family who loves him and a job from where he retires a lifetime of faithful service. Although Raj and his wife, Pooja, have been married for 40 years and have four sons, they still cherished and sucked some love that hit newlyweds, whispered their eyes and whispered whispering in each other's ears. almost to the point of nausea. In fact, the whole bloody bread is so happy, loving and harmonious that they look like the Von Trapps compared to a dysfunctional family. The parents and kids joke together, laugh together, even perform choreographic, "spontaneous" song and dance numbers (like many Bollywood productions, "Baghban" is a rambling drama - in this case a large number of musical sequences). <br /> <br /> Anyone who knows anything about storytelling is aware that such an unforgiving happiness cannot be punished for a long time, and that all that joy is merely predicting a terrible disaster destined for fall on the heads of our unsuspecting revelers. Knowing this, we spend the first hour of the film in terrible expectation, and just wonder what form that disaster will take when it finally comes. The thunderbolt takes place in the film about an hour, when Raj informed his children that he and their mother decided to go in with one of their families. The choice of one is for the children and their respective spouses. Suddenly, like King Lear, who hid the vipers in the family bosom, Raj finds out that his children are not so fond of being unselfish and eager to share their homes and live with their parents as they originally thought. Mentally awful at the prospect, the kids, to obscure their parents' plan, come up with a scheme in which Raj will live with one of their children while Pooja will stay with another; then they will switch off until eventually each of the children has had a chance to offer both parents and then the cycle will repeat repeatedly. Many of the children's chagrinism, the parents add to the plan, even though the two are deeply in love with each other and they never put time apart. So, the second and most of the third hour is spent on the two aging (though married) loved ones hiding one another, while their ungrateful, insensitive little brats do everything in their power to understand their parents how unwelcome they are in their homes. <br /> <br /> One of the big problems with "Baghban" is that it is not subtle in both its storytelling and direction. The love that Ray and Pooja feel for each other, as well as the almost greedy proximity to the family unit, is so heavily laid in the first hour that the film collapses almost under the weight of sentimentality. Then, virtually without warning, turn the screenplay on a dime and turn the kids into reckless, self-centered monsters and the parents in passive, shining victims of that recklessness. Raj and Pooja are a little too long in the tooth and a bit too self-reliant to do the dream-lined, pouting, unanswered love bit, more suitable for darling school children than the parents of four grown children. The press prose style, in which every emotion is highlighted and highlighted, leads to intense persecution and a strong confidence in wheat reactions and melodramatic punctuation music. The music numbers initially carry some satisfying joy, but they go on for so long and change so often that they lose their effectiveness quickly and only serve to exchange the material with unspeakable relationships. At least a full hour can be excised from this inflated production without any noticeable damage - and quite well. There really is no reason why this movie should be dragged for a three-hour penalty. The most ominous of all is the seemingly endless harangue that we end up with, a speech in which Raj (who somehow managed to change his experiences in an award-winning bestseller) tells us all about the truths. of parent / child relationships for at least ten straight minutes. <br /> <br /> "Baghban" is a juicy, wheat-like saga, filled with more sugar and goo than a seafood's chocolate. Example at your own risk.
