Well, that was at least the last successor I could get at Blockbuster, because this movie was just horrible. I mean, I can understand how difficult it will be to get rid of an evil house. We speak at the beginning of a terrible fire, bulldozing, flooding, etc. But a mirror? How difficult can it be to get rid of a mirror? It was the most horrible movie that could put the title of Amityville in the picture! <br /> <br /> Well, a group of friends who are a lot from the beginning are a lot of freaks. One of them is a photographer of some kind and buys a ghost mirror from a homeless creepy man, teaches me a valuable lesson, doesn't buy things from homeless, rogue guy. Of course, the horrible deaths and chaos occur to this group, although I can't imagine anyone missing them. <br /> <br /> Please, hit Amityville: A new generation, I already have a few complaints about my generation, so I think it was a foreman. Not so crazy. : P But believe me, it's been terribly acted out, not well thought out, and not even scary! I feel so bad for the original writers of The Amityville Horror, they have to cry every time someone sees this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10
