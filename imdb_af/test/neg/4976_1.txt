In vain, Clint Eastwoods pay tribute to the once great west. But while I thought it would be good and the bar increased for future westerners to come, I was unfortunately wrong. Unforgiving, though simply plotted, it falls flat on characters and emotions and I will say that Unforgiven Eastwood's worst movie is to date. Eastwoods seems to be too old to play the role of play and directing, which also contributed to a decrease in the overall appearance of the movie. <br /> <br /> All the characters look like a while over the edges, especially Eastwood's character. The acting doesn't seem to flow and adds to what the characters feel. The direction was poorly deceived by impressive shots. So overall Unforgiven is not Eastwoods the best and by far one of the worst westerners.
