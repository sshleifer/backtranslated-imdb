This is a very interesting introduction! "Duplicate stories" contain three foolish and childish episodes. Genre is not really horror or action, more like something in between. Where is the suspension? Where's the fun? Where is the common sense? Certainly not here, but if you don't expect to get it, you don't necessarily miss it. <br /> <br /> The first segment is called "Showdown". It's a violent, absurd western. I didn't understand the whole idea of ​​it. "King of the Road" is a stupid story with Brad Pitt. By the time of "Two Fist Numbers" he was just a pretty face that really didn't know how to act. Fortunately, he later learned the skill and now he is a fantastic, talented actor - one of the greatest of the younger generation. Story is almost ok, it's foolish. Final Episode "Yellow" is the only segment that is almost entirely successful. It's silly but funny. We must thank Kirk Douglas for this. <br /> <br /> This movie is something to watch when you sit in an easy chair and eat popcorn. (I need to know, that's what I did). If you loved "Tales from the Crypt", you'll also love "Two-Fist" because it's basically the same. I understand these three episodes are actually extremely rare "piece of art" and very difficult to find anywhere. I have the whole package on VHS, but I don't think it's a great privilege. You have to be a fanatical Brad Pitt fan to figure it out. Otherwise, it doesn't bother, it's not worth it. Silly crap.
