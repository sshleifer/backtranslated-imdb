Okay, so maybe the play was not bad, but I am writing this review as a public service to prevent someone else on the plot starting this phone call, throwing away two hours of their lives waiting for a plot development that will never come. The chief investigator had a feeling that had been done away with the missing marine officer (Guy), and few people, besides uninvolved bystanders and the accused, disputed her. So what's the point of staying with this drama? Knock out the shit out of me. I thought (or hoped) there would be some kind of plotwending or new revelation, but there was nothing before. In summary, I can't think of a single reason to sit and watch this senseless TV movie or a real story.
