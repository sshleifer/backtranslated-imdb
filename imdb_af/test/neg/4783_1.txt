I saw this movie with very low expectations. I didn't know much about it, so I wasn't sure it would be worth it. <br /> <br /> The story has done a great job making you curious about these ruins they are traveling to. The tension continues when the Mayans arrive and force them to stay at the ruins. <br /> <br /> Then the movie becomes a bit exciting to useless. The amount of gore found in this movie has not been balanced compared to whether it was really needed or used more for shock value. <br /> <br /> The fact that they didn't make the effort to fight the vineyards from hell. They had fire and didn't try to burn it. They also didn't try to cut it with a knife to see if they could destroy it or not. They quickly jumped into a victim's roll and their helplessness wasn't really. It reminds me of the old horror movies where people just shout and shout and don't have half a brain to fight back.
