Foolish comedy throws an embarrassed Ray Milland as a British officer in World War II. Europe escapes German borders and embarks on a man-hungry gypsy woman, played by Marlene Dietrich. Slow, long, and flawed: the lead is too old for this kind of feed, although Marlene shines in her solo moments. It took three screenwriters to adapt Yolanda Foldes' book for the screen, but this material had to be dated in 1947. It seems that something Ernst Lubitsch turned out in 1939. The scenario is stale, and the stars have absolutely no chemistry together. ** of ****
