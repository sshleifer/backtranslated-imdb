If I were to post this movie thought to a few Hollywood bigwigs, it would sound like this: <br /> <br /> ME: "Four boys at a private high school are good friends, and they're witches." <br /> <br /> Hollywood: "It sounds like" The Craft. "<br /> <br /> ME:" No, no, I said four boys, not four girls. "<br /> Hollywood: "It still sounds like" The Craft ", just with boys instead of girls." <br /> <br /> ME: "OK, but there is this fifth unknown boy in the picture come and he wants more power. "<br /> <br /> Hollywood:" Not much difference, because one of the girls in "The Craft" also wanted more power. <br /> <br /> ME: "OK, OK ... I'll make these boys part of the" crowd ", they'll be rich, and the school is on the east coast. <br /> <br / > Hollywood: "Now it sounds original. It's nothing like 'The Craft', here's a billion dollars. "<br /> <br /> This movie was so clich√© and uninspiring. Even the crafty drama between Chase and Ipswich's brothers was a blast. Children, with their biggest problem, what color Bentley wants for their 18th birthday ( and 18th car), don't mind me, even if they have powers. Every child in this movie looks like they came out of a magazine, and of course there was the free male nudity and female 80% nudity just to go home I wanted to rename this movie "The Witches of OC." Oooh, rich kids and their problems. Let me pretend to care. <br /> <br /> This movie was totally unattractive and predictable The final battle was paralyzed and the end was very anti-climate, which was a movie that was left on the cutting room.
