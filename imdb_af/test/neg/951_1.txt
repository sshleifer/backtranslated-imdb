Since this display of TSS (the screen savers) has been changed to AOTS (attack of the show), it has gone hill. TSS with Yoshi and Kevin Rose Alex ... etc. Make the show wonderful, then fired for an unknown reason from TSS. When the show switched to AOTS, it got less about computers, and more about games and magazines. It also promoted ties that no one had heard or cared for. Eventually I couldn't see if Kevin Rose was gone. He kept it interesting, but he went to do his own thing, which is good. Kevin Rose now has several online podcasts, and shows, etc. On the REV 3 network. Look at that. REV3.com I think, you can get it by going to www.systm.org. If you want a real technology program, rather than watch it, check if Kevin Roses shows or listens to the White Podcast. <br /> <br /> J <
