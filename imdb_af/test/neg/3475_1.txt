What a disaster! Normally, if one criticizes a historical movie, it is always nice to show the inaccuracies that come in, usually added by the authors to create more "dramatic" situations. However, "Empire: Nerone" is an entirely different kind of animal. In this movie, you find something that is confirmed by the historical record amid the burden of nonsense and fiction presented as the life of Rome's bad-boy-artist-emperor. And it is a pity, because Nero is one of the most fascinating of all the Roman emperors. His life was full of turbulent events and interesting people to make a very good movie. The manufacturers of this mess have chosen a different route, which only leads to the scratching of any informed viewer. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: <br /> <br /> 1. Nero is portrayed as a 6-8 year old boy, when Caligula killed his father for betrayal, his mother, Agrippina, leave, and send the boy through slaves in the countryside. "Ten years later," the story resumed just before Caligula's murder. Facts: Nero was born about six months after Caligula started his four-year government and was only three when he was killed; Nero's father died of natural causes; Agrippina was briefly banned for bad behavior, not betrayal; and Nero was not raised among slaves, but had the typical education of a young member of the imperial family. <br /> <br /> 2. Okay, according to the authors, Nero is about 16 when his uncle Claudius becomes emperor (he actually turns 4); Agrippina engineers ruin the emperor Messalina and marry Claudius, who assumes Nero. Then he goes out to conquer Britain and is soon poisoned by Agrippina after his victory. Nero is declared emperor, although he is still only 18 or 19 years old. Fact: Claudius Britain in 43 A.D. conquered, two years after he began his government. He lived until 54 AD. Nero then had to be 31 years of age by any normal chronology, but actually passed the throne at age 16. <br /> <br /> History tells us that there was then the "Five Good Years," where Nero sensibly and well responded under the supervision of philosopher Seneca and the Praetorian commander Burrus. It is shown - kind of - except that Roman Senate is portrayed as being Nero's good measures inconsistent. Senatorial opposition to Nero first began when he began showing signs of insanity and killing Senators for real or imaginary betrayal. <br /> <br /> 3. Nero's mother Agrippina is the controlling species, who killed her uncle to make her son emperor. After a while Nero strapped her and decided to kill her. In the movie he sends his henchman Tigellinus to stab her death. All true enough, but the reality was so much better! Agrippina was a survivor and did not go easy. Nero tried to poison her three times, but as an old poison herself, she did everything, and he failed. Then he tried to kill her, falling into the ceiling of her bedroom, but it also failed. Then he sent her on a ship on a ship deliberately built to fall apart and sink; As it went down, she jumped into the sea and swam to the beach. Eventually he stabbed her to death. Now show all that this movie has definitely improved! <br /> <br /> Other errors are abundant: Nero's lover Acte was not a kid slave friend, she never denied him, and there is no evidence that she has become a Christian. Nero did not commit suicide by cutting his wrists while sitting next to a lake. Etc. Etc. <br /> <br /> The sources for Nero's life are mainly Roman historians Tacitus and Suetonius, who were both hostile to him and his memory. But the evidence suggests that he remained very popular with ordinary people, unlike one of the final scenes where he was peeled by the gang with vegetables, as he left the city to commit suicide. WHY did the authors and producers take an inherently interesting story with lots of good stuff for any movie, and crap this piece? Oh, and did I mention how cute the sets and costumes were? Lol. <br /> <br /> One star because there is no way to lower it.
