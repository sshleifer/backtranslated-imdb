A "40 foot" giant mutant squid with five tentacles, razor and the ability to reproduce its own cells, terrorizes a small town in Florida. Several marine biologists, doctors and police plan to kill them. Meanwhile, a human monster called Miller offs people who discovered the "Devilfish" is a man-made creation used for the greedy advantage of some evil doctors! Miller attacks a female researcher, strangles her, drowns her in the bath, throws her in a hair dryer and rips the underpants from her dead body! <br /> <br /> Many false alarms are set when our heroes Peter, Stella, Janet and Bob have a high technology (high technology for 1984, anyway) a "Seaquarium" boat to catch, which is often seen in the close-up or hilariously obviously speeded-up movie to look more threatening. And just the fire can destroy it, leading to a flammer-armed post against the aquatic cattle finals. <br /> <br /> This JAWS collection is pretty tame (except a legless look and a decade) but looks and benefits from an excellent Antony Barrymore score and a decent (again, for 1984) monster design. Luigi Cozzi and Sergio Martino wrote the original story. <br /> <br /> Score: 4 out of 10
