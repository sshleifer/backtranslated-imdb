Breaking Dawn, in a California college like Professor Simon (co-producer Joe Morton), tells his students to do an intensive six-week study of a mental patient in the Cape Hospital as an important part of their education , they fail and they will never become qualified doctors. A bright, young, attractive and intelligent student named Eva (Kelly Overton) gets a particularly difficult patient to study. His name is Don Wake (James Haven) and is a convicted killer. He was found in blood outside the dead body of a woman (Diane Verona) and her young daughter (Jenette McCurdy). Don won't even look at Eve, but talk to her less, but like the trooper, she's Eve trying to figure him out. Eventually, Don starts talking, but what he says Eva scares Eva, he says someone looks at her and calls the name Malachay. Eva begins to see a dark shadow on her, as Don clarifies the conspiracy theories and bizarre statements. Eva slowly loses her mind, as the line between fantasy and reality is becoming increasingly blurred. Is there anything more about the supposed nonsense that Don is talking about than being the bad ravages of a psychiatric patient? <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Mark Edwin Robinson I have nothing but negative feelings about Breaking Dawn. Now, we all like a good twist, the kind of end that we firmly catch, surprise us, work well with the rest of the movie and stay in our memory like the cool-running ends at The Sixth Sense (1999) & Fight Club (1999) to name just two good examples and, to a lesser extent, the ends of films such as Scream (1996) where the identity of the killer comes a good surprise and it is not so obvious. Then there are, of course, films whose ends spoil everything that has gone before. As an example we can do, oh I don't know, we can say Breaking Dawn, because I've never seen such a terrible end to a movie. Breaking Dawn begins as a decent psychological horror thriller with ghostly things happening to Eve. This is not the most action-packed movie ever by any imagination, but it holds the interest, but it is not the most absorbing film ever, but it is more than vigilant and it is not as bad a movie to the quarrel not, I still have to mention it, because everything that until then (which is right to justify it) suddenly becomes irrelevant. I'm sure there are people out there who think they have this bruised mess of an ending that has come to the smallest. All I can say is that no one can explain this thing satisfactorily to me and so far. As I worry, it doesn't make sense and never will. Breaking Dawn is shit and it's a waste of time to look at it to be rewarded with the lamest ending in film history. It's as simple and straight as it is. <br /> <br /> Director Robinson doesn't make half a mess of what could have been a decent excitement, maybe he thought what he had shot would play well, or maybe it's in the room of destruction ruined, but I think it was more likely to get a rubbish because he was trying to tie all the absurdities. together within the space of a few confused minutes and give us all a happier than happy final shot. He builds the tension pretty well during the first 80 minutes, but that's all for nothing at the end of the day. <br /> <br /> Technically Breaking Dawn is good and is generally well made throughout. The play is pretty good, Overton is nice and easy on the eye and puts a decent performance. Was it just me or the man who played Don, like John Morghen's star of such Italian sleaze classics such as Cannibal Apocalypse (1980), City of the Living Dead (1980), The House on the Edge of the Park (1980) ), Kannibal Ferox (1981), Stage Fright (1987) & The Church (1989)? OK, maybe it was just me ... <br /> <br /> Breaking Dawn is junk, I hate it all because of the last few minutes. Don't get me wrong, it didn't make me so excited, but it was OK. Definitely one to avoid as far as I'm concerned, although it seems to be a fair share of positive comments on the IMDb ...
