A woman who works in art starts with a passionate love affair with a man named John. They make love wherever they go and they play sexual games. The problem I had was that it was all they did. There was no plot for this movie, or I just didn't see it. The hot erotic passion was the best of this movie, but I wanted something else to happen. Maybe he could have been a serial killer or she could have had a secret. I just needed something and everything there was was a lot of love to make scenes. Not that it's bad or anything, I just wanted to do more things in the movie. Perhaps a colleague also slept with him. Anything! I was very upset that it was all there was. Mickey Rourke was so hot again. I wonder what happened.
