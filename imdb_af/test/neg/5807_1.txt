Honestly, this could be the worst movie I've ever seen. And I saw Spider Baby, not this earth. Heck I even saw 200 motels. Having recently discovered the Freaks and Geeks series and was amazed at Linda Cardellini's acting ability, I chose the reviews here and decided it was worth it. This is the last time I will ever rely on a review at IMDb. I didn't realize MORONS writing IMDb reviews while waiting for their calls to be answered on AM radio. <br /> <br /> This movie is so far above bad that mere words cannot express the misery of its vomit state. Seriously. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you think Will Farrel is really really funny, if you think Adam Sandler is a comic genius. Look at this movie, but DO NOT WIDE!
