From the second the music swore (the second one from the movie) and it was a movie hack tripe, I knew I was for a very long drive. Horrendously clich√©d - (I laughed a lot and knew how the plot ended well before the end). They didn't use Louisbourg in particular, and the costume and hair were so terrible. (My particular favorite makeup moment is that the only way they endure Depardieu age was to place a straight hair wig on him instead of wavy). I can long ago talk about the ridiculous disability of the music - the movie can be greatly improved by an 18th-century score. <br /> <br /> (ETA: AH, it's the horrible movie maker Patrick Doyle who is responsible for the score - say no More! He should NOT be allowed near historic movies - he has to be at the 20th century institutions. <br /> <br /> The "visit to the significant human section" was also hilarious, especially his little visit to Madame Pompadour, which was not particularly convincingly played. <br /> <br /> I thought the only actor based in the centuries was Michael Maloney as James Murray. He absolutely stole the show for 30 seconds that he was on the screen. Tragically he showed you how the movie could have been. <br /> <br /> The love shows had heat - the two leaders were beautiful together. <br /> <br /> The most horrible scene for historians is where they are at Britain's great lunch, before Wolfe sails and he lifts his glass and says the first two lines of "How to stand the glass around" aka "Why soldiers why" as if it were a toast. Absolutely ominous failure at historicity, much better to leave it out. Thousands of people know the damn song and thousands more believe the rumor that Wolfe and the company sang it (probably drunk, not all stuffy like this bunch). Daft.
