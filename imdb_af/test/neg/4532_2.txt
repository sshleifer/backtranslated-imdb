It is a poorly written and flattering short film, pure and simple. What's interesting and keeping me up to some height was the production values. Shot on the video, with a bad writing and bad direction, one would think it would also have a horrible production value. This is what the viewer expects when watching a movie that is terrible and shot at video. BUT Not in this case, they spent money and showed it. It is very important to me to see what comes next, just to see! Probably, the worst short film I've seen has seen huge budget Hollywood, though shot at some video format. <br /> <br /> Instead of spending the sum of money spent on some impressive set design, it would have been nicer to see a better-guided story with good direction. But then again, how can we expect new filmmakers to do it when even Hollywood won't.
