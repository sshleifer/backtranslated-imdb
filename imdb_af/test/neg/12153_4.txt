This movie didn't make me excited. While on vacation in Turkey, I noticed that it played at the local theater and decided to take the opportunity to see it. The action sequences in the movie are well choreographed, but the story is dragging in the middle of the movie. <br /> <br /> One thing I didn't quite follow was how Gates could get the money around the guards. <br /> <br /> The other thing I didn't like was the missing segment of Khan's life. It didn't go into detail how the bad guys could get him and arrested him after he'd been missing for so long. <br /> <br /> Overall, I rate this movie a (4) because I enjoyed the action sequence, but they were too few to justify a higher rating as the dialogue left me less than impressed ...
