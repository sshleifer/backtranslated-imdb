Wait until you see this one .... I even mean after reading this review. No other movie to date has sucked more than this one. One thing I don't understand is that when you rip an English movie, why add your own creativity? With the amount spent on making this movie, producers have to consider buying rights for "Mobile Phones" in Hindi and have released the movie. They might get as many profits as I think. If there was a chance to rate this movie with 0, I would have done it and the most pathetic performances come from Tanushree Datta and the girl who played the sidekick to Aftab. I do not know if my problem is that I saw Cellular much earlier than this movie ..... but it cannot be a reason to support this movie ... I can keep hours, but I do not have the time to talk about this useless shit of a movie, not to remember those horrible scenes of the movie. <br /> <br /> Please stay away from this movie.
