There are so many things wrong with this movie that it's hard to just pick a few. Let's start with the stupid and annoying songs. Like 'Ride Little Cowboy' who only emphasized Klinton Spilsbury's city-slickers look. The stupid kiddie cowboy songs in the background of the movie hurt any credibility or momentum the story had for it. <br /> <br /> I saw the media hype before this movie was released, and I saw Klinton Spilsbury interviewing on several TV shows, and he had a very soft, sweet, lush voice. His body language wasn't exactly what people remember who were fans of Clayton Moore and the Lone Ranger TV series. Spilsbury did not help to act like a diva and talk about Clayton Moore after the producers gave an order prohibiting Moore from appearing at conventions and other occasions than the original Lone Ranger. Clayton Moore was not even allowed to sign as "Clayton Moore, The Lone Ranger." He could only sign up as "The Masked Man." The incredible amount of negative publicity that this move gave the film was added only by the spectacular attitude of Spilsbury. It was very quick to tell reporters that Clayton Moore would soon be forgotten once the movie came out! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, even after the movie was a total flop, the company owned by The Lone Ranger refused to lift their initiative against Clayton Moore and he was never allowed to sign anything again. except as "The Masked Man" and he could not do his black mask on any public appearances. Between Spilsbury's diva personality and the negative publicity that the film has, it certainly did not help to make a good impression on the public. Even worse, a few weeks before the movie was finally released, the news leaked that Spilsbury's voice in the movie was over-obscured by James Keech because the producers thought Spilsbury didn't sound very convincing as a cowboy. The mockery and mockery that brought this news to the talk shows and comedy shows of that era put the last nail in the coffin. <br /> <br /> But then Merle Haggard was making his way through the movie. Apparently, the producers hoped that Haggard's macho image (one of the Outlaws of Country Music) would give credibility to Spilsbury as The Lone Ranger. The story by Merle Haggard was just another annoyance that audiences had to deal with. Sometimes Haggard drives his story, and it sounds like a strange kiddie movie. Combining the rowing story with the Ride Little Cowboy songs and any credibility Spilsbury could have destroyed by Haggard and the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Tonto was played by Michael Horse, and as others pointed out, Perd had much more personality than Spilsbury. In fact, perhaps because of Spilsbury's allegedly controversial stance during the filming, Horse seems to have given far more dialogue and screen-time than anyone expected from Tonto. Tonto takes control and is often the leader instead of the Lone Ranger. I was expecting (or hoping) Billy Jack would make a cameo as Tonto's brother (that would make the movie much better). Horse is not only more interesting than Spilsbury, but he says more and has better scenes. Perhaps it was a case that Horse stems from Spilsbury. However, since the film was so bad, Horse didn't get much recognition. Unlike Spilsbury, Horse had a very productive career in the film industry. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the last negative about this movie is the Powder Blue outfit from The Lone Ranger. The material selected for Spilsbury was more powdery blue than Clayton Moore normally wore on performances. The choice of color for the outfit just made Spilsbury look a little more in its role. The cartoon version showed that the Lone Ranger also wears a red shirt and black pants and that the alternative outfit helped to see Spilsbury more convincingly than The Lone Ranger. <br /> <br /> The supporting role mostly posted in their performances. They all seem to have worked on a TV episode and no one was very convincing. Even the villain, Cavendish, lost his edge because of the people around him. Overall, I feel sorry for Spilsbury. Not only did he do a terrible acting job, but it is clear that the production and publicity were terribly and effectively sabotaged by the poor man. Even if he was an excellent substitute for Clayton Moore, I doubt the movie was doing well due to the other factors. As it stands, this movie is funny in a sad way.
