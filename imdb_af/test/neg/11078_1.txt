First, let me say that those of you who voted "10" are just sorry and try to get the voices to a respected level ... something this movie doesn't deserve. (The only movies that deserve a 10 IMO are the classic ... Godfather, Shawshank, etc. Look at the best rated movies of all time for the full list.) I also noticed that many people favor it given to be so realistic. as far as it looks in a cave. Although I would like to vote with them in the area, they simply do not write the movie as a whole ... they are in the vicinity of the environment but miss the overall review. It will be like I have 10 votes for the movie "From Justin to Kelly" because I think the beach tunes remind me of how it is in the Florida Keys. Although this may be true, it does not mean that the movie is earned. a 10 because the movie was wholly whacked. <br /> <br /> I wish I could tell you that something saved this movie, as usual, when one thing stinks in a horrible movie, picks up something else, or makes the weakness (Ex. a great plot and / or a big camera work and scenery.) We started the DVD and it started quite normal. We started to find out who would be the first to die. After a bit of driving and walking, they set up camp for the night. At that moment I packed up a few things that really made me tune the rest of the movie. Two main issues I had: Bad effects and an even worse story line. The first thing we all noticed was that the campfires were not really. You can clearly see the "cgi" or false flames that everyone has put on. For a horror movie to have such a blatant effect, mistakes had to tell me what I was up for the next hour. <br /> <br /> Just minutes later I showed how poor this movie was written. I don't remember exactly how they got to the point, but basically, we find that the token Nerd writes a book about caves, etc. Another man in the group wants to tell a story about an experience, but hesitate to say, "I don't want this story in your book." The author convinces and cherishes the other that he will not put the story in his book and that he can trust him. (A direct quote: "If I tell you the story, you will definitely want it in your book.") At this stage I fully expected a nice 5+ minute story, complete with flashbacks and grief. What I got was a brief, poorly told (and acted) statement. I say statement, because what he eventually told was about 10 seconds and 5 sentences. I don't remember the exact quotes, but basically he says, "We were in a cave, the cave flooded, a girl died as our friend watched her." You may think I'm exaggerated and very critical, but it's not far from a direct quote, line by line, of the movie. <br /> <br /> Over the next 50 minutes or so, the movie will take place in the cave and although the lighting I would suggest being in a cave, I could really have done without the very fuzzy / hazy watching the movie, and the camera shake is just one that i haven't done going for. (I had a very good vision, and looked at the chapters of the movie, I felt I was legally blind.) I was emotionally detached from this movie, so the parts that were probably scary were not. Perhaps I could have overlooked the very slow and poorly educated start of this film. At least I would have been scared, but I don't remember anyone in the dark room, even at any of the "action" scenes. /> <br /> The last scene was probably one I will never forget, and that is not a good thing. In fact, two women are trapped in a naked room. The "monster" comes in to attack / kill the women ... he was stopped when he saw a picture of a little boy. A jump back takes place where we find out that the "monster" was injured as a boy and spent his whole life in the cave. Cut back to present time, and he takes his "mask" (a big skeleton with what a deerskin shirt looks like). He looks at the picture and the two women look to the caveman's weakness / soft spot. At that stage he stabbed and killed one girl, then he raped the other woman, rather graphically. After about 30 seconds watching the camera jiggle and shake while raping her, roll the credits, film's ear. <br /> <br /> Honestly, if I have to do all this and have lost money on renting this movie, I could have saved myself an hour and watch the first scene and last scene of this movie and still with the same thoughts about what I have now. <br /> <br /> One of you who compares it to Blair Witch is down ... if any of you followed up on how the director and writer ran the movie from Blair, it would realize how revolutionary it was ... to each cast member handing a script the day / night of filming without the other members who knew what The other actor did genius. <br /> <br /> If IMDb let me go, it would get a negative score ... I don't understand how anyone in their right mind can recommend this movie.
