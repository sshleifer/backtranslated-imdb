As soon as I heard that the biggest and oldest preserved Germanic fortune poem was transformed into a movie, it almost became my obsession to see it. The first gleam of his appearance I have caught has never disappointed me. A Futuristic Interpretation With Lambert, our favorite highlander and Mitra, the grave beater, were looking for leading roles, though there were doubts (an important female character in Beowulf?). Two hours ago I saw the movie. After reading the director's name, my world fell apart. As I have already said, there were not many surprises. First, the movie has nothing to do with the original Beowulf if we ignore some violent and useless stolen names. If they didn't steal the names and declared it as a new story, it could be a f-class action foolish with nice costumes and scenography. This is just a crime! An attack on legend and its ideology as well as on common sense. Okay, let me be positive for a second. Apart from the overall good electric goth atmosphere, it also has good music. This was for both the positive and the comments.
