Waitable but pretty terrible. How shocking it was the great Gregory La Cava's last live credit! Even in his better-known roles, I don't care for Gene Kelly. He seems to me a smug, hostile and self-centered. Here, along with a minor actress like Marie Wilson, he seems to be showing those qualities in the kicks. <br /> <br /> Marie Wilson, who plays an heir who falls for a military man, is extremely difficult and unmanageable. The actors seem to stubbornly work to get past the hard, unpleasant core of the picture and they do it well. <br /> <br /> The know-it-all butler is apparently meant to be funny, but he looks like an elaborate Riff on the spicy pieces for which Franklin Pangborn was famous (and to what extent, despite their stereotyping, he was generally funny - unlike this man.) As always, Phyllis Thaxter is very attractive in a fairly underdeveloped secondary plot.
