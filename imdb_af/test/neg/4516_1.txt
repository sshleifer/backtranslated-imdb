It's really uncomfortable. I just got a copy of Disco Beaver From Outer Space after I heard good things, and I have to say, it was just as incredibly indecent and bad, it will make you numb and reveal how it was ever made. /> <br /> I mean, what was it? Is it that it's typically late 70's humor? I do not think so. It's just as bad, and believe me, I don't mean too bad it's good. It's a collection of extremely inappropriate sketches as if you're watching cable TV. Sure enough, it was an HBO program, and to think it could be considered groundbreaking is scary. <br /> <br /> There's a pretty pretty girl in it, and there are some old NHL hockey team NHL stuff, which is fun to watch though I'm a lifelong NY Rangers fan. But they even waste it because they are trying to kick humor from two hockey players on the ice, as if they are "dancing" and, worse off, turning the videotape of two hockey players to make them look like they are having sex. Oh how funny! In a bit of cunning, there is an interview with a hockey player called "Chico" who looks like island dweller, Chico Resch. But they even blow it by wearing a Rangers jersey! Well, it was deliberate, who knows. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is: Disco Beaver is just as blatantly awful, so incredibly bad, you will definitely feel cheated after watching it and spending almost an hour of your life. You will wonder what made the creators of this garbage think they have something funny here, and you will also wonder why these sketches can't even get close to the worst Saturday Night Night demolition. Unbelievable. Just incredible.
