Danny Glover and Carey Elwes obviously forgot how to act when they made this movie, the play is absolutely sorry. The payment is even worse. I feel sorry for Danny Glover, I hope he paid well for it because it made him look completely foolish. The same goes for Mr. Elwes. An absolute slap in the face for any horror movie fan. Despicable. It's probably the worst performance of acting by veteran actors I've ever seen. I wonder if they were bothered to look at the script, or if they did, it should have said "forget everything you know about acting", because it makes the two of them ridiculous. For two seasoned veterans to act this way, it's terrible, I hope the check was very big, I thought it was initially a spoof. If you can find satisfaction in this movie, you can have more power.
