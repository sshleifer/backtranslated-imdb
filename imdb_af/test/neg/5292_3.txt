I enjoyed the beautiful scenery in this movie the first time I saw it when I was 9. Thunderclouds are a kind of cute for kids in a sneaky way. It reminded me of HRPUFFINSTUFF this morning, the Swedish background makes it easy on the eyes. Don't expect older kids to be interested as the live action / animation is far behind the times and most older kids will get bored. It is definitely a movie that is less than 10 years old and a little reminiscent of those who were little children in 1974.
