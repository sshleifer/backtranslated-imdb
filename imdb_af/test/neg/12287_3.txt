It may be all you need to know to decide if you want to see it. <br /> <br /> The movie is bad. Really, very bad. And sometimes it seems to be aware of it and make fun of how bad it is. It fits cliche to cliche and even manages to get worse as it goes along with a few moments bad enough to be hilariously funny. <br /> <br /> If you can read very poor quality in writing and production values, you may enjoy it. Otherwise, prepare for severe brain damage. <br /> <br /> 3/10
