This movie is trying to be more than it is. First, the play is terrible. You need to get past the incredible bad delivery of lines and terrible emotions. The plot is very interesting. A shipwreck occurs (apparently because it is made of strings and balsa wood), and a few guys find themselves on the beach. If it wasn't bad enough, there's also a man named Count de Sade. He lives in fear of pirates and has gone completely mad. Anyway, he has a big slave, a young woman and a few dogs. There is another woman who does not speak and his wife, who is leprosy. Anyway, things get bad, as these men have to deal with this nut case. He is arrogant and likes to draw and deliver lines. The rest of the movie is an attempt to escape. It has an ironic end that I won't reveal and it saves the movie. I won't bother if I am you.
