It's a very very bad movie! <br /> <br /> The plot is poor, the acting is bad and science is worse. <br /> <br /> The special effects are inconclusive. The dramatic scenes are a joke. Every step of the way you can see comes a mile away. The end is disappointing and there is no tension. The best thing about the movie is the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The only reason not to give it a lower voice is because it is a TV movie and I believe the budget was low to start with. <Br /> <br /> I believe the young female fans of Luke Parry will still see this movie, but he did better work. Again, it's terrible. Very very terrible. If you have a choice, look at something else.
