Jane Eyre with full frontal nudity! I was not surprised to see that a woman had a hand in this terrible woman's photo and I mean in the worst possible way. The problem is, it could have been so good if they just left the Jane Eyre stuff and held onto the many more interesting scenes that Spanish / Portuguese Jews had in London in the early 19th century. When the soundtrack music is better than the movie, you know you're in trouble. If you move the video forward, because you can't stand the movie, just to make sure you don't miss anything, you're in even worse trouble. This movie will end up on the romance TV channel where it rightly belongs.
