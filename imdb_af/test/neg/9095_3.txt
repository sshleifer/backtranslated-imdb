It's a candidate for the worst movies I've ever seen. It wanted to be as shocking as "Silence of the Lambs" but didn't have the style or whiteness of the aforementioned. The make-up is excellent, the play is pretty good, but the story seems to have been going on for years and the murders are so gruesome that they are more disturbing or entertaining.
