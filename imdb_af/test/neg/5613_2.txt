This film is made because the concept is well translated into a two-sentence summary that can be used to attract investors. This is the point of departure is interesting and salable. I mean, I hired it because of the synopsis. The problem is that there is nothing beyond the initial concept. There is no coherent plot, no full-fledged characters, no real comedy, no interesting scenery, no surprises and no good performances (except Jon Herder, he does something with very little). It is as if the people who lighten green this thing never read the script, but only the synopsis. And if there were enough people like me, it might even have made money. <br /> <br /> For the prospective viewer: don't waste your time, there's nothing funny or interesting to see here. For the creators of the movie: Hey, you made your movie, so what if it's not that good. Most people never find themselves or their work on the screen.
