Note to myself. Never again see a serious movie with Charlie Sheen. Great comedian, terrible seal. This movie makes Navy SEALS look like a reckless group of rangers when they are actually the most elite form of military in the world. Charlie Sheen helps destroy the Navy SEAL reputation. Thank you for making such an incredible selection of individuals, look terrible in one of the worst action movies I've ever seen. It's a wonderful story that can be made into a wonderful action movie, but why Charlie Sheen? There are possibilities for a very passionate story here, but Sheen decides to destroy them with "funny" comments.
