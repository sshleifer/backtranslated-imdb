By the time this film came out in 1996, director Mark Lester had been making tight, sharp, little B action photos for over 20 years. He was responsible for the huge "Truck Stop Women" of the 70's and various other jewels; Unfortunately, he is also responsible for this dud. It is a pity to see the talented - and still hot - Theresa Russell is wasted again, but she is still the best actor in this photo. Eric Roberts appears for a while, becomes his Eric Roberts thing, then goes away, a not quite unwelcome look in a photo with Eric Roberts in it. Frank Stallone is actually not bad, which should give you an idea of ​​how truly pathetic this picture is. As mentioned by other reviewers, the action scenes - which are the reason for making such a picture in the first place - almost completely illogical and unrealistic, in addition to being somewhat incompetent. Unlike some "vintage" clothes and some old cars, there is no feeling for the 1930s, the era in which this movie was set. A by-the-numbers script with annoying decay in logic and little historical accuracy - this is of course not a documentary version, but the filmmakers can at least try for some authenticity - and performances ranging from grade B to graduate rejects this cheap, little quickie after the 4:00 am sunday slot on HBO, just where I saw it.
