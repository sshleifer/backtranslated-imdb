This is a fairly senseless remake. Starting with the opening title shots of the original was a real mistake, as it reminds the viewer of a wonderful little part-time cooler it was. The new version that follows is a resignation exercise. <br /> <br /> Brian Kerwin plays a city man photographer returning to a semi-desert desert town populated by a scattering of underdeveloped clichéd stock characters: the lollipop sucks Daby doll Lolita, the old old frog prospector, the cripple fetter and his Asian wife, etc. ... <br /> <br /> Kerwin's character testifies that the 'something' is crashing into a slope and shortly after strange things begin to happen when pieces of strange blue rock are scattered. The temperature starts to rise, all the water in the area disappears, people start to behave strangely, explode things. Kerwin's character becomes more and more common in and out of his car than is humanly possible in one movie. The film doesn't develop a sense of place, no character development, no humor, no tension. All that made the Jack Arnold's original is a creepy, small Cold War paranoia classic. It just runs through its minimal hoops and then just ends. <br /> <br /> The special effects are not very special - the inside of the ship looks like pieces of cling film wrapped around a few ropes. from the camera to frame some of the most uninspired and clumsy wires ever placed on the screen. The script is repetitive. Everyone says it at least twice, Kerwin gets to say "Let's go out of here" at least three times in the movie, twice in one scene. Many things are inexplicable at the end - for example, why do strangers need all the heat and water? - Not that anyone who looks will mind; If the filmmakers don't mind, why should we? <br /> <br /> The acting is enough - better than the script, which sometimes deserves a proven improvisational quality. Although it is often the actors seem to get the thing done as soon as possible - A remarkable example of this is when Elizabeth Peña registers the shortest, token moment of "frustrated despair of hands" before coming to Stevie, the old boy. followed. to see him do "angry sulky teenager who had something from a table". <br /> <br /> Continuity errors include the (GB) sticker at the back of Kerwin's jeep that appears and disappears, a dual action of the gas in the explosive car, a town person who is simultaneously in two places - once in the Alien Stevie's POV then immediately shot in a reaction, Elizabeth Peña closed a car door twice. You can say I'm grabbed, can't you? The movie binds the biggest mistakes. It's boring.
