What can be said about this? Actually one of the most sensible experiences of my life. Your brain will try to shut down as part of a primary impetus of self-preservation. I was left with the experience of watching this 'movie' and I took a good two hours to fully recover. This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the clear trinity of horror movies. I certainly don't understand this distinction in a good way. I mean this in a terrible way. A terrible way. <br /> <br /> This movie has no redeeming features. Everything is terrible. Artless camera work offers us endlessly with the ugliest imaginable environment, ie lots of wheat, lots of mud. The story is stupid. The font is? Was there a script? The villain is very unsuitable and wears yellow wellington boots. The children are irritating. The chief is charisma-free. And it has the audacity to go on for 100 minutes. Completely without merit at any level, it is similar to torture. Normally such a statement would be an exaggeration intended for comic effect. Not in this case. I'll say it again? this is torture. <br /> <br /> In the end, I was in a state of paralysis. It was very grateful. But as soon as I recovered, I decided I had to look at the "Making Of" featuret. I had to understand. Perhaps there is a reasonable explanation for this cruelty. Has it been an extensive joke? I watched the first 2 minutes of the 'Making Of' featuret and discovered that the author / director was slightly misleading. I also discovered this because I watched the first two minutes of the "Making Of" featurette of Dark Harvest 2, that I was an idiot. Not a pleasant journey of self-discovery. Life sucks. <br /> <br /> Highly untouched.
