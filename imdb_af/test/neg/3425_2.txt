An interesting concept has become a bloodbath ... <br /> <br /> My first viewing feature of Geoffrey Wright (Romper Stomper). Once I was interested, it was an interesting concept at the time ... <br /> <br /> Shakespere + Aussie Film + Gothic + Melbourne + Gangland <br /> <br /> A very strange mix in A disastrous piece of Aussie theater has become a bad name for my country ... <br /> <br /> Advantages: -Interesting concept <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: -Wast of a good throw -Stuffed and stupid plot - Curved camera angles - Not many variety of places. Use the Shakespearian diologue. <br /> <br /> Overall: Australia's worst effort of a Shakespea movie, stick to Baz Lurhman ... or Romper Stomper (WARNING: The movie is dangerous)
