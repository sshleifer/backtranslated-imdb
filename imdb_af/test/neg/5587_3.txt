I'm sorry, ELO supporters, but I was disappointed with this concert at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. This is decent music, but the performance is just boring - great time. Most of the songs sound the same and lead singer writer Jeff Lynne is about as animated as a retailer. He has a pleasant voice, but he is not much to look at. He just stands in one place and sings for an hour and 40 minutes. The songs all sound like bubbly from the 1970s and 1980s: pleasant but not exciting. <br /> <br /> Lynn is accompanied by a very beautiful woman, Rosie Vela, but she is not too animated. The only song - out of 23 - that creates any excitement is the last one: "Roll over Beethoven." Now that only a few of the other 22 songs had the excitement for them, it could be a much better DVD.
