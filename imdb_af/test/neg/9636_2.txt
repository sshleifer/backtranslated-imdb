It's the kind of movie that loves 50-year-old school teachers and people who consider themselves social issues - but didn't really have an idea. The actors - I think everyone is amateurs - do their best, but the writing is so full of cliches and stupidities that they can't save it. <br /> <br /> The worst of all is the Scool cabaret that the kids are working on - bringing back all of your worst remembrance classes at school. The lyric on one of the songs goes as follows in a quick translation 2.30 in the morning: "I am the dwarf of society, an emotionally crippled individual." <br /> <br /> Please!
