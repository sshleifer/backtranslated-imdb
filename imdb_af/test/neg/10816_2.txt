"The Cave" released simultaneously with the English film "The Descent", led by Neil Marshall. Both movies share a similar presentation; just "The Cave" is terribly inexhaustible, unspeakable and incompetent compared to the wonderful horror adventure "The Descent" is. It feels like Neil Marshall realized that the basic story was too poor and immediately added ingenious ideas, depth and personal style, while "The Cave" director Bruce Hunt simply went for the most rudimentary effect of the script his desk was thrown. The result is an incredibly mediocre movie that includes every horror movie that you can think of and in which most violence occurs on the screen. And we all hate it, not us? The story presents a click of insatiable cave divers trapped in a completely undiscovered Romanian underground ecosystem. Hidden winged creatures, which also prevent parasites, fall rapidly and escape is impossible due to a landslide. The first half hour is still generously entertaining if you keep yourself busy mocking all the clich√©s and listening to the cheesy textbook dial, but the whole thing just gets too bad. Neither event is even slightly credible and it seems as if the entire cast is competing for the WORST performance. I have seen better special effects in anonymous B movies, the filming stations are not fully used and the end is straight! Many are NOT recommended!
