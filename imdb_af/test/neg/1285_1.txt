What a waste of precious time! My 5-year-old daughter brought this home to my mother's house, and we considered it a family. None of us liked it. This miserable little film, full of dazzling contradictions, open Christian themes and horrible movie quality, is not worth watching, even on a gamble. It feels a bit like a bad high school drama class attempt to make film. How sad to see talented actors (Chris Atkins, Gary Busey, and their company) flow their way through this silly and inexorable story. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that the dog is cute. The movie may have gone straight to the pound. Avoid this movie - your time is better spent drying paint.
