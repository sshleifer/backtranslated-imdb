The movie version of 'Rising Damp' ended two years after the television series. Like many fans, I went to the theater when it was opened. I was very disappointed. Eric Chappell couldn't spend much time writing the script; Most of them are repetition of ideas from old episodes. By the time of release of the movie, the series "Rising Damp" was repeated on I.T.V. so the public is asked to pay to see something they have seen. At least the images featured on On The Buses original screens. <br /> <br /> Second, Richard Beckinsale died last year, replacing the character of 'Alan' as a sign of respect, John ', played by Christopher Strauli of' Only When I Laugh 'boast. It simply wasn't the same. <br /> <br /> As another poster pointed out, Rigsby's boarding house saw nothing like the one in the series, bigger and completely cleaner. <br /> <br /> Director Joe McGrath was one of the directors working on the original 'Casino Royale', a movie that was threatened in surreal humor. 'Rising Damp' also has its share of 'Walter Mitty' style fantasy sequences, such as the Saturday Night Fever parody. Personally, I found them terribly out of place. A case of 'over-egging the pudding'. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Leonard Rossiter is as wonderful as ever as the "Rigsby", like Frances De La Tour as' Ruth 'and Don Warrington as' Philip. It's just a shame that the movie is not worthy of their talents. <br /> <br /> When Rossiter died in 1984, it was by I.T.V. as a tribute, with its final scene - which leaves Rigsby to the foot of the stairs - removed in the interest of good taste.
