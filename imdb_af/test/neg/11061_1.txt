If you're a bit masochistic and want to waste time, try this one. I have enough time to look at myself, so I will not waste any more, why it is so terrible. Be warned !!! Oh, I see I have to fill 10 lines or more. Here we go: every year or so some people think it's fun to shoot a low-budget movie about the nasty monsters from the subsoil, which will hopefully be a hit. The cave is one of those. I didn't have high expectations about this, but the acting is so bad and the production is so poor that I think seriously about asking back. Poewww ... another line about a useless movie ... Oh, I'm done.
