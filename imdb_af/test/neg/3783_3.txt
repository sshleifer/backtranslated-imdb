I give it a three instead of the lower number it deserves due to its history. A full-time movie made by high school students! It also shows, but it is part of the charm and appeal. Get some of the things George Lucas did at UCLA; it's better. Maybe because of a group effort. <br /> <br /> A monster of toxic waste and too much garbage - these kids were far from their time! - Start destroying the city of Milpitas during a high school dance. The monster randomly destroys and leaves garbage and stinking footprints. <br /> <br /> The film has local TV and radio people, the mayor of the Milpitas mayor, Samuel Ayer's principal and a lot of high school students and their parents, not the mayor's daughter as the not to mention general. <br /> <br /> Dumb? Yes! Fun? Yes! Large screen writing? Come on, they're uneducated high schools! Copy the comments for acting, movies, directing, etc. <br /> <br /> Milpitas is right next to San Jose in the heart of Silicon Valley; Perhaps one of the graphic geniuses will update the video somehow. Now there's a challenge.
