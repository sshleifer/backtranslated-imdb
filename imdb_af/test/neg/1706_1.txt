This is a movie that revolves around two puzzles (which I have now uncovered). <br /> <br /> First, the filmmakers understood the concept of 'parody' before using it to bombard the audience through the film? Parody is when a reproduction seeks to mock, comment or pay homage by self-humor to the original work. In other words, there must be reasons to parody such work, and they should definitely be smart. I didn't see any of those in the movie. I saw some very 10-second jokes that fell flat within 2 seconds. Bryan Stoller probably went to Eric Roberts and said, "Hey, I was drunk last night, watched Survivors, and have this brain for a straight to DVD release. I want you on board without reading the script ... because I plan to direct this movie without one! "<br /> <br /> And here lies the second secret: Eric Robert's career. I used to think that Eric Roberts had the career because he was unhappy. Now I realize it's because he's stupid (and therefore he deserves the career he had). Having watched this movie, it is clear that he would have been better if he went into mainstream adult movies, with higher budgets, more ... intense ... scenes and roles, better acting and direction, more extensive and compelling intriguing lines, and a much larger audience than this B-movie rejects (C movie?).
