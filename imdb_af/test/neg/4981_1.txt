I remember the first trailer for Underdog back last March, I also remember that I was smiling a little for myself. Certainly, it was a cheesy idea, but I really thought when the concept could work, hell, it couldn't be worse than the disappointing Cats and Dogs? When in December and I suddenly remembered the film I realized how likely the movie would suck, the fact that it was delayed in the UK made it inevitable, it would be terrible, but the terrible reviews just made me realize that it was almost impossible. because the movie must be good. Yet I swallowed my feelings and I saw the movie with a friend today. When I got to my screen, I was killed. It was the first time I would see a movie with a friend and the only two in the screen! Little did I know for what I was about to endure. Immature to put it blunt is terrible, it's really. Imagine how bad you think this movie is and prepare yourself for a movie that is even worse, it's just how pathetic the movie is. While it is aimed at entertaining children, it just seems to be an embarrassing effect that children seem insulting, rather than enjoying the movie. Matters can't be helped by the fact that the story is over, the drama is generally poor, and the movie just feels like an exaggerated, tired and straight-boring Saturday cartoon! After a short five minutes where I thought the movie was sensible, the movie suddenly looked dead and then it went to the already finalized final. I'm just surprised the movie is actually ever released, it's an embarrassment for Disney, hell half of them straight to video successors is better than that! What is even more frightening is the fact that the end provides space for a successor! <br /> <br /> We can come to the scene (cracks). All right, let me be honest. Jason Lee is decent, his voice fits the dog, and if he has received a decent script, he can do the job. But with such a dodgy script he just looks whistled. In many ways it reminded me of Bill Murray in Garfield. Murray did what he could with what he had, but what he had was not enough to make it sensible. Then we come to the human actors, and most of the horrible. Alex Neuberger plays Underdog's friend Jack. My biggest concern is that someone will even take him seriously in an audition. The scene where he is going to fly with Underdog may be the scarcely worthy scene in recent years, just because his play is so poor. Not once did I believe he was a real person. In fact, part of me is still convinced that he was a robot specially made for the movie! James Belushi looks half dead in the film, he has nothing to work with, no decent lines. He just seems to wander the set and wait to become relevant to the plot, which the authors try to do at the end, but do so in such cases. a poor way is his laughter. Fortunately, Peter Dinklage is the one independent factor of the movie, he is wonderful as dr. Barsinister and seems to have a laugh in the role. He steals every scene he's in, though it's hardly difficult to share screenplay with the extremely annoying Patrick Warburton. The rest of the role is even worse, especially Taylor Momsen, she just has to run her acting! <br /> <br /> Underdog also fails dramatically in terms of delivering anything like a funny scene. When the funniest scene involves Underdog biting a can and causing dog food to explode everywhere, you know that something is drastically wrong. It can easily be ignored if the movie had decent behavior or a good story, unfortunately, the movie is even worse in both of these terms. The effects are such strings that any scene in which Underdog flies just looks absurd, and the dog uses its powers to such an effect you often forget it has superpowers. What is the point of making a movie about a super dog if the hidden dog never looks super? The final battle also struggles purely, because she's ten minutes of nothing, the dog flies, other things happen, some things are broken, everything is irrelevant, as these things happen for the sake of things that happen. The writing is also dodgy and straightforward at worst. When someone says, "Look, it's a plane, it's not a bird, it's not a frog ...". Yes, you are reading it correctly. I just wanted to erupt in tears. Actually, I wanted to go out while I was obliged to see if it was lower than that point. It happens near the end, so it doesn't make you happy. <br /> <br /> Overall Underdog became the worst movie of 2008 at this early era, and is just as bad as last year's Epic Movie. Luckily for Underdog, Meet the Spartans come here soon and I expect it will be even worse. So if you didn't get the point of my review, avoid the movie at all costs, if you want to watch a movie with a dog, then watch Cats and Dogs, buy a real dog if necessary, don't see it!
