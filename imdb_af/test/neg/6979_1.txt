I have endured this movie just to satisfy my curiosity. It must be one of the worst movies I've ever put. I'm surprised this movie currently has a 7.5-star rating. The acting is terrible, the writing is not there and the characters are so predictable and hollow. For a funny movie I can't even remember sobbing and not seeing it as a comedy. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this foam and look for more worthy alternatives that will give you much more pleasure. Watching movies like the holidays or 27 dresses, these movies offer a much more satisfying movie experience. I sincerely hope that more educated filmmakers are negative about this movie, in the way it really deserves, because it gives a more realistic touch that other film lovers can base their judgment on. Come on, let our people be fair to everyone involved and give those involved in this movie a true reflection on what they are producing - an extremely mediocre picture that must be forgotten very quickly.
