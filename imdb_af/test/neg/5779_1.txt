Look at this one in a Sneak Preview yesterday and have to say it was terrible. After the credits I thought, "Hey with this role, it's probably pretty good." Didn't challenge that way at all. <br /> <br /> Lame predictable groans, terribly simply drawn characters (perhaps except a little Mrs. Lara's) and a finite can provide 10 minutes in the film. And worst of all, it is abusing a delicate theme (disabled) for low level and mostly tasteless jokes without touching anything other than the surface of the problem. The disabled person who sympathizes with the movie with the most is the one who just fails. What kind of message is that? And the film has no idea at all by ending. It basically comes down to: "I love you, no matter if you acted like a prick." <br /> <br /> To sum it up: Great role that had to be very bored to sign up for a terrible movie.
