The only good thing about this movie is that I have a movie on the worst list now. Rest up to be at the end of the spectrum where I can compare all the terrible movies. Really, this movie is the worst plot, the worst pointed out, throughout the movie is everything I wanted to do, pulled out my hair and kicked the author and someone who made the role of the movie possible. I'm a deploying soldier, and if I spend my precious stand still watching movies like this. These people must feel awful, they had to watch it before it came out, and had to be lazy to repeat, after they realized it was freaking. I am so surprised that this wonderful country allows us to make another one. Honestly, this is the first time I've ever responded to a movie, I had to let the world know, not to waste their time. Erase this movie from the face of this planet. It slows our people down.
