Really? Is this necessary? How can someone make such a movie? Disgusting !!! Set Seagal with funny hair and fat like an elephant. Stunts all the time, cars prosecutions with an annoying soundtrack. Not to mention the end. Totally nonsense with the presence of the girl. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal wants to be Robin Hood! Well, in the beginning, a fortune teller answers something no one has asked. Seagal's wife has nightmares and she can see the future. They must be sheep. Steven Segal goes out for a car prosecution and I know he can't act. It was awful. Nothing can save the movie. <br /> <br /> I lost 90 minutes of my life! goodbye
