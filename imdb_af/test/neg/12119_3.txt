I loved so many last Bellocchio's movie, the masterpiece "L'Ora di Religione". It had a big screenplay, great actors (well, Castellitto is so much bigger than others), a brilliant use of lights for a big movie. <br /> <br /> Well, Buongiorno Notte is another story. Ridiculous screenplay outburst tons of morals (and we can talk about politics for weeks, you know we're Italian ...). Poor cinematography (it's too easy to represent '70s dark years with dark colors and dark lights, do a few more attempts !!!!). Bad use of music: What is the use of psychedelia to represent the tragic rationality of Brigate Rosse? <br /> <br /> And for all the people who claimed the main price in Venice, I answer: "Are you nuts ?? ??" Perhaps the Russian film is bad, but not as bad as it is. <br /> <br /> I'm down with the P.E. Don't believe the hype !!
