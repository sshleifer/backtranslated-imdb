This experimental silent film, made in Switzerland by an independent British film company, is mainly remembered as Paul Robeson's first film. It is very artistic, with shots that often seem meaningless to the story, which in any case is difficult to understand because of the lack of enough interstitutions. From what I came together, Robeson's wife, Adah, is in an inter-racial love affair with a white man named Thorne. It doesn't disturb the owner of the bar / hotel where Thorne lives (and she seems to have a lesbian relationship with a barmaid), but an old lady expresses the town's stance in an interstitial: If I go my way we would not allow negatives. "Thorne is also called" nigger lover "by someone in the bar. Adah tries a reconciliation with Pete (Robeson), but eventually leaves him. Thorne's wife, Astrid, goes from the deepest point, burns a knife, cut Thorne's arm and cheek and died somehow, Thorne must be accused of murder because we learn he was acquitted.As to Pete, he gets a letter from the mayor telling him that it is best for everyone The movie is more about racism than anything, but in a recording, Mr Pete says: "The sad thing is, they think they're right. This is the way we are. "The meaning of the title is a mystery. It can refer to Adah which is a light skin (a border nine) or the borderline behavior of the main characters.
