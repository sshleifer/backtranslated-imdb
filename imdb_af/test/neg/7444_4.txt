Star count: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Old Detroit is back, with the giant Omni Consumer Corporation continuing to swallow everything in its path than the construction of the new Delta City continues and a new threat to fight in the form of Cain, a brutal drug host with atrocities of Christ's parable, gaining a deadly new addict on the streets called Nuke. As he continues to struggle with the memories of his past life that has let him down, the hidden hero sets out to bring this villain - just to stop chopping scrap metal. With Robocop out of action, set a relentless OCP businesswoman plans for her new android - a blunt, cattle-like machine from a machine that needs an equally nasty test box to authorize it - which Cain fits perfectly. After a short while in his system, Robo comes back to bring justice to the streets and settle the score with Cain. <br /> <br /> The original Robocop is a movie that always encourages you every time you see it, no matter how many times you've seen it, one of those movies that just can't be done again. That being said, it is not surprising that a successor has been made - it is even less surprising that the successor is really compared to the original fall. Empire Strikes Back director Irvin Kirschner has made an unpleasant, slightly incoherent and oblong film that cannot capture the magic of the first film, no matter how hard it tries. And it's definitely the funny advertisements of the first film that doesn't stop running, the corporate satire that makes the bit sharper and the action as fast and furious as before, but with blood / gore even the first movie. The first film got a name for some nasty blood-slaughtered violence (including a man's genitals being blown out and a man being blown off), but while it was remembered, the violence / gore was on display here. of a more sadistic and free nature, with a very unpleasant and moderate tone about it. <br /> <br /> But overall, the movie gives you a feeling of general apathy - why do you watch it if you can look at the original again? **
