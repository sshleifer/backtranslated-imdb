I'm amazed at the great comment here for this OK surf movie. It really comes from the "California Dreamin" school to beach people and is not really credible. The idea that the main child learns to manage a board. So good in a concrete wave pool that he hit the right surfers in their game in the right sea is just stupid. In Australia, where most urban teens burn, this movie is laughed and audiences have it all with a salt of salt. Made in the 80's, but with its heart in the 60's, it's nice to look and look and sound good, but it's not a classic class at all. Even the actors did not exceed it. We are serious in FLY BRIDGE or RIDE THE WILD SURF or BEACH BLANKET BINGO country here. Oz stars like Occy and BIG Wednesday hero Gerry Lopez has been set up to add headquarters recognition to our farm boy's golf skills, but it just made the crowd in the theater wave. It's for 10 year olds who don't ask much. It's not even GOD'S HAND and it was stupid.
