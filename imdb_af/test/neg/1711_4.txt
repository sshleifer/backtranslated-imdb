While missing out with a team for the Miss's dispute. Galaxy is, the plane launched by Maximus Powers (Eric Roberts) and Mike Saunders (Charlie Schlatter), in an isolated location where Noah's Ark is protected by the Jurassic Pork. While the group is fighting to survive, alien monkeys are planning to use the ark to destroy humanity and dominate planet Earth. <br /> <br /> I like parodies, but "Miss Castaway" is a human brain violation. The terrible story and the special effects are very, but really very bad. There are spoofs with Lost, Castaway, Jurassic Park, Sixth Sense, Titanic, Planet of the Apes, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Congo, MIB, Perfect Storm, "Austin Powers", "Jaws", "Mission Impossible", " Close Encounters of the Third Child, "Star Wars" and "Hulk", but the problem is that most of them are very stupid and not funny, in the end the trailer is better than the movie. four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Missão Quase Impossível" ("Mission Almost Impossible")
