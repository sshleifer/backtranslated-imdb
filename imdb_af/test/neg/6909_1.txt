My boyfriend and I decided to watch this movie after we heard on the radio that it was a good movie to watch, even with 'cars'. Within the first ten minutes of the movie I was shocked. To begin with, the cows, which were female, had to have male voices. Then I realized they were really supposed to be guys. I put the transvestite cows for a bit and tried to watch the movie with an open mind, but it was just as boyfriend that I couldn't help but shake my head. I checked my phone about ten times to see if it was almost over. The plot was decent, if not predictable, but it went too long to reach its point. I had trouble going through that, and I'm 19. The kids in the theater actually came up and down the corridors. I felt like joining them. But my biggest problem with the movie was that it was loaded with drink references, not to mention that the cows / bulls were actually hot and stolen a car, then drank and managed, broke into a boy's house to push him out of bed. it deserves it), then ran away from the police, who made the authors of the movie look like terrible people. This is not the kind of thing I want my child to be exposed to. There is too much of it in the real world, if I wanted my child to see how guys were drinking and driving and pushing the police, I'd like to pop them before the 10-hour news. Children's movies are supposed to be an escape from reality, not an escape into ridicule. What happened to the good morals and happy ends that children's movies used to boast? That's why Disney's old movies, like Beauty and the Beast, are Lady and the Tramp, The Little Mermaid, etc. Classic. If you want to see your kids a great cartoon, basically the same plot as "Barnyard", rent "The Lion King" You can get a big story without the terrible drinking and driving and theft referrals. The writers of "Barnyard", of course, tried to continue the great tendency to make a children's film that a parent can enjoy, but they did so in a very bad taste. I will never take my children to see it, and I suggest you save your money and look something else.
