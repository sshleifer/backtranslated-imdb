The female movie of this movie is wonderful: you have Linda Blair (with a nice mud), Julie Strain (who doesn't talk too much - that's a good thing), Rochelle Swanson (as convincing as a lovely innocent girl or as an evil girl), Toni Naples and the most beautiful of them all IMO, the simply beautiful Kristina Ducati (how goofy male chief, Larry Poindexter, deserves to become sexually involved with any of these women remains a mystery). But the performance of these beautiful and sometimes talented women has little to offer. The plot is unfounded and does not really touch the last 15 minutes or so; And when Wynorski finally manages to create some tension, it comes with a ridiculous "twist" syndrome and ruins everything.
