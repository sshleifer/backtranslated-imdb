It opens with the company credits that let us know by World International Network. I knew I saw this company credit, but couldn't remember where, but knew it was at the start of a very bad movie. I saw so seriously thinking about changing channels. The only thing was that I saw every movie. on the other channels which is one of the problems of being an IMDB judge. As for hell, I thought it didn't really matter if WANTED was good or bad, because I would still be able to review it for this site. <br /> <br /> As I expected, it wasn't that good. It's a plot I've seen so many times (too many times) before I started a refugee, a bit like THE INCREDIBLE HULK TV series without the shirt ripping. Jimmy cross the gang in a completely confronted way and go ahead and find himself in a completely confronted way at a Catholic reform school. Did you notice a frequently used description in the last sentence? "Completely confronted" is the answer. Let me repeat for the trouble of thinking that this is a wholly owned subsidiary where everything happens to be dependent. Another problem I had was the church reorganization school - it is too sympathetic and good, I have led to believe that this kind of institution looks like Alcatraz as a country club. I say this is a fact, but when the chief priest looks like the spitting image of Donald Rumsfeld, you feel there is a huge amount of sugar cover going on. <br /> <br /> To be honest despite the ridiculous plot twists, etc. WANTED is not really a bad thriller. although it is a very good one. I never really had the urge to eliminate it, no matter how confronted it was, which is a private compliment to the movie
