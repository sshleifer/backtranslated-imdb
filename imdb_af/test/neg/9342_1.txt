I won't comment much on what? Stereotype characters, absolute ignorance of Colombia's reality, terrible mishap and scene, poor color choice, not funny (it's supposed to be a comedy and they expect you to laugh because some music is seduced, it's next to the trivial scenes ). Very poor actors direction If you see people somewhere, I mean the interpreters, you will know they are at least good, but if you see it call it movie, it is impossible to guess it, you get tired of the music ... this "comedy" has no rhythm, the only good rhythm in it, it's the rap singing in the final credits .... pathetic, isn't it? etc ... etc. It's been a long time since I haven't seen such a movie !!
