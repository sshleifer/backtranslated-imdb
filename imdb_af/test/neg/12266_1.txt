Within about 5 minutes of the movie I watched the first battle scene that I could only help but show the lack of tension in the scene. The cameras that go back and forth really show that he had no idea what he did. Well, actually, the soundtrack shows the best. I'm not a low budget movie and you're not going to get top 40 songs, but at least get music going to the scene. It's not really hardworking. Well, if I see something, I'd like to let you know. the writing was so badly written, would surprise me now a bit of the guy who spoke this piece, I will give the person one 10/10 and that was for the DVD cover because if I actually "watched it "in a store and it was like $ 10 15, I would have bought it, why if you look at the front page, it actually did you well to turn back and you see it actually won prizes. now this is a very misleading thing, because even in a small film festival I would never believe in my life that it could win everything I could say, "Wow, if it was the best, I wouldn't want to know what the crap in the film festival was like "<br /> <br /> movies that are bad, have only one good use and it is for an aspiring filmmaker to use as inspiration, movies like these are better tools than good movies Because with good movie you know almost from the bat, there is a good chance you won't make a movie that is good, but if you use such a movie, you can look at all the things that the director or writer has done wrong so you won't make the same mistakes. you have the extra plus to watch this movie and say if a piece of peep like this can be made, then there is hope for anyone out there
