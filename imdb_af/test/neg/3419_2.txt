If you want a terrible interpretation of "MacBeth" then that's your answer. Filled with archaic Shakespearic English language in an Australian environment of the 21st century, this movie lives to let you down and scratch your head. But that's not all. <br /> <br /> Not only are there sophomore action sequences, but there are many scenes where the female body is displayed. The witches, played by actresses, look like schoolgirls more than witches, put a soft porn show with MacBeth in an unbeatable display of love. Welcome to stupidity and depravity - all at the same time. <br /> <br /> It is a wonder why this project was green. So much for the modern cute movies. "D"
