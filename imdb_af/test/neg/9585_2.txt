It's the worst middle-class practice to hit our television screens. Unfortunately I didn't see it when it was first shown, but paid for the joy of watching six-hour turbulent thunder - and I'm still waiting for the laughter to arrive. I love Tasmin Greig, a big fan of both Black Books and Green Wing, and know she is capable of making the best of the comedy parts. However, she also played this part, and she could provide the lack of any decent comedy material. Broadcasters should please keep in mind that the Commercial Rights Descriptions Act can be used well if you continue to record as comedy material that is the best pseudo-psychic romance and, in the worst case, a drama that excels as an exciting comedy to hide the fact that no fish or chicken.
