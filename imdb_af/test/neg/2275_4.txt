Well, if you discount the production value, the ugly outfits and the big hair discount, this adjustment is still well below the 90's. First Ann Firbank (playing Anne Elliot) is literally ten years old to play this role and her acting leaves much to be desired. Amanda Root (playing the same role in the 90's version) can express more in her big, brown eyes than Firbank can with her whole face in a four-hour production. Anne turns into a spicy, winding, boring character (and what was the scene during the "long walk" where she quit poetry?). Henrietta and Louisa looked so much that the only time I could tell them separately was when they stood side by side (Henrietta was longer). And Louisa! There was never a more intractable character! It was ridiculous to think that Wentworth was interested in her. She is supposed to be haughty and beautiful and charming, not stupid and stupid with her ridiculous laugh, it's like nails on a plate. When she started singing, "to Lyme, to Lyme, to Lyme," I started screaming, "Stop, stop, stop!" The best part of the movie was when Louisa dropped those three feet at the cobb, because I knew I'd no longer have to see her in the movie. Talk about the fall at the cobb scene; It was the sparrow's poorly acted, sleazy and edited scene of the entire film. How does a person fall down three feet, land on her feet and still be unconscious? <br /> <br /> On the plus size Elizabeth's character was much closer to the book than in the 90's. At the end, they also added many more scenes to Anne and Frederick. <br /> <br /> I admit I bought this movie, even though I knew how sub par it was, but I'm a big Austen fan, so I will buy any movie from one of her novels. Look at this move if you're sickly curious, or to appreciate the 90's version even more. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is, this version can follow the letter of the novel, but the 90's version follows the spirit.
