I mean, come on! Now my compatriots have started making westerners! Isn't it enough that our cinema already sucks? Now you have to do English language movies with Polish acting and no sense? Please keep away from this movie, don't waste your eyes on it. A 5 year old baby can make a movie that makes sense. I am from Poland and I am ashamed that this title can actually be looked at by you. Please, I beg you, don't watch this movie and if you do, don't consider Polish people and Polish movies based on what you see there. We had some good movies in our history and we had bad people, but this one - it's like nothing worse that I've seen in my life. Stay away !!!
