I see that most of the comments so far were if it wasn't too positive, then at least positive. I can't understand it. The only explanation I can find is that the people who comment on have something to do with the movie, as it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It makes "Boggy Creek II" and "Mutant" look like horror masterpieces. The acting is, at best, shaky and terrible for the most part. The whole movie is almost black, probably so they can all shoot in the same place. The monster looks like something of one of Roger Corman's worst movies. And the plot ... well, the less it said better. <br /> <br /> One to avoid at all costs.
