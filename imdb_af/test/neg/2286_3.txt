Connery climbs over the Moore buffalo train in this stinker of a movie. Everything Bond did in the first place ruined the Bond character, throwing him into the Inspector Gadget category. Get Smart it's not. There is no style here, only two-day actors performing on cheap sets. It's a pity that Connery can't borrow an element of class here, but it doesn't. Everything here is a series of mediocrity, including Connery's bad toupee. Perhaps if I was in the snow and given the choice to watch "Never Say Never Again" and "Howard The Duck" I would choose the former. If you want the right James Bond, get a Ian Flemming novel.
