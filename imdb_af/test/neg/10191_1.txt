I just stumbled upon this movie and checked IMDb for more information: score 6.7, well ... not so bad. Genre: scifi ... good I like scifi. So I got the movie and I look forward to a relaxing Sunday night to watch it. But only ... NO. <br /> <br /> As in summary, it's not a movie at all. This is a religious advertisement. These include: Pope about Jesus, God, Devil, End of the World, etc. Movie begins with an epic kidnapping story: driving at night, car stop, bright light, and so on. Well, that was actually the movie. Lastly, of this ..umm ... honestly I don't know what to call it ... was dialogue about the end of the world and the last judgment. Completely the same things these TV preachers tell you, but they are "good" to it. <br /> <br /> Honestly, if you want to see a scifi movie or something with UFOs, please stay far away from this "thing". It has nothing to do with them. If you want to hear a cuckoo's mind what the Bible should say and what to do. Then go ahead and look at this thing, but I still prefer to go to church on Sunday. <br /> <br /> It's a complete bull. (and evangelical Christian propaganda, as other users have said: Well ... I had to have other users' comments before I get the movie. <br /> <br /> (27% of voters have this "thing" as 10 yes, right. Please, go somewhere else to do your propaganda)
