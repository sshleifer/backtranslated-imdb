This movie was found in a $ 10 DVD discount rack. It wasn't worth it. Some of the camera work and dialogue seem and sound like it was done by a film student. Sandra's actions were somewhat credible, but the film was predictable and the action was mocking and dragged. <br /> <br /> One thing I will give them, however. Unlike most action films, people in this movie actually ran out of ammunition and cunning bodies for new weapons and ammunition.
