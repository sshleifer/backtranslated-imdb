This movie should be about one of the worst I've ever seen. The humor was rough, almost funny and has been heard a million times before. The start was exceptionally special and it got worse and worse as it went on. I went about halfway through and couldn't stand to look at it any more. Fortunately, I just watched it on TV, and it didn't cost anything, but I strongly recommend not to waste your time or money. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the movie was new. The characters were not developed at all. Actually, I think it would have been better than a small child movie, because it was full of stupid unrealistic "funny" events ... it's like happening in the house alone or something. Not to act alone was as terrible as that.
