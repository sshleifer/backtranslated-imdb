It was by far the worst movie I've ever seen. And that's compared to Alexander, Fortress 2 and The New World. <br /> <br /> I should go back to bumping and asking for my money back with compensation, as it was a real traumatic experience. For the first ten minutes I changed the zoom on my widescreen TV because the actors were out of the screen. I didn't think it was possible to make such a bad movie. I was wrong. As I typed this message, I thought of a good reason to buy this movie. A joke against Xmas present. I blame the Mrs for this one as she chose it, thank you babe. <br /> <br /> Be warned ....... A real shocker everywhere !!
