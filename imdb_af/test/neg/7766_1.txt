The very first time I saw it, I returned in HORROR about what is being offered as modern liberated women. Sorry, but I can't relate to idiots who are staggering about the loveless sex and acquiring Gucci. , Prada and Louis Vuitton labels. The disturbing thing is that some may actually think it's like living in NYC. This is definitely not. These women are incredibly shallow and materialistic and, like another reviewer, they act like gold graves. <br /> <br /> This is not a liberated woman and I am glad it is gone. 0 stars and just plain AWFUL
