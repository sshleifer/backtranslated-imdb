I think my summary says it all. This MTV-ish answer to the classic Candid Camera TV program has a Gen X type (or is it Gen Y) that brings in fake hackers and wears various hats and wigs and glasses, and seems to be quite strange, though often Not very interesting situations. . Example: Kennedy has a guy who invites his parents to his wedding. Kennedy is the bride, made up of a full bridal gown and long wig. The "joke" is that the parents immediately understand that their son is marrying a man who claims he no longer has his pieces. Problem is, this sktick goes too long, of course to fill in time. And Kennedy is about as funny as a dead cod lying in the sun. Candid Camera would have had three or four scenarios at the time Kennedy had to run through this one, run around and constantly ask, "I look fat?" I admit that the show wasn't made for me. It's made for 12-year-old pinheads who think JACKASS is the highlight of comedy today. Then let them laugh. Thank God, the show was brief.
