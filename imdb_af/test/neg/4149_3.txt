As a child of the 80's like so many other reviewers here, I hated the original V and V: the final battle. I own both on VHS and never get the VCR to watch them. I don't remember much about this short-lived series, but I couldn't remember why, so I hired the first disk. By the third episode, I refreshed my memory. It's terrible. The writing is over. It's not even FUN. They had a lot of stuff to work with, but they just didn't know what to do. They changed it in 'days of our life with lizard strangers'. How cool and full of potential is the concept of Elizabeth the Starchild? All they can think of is to grow her into a smart, boring teenager to compete with her mother in a romantic way? Marc Singer seems less shy to be in Beastmaster II than he did when he was caught up in this drift. The point is whether you are one of the younger people who just discovered V or one of our older scientists. To discover old fun, save yourself and SKIP THIS!
