Olivier Assayas's movie stars are Asia Argento as a woman who had a relationship with Michael Madsen. Madsen is a businessman who is in financial trouble. In despair, he will sell his share of a business to a company called Golden Eagle, a Far East company. As Madsen starts, he moves away from his company. Asia returns Argento to his life. The couple had an urgent love affair that included her doing business favors for Madsen (with the Golden Eagle). As soon as Argento enters the movie, the movie follows her as we see the intricate web she is woven and how the complications are dangerous and violently out of control. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan. Actually, I was very bored as the film seems to be going off the pillar to send much of the first hour, wondering what the point was other than giving Argento a meaty role. Argento, daughter of director Dario Argento and a director in her own right, is a unique actress. Sometimes surprisingly good, she is more often than not going to give you a strange discount image of a damaged person. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I don't think it works completely completely because the writing is too complicated to support it. I don't care what is going on, so her wounded girl just smeared me in the wrong way (she was more swampy than anything else). I don't estimate the actors, but writer / director Assayas, who once again built a complicated story with the kind of parts that actress wants to tackle, but which makes audiences scratch because they don't really work. <br /> <br /> If you need to try it on cable
