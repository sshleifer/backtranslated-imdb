Unbelievable. I never saw anything like that. Everything is bad; really bad. From photography (lots of scenes without focus!) To the play (the young woman is terrible). And what can we say about the helicopters made in Paint Brush? Actually amazing B, I mean, Z movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is bad, clich√© and badly written. Basic features for the script seem to work. I can't even imagine a young student of the theater making this movie. Nothing justifies it. <br /> <br /> I recommend not even thinking about watching this movie. Sleep or play alone is best choice. ;) <br /> <br /> xxx
