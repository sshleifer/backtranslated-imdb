It is very sad to see someone of the caliber of George C Scott in a low budget player who would have been better if the original novel was written by Graham Greene and directed by someone worse in the genre. NOT A BETTER CINEMATOGRAPHER. There are so many missed opportunities with the scenery and carnival, but only captivated, rather than captured to find the movie firmly in the exotic environment of the novel. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere in the viewer's remarks on this site, one very clever observer has complained about the variety of diabolic bad accents in this movie. Since then I have seen George C Scott as Rochester in Jane Eyre, I prayed for him never to accept a role that required him to accept a British accent. Every now and then he may only succeed for the British or a very British sounding South African who is, of course, played by an American actor. I can emphasize Meryl Streep's extraordinary effort (both British and Australian) - at least she gets it right, although with every expression she requires us to marvel at her skills. Well, I'm sorry Mr. Scott is not Meryl Streep, and it just destroys the illusion - like talking to Michele Yeoh, with excellent Mandarin with a strong Singapore accent in Crouching Tiger etc. <br /> <br /> Peterson is no different from what we see on CSI. In addition to being still very beautiful and more or less slim in this movie. He is the Harrison Ford of TV. The same old expressions for every emotion, every situation. No, the second thought, Ford has two - confused / painful and happy. I have never had a smile on Mr. CSI not seen!
