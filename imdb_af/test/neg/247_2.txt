Oh, such an original title for a very clumsy movie. The dubbing is hilarious because the voices and mouths never seem to match. As a result, I had no idea what was going on as I watched this mess unfold. There are flashbacks in the flashbacks and no real time is up to the end. The Aztec ceremony laughed at me. I reclaimed it twice and had the best workout. The singing Aztec lady is comical naturals and the dance and costumes are a hoot. Some guys get a face full of acid, there are many battles, you have no idea who is any character (not that I really care), and it's a whole noir rubble. Oh, and the real fight does not happen for a while, so during the movie you feel free to stand up, take a nap, take a trip. You will not miss anything exciting.
