I have to start by saying that the actresses and actor did a good job for what they worked with. The problem in Dark Reality is that you had a poor director who tried so hard to be innovative and exciting, he eventually destroyed the movie. From start to finish you can see that the movie reel's quality is low, but the poor lightning and shaky camera just makes it darker. The sound is muted and often not understandable. I'm sure Huston (the director) would argue that it would cause a state of panic in the audience, but he had more than enough material to do so. Leading to the camera and the way he did was a sign of the upper syndrome. <br /> <br /> The story is good. A basic sadistic female kidnapping story that clicks away by keeping the girl in a state of despair for good reason all the time. Billy Bob from Silence of the Lambs treated his victims better than Netwon. The biggest problem with the story is that the dead people are constantly damaging the main character in her mind, and by the second time they showed me that I was fast moving forward because it was trying to destroy the only decent part of the movie. <br /> In the end, the way the director showed it together with random vague things and constant scarce viewing scenes (not due to horror, due to the lighting, corners and camera) eventually has this destroy film. Huston apparently tried too hard and it looked like a bad film school project. If you want to see a decent story, it's right, but be warned that movie quality is enough for most to turn it off.
