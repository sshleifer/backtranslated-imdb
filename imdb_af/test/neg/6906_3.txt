I took my 4-year-old twin to see this movie today and I would not recommend it for children's age. <br /> <br /> This movie had many fighting scenes throughout it, which I found too violent and feared my children. <br /> <br /> The subject was far beyond my children's kicks and the death scene was too scary for a cartoon focused on kids. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed because we all looked forward to seeing it, but it just didn't cut it. If you have children under 7, I would not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The whole thing also made me crazy during the whole movie.
