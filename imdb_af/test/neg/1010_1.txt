It is slightly less sick than the first two movies, but otherwise it is as usual: a rogue, messy and unbalanced piece of sick cinema. Charles Bronson is back, blasting in action if his friend is killed by the terrorists who terrorize the neighborhood. Crime, you see, is 11% higher in the South Belmont area ... so what to do? A stronger police presence? Bigger prisons? Harder mind? No, the only solution is to send a loose cannon like Bronson to measure bloodthirsty revenge? or, as the authors would have it, justice: this time he is the personal killer of police chief Ed Lauter. <br /> <br /> The writers bow back to send Kersey the hero, sending the useless police in the area. just to seize a weapon of an elderly resident who protects it, and to provide a scene in which Kersey stole his camera and shoots the thief right into the back, applauding the crowd. Main punishment for theft? Well, okay. The attitude of everyone in the film is that it is a solution, and the dishonest distortion of the characters in digits that only exist to repair or refurbish Kersey is frightening. <br /> <br /> Sure, these villains are scum, but shouldn't the film leave the audience to settle their minds, rather than move the whole thing to Kersey and his inconsiderate answer? Strangely, the beleaguered residents are not afraid of gangsterism or Kersey guilty of any of the violence. This is strange because one character is killed exactly because of Kersey's involvement. At the end of the film, they all take guns out of their sockets and like to join them with the massacre. They never stop thinking or struggling with the thought of killing another person. <br /> <br /> The frightening level of shows doesn't help? Bronson literally has one facial expression throughout and cannot even embrace the correct words. New heights of stupidity are reached here ?? a machine gun? A rocket launcher?! ?? and New Highlights of Misogyny: The movie plans to defile every female character in sight, either by rape, explosion or throat play; and it puts them in a very stupid way, such as a victim who is in the crime-ridden, gang-controlled environment to ask a stranger, or someone who is going to shop alone at night. It is drunk, pure and simple, senseless garbage combined without style or sense.
