First of all, the whole idea of ​​making a classic shepherd like "Psycho" is nothing less than ridiculous. A lot of time and effort was wasted here. I'm sure they're smart enough to know they can't improve on the original, so they had to pay a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock on their minds. Yet, the idea that started as a benevolent tribute resulted in a slap in the face of the abomination. This movie was poorly produced, poorly acted and unnecessary to start. The original classic stands out well, even after 40 years. The Hitch event coming from the grave and to the people responsible for this piece of waste is unlikely, but if I were, I'd sleep with One Eye open just in case. Don't waste your time.
