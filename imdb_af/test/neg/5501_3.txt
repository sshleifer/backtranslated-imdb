Several things are clear after the first few minutes of this movie. First, the scenery and special effects are incredible - the best, and if everything worked differently, the tough presence could have made it a good movie. <br /> <br /> But as soon as the actors open their mouths, you suddenly realize you're sitting in your gate watching a movie. The story itself is full of cody and melodrama, and the dialogue is the worst I have ever seen. And as if it wasn't bad enough, they made a fool out of the protagonist, and in my experience you wouldn't do it unless the movie is a comedy. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: I had a hard time getting it, and I wouldn't recommend it.
