I saw this movie on Blockbuster's board and thought it looked cool. The DVD case has prompted so many good actors and I wondered, "Why have I never heard of this movie?" Then I turned the case around and saw the director, Lee Tamahori, and so the answer explained himself. <br /> <br /> First of all, I want to defeat the idea that a big role equals a big movie, but more importantly, I think I should explain why this movie is so terrible. Well, the writing is terrible and full of one-dimensional characters. It's the worst role I've ever seen playing Chazz Palminteri and I'm surprised he'll do something that is ridiculous. But undervalued talented actors have to earn their money. Palminteri plays a one-dimensional police detective who comes about as silly as a C-movie mob handler. He, along with the chief detective (the poorly directed Nolte), the big but simple Michael Madsen, and the late Chris Penn (whose role has been completely discarded with Madsen's) make up an elite group of detectives, which the city must evacuated. from gangsters somewhere in the late 30's or 40's. The film introduces this group as police who will break every law to ensure that those who think they are above the law do not work in their city. At the start of the film, the police snapped up a local restaurant, grabbed an alleged murderer (William Peterson) and brought him to a place they call the Mulholland waterfall. They throw him away from one of the cliffs on Mullholland Drive and it is supposed to demonstrate how serious these guys are about the city of crime. Whatever. It was nothing but a cheap excuse to use a crappy title designed to make you think of LA and its well-known sites. Somewhere later, they find the dead body of Jennifer Connelly and the plot begins. <br /> <br /> Towards the direction of almost amateur and weak! Aside from the fact that the characters were B-movie quality, the police chiefs and the terrible Daniel Baldwin had some highlights that made this movie look like it was Lee. Tamhori's first movie. There is not one good performance in the film apart from perhaps Melanie Griffith, who may argue was the worst in the movie (she won a Razzie for this movie). In the end it was her character who was not so good and she really didn't have much to work with. <br /> <br /> As with any bad movie, everything starts with the writing, and this writing was no jewel. Plot is simply formulated based on the setting of the next scene and never takes into account the characters' motivation. The way the characters behaved was incredible. Police take the law into their own hands in the right circumstances (see LA CONFIDENTIAL), but in this case these guys seemed to be able to get away with anything, including murder, and never lose sight of something to clean up . I think we as an audience are just supposed to assume that nobody has seen anything and that people will not ask questions. Everything about the story is predictable and spoon is so well fed that we understand everything a good time will happen before the characters do. However, this doesn't make us feel smart, but rather makes us angry about how stupid the hero is, despite the fact that there are no heroes in this movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, the best component of the movie was the big score by David Grusin. From the beginning, it has been addressing a since CHINATOWN, which quickly fades when I realized how incredible just about everything was in the movie. It didn't surprise me to learn that it made a powerful eleven million in the cash register. What I will say is that this movie is worth watching for a few laughs. Nick Nolte's play is like an unsuccessful pet, and I laughed every time he tried to be serious. I also almost fell to the floor at each of the slow motion shots used in the movie (I think there are three with one during a key ring scene). If you have to use slow motion in the heat of a dramatic moment, you have clear problems. So, even with my negative criticism, I would recommend this movie for the purpose of seductive laughter, that is, if you value the good movies such as LA.
