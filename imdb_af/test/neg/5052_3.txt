You know, I really get tired of all the generic music used in these types of movies (see Jawbreaker, Disturbing Behavior, etc.). Every scene of true tension here (and there are some) is immediately suppressed with a bit of cheesy spelling, which dilutes the tension completely. Why are they doing this? Of course, to sell soundtracks, of course, but in this case, mission inexplicably - did someone buy the CD? <br /> <br /> Yes, ma'am. Mirren attacks her role with a sense of pleasure (with a couple of cheez-wiz joints). But what do Molly, Leslie and Vivica do here? Their roles (they are so underutilized that I can't use characters here) have no purpose in the storyline, so I can't figure out why three famous actresses were thrown. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the end is so incredibly hackneyed and irresponsible. The children leave the lap and act like nothing happened - everyone smiles at graduation. They are criminals, people! No consequences for their actions (kidnapping, assault, rating) - nothing. <br /> <br /> Little things too - was Tingle's story about her husband true? What is the crossbow? Would the virgin Katie character lose her cherry on such a whim? (Big message, guys.) Why did McKean go to her house? How did Kate's academic noses pass through the door at that exact moment? How do students even get teachers' home addresses? WHAT IS WITH JEFFREY TAMBOR ?? On what basis did McKean fire Tingle? She was looted, murdered and held hostage by students, Mrs. Cripe! <br /> <br /> Oh, I'm spending more on the script than Mr. Williamson apparently did, so I'll stop here. br /> <br /> 3/10
