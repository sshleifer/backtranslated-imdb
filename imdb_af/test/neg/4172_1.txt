Apparently it was an award winner. Apparently someone had a gun on his head and was the power to nominate Maize: the movie. <br /> <br /> It should have been a mistake. <br /> <br /> It's the most uncompromising movie ever made. The show and editing is the biggest horror of this movie. Two little girls get lost in a maize field and are bumped by someone who can be laughed under his rubber mask. The little girls walk in their hero's dad, and then walk away from him, W.T.F. The hero-dad in the movie watches them in the few minutes to see it. <br /> <br /> Of course, the girls were not trained actors and had no sense. They were so annoying and so childless in the movie, it's not even remote. To hear them screaming over and over like a broken record was the reason I got up and gone. You can't even listen to this movie without almost convincing. <br /> <br /> I can generate a better award winner than this garbage.
