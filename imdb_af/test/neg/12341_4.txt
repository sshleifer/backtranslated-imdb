Director Michael Ritchie and actor Robert Redford's second drama play, The Candidate, is a political satire that still looks fresh and appropriate today. So it is a pity that 'Downhill Racer' occurred for a short while, it looks so dated in contrast. The music is ugly, and perhaps the innovative ski range is now standard in television coverage of the sport. The world of skiing seems strangely amateurish (probably accurate, given the time the movie was made, but it's hard to relate to today's professional world), and the theme of Americans in Europe also looks hundreds in a age of ever easier travel. Perhaps the biggest problem is the flat plot, centered on the arrogant but mysterious hero; Unfortunately, this is a terrible achievement by Redford, which gives us little insight into his caring or motivation. And a character-driven movie without much of a character is never a good bet. I expected a lot, but unfortunately it is a boring movie.
