This show makes me crazy. It's all about a family, even if it's meant to be a comedy. The show is supposed to follow Dave and Vicky Gold (Michael Rapaport and Anita Barone) as they raise their three teenage children: Hilary, Larry and Mike. A good place for a comedy yes, but that doesn't mean it's a good show. <br /> <br /> I don't think I've ever heard of parents talking to children and conversely. The only talk that appears in the show is the control of children by parents and sex. I know that sexual intercourse is usually a topic that is often spoken by teenagers, but it is educated in almost every episode, with no point in it. The one episode I just watched, the parents involved, and they gave their daughter, Hilary, a car. Not once do you think they are in any way related to the way they talk to each other and how the parents talk about how Hilary is like their slave. "<br /> <br /> The show fails at the comedy level most. I haven't even laughed at this show in the numerous times I tried to see it, and I'm a person doing such movies As Animal House and Dumb and Dumber have given very high marks, Michael Rapaport is a very good actor and why he chooses to destroy his career by making this piece of garbage show is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Parents , make sure your children never and I never mean to see it. Teenagers, you will probably have a laugh out of this just for the blatant sexual references, but nothing comes from it and then you feel nice. > <br /> 1 1/2/5 Stars.
