I'm sorry, but it really feels like a modern Apollo 13 knock. Totally indescribable (at least Armageddon FELT like a cartoon! It felt like a bad high school movie project), acting about cliché as you can get, and .... a spacecraft on a LA highway land? Come on. Seriously. Jerry, what did you think? And all the clichés: The pregnant astronaut's wife, the nosie reporter who gets in everyone's way, the stalwart driver with "Go Fever". And it's one thing to turn the laws of physics or politics or whatever to make an entertaining story, but at least make it good! Fact and science were completely slaughtered for it. The spacecraft does not have a fuel tank in its wings, and even if it did, it could not operate by moving fuel between them (nor a DC-10). <br /> <br /> If you want bad acting, bad storytelling, low realism and cheesy cliches, this one can't be beaten!
