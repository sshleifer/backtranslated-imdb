As a writer and a dilapidated Orthodox Jewish woman, I was severely dismissed by this movie. The dialogue is hackneyed and wasteful, the characters involved with lines ranging from the shaky prosaic to the beautifully melodramatic, are not allowed to expand into truly structured individuals. The one-trick musical score tries to make up for the moody, which sharply shouts to throw the viewer and the writing out of long-lasting katatonia. <br /> <br /> Like an adolescent revolutionary on a self-righteous tirade, this movie is blown away by the wisdom of its revelation - the patriarchy is wrong - and devours its energies to the point. The resulting artistic crime is a complete lack of imaginative development; The moral crime is reducing people to caricature: martyrs and grotesque.
