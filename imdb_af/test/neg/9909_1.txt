Including Big Spoilers, by chance, you would actually care about the story line. <br /> <br /> OK, we have storms that destroy a city and a computer hacker, cutting the power grid. <br /> <br /> Predictable sklock from the start, and if not enough, kill the 5 second action between the movie and the ads that had little potential. For example: will they go to the airport in time? Things seem dull as we go to a commercial and shoot the action before the ad shows them bouncing off the plane! Well, I think they will definitely make it, but then they had to be good guys again. <br /> <br /> The acting wasn't too impressive (exception and welcome relief: Randy Quaid as Tornado Tommy), the effects were a bit lame, the bad guys did, and the good guys came through . The real disaster of this movie was the writing, especially the end. Not only did they have any congratulations on a cancellation as soon as a sea phone call had 24 hours, but they thought the hacker so well. So he caused a bazillion death? He meant well. And, of course, an uplifting final TV report on people coming together. Barf. This was all I expected from the ads, and I'm glad I was wasting my time watching it. It will make a good conversation tomorrow at the lunch table. <br /> <br /> Is CBS insulted by doing so? Sure ?? But we looked at it, didn't we? Have you counted a lot of ads, did the home backup computers have been on this pig? <br /> <br /> Here's the hope of the next Plan 9 from outer space (which gets better with every viewer). This is not it. <br /> <br /> 1 star.
