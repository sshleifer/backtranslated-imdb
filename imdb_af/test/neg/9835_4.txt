The Girl in Lovers Lane is one strange little low-budget movie. On his surface, the film tells the story of a loud brave, Bix (Brett Halsey), who spends his time for a young child named Danny (Lowell Brown) and the girl, Carrie (Joyce Meadows), who meets Bix who will love to look out for him. Nothing too interesting happens (Bix goes out with Carrie, Bix gets Danny out of trouble, Carrie's dad drinks a lot, etc.) Up to about 10 minutes to go into the movie when Carrie is killed. Her father blames Bix, pulls him out of a prison cell and just kills him. Now their roles are reversed and Danny has to save Bix. <br /> <br /> Until I read the reviews on IMDb, I thought it was just me who read more in Bix and Danny's relationship than was really there, but now I see I'm not alone . It was very clear to me that Bix and Danny had more relationship than you usually see in a film in 1959. The homosexual nature of their relationship, while never openly expressed, is quite clear. Their life and sleep arrangements, Bix's reaction to finding Danny in bed with a prostitute, Bix's inability to commit to Carrie, and the call to the end when Danny tells his parents is a friend who has a friend burned, a few examples of moments that lead to the inevitable conclusion that there is more to their relationship than is initially apparent. I'm sure they exist, but I can't think of any movies I've seen of the 50's that scream as much as homosexual. br /> <br /> As far as the movie is concerned, I don't know another way to put it. This is boring. As I wrote earlier, nothing happens for 90% of the running time. The characters are boring and the actors aren't good enough to give The Girl in Lovers Lane much of a spark. The one-off exception is Jack Elam. His crazy Jesse is the one character who is interesting enough to be worth it. The biggest problem I had with the movie was with character motivation and logic. Carrie is chilly D and Bix is ​​immediately accused? What about crazy Jesse who Carrie probably suppressed her whole life? Anyone think Jesse where he was that night? Her father saw how he would disturb Carrie at night, but he never thought the learning Jai might have anything to do with his daughter's death? There is not much logic. And what about Jesse's confession? Danny grabs Jesse's lap and that's all it takes to force a confession from Jesse? Real tough guy, huh? Why would he confess so easily? And after confessing, nobody thinks to grab him? It is very nice to just sit down and not run down Jesse. In any other reality he would never have flushed his stomach and would have been like a hurry if he was caught for the murder. The fact that The Girl in Lovers Lane asks me to accept this ridiculous act of characters is something I am not prepared to do. Overall, I give The Girl in Lovers Lane a 4/10.
