I bought this movie and hope it would be another big killer toy movie. I'm a big fan of the Child's Play series and hoped to see the same here. Boy, was I wrong. Most of the movie was not the least scary, and the only time we really see Pinocchio "alive" is the last few scenes of the movie. The girl in the movie, her acting is so bad, it's almost laughing. Plus, the end never showed what happened to the puppet, or what made the girl in an asylum or where she was at the end of the movie. So, in my opinion, this movie is the worst of the "killer toy" genre. If you want a good killer toy series, stick to the Child's Play franchise. Pinocchio's Revenge is a waste of money and time.
