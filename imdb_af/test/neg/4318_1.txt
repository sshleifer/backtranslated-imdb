OK I went to this site before I watched this movie, read the comments, pumped them, because they were all good for a B movie - it looked and was totally disappointed. The main characters wannabe wages rebel straight from the mid-west act were sick to the stomach and didn't even get me started on the two police, I mean there's a bloody door right there, in a simple view, check it out ! The plot was completely predictable, the editing was rather limited, I swear the editor even dipped near the end when he cut this movie, and the direction was furious with bad cinematography. Now you can't misunderstand me, I love B flicks, some are really good. <br /> <br /> Want to see a good B-given movie ??? <br /> <br /> Dave recommends <br /> <br /> "High Voltage" <br /> <br /> http://imdb.com/title/tt0338095/
