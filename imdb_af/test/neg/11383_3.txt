I was interested in the movie. It turned out it could be a serious drama, dealing with death, sadness and healing, with some realistic human conflict being thrown in. Oh, it didn't stop. <br /> <br /> I need a movie with somewhat consistent and credible characters. Too many characters in this movie are laid out as extremely gullible and contradictory. Look, I know it wasn't supposed to be Shakespeare, but come on, I need some quality in writing and characterization. <br /> <br /> The acting was good, the writing not so much. At one stage, James Brolin's character is relied upon to appear on a picnic underwear. He says his order won't work. His new wife says that if he goes home and changes, she will rip his clothes later. It's a cheat. This movie has some unintentionally funny lines. <br /> <br /> It was hard to worry about Jame's Brolin's character. When he first gave his first wife's things to his new wife, and even his daughter was killed, I lost most of my sympathy. Who really care about what happens to him. I have to admit I didn't finish the movie. If it has a quality of 180 over the past 45 minutes, let me know. It was just unpleasant to look at and so predictably I felt it was not necessary to finish it.
