Extremely slow movie. There are good performances by all actors. This is why top 5 scores. Surya and Jyo are supposed to be this ideal man and woman and we are shown until it comes to a point you are beginning to ask, there is a story. one day Jyo discovers Surya's diary to find his failed college love story. The college love story is totally unconvincing, as Surya is an arrogant Senior who always picks up Bhoomika, fades away her friend, shouts with her in public and despite his horror she falls in love with him. Even afterwards, he remains dominated by crude language. I certainly can't appreciate the gentle character played by Bhoomika. I don't think a self-respecting woman will fall into real life for such jerks. So. Jyo decides to bring them along and what happens next is the climax. The story is extremely poor in its characters. An extremely arrogant Surya to Bhoomika is exactly the opposite of Jyo (and there's no reason for the sudden change in character). " A very humble Bhoomika becomes a great outside wall when she returns. Wonder, if she changed so much confidence, she didn't try to find her love, because she didn't fear anyone anymore.
