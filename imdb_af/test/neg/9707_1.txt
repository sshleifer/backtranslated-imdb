If you've never heard of Jane Austen, seeing the original movie or the 1995 adaptation of the BBC, or even a pop-up version of the book, then this dangerous attempt to make this classic love story come true. show, be vague. <br /> <br /> The opening scene should be remembered for its horrible acting, horrible mistakes and complete lack of Jane Austen's classic white. <br /> <br /> Whoever has decided to cast actors (with the exception of the excellent Judi Dench) who has never heard of Jane Austen, let her be punished! Keira Knightley grins and grins every scene, and comes across the fact that it is so diligent that no one wants to marry her! Darcy looks as though he is trying to remember his lines throughout the film and the rest of the Bennet girls were changing in the lack of portrayal of their characters as they were originally written. <br /> <br /> This version did not show the right pride and prejudice that both Darcy and Elizabeth suffered and at the end of the longest two hours of my life, who care if they come together or not! Absolutely uncomfortable - even the too few minutes of Judi Dench cannot save this litter. I can't think of anything good about this movie except it finally ended!
