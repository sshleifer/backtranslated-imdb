Poor Jane Austen should be glad she is not around to see this terrible wreck of an adjustment. So many good Jane Austen movies recently came out that this one should be earned permanently with two other movies I despise. The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit and the 1969 version of David Copperfield. My main steak with the movie is that it misses the point of the book completely. Jane Austen was making fun of the Gothic mania in her society, and much of the novel is in the cheek. The movie, however, is serious and comes in terribly melodramatic. The sad, tasty taste of Austen's writing is completely and remarkably absent from this ponderous foray. Iinto horror meets period drama. The scenes of Catherine's imagination are both free and uninteresting. Also, Henry Tilney is extremely unattractive. Why do I ask, will someone fall for him? If you're looking for a fun Jane Austen evening, see Emma earlier!
