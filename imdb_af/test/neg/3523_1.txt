When the ground runs, the movie starts with THREE murders in a row. No plot, no characters, no motivation; The second murder happens from the screen, and the victim's cut head is actually used to kill the third victim! It's a high point. But of course the Lewisse is smart enough to lead with power; Soon they will cover dialogue scenes with detective voice-over and shoot endless snappy repartee in ugly wide shot. This Betacam production's horror atmosphere is now rapidly forming an insurance infrastructure atmosphere, with the monumental (and rather engaging) minds of the leaders who are skewed toward things. Shlub police investigate, meat vault man butchers, repeat, climb early with an unforgettable cut-finger-in-the-salad gag. Just how the hell did the fingers get in the salad? And wasn't it the blood cult's purpose to gather the supplements they cut? When the GORE doesn't make sense, you know you're in trouble. And without spoiling the great, unbeatable strife, just take my word for it: the fascinating incompetence of the first scenes makes for a deep cathode-tube-shattering impulse. The basic reaction is to try to put it behind you and continue with your life.
