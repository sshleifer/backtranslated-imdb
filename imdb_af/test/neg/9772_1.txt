I think the "Bone Snatcher" should go to someone associated with this movie. To see it will look like the longest 90 minutes or so of your entire life. The plot is boring and stupid. There were no horrible scenes, even remotely. If you endure this good piece of cinema completely to the end, you're going to be disappointed or dying hysterically. I bought this movie based on other reviews I want to read. I wish I had my money back. What a skunker. If you are looking for a horror movie that will interest you, see "Your Turn". It can be based on a cookie-like plot, but it's full of those creepy scenes that make you jump from start to finish.
