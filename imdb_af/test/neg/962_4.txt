Rudolph Méé's 1950 film is a refurbishment for the 80's. Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid) is a university lecturer who had a successful writing career, but now it's the tubes with his marriage. The initial outline plans the idea in the viewers to think that everyone has something against him, so when the revelation comes that he is poisoned, we are not surprised unless of course you are familiar with the original. Dexter, after saying he has less than 48 hours to live, decides to trace his steps back to one of his students Sydney Fuller (Meg Ryan), but they find they have many obstacles in their path. <br /> <br /> The film starts out promising in black and white, as Dexter raises in the rain to the local police station where he wants to report a murder ... his own, but the Huey Lewis style 80's beat what accompanies Being from this scene just serves to remove any sense of tension and tells the viewer that it will be pretty bad, it's just a matter of how bad? Sure enough, we quickly use the old flashback medium, but now the movie goes over to the full Technicolor. There are a few short reminiscences to Noir, as the embracing couple are standing in front of a blind blind, but there is really nothing here to recommend, the shows are terrible, especially Ryan does her usual dizzy blonde with a blinking rooipynroetine. The film is a lazy effort to put unnecessary ooomph into both fine movie footage. Obviously they are trying to get cash in one of the Body Heat schools. The apparent results are undoubtedly aimed at a teenage audience and they are welcome. 10/04
