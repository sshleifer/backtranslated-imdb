After I had Neil Gaiman's writing (especially his collaboration with Yoshitaka Amano in "The Dream Hunters"), I considered Mirrormask a sure thing and was very disappointed. The start, live action section of the movie was intriguing enough. The relationships between the characters were credible and easy to empathize with, and I loved the sets, the costume, and Helena's art. However, the subsequent computer-generated scenes were disillusioned. The dialogue was uncomfortable and pretentious, the interaction between the live actors and the CGI frightening. Events occurred for the flimsiest reasons, and most events were redundant until whatever plan existed. I just watched the first twenty or thirty minutes of the movie, so I'm not actually an authority, but I strongly recommend that you don't look at it and stick to Gaiman's strong writing.
