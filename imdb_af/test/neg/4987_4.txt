Story of the creation of Underdog and adventures that Simon Bar Sinister struggles with in a lively action format. First, we took Showshine off the street and brought to a laboratory for scientific experiments where Simon Bar Sinister works. He fights back when Sinister tries to inject him with chemicals, and accident occurs, he gets superpowers and the lab blows Sinister up. On the street, Shoeshine runs afoul of another dog, Riff Raff, and is being taken up by Jim Belushi, a guard at the lab. Belushi's son discovers that Shoeshine has all these powers and eventually Shoeshine becomes Underdog, who will again fight Sinister. <br /> <br /> After deciding that a real dog will be under the dog, you limit yourself to whether the movie is going to work or not. For me, the film works half and half. The part that is not, is all the things you see Shoeshine, the dog, as a dog with his master. Some of the repartee is funny, but it just goes on and on as we are introduced to Sweet Polly and her mistress and we go through all the typical shows you can do. It is deadly 20 or 25 minutes and effectively kills the movie. It is painfully dull and feels that it is needed forever to get through it. Considering the movie is about 75 minutes of credits, something you don't want to do. <br /> <br /> The good stuff is anything. with Simon Bar Sinister (Peter Dinklage is an explosion) and anything that Underdog is in action. Some how they have managed to find a way that is both twisted and the spirit of the cartoon and to update it. Of course, I can be wrong, as the middle part is so boring, but I don't think since I look forward to getting it on the cable again. <br /> <br /> On the whole, it's probably as horrible as some people have said, but if you can wait for the cable where you can stumble on the good parts, it's a good cartoon to adjust. (But wait for the cable really)
