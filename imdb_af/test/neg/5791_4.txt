As a resident of the CA, I would like to see the jackholes that shut down the electricity plants to raise prices, also get a jail term. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was pretty good and has some very informative pieces. While holding on to how Enron got up and crashed, I found it very interesting. But when the movie focused on the anti-Bush slope, it made me wonder if they were really accurate. <br /> <br /> It is good to show any connection between the Republicans to Enron, but the monster was created while Clinton was president. The CA energy crisis took place under Davis's watch. Both were in office during Enron's abuse but were not held liable. On the contrary, many minutes are spent on how Bush was friends with Lay. Approximately? Play golf with Clinton and spend the night in the Lincoln bedroom. Why are democratic people given such a free pass in this movie? I think most politicians are a waste of our taxpayer money, so I'm not part of one of the parties, but I hate feeling as though I am subject to someone's political agenda when I watch a documentary. Yes, politicians deserve some debt, but I really doubt that the only culprit they have R's after their names. I didn't find any value in the depiction of the Bushes as Kay lovers when Democrats received just as much Enron campaigns as Republicans did. As I said, it weakened the rest of the movie for me because it made me suspicious of the rest of the facts they explained.
