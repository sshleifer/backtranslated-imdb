Two days ago I got the chance to watch this movie on Cable (TV Asia). I have been disturbed since then. The movie "Baghban" was very successful in portraying just one side of real life. It is highly partial to parents. Have you ever thought of others (kids)? There are few parents in this world who only give birth to their children, but do not provide parental care. I'm a victim of that. Why do you (parents) want 5 children in your life if you only make Rs 2000 a month? I was stranded in the street with my brothers and sisters. I have no idea how I managed to reach IIT. Since then it's been a long time, but I still don't believe it. Now I'm here a research scientist in the US. I carefully provided all my needs to my parents by my two brothers staying with them. They couldn't give us basic things if we were kids. I find this movie very malicious. It's very partial. This made my sentiments very deep. I strongly encourage the producer / director of this movie to also watch the Indian community and make another movie. I can be reached at john_simension@yahoo.com
