This film is honestly one of the best movies of all time ... if you suffer from insomnia. It's a fool-safe way to ensure hours of sleep at a time. As the film progresses slowly, the audience slips into a state of unconsciousness and loses sight of the appearance of any kind of plot the film actually contains. This effect is surely created because of the lack of lovely action / lovely babies. <br /> <br /> Of course, Eisenstein was unable to master the art of assembly. A prime example of this is the scene on the Odessa steps. For no apparent reason, a real-life event that took a matter of seconds would turn into a seven-night nightmare for any healthy viewer. This editing error generates any kind of realism throughout the movie. Honestly, I've seen more realistic editing watching cartoons. <br /> <br /> Some individuals who commented on this title welcomed Battleship Potemkin as: "One of the best movies of all time" and "Truly a masterpiece". Well, I'm writing this comment to persuade readers to avoid watching this movie at all costs. My best guess is that my fellow Potemkin critics simply wrote the wrong words in their summaries. Certainly, what they meant was, "One of the greatest snooze festivals of all time" and, "Actually, an epic failure." <br /> <br /> Finally, don't waste your time. If you're interested in watching a movie of superior quality, go to www.youtube.com and watch a Halo 3 montage. If I played the movie "Battleship Potemkin" in a game of a victim on guardian, I would face it with my sniper rifle and then hold his dead body. PEACE!
