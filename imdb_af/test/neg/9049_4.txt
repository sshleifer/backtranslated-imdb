Gone Alive plays like a bad rehearsal for next year's Cannibal Ferox. The characters are universally thin, the sites are criminally underutilized, there is no attempt to create tension or tension. The physical effects are either stealthily badly or stupidly stolen from other films, and the ubiquitous rape styles are hardly a PG-13. The only shocking scene involves crazy Jonas, going a little Goldfinger, wearing a blood-consumed dildo; a scene that is just bizarre, rather than graphical. My beloved wife, she of the 'Romeo and Juliet Collector's Edition', watched this movie, without much disgust! And it calls him a cannibal movie! All-in-all, a great effort that betrays the Cannibal tradition thoroughly. Luci's succession, Cannibal Ferox, is a much better example of the genre.
