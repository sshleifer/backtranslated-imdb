the plot of this movie revolves around this submarine builder who is a real bastard and he wants to launch his new sub that can travel thousands of feet deep. Unfortunately, he can't. Oh yes, and he was haunted by the memories of his mother and father to be eaten by a megalodon when he was a child. the man meets some scientists who are beautiful, and they and this crew of about one hundred people went out on the main character's submarine to kill the same megalodon that his parents murdered. Now, the shark in this movie is a very fake CGI shark. basically it's kind of like Shark Attack 3, except more depressed. If you don't get what I mean, listen. The film's opening credits show "home movies" of the main character when he was a child with his parents before they were murdered, and there is much sad and depressing piano music playing in the background. you will expect to see a shark or something, and you do it. A short shadow of the CGI shark floats every few seconds, but that's just it. I also do not remember one happy facial expression during the whole time of the film, a majority of the film takes place in the dark depths of the abyss, where the story becomes even more beautiful and all the characters (the shark also) die in the end. I thought Sabato would kill the shark and manage to save himself and the girl, but no, they all die and the movie ends with the shark, everything blows up, and the submarine (with Sabato's crushed and burnt body in it) sinks. in the abyss. If you are a happy person and you do not like being depressed, avoid this movie. If you're the opposite, then luck, you've found your movie.
