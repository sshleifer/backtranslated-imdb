Low budget secret. A shot rattles out of the dark and a woman is seen from that direction. A young architect Jimmy McMillan (Chick Chandler) discovers a missing body. The woman who is in a hurry, Mary (June Clyde), is connected to the screen; but that is McMillan who has to solve the case to prevent serious suspicion. Suspects are six shop owners around the crime scene. All the atmosphere of Film-Noir; but not quite the right thing. This movie is just enough to be a decent low budget secret / drama and is a nice little escape. Other players include: George Meeker, Michael Raffetto, Milton Wallace and Rebel Randall.
