I don't know why they even kept the name. How they could call the series 'The Scarlet Pimpernel', after deviating so much from the novels, I would have had no idea. The character names are the only thing they kept, and even then they changed and mixed some of them and changed Percy's relationships with them. Although I only watched about two hours, it was enough for me to realize that the series was nothing like Baroness Orzcy portrayed her characters and would probably have been in her grave when it filmed and aired. Poor woman. I hope that when the next person wants to make a movie / series of the book, it doesn't ruin it as completely as this series did.
