As a flagship show, Attack of the Show (AOTS) is endemic to the wider fall of G4 TV; This is a show (and a drive) that has so far fallen in love with sex to try to cover up its sharp mistakes. His predecessor, The Screen Savers, was a place to solve technology problems and eliminate the latest and greatest in technology. It was a nice show with a pleasant staff and it was nice to see the modding and other experiments that the crew could see. <br /> <br /> Acquiring TechTV through G4 bothered a few long-standing fans of the station. but early returns were actually promising. The emphasis on gambling was a great addition and I enjoyed a lot of the coverage of E3 and other great entertainment activities. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, AOTS now stands as a shell of its former self. Those who oversee the channel have shifted the channel's focus away from technology and gaming and to anything that can attract young adult chicks. The result is that AOTS spend so much time on Olivia Munn or attribute the adult movie industry, as it covers games. It's so bad that it's virtually incompatible. <br /> <br /> While some may find joyful joy from this kind of thing, those who really enjoy can wonder where the good coverage went. Equally disturbing young players who may have G4 in mind that they are playing games - that active gambling group between 10-15 - are instead fed with a more mature audience. On a channel like HBO or Cinemax things are expected as they are. At G4, it's tragic. <br /> <br /> At least SpikeTV, another male-oriented channel, has good programming like CSI. AOTS, and G4, have very little to offer. <br /> <br /> Too bad, really.
