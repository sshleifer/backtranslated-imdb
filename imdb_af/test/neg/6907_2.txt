I can't believe the number of people referring to the main characters as "boy cows"! there are no such people !! There are cows and bulls and all male cattle are bulls and have no udders !!!! There was even a real bull, but it was like another kind of animal! my god it's like drawing human ears on a cat, boobs on superman or mickey mouse with blonde shirley temple curls - even in animation it just doesn't work! To give human characteristics to the animals is nothing new and is expected, but changing their real bodies into basically a transsexual figure is bizarre for a family story. How many people editors, writers, producers, animators saw it and didn't know better or didn't say anything - it's amazing! I'm not a snob and I love animation simpsons, beavis & butthead, south park, even ice age and all the other new ones out there - the fence was fantastic - but it's nuts - quite nuts - I couldn't accept it that many people are ignorant and I still hoped a reason for the udders in the film - an explanation - nobody came - and at the end when they kept this little newborn calf and half, the belly is udder and speaks they a boy 'I almost stunned !!!! please, author / creator lets us in on the joke!
