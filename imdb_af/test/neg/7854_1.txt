I am a fan of good historical fiction, and was excited about the idea that someone would take a well-written book series and film it. Writing is not like writing regular fiction, but if you have a book that fits you, it would be nice to actually follow the plot line. <br /> <br /> The depictions of the Vespasians (the actual emperor and his 2 sons Titus and Domitian) were terrible. They acted like a cookie hunter Caligula, and were the bad guys in this adjustment. There was a scene with Titus expressing justice as if he were Caligula (of the movie of the same name). The way the Vespasiani is portrayed in the books mostly follows the reports of historians who wrote in that period - they were fair and healthy. , not shamed by imperial Claudian madness. <br /> <br /> Helena (the love interest of Marcus Didius Falco) gave the reason for the separation of Pertinax (one of the traitors referred to in the title) was that he was a traitor, but was in the books because he ignored her and she felt that she would be better off marrying someone who valued her as a person. <br /> <br /> Marcus in the movie gets a slave Justus, but in the books he could barely afford his apartment, let alone a slave. There was certainly no romantic intervention between the non-existent slave Justus and a female gladiator. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you want good cookie cutters, Roman stereotypes will get Caligula, if you want a good Roman from the classic history standpoint, I get, Claudius.
