Lord, it sucked. There is a specific type of sexual revolution of the 60's that manages to confuse sexual assault with sexual liberation. This movie is an example. I tracked the number of times women slapped, beaten, beaten or slapped in the movie. And then there are times when women in the movie fantasize that they are beaten, beaten or beaten (you know they want it right?). Sometimes it seems to be part of safe fetish play-acting. Other times it is clear, but you will have to wait in vain to report the heroine to authorities that she has just been raped. Instead, we hear that she is being told by her rapist about her inability to "let go". <br /> <br /> Every scene of this film series of misogyny (speaking as a straight, white, married man in his late 30s, not a teenage lesbian woman study, with a slide on her shoulder so you not the wrong idea.) <br /> <br /> Perhaps the one good thing about this movie is that it gives a sharp reminder to just how bad things really were for women just a few decades ago.
