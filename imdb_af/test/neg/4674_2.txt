I saw this movie last night. <br /> <br /> And I'm worried that I'm in one of the left liberal turns they really enjoy in South Park. Because I found this very offensive. Am I ridiculously sensitive? First, there is the old staple food that America is the only country in the world that is physically capable of anything, ever. <br /> <br /> Second, and chillingly, there is the early meteor strike that strikes (unnamed ?? why do they need a name?) Asian country. The reaction to this is to regard it as a warning. As in "my god, imagine the tragedy that * could happen". Because you know it happened to Asians. It can happen to white Americans, and * it * will be tragic. <br /> <br /> Then, later, a larger meteorite becomes Paris. Our throw on the ground is annoyed, as it may mean our boys have less time than they thought. Not very upset in America. Not mentioned that many people have died. <br /> <br /> Then there's Michael Clarke Duncan. A wonderful actor, wasted. Never was a black man such a sign. Among a team of hardcore drillers, his work seems to stand out in the back and occasionally say, "Hey, you, man." Really. Why did they even bring him? It's not like he's petite - he didn't weigh the shuttle for anything! Not once does he lift up a tool, stab a spaceship or help solve anything that inflates. <br /> <br /> Even if you ignore Russian food maker (Peter Stormare, another great actor wasted in a useless role) who seems drunk most of the time and does things with keys, instead of confirming them, because "That's how we do in Russia", it's pretty scary. <br /> <br /> Of course, all the blue, blue-eyed American kids are cementing all fours in wheat fields to be saved and everything is right. Because all death and destruction to the rest of the world is irrelevant. <br /> <br /> You expect the bad writing, the dodgy acting, to be the unreliable plot (fat, middle-aged men trained in 12 days to be astronauts? including one that seems to be delayed?). But I couldn't believe the racism and xenophobia involved in the film and the indifference to the lives of anyone who didn't feed American wheat. <br /> <br /> This is a different charge of the attitude of a part of Western society to the world. <br /> <br /> And it's also a crappy movie.
