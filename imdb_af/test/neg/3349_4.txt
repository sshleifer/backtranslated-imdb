I saw it on a cheap DVD edition entitled "The Entity Force". Since I enjoyed the 80-year-old horror movies, I thought I was a real surprise. Unfortunately, the movie is mostly boring and you are constantly waiting for something to happen. Eventually, it gets a bit interesting, but it's in the last quarter of the movie. This is a case of too little late. When the action happens, it's not that good, what we get is dead bodies 'floating' along the ground and chasing the girls in the mausoleum. It's not the absolute worst thing I've ever seen, but you can do much better. I would only recommend it to the hard-hired collectors of the 80-year-old horror.
