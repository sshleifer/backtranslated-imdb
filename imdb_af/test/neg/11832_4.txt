"The death of an artist on a Broadway stage plays a theater critic and a police detective as an unlikely crime-dissolving duo. The descendants of the dead artist are not merely the object of affection for our critic, but Also a major suspect in this death and other murders taking place at the theater "The Phantom Killer" sets his mind on the young woman as his next victim, so it's a race by the time our heroes can catch the killer , "according to the DVD sleeve summary. <br /> <br /> Milton Raison's script sparks a bit in this low-budget mystery whodunit. Helping, Dave O'Brien (like Anthony" Tony "Woolrich) starring, his skills as an actor appear to be far greater than the productions that employ him, O'Brien and cabin driver Frank Jenks (such as Egbert "Romeo" Egglehoffer) would be a fine 1950s TV surveillance team Leading lady Kay Aldridge (like Claudia Moore) and supporting role-players is also good. Unfortunately, the story becomes winding and anti-climax. <br /> <br /> **** The Phantom of 42nd Street (5/2/45) Albert Herman ~ Dave O'Brien, Kay Aldridge, Frank Jenks
