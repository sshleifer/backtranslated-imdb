Okay with this movie there are a number of ingredients at work: <br /> <br /> First put a lot of hillbilly truckers - good ole boys who have a secret desire to take the law into their own hands. Second, in the wicked, policemen controlled a Texas pants. Third pit in karate fighting trucker games played by Chuck Norris. Fourth in a bunch of teenager than Norris's cousin captured by the evil hillbilly policemen. Fifth show Chuck Norris fights slowly. <br /> <br /> Now, everything mixes and what do you have? <br /> <br /> You guessed it ... a very mediocre movie!
