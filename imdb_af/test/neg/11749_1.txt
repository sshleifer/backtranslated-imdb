Let's start by saying that this re-created version of one of the greatest ever created movies "Psycho" (1960) is nothing but a good example of poor direction, poor acting and poor role. The best way to describe this movie is to compare it step by step, acting by acting and processing through the process to the original. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock, one of the greatest movie directors ever lived, had the intention of shooting the original in black and white despite the availability of color at that time. Okay, people in 1960 may not have been to bloodshed or horrible scenes as much as we are today, but it didn't stop people from being loved and nominated for 4 Oscars. Gus Van Sant had absolutely no reason to leave it in color, except that the year was 1998. What would seem realistic in color did not. After the shower scene Norman flushed his hands, it is easy to understand that everything used for blood looks like a kind of red. Once he was off the blood, his hand was red in color. <br /> <br /> About acting, maybe there wasn't a better cast by Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins in the original. Perkins fits in well with Norman and he was incredibly natural when he smiled and spoke to the stranger. Hitch wanted a nice and good actor and it worked just fine. In this version, I personally think Vince Vaughn looks perfect and attractive and strong to play Norman's role, unfortunately his play was nothing short of terrible. In the motel office where Norman and Marion had the long conversation, he had no expression on his face and his voice and face never changed. Described in the original scene in the same scene as the madhouse, we can clearly see the sudden change of expression on Perkins face and he barely looks angry, though not aggressive. Vince Vaughn works the whole conversation here, just as he had only his lines. Again, terribly observing. The same is with Anne Heche. In the original scene in the original, we can see how tense and nervous Marion (Janet) is when she drives to Phoenix. She was happy to get the money, but at the same time afraid of life. I call that acting. In the remake, Heche has no signs of fear and his smile regularly gets money. I don't think anyone would be "happy and smiling" if they only stole $ 400,000 and the whole state police were behind them. In the landfill Janet stuck in the original curtain, turned around and died after being stabbed. In the remake, Heche is stabbed, turned around, then swung the other way, has a foolish expression on her face and manages to die with great difficulty. Again, terribly observing. <br /> <br /> There are also some specially innate changes in this movie from the original that have nothing to do with the plot line and the ongoing situation. In the scene where Arbogast is murdered, two screens shine between them. One with a naked woman and the other with a sheep. Many people, including myself, are not quite sure whether the second scene has a sheep or a cow or whatever it was. What on earth has to do with an animal or a naked woman with an investigator's murder! The changes were just inappropriate and unnecessary. There are also some changes in the endings. <br /> <br /> Let me add some (and only) positive points. I felt Julianne Moore did her job well and played a good character from Lila. And William Macy did well, it was almost exactly how Arbogast's character had to be played. <br /> <br /> It is common knowledge that the purpose and intention of a movie repair is to make the current generation aware of a movie It has a good classic plot line, and to make it look better the original. And if something happened here, as I just said, it's directly the opposite. Unfortunately, many people like me were not impressed after watching this movie, unless we were introduced to the existence of an unforgettable original release. <br /> <br /> Please do not look at this movie, it is nowhere near the original and the original will always remain one of the best ever created movies if it is not the best.
