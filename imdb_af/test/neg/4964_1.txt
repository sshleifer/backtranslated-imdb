Look at these reviews and see all these high ratings, let me believe that large amounts of red corn syrup will only please a brain-dead idiot. This movie is useless. All the cliches of a slasher movie without any substance. I'm sure I could go into details about the movie, but why bother it if you can sum it up? Of course everyone wants to have Mandy Lane and she doesn't want any of the guys. Through the movie you will see it. <br /> <br /> If she ceases to be friends with the typical boy trapped in a friend zone loser, he goes ballistic and when (on a road trip to the middle of no place) he goes They start hunting one by one. Sounds right so far right? But what this movie is struggling with is incredible when you find out that not only is her lover friend the killer, but she is just as good. The plan was also ridiculous. Let us kill all our friends and then kill each other. They gave no reason why they wanted to do this and gave Mandy Lane's "Goody Too Shoes" bravery. This makes you scratch your head even more, motivating even the characters to do something they do. It's sad. This movie has a lot of potential, but the director or writer can't be related to the audience anyway.
