It was a character's movie. The plot was not so hot when it was there, but the characters were interesting and very well done. The story focuses on the Travis family in the wake of the eldest son's suicide. I'd rather say it because the story is mostly about the surviving son and mother, because if the father had the idea to focus the story on him, they worked out the movie pretty badly. The action on all parts was very good, especially Emile Hirsch as the surviving, confused boy. The characters were all very interesting and I didn't mind watching them late in the movie, when it just seemed to be dragging. <br /> <br /> My big complaint, however, was the story. The boy who kills himself is supposed to be the center of the plot. However, this was really not. It was something that happened at the beginning of the story, but then everything went completely. Then they will mention that the boy killed himself to remind you that it was the central thread. The other thing was that the large plot twists, of which there were enough, were never really explained or built up, but just thrown randomly and often from the far left field. In fairness the end was very, very cool. But it was also clear where the inspiration came from the story: about half of them (half not stuck) were removed from the story in the Pearl Jam song Alive. What reminds me ... <br /> <br /> There was a "poem" in the movie supposedly written by someone who killed themselves. I couldn't have been the only one who acknowledged that the poem had been lifted, word for word, from the same song. I don't know, it was a movie I had hope for, and they really dropped the ball.
