Can this movie be considered a movie? Imagine the situation: Someone puts a handy camera over a tripod and in front of a seafront promenade and movie people walking or running there. Then he puts the camera in a beach, buys a few ducks in a pet shop, opens their cages and runs them in front of the camera. Later he only films the water surface and the sound of birds and insects in absolute darkness. Is it an experiment or just an insult to hearing intelligence? What would happen if any unknown director had such a movie? Will we mark his work with 10? I always disappoint directors who believe they can do everything when they become known.
