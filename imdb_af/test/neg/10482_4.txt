Okay, when I bought this movie, I need the ultimate b-movie, space monkey landing on Earth and instantly killing people! <br /> <br /> Well, it was almost everything I expected, a typical low-budget scifi movie from the 60's. Acting must be the worst I have ever seen, especially the starring girl and the girl who played the waitress made me laugh at my ass. <br /> <br /> So why 'Night Fright' doesn't fall into the 'so bad it's good' category? Reason why some of the screens were just too long and boring. For example, the scene where police officers seek clues in the forest was just a few minutes away from the goal. And then the big final, the people are waiting for the monster about 5 minutes and when the space monkey appears, it gets 20 seconds in the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, a nightmare is boring, but it has some funny moments. I can recommend this movie to anyone who liked movies like 'Zontar, The Thing of Venus' or 'Curse of the Swamp Creature'. <br /> <br /> I give Night Fright 4 Space Monkey knock out 10. <br /> <br /> -Rob Awful
