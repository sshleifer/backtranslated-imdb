For sci fans it will be better than anything that will probably run on TV at any time; It's about the best you can say. Good points; repartee and sense of humor are less dull than usual in such movies, the plot is coherent and does not use magical mystical revelations. Bad Points; the authors are trying to do good science, but it falls in the direction and production (eg a rock drill using overheated rock drilling equipment breaks surface underwater with nail to watch a bubble or boiler), the characters are clich√©s and the plot unfold is nice stock standard. OK for a too-tired-to-do-anything-else-night; but don't expect any big build or even talk points to be really.
