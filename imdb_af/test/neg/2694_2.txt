I watched this movie as a preview before the opening of Venice at the Telluride Film Festival. Your response to that will largely depend on your attitude towards respecting the text of Shakespeare. On the positive side: Pacino does indeed perform very well as Shylock; Lynn Collins is a fine Portia; and the movie has a beautiful view. <br /> <br /> The negatives are predictable. "The Venice dealer" is probably the most difficult of all Shakespeare's plays today, mainly because we look at it through the twisted lens of the 20th century. The romantic plot with Bassanio and Portia has no problem. Do the character of Shylock, because we have the original frame of reference of the Elizabethan audience. Shylock is simultaneously a human character with human characteristics and motivation, and an abstraction of the dishonest quality of the Old Law. When he says, "Are there no Jewish eyes?" he is a character; when he preaches, "I will have my bond!" he is an abstraction. The long section on music and cosmic harmony in the final scene (moving here and cutting on ribbons) is the key to the play, as it restores universal harmony to the disruptive and evil (the Shylock of the trial scene) forces are ejected. It is possible to make psychological sense of the character of Shylock by gradually making it crazy and becoming a monomaniac, by the time the test scene rolls around. The key is that at one stage he ceases to be sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Pacino's performance almost does, but not quite. The movie cannot be fully remembered - on the one hand there is the right movement in the character of Shylock, and on the other hand, there are many exorbitant footage of Jews who are abused and Venetian whores with bruised nipples (no doubt show the decadence of Antonio et al). Shakespeare does not write an Ibsen-like social drama; He writes a comedy based on the classic pattern of disruption of social order and the restoration of social order, symbolized by marriage, with a theme of love towards the law in the middle of the Shylock plot. <br /> <br /> In this sense, the movie is a travesty - Radford's play and direction operation almost forces us away from what the play really means. (At the beginning of the final scene, cut most of it, and move it before the trial scene. This is the most extreme example.) There are other major issues. Jeremy Irons, a fine actor, plays Antonio as if he were over sedative overdose. Joseph Fiennes is beautiful, but level like Bassanio. Most of the actors, with the exception of Collins, Pacino, and the actor playing the Duke in the test scene, mumbled their dialogue. <br /> <br /> Final ruling? A nice movie with some decent performances. It's not Shakespeare, it's poor interpretation. Not really worth your time or money - although Lynn Collins as Portia almost redeems it.
