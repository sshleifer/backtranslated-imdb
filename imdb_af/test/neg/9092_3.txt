This movie was a disappointment. In essence, the story is paved with a castle (or a very cheap set that is a castle specific) that is being replaced by the hotel and a monster instead of the ghosts. The budget is the same as you would see from a Cinemax softcore porn, such as the photos, sets, lighting and video it was shot at. The story is a failed attempt at sincerity: there is no easy way to make your audience sympathetic to your characters than to show that they are experiencing emotional trauma. And the trauma in this movie is pretty thin. Want an example? A blind girl who listens to a language band learning Italian words for colors begins to cry about what she will never see. <br /> <br /> This movie had a few things for it, but the monster is pretty cool. , pretty scary. And there's a pretty decent amount of nudity from Raffaella Offidani, herself a star of Italian "erotic" movies. However, the gore leaves much to be desired as well as the acting, even from the experienced Jeffrey Combs. <br /> <br /> Unlike that, I only saw two other Stuart Gordon movies: Re-Animator and From Beyond, both were outstanding. But I won't let this little footnote in my career stop me from watching much more of his movies.
