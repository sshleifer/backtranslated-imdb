This movie is overestimated, to say the least. It's not as good as a comedy, and it's not as good as a "serious" movie either. The pacing is far too plodding for the former, and there is too much lame slapstick for the latter. The only laugh comes from some of Bud Spencer's reaction shots when he gets excited by his brother's behavior. The dubbing is excellent, but the full-screen frame is frightening. (* 1/2)
