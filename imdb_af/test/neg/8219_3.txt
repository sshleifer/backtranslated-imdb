Of all the directors who ever sit behind a camera, Wellman can break your heart faster than anyone. Even Ford. But this is one of his worst. Even he knew it, probably from his jejune treatment, not much above a Bonanza or Big Valley. <br /> <br /> However, there is one moment, typical Wellman coming out of nowhere to destroy you, the death of the Indian woman of Gable. She went to give her baby water and WHAM was immediately killed with an arrow. No warning. Nada. <br /> <br /> One of the most shocking, unprepared for deaths in all movies. Especially after a whole hour of love for the woman invested in what seemed to be a juicy western. Of course, her treatment was then burdened with Wellman's total indifference, apparently, to the film. Yet it is a reminder of the power he has always had.
