Scientist Charles and his wife (or assistant) Marissa receive objects and a skull from an old Indian cemetery. During the cleaning of a vase, they are attacked and killed by a mysterious creature, the Skeleton. Then a military group headed by Captain Leary (Michael Rooker) is looking for two groups of four soldiers who each disappeared in the jungle. They stand in front of the Skeleton man, shoot him while killing every soldier. Then the Skeleton goes to a power station, and Captain Leary explodes the facility that destroys the supernatural being. <br /> <br /> I bought the "Skeleton Man" on DVD and expect to see a funny trash, but I have a very boring, annoying and senseless shit, with shoots and explosions. The imbecile story is completely disconnected and does not make sense, and the military team consists of imbeciles, who insist on shooting the supernatural Skeleton until they are completely slaughtered. Their leader is also the dumbest, with the bloat of an entire facility to eventually destroy the supernatural rip-off of the alien fighter predator. On DVD it is possible to use the quick button next to the movie and reduce the sufferings of the viewer. My voice is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Skeleton Man"
