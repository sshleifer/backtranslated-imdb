Personally, the book was a very well written, wonderful, exciting piece that was not brought to court. Watching the movie at 12.01 in the morning to see that most of the book was left out, frustrated me as it affected the "different" outcome of the movie. There was something to be desired from this movie, but all in all, it did not lack in plot. <br /> <br /> For someone NOT reading the book, I could see how this movie would be entertainingly entertaining with its controversy and tension. But after a dedicated reader who read it seven times, I didn't see the strong connection between the two: both the film and the novel. <br /> <br /> With great missing characters (like Maximilian Kohler) and the sudden turn in plot with the survival of the last cardinal in preference, the plot of the movie is slightly scattered and thus leads to another in closing the story. The Hassassin is also portrayed as an ordinary white man, compared to that of the novel where he is portrayed as a Muslim; His motifs in the book are mainly tied to the Illuminati, but in the film his motives are based on money and looks more like work than a personal tie for the task.
