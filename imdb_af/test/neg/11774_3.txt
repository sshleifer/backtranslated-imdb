What is about drug addiction that so early-time filmmakers draw to offer their own approach to the subject? This topic was killed. Drug abuse is bad. We'll get it. Drug addiction is painful to watch. We also get it. But the dark subject does not give the filmmaker a license to make a messy movie. Every movie doesn't have to be Hitchcockian's masterpiece of film excellence, or use Orson Wellesian's deep focus, but it's still a narrative movie. Verite does not mean pseudo-documentary. Even consumer mini-DV cameras are capable of producing white whites and blacks, and this movie maker is just lazy by shooting no contrast scenes with existing lighting: the subject is dark enough without forcing it artfully with messy cinematography . And even documentary films have a good mix. Vera Farmiga is very talented, given the right material, but the director clearly conveyed her and sucked all her life out of her performance. Addicts may remain in a manure, but they still have emotions, but none of these characters appear to be on the screen. The supporting players just delivered their lines without creating real people. Sorry to be so hard, Debra, but some things are true whether they want to believe them or not. I'm sure your next movie will be better - but please, not another drug movie. :)
