Although I am sure, the idea looks good on paper, and it addressed me when I first heard it. This film often flashes and falls flat, and if I see it, I just want it to end. The film's beginning and ending of the film about Lou, which has to make a difficult position, was accomplished at its best, though I found the long-cut part to be humorous. However, I did not find much to laugh with the bottom of the barrel that was thrown together for these two great comedians. I thought it was a mistake to put them in a musical, and the series "Wizard of Oz" rip-off (with the songs and black-and-white to color format). I would not recommend this movie to anyone except the hard A&C fanatics. Anyone else will be disappointed, and they have much better movies.
