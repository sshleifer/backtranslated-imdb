There are bad movies, movies that are terrible, and then there is a small, rarified body of movies that is so bad that even at some point, even after seeing them once, the ominous thing makes it impossible forget them even decades later. It's just such a movie, and it's hard to believe that the original movie in this series was actually pretty good. Let's see, George Kennedy, the original cigar's chomping "tough guy" engineer, was somehow promoted to the captain. After the Concorde came under rocket attack (don't ask), he stumbled over stunts like a firearm from the cabin window despite (supposedly) flying at Mach 2, which did the kind of wild high G-elusive maneuvers that wobbled. tearing a real plane, never affect the passengers! But the absolute worst part of the movie, at least for dedicated planes, like me, is that this horror has launched one of the coolest, sexiest and most technologically striking aircraft ever. The Concorde (or just 'Concorde' as his pilots refer) deserves it much better, this horror is the equivalent of a high-class beauty like Audrey Hepburn and her in a "Porky's" sequel. Fortunately, the release of the ever hilarious "plane!" The following year, the entire airport franchise brought a well-deserved halt, as anyone who even considered a fifth installment had to be laughed at by the studios and movie lovers. <br /> <br /> 1/10
