Unless you are interested in seeing 2 hours of picturesque mountain pictures with hysterical characters, lots of histrionics and cheap 70's (not many of them), I would recommend avoiding this movie. It is long wind, over long and has a rather annoying amateur feel to it. Masterpiece? No, an average thriller, shot in an average way, in a beautiful Italian landscape. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the slow 1970s movie, when there's a plot to entertain and entertain you. In this case, it didn't make me think. The plot is solid, interlaced with superficial and stereotypical characters, backed by hilarious evil mobs and your typical Italian widow dressed in black, sobbing. <br /> <br /> If you're not familiar with the country's Italian side, the movie might be worth seeing as the scenery itself is spectacular and quite breathtaking. However, this movie is not out of the ordinary, there are much better Italian horror flicks than this. Not much other than a yawn party. 10/05
