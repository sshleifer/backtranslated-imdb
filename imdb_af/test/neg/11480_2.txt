It must be renamed "Everybody Loves Sebastian". The 1983 rural, nowhere-urban high school junior (or senior? - they seem to be the flop flip) with strange hair and 'Leo-like' looks good, has a big plate of trouble. His stepfather announces definite plans to have a gender change operation, on which his mother calls the marriage to end; Sebastian is called the "f" word by everyone and their mother, while looking around for a number of times, touching a high fever at a supermarket and saving a "strawberry" prostitute from the shoulders of relentlessly pimp her. <br /> <br /> Sebastian's "buddies" make Eddie Haskal like a choir boy; bad association doesn't get much worse. Sebastian seems to go for "Harold's" suicide attempt record (though he won't admit suicide charges). For no apparent reason, the brilliant level of SAT score Sebastian MUST should begin to graduate early, although he has no idea of ​​the future, he also does not want to attend school (who does this nonsense?). <br /> <br /> This movie is a look at a few weeks in the life of someone who is PRETTY MESSED UP. The final scene indicates that things will be good, although the HOW is left entirely to the viewer. <br /> <br /> The creators of this movie seem to rely solely on the undisputed appeal of the very attractive male head. The "story" leaves much to be desired. Looking for "what will this beautiful child do next?" do not meet exactly. The slender production values ​​just don't measure on other movies, independently or otherwise. A low budget and poor story need more than a pretty face to carry it through. The "results" of this project are forgotten and an insult to intelligent films.
