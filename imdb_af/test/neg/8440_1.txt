It was absolutely the most tragic pile of cinema I ever witnessed. Not only was the name a complete misunderstanding - as the film has nothing to do with piranhas - but the play is so hollow and stale as the attempt to actually make a plot. If you watch this movie, you can't help spending every waking second interrogation if you've had enough and it's time to turn it off. Unfortunately, I waited until the end in my case. It's two hours of my life that I will never be able to recover.
