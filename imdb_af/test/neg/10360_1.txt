Yes, I admire the independent spirit of everything, but it is like a road trip with a bad role and no budget. <br /> <br /> I cry when I watch American comedies, I laugh. This movie made me laugh, but just because of the big obvious effort to simulate high-American American high school / pot flicks. <br /> <br /> If you want a good independent American comedy with pot references, check out Kevin Smith or Richard Linklater or something. Don't waste your time on this movie. <br /> <br /> I mean, how can you take this comment seriously when most people complain about the characters not drinking pot! <br /> And casually: in Norway it's called "Dude, Where's My Pot"!
