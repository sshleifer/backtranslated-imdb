I was so impressed with Tim Kincaid's MUTANT HUNT that I tried this one. This is the near future, of course, post-apocalypse. A walking warrior named Neo (no, no, Neo!) Joins a group of similar search fighters to challenge The Dark One and his underlying Valaria. Along the way they touch mutants, crazy women, sewage worms, a big spider and a few bots of robots. Oh me! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, ROBOT HOLOCAUST is barely on or off to HUNT's level. With a painful 79 minute beat (the box says 90), this is a cheap movie. The sets have proven the elaborate design of a carnival haunted house and the costumes that in the near future, like John Travolta, everyone will dress in the latest dance STATE LIVE. The atomic desert is a combination of old buildings with litter and Central Park. The Dark One's headquarters is ominously called the power station and looks like a power station. The acting is universally bad except for Angelika Hunter as the evil Valaria. Hunter is a whole 'nother level of bad. Vit is sick Cherman acczent, she gives a show so incredibly bad that it is the only reason to recommend this movie. She also delivers the only nudity of the film in the "movie room" section of the film. Ed French returns the robot effects, but they're not nearly as smart as his work in MUTANT HUNT.
