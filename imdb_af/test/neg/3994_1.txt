Let me get it straight ... "The Church" has a safety lock mechanism to keep the spirits, but the ultimate solution brings it to the ground? LOFL! Maybe I miss the plot. Perhaps this man is from the Ed Wood school of film or something. This movie is about as useless as the church itself. Hey ... maybe that's the point. The whole Rosemary's Baby-esq segment was hilarious. I can go to my Halloween costume shop and go better than that. The whole movie needs to be recreated. Properly. There were so many things played ... so many things that could make me come out of my seat and through the ceiling. I'm not sure if the mistake lies in writing or editing, but what I have seen should not be so high on a rating.
