I can't believe I'm sitting through this total waste of time. I was just too fascinated by how unspeakably bad it was that I couldn't move. It reminds me of the feeling when you can't take your eyes off a horrible car accident or the rotting carcass of a cow. You can't help but you feel sick and nauseous afterwards. <br /> <br /> Let me expand: "Plan 9 from outer space", for example, is not a bad movie. Not even "Star Wars: Holiday Special" is a bad movie. They are both terrible to make sure, but they both have some features and at least they allow you the power to reach for the "down" button. <br /> <br /> This "remake" (of name only) of the sci-fi classics has made me cry on my couch and desperately try to determine how such scripts are filmed, why someone remembers the original classic would remind, and if I had my normal life without me suddenly I longed for the silence and peace of death. <br /> <br /> Although the dead realized, I would have no rest at the terrible memories of this heap of shit, because the poor souls in hell are probably forced to watch it over and over for ever. .
