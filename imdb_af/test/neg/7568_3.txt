I like J-horror, anime and even the pink movement, which some of them claimed, is a member of, but it did nothing to me. I'm ready to go one more step and call this one of the biggest deviations from my movie career. <br /> <br /> Three young rabbits are raped to rape their kicks from raped girls. One of the groups is beginning to develop a consensus on their pass rate when his child's sister catches them almost in action. The group constantly turns on once friends start fighting together. It ends with a sign that satisfies the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Besides the friends screaming, what they do a lot, there's not much going on here. The film is full of LONG persistent shots that only aggravate the problem. In addition, even when the film does something interesting, it suddenly falls into the ethereal philosophy that never makes sense. For example, after one of the girlfriends has his heartbeat about the assault of girls, he goes out and does it again, but then stops his friends to take their turns. Huh? The cinematography is slow and the lighting is poor. The writing is OK, just like the acting, which makes a sub-par cinematic effort from the beginning. Mix the lack of technical skill with the thin content and you have nothing more than a waste of time. Oh, and another extra note, at least one of the girls appearing in the dull is not looking old enough to do that kind of thing. <br /> <br /> 3/10
