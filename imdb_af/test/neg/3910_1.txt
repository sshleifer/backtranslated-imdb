K, one day my dad picked up a movie with a "neat" cover. Go home with my mom and we were like you can see this new movie we've never seen before! .. Okay, it starts ... interesting start, cool robots and disgusting gore (oak) on a strange planet (actually it was Pluto, wasn't it?) Blablabla I could tell the whole story, but rather I do, WTF NEVER just pick up a movie with a lame ass name, and seriously, it doesn't always mean that I ever judge a book about his cover (err tape ..) It looks like an interesting movie. However, it was a slap in the face of sci-fi movies, it's Disgusting. I mean it was so bad, I just started laughing (I swear it was trying to be serious). I can't describe the lock! It killed more than a million brain cells from me. I can't even write an offspring criticism. She's so crazy! Argh and I Wana prepare you for something "strange" * COUGH COUGH * mechanical p3n1 $ * COUGH COUGH * Sorry, it just had to say, it's so funny, think it as a comedy or a parody of kinds for sci fi movies. His classic batman laughs, but in a new package. What did this director think?
