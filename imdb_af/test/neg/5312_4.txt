I'm a fan of Get Shorty. This is the sequel to the movie that no successor needs. <br /> <br /> Chile is back, but Rene Russo is gone without a peep. Unfortunately, Chile's game was played in the first movie and rather than finding an interesting personal arc for him, they just left him between the repetitive lines of the first movie. It's pretty lukewarm. Travolta looks old here. It's as if they are moving people around him because his legs are cracked. His pink lip gloss and the blue eye contact are very strange. The 2nd bad role is Edie (played by Uma Thurman). She is a music producer, a role that requires her to be just the female Reuben Kincaid. ("Hello, these kids have a good new sound.") In any scene, she finds the wrong tone motive or emotional or both. It is painful to watch. Despite the big problems, Be Cool is getting better after a very incomprehensible start. <br /> <br /> I surely laughed at it (Vince Vaughan is running on fire, Cedric the Entertainer, Ludicrous, the Rock, a t-shirt that says "widow"), but it doesn't offer any good memories after it's over. It is a helium light love party from the first frame. There is no one so priceless idiot as Gene Hackman in the first movie. It's just about doing good in the world, for a few kids who have a chance (Beyonce & the Rock). Ho-hum. The first one was not preaching. <br /> <br /> Working in (repeatedly) gags and lines of the first movie is annoying, just like the stupid concession to Rock's wrestling fans (he raises his eyebrows twice) as Steven Tyler says, "I'm not the kind of singer who makes appearances in movies. " The whole star-spectacular series is part of the problem. The first movie was not taxed by "stars". <br /> <br /> For a rental we even get it.
