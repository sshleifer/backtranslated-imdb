Let me say this from the beginning. I hate this show. I really like many of its aspects. In fact, when I first started looking, I was quickly affected. I just started coming out of the whole stereotype "anime for kids", and the adult elements of the show irritated me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, after seeing the whole series and some of the movies, I can say that my overall attitude has changed, and it falls into almost all the pitfalls that plague a bad anime . Seven or eight friends and I watched this series on TV. By the end, only one friend and I had watched and none of us liked it. <br /> <br /> Let me explain the plot to you. You can skip this paragraph if you don't want to know. Kagome is an average high school student who one day falls into a magical place near her family sanctuary. When kagome comes out of the pit again, she is transported to the feudal era of Japan again in time. She meets many other characters and they form a group of five or so companions who fell on a journey of revenge / justice in a character case. Overall, they try to repair the pieces of the sacred gems that enhance the power of demons using them. <br /> <br /> While there are many, many story stories and story arches, there is not enough material to occupy 167 episodes. The only story bow that is interesting enough to watch is still dull (the group of seven). After halfway through the series or perhaps before, it became painfully clear that the plot was frozen in place and everyone who made the series decided to fill in dozens of episodes. <br /> <br /> These episodes have little or no impact on the story, and rarely even on the characters. In some cases, some characters that have a major role in the story will disappear for dozens of episodes at a time. Many episodes follow exactly the same cookie cutter patterns as the stories before it. Inuyasha shoots wind scar on the enemy. Windshield deflects. Characters seize in horror. Enemy seems to have a barrier. Characters have spent three episodes killing the enemy before Kagome finally burns a sacred arrow and turns to dust. <br /> <br /> Also ** IMPORTANT SPOILER: THE CONCLUSION WILL BE RETURNED ** The lack of any conclusion seems to have turned 83 hours. <br /> <br /> ** GREAT SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> The animation itself is above average and in some cases excellent. However, the reused animation cells reuse most of the action scenes, and it is very difficult to ignore them when it is clear that the exact same stone has flown five or six times in a row over a character. <br /> <br /> On the brighter side, all the characters were very well developed and the romance between some characters was truly fascinating. Also, the character designs (phenomena) were brilliant and sometimes between the best I saw, especially with the group of seven. There is definitely no shortage of Cosplay events here. Yet I hoped that a character would die, just as there would be some kind of movement in the plot. And the humor in the display between characters is being used again and again. A special joke (put boy) is found within the first five episodes, and you can literally expect it to be used again and again for the remaining 162 episodes. <br /> <br /> Although there are some good aspects of the show and it's easy to see why it has a huge impact. The series seems to be dominated by obsession with girls falling over Sesshomiru and InuYasha. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Definitely worth watching, but it's not worth watching. the whole series. The first 30 episodes are very clever, original and enjoyable for anyone. But after that, it's just boring and boring. Watching a TV show should never be like a task, but this way it reaches like this. Don't expect much from "InuYasha" because you'll just drop.
