Is it really possible that so many people in this movie believe the girl is a witch? Just because she has dark hair and wears dark, must she be a witch? And I have the impression that the film is trying to imagine her as someone else, someone who doesn't understand anyone. She's just a teenager and a dumb girl in her high school says she's a witch and everyone believes her. Besides, Brandi is also very badly portrayed or the character itself is made like this ... Fake. She did not convince me that she was not a witch, not that I would believe it in the first place. Everyone accuses her of a witch and she acts as if she is not quite sure whether she is a witch or not. And how they dressed her for the court - I see old ladies daily who wouldn't wear it, even though it was the last outfit in the world! Brandi's brother was not very convincing either. But you see, the most important thing is to put a bad, bad girl at the end of the movie on the ground. "She won the battle, proving to everyone she is different." <br /> <br /> It's probably too one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I just watched it because at the moment there was nothing else on the TV, so I was condemned to this trash. Please, don't waste your time watching this movie. When I see the 7-star score, I almost fainted ... It doesn't deserve it, compared to other 7-star rated movies.
