I've been collecting Iron Man comics since the early 70's and have always enjoyed the character that is far from the average clean-cut hero and his numerous and varied enemies. There were no fewer than three attempts at an animated series for Iron Man and only the original and part of the second ever did the character justice. So I was somewhat hopeful that this latest version would be good. Boy was I wrong! The DVD art is VERY misleading and offers an image that is not the movie. Fist of good, little there ... Art and animation are well drawn and writing and dialogue are generally good, though with notable exceptions. Character voices are very well chosen and each character is distinctive and well-behaved. Now for the bad ... Unfortunately, the authors have decided to completely screw with both Iron Man's origins and especially the Mandarin. In addition, they decided to do Iron Man and his opponents all in CGI. Bad CGI. It almost makes them stand out as much as live actors want in a cartoon. The CG work is often repetitive and temporary shortcuts are used. The CG battles are also clumsy, further enhancing CG and line animation not mixing well. The movie would definitely have performed better if they chose to actually draw all the characters. Another problem is that Iron Man is in his traditional red and gold suit for all ONE fight! And it's not even the big battle in the end. All these things drag the movie off and it never comes up. <br /> <br /> ************ SPOILERS (or warnings) MAY FOLLOW *********** * <br /> <br /> The movie starts with an interesting unusual stop motion credit order of machinery, welding and gears. Then we are introduced to what looks like a Chinese temple in the process of being restored, and prominently is a statue of what fans will recognize as the Mandarin. Things are going strange, hampering progress in restoring the temple. Overview of this is James Rhodes, Tony Stark's long-time friend. They seem to be planning to erect the temple out of the earth, despite opposition by a group insisting that raising the temple will cause a terrible disaster. Rhodes is caught in an attack. Stark, shown in a hot tub with a lovely lady, becomes aware of the problems and oversees the project herself and saves his friend while dealing with his father's drivers who are pushing to remove Tony. Tony just arrives to have his armored accompaniment. Tony later wakefully wounded in the heart and a prisoner of the rebels. He is only saved by rapid action by Rhodes and a scientist. Ultimately, Stark must build the prototype gray iron armor and escape well, but only after some loss of life. As he met with the rebels, he met a troubled girl named Li Mei, and the two fell in love. The temple is raised and four elementary creatures (all in CG) are displayed and continue to collect hidden power lines. Stark and Rhody find problems at home again, but manage to confront the elements unsuccessfully to really stop them. First use the Aquatic Armor, then the more classic Red and Gold Armor and finally everything comes back to the temple and Stark is back in the big gray. for a final jump and a walk in with which Fin Fang Foom (also in CG.) can be. Here's the story a big turn, as it appears that the Mandarin needs a host body to manifest. This leads to a somewhat tragic final battle being mumbled by the fact that the Mandarin is little more than a ghost and is not seen until the last 5 minutes of the movie. ugh ... <br /> <br /> If you're an Iron Man fan, you'll probably not enjoy this outing. And even non-fans might not be missing the movie or not.
