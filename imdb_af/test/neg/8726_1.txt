I looked forward to watching this movie since I loved the David Lynch version. In my first attempt to view it, I fell asleep. Nothing happened. The next night I tried to look the rest, and again it slept me! Nothing ever happened in this movie that could keep anyone's interest alive. The only time it got a little more exciting was when I tried it on Fast Forward! The DVD has a second disc containing bonus material. Needless to say, I didn't have a hard time torturing to watch more of Dune (2000). Here's the low points: The acting was bad, the plot was moving slowly, the sets were cheap, the direction was pathetic, and the CGI visual effects were childish. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch Duin, save your money or rent the 1984 version.
