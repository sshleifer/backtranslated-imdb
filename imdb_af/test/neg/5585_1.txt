6 of the 8 comments on this topic considered this movie worthwhile, so let me fix the balance. <br /> <br /> If it is best for British Independent filmmakers to offer, they should store their cameras straight and get work in another industry. Unfortunately for me 82 minutes, I will never see again and hopefully I'll save some of you to waste 82 minutes of your own. <br /> <br /> While the idea behind the movie is interesting, it's not enough to keep the viewer attached. The student characters are vague and uninteresting and honestly you will not care about what happens to them. The soldiers are almost caricatures of every bad thing ever seen in the movie, and I'm waiting for Captain Markovic to turn an imaginary mustache. Some of the effects were pretty good and showed a little imagination, but it was ruined by the shockingly bad acting, poor writing and fluttering camera work. The budget could be better spent sending the "actors" (and I use the term loosely) to actors or the Thomas Brothers to make film, or perhaps on a spell checker because the captions were spelled incorrectly. The fact that the misspellings have not been picked up and rectified speaks volumes about the immaturity of the whole production. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the positive comments are recorded by the filmmakers, whether they watched a completely different movie. I beg the Thomas Brothers to never give up their work, for if they continue in this field, they will surely be hungry.
