I saw this movie and was bored with my mind! I'm a fan of Peanuts, but I can't understand why Charles Schultz made this disaster! Spoilers ahead. <br /> <br /> I can't believe Snoopy will let his friends sleep on the ground in a dangerous situation and go to a bar and swing some cold without a standing watch! The story was totally nonsense, even for cartoon characters. It took them too long to come to France, and as soon as they came to France, I had the feeling that the writer (I still can't believe it was Schultz) didn't know what to do when they arrived do not have. <br /> <br /> Peanuts are the best in 30 minute episodes, not 80 minute movies. <br /> <br /> Go home Charlie Brown, you're at it's best there. <br /> <br />
