I don't think I can add much more to what has already been said about this movie. However, I can give a small reminder to see ST-V in the theater. In the last (terrible) scene, as the camera emerges from the campsite, and it seems likely that the credits are starting to roll at any moment, it seems that the audience is rising in harmony. Usually, it remains for a movie like this, at least-the-hard-to-hear the final release. While the people were unloading, I no longer remember a nice and cheerful rascal, but just a low murmur. <br /> <br /> I remember reading a movie review in the local newspaper in which the critic said it was so bad that only Trek supporters would like it. What an idiot. The fans were best to tear it apart first! <br /> <br /> Favorite Worst Scene: Shoot on a Voyager space probe, with a periscope no less! The space must be a much smaller border than we thought.
