Let me first say that I rarely review movies, I just comment if I'm blown away or disappointed in something I thought would be good. Killshot was a huge disappointment at so many levels. The screenplay was terrible, the acting was sub-par (especially from heavyweights like Rourke and Lane) and the editing and effects were comical (cars were blowing etc.). Rosario Dawson had a terrible role, I can't believe it will even accept, it was such an abuse of her talent that I can't even put into words. I had to know after seeing the trailer for this movie 3 years ago and it was stuck on the shelves that they were a serious problem with this movie .......... B movie all the way ... ...... don't bother unless you are really bored ........
