As many have described here with some seriousness that I find amusing, it is * not *: <br /> <br /> a MOVIE. (cue dramatic music) <br /> <br /> It's just a bad-it's good, totally surreal, Jackie Chan stunt-for-all. The women fighters are completely kicking and Jackie is definitely in his place. <br /> <br /> It's the movie you want to see with a few good friends on a Sunday afternoon - surrounded by munchies, ready to laugh, brave the good guys, don't scream the bad guys and constantly shouting, "WHAT?" when something completely bizarre happens. Great fun !!
