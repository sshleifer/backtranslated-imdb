A horrible movie; poorly written, heavily acted, split, chopped, foamed. The premise is such a good one and a chance to educate on black cowboys, but the movie is really scary. It's a peculiar blend of a bad 1950's Randolph Scott B movie and a bad 1970's spaghetti western. The villains are cardboard, the flashbacks are ridiculous, the dialogue is unclear. <br /> <br /> The deliberate anachronisms (such as 'Victorian' rapeseed and modern swear words such as 'motherf **** there') are irritating to the extreme. <br /> <br /> A Frankenstein monster that died on the lab table.
