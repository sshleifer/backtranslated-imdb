It usually sounds much better in my head (so forgive me for rattling). I'm barely Tarantino's biggest fan (and will * try not to bend to call him a "hack." Don't like to mock or criticize a movie before you see it, so, with prudent hesitation , I went to the cinema today to see 'Inglorious Basterds' <br /> <br /> Now, if it's a rip-off of a rip-off, it would be unfair. Tarantino is fortunate enough to the title of Enzo Castellari's (less than spectacular) Dirty Dozen clone, but it's not plots (it takes all other movies). "Inglorious opens with a Nazi officer and his long interrogation against" A farmer who hides Jews in his cellar, it is such an anti-climax, in the sense that the dialogue is outdated, and the result is a mile off, of course one of the hidden Jews escapes her (but more of her later) We (the, of course, easily satisfied) are treated with the introduction of Lt. Aldo Raine (ha-ha, that name sounds almost like B-movie King AL DO RAY .... ha-ha Quentin ... keep the "tribute" and this character is not played by anyone other than Brad (DALLAS) Pitt (sorry, DALLAS was about the only good thing he ever stood for ) And with the jawbone, Mr. Jolie drove us to a hound-dogged, southern-cut, smirking Nazi killer. Meanwhile Mr. Tarantino that real adults may be present, so assume that teenage farmers have not heard of the 'Dirty Dozen'? <br /> <br /> Raines' platoon consists of (John Cassavettes looking) blood thirsty Jewish soldiers, all seeking the great repayment on Adolf Hitler. Tarantino in all its superior knowledge, pay particular attention to two of these men, by throwing his long-time friend, best friend (and co-homage sycophant) Eli Roth (as the baseball bat wearing Bear Jew). The other man is called Hugo Stiglitz (and I will enter more than half of the QT fan boys. The boys have never heard this name before this movie.) Keep up the good work Tarantino, you have about 6 or so. Achieve 7 'hommages' (in the first 15 minutes) Hold it up and it can detract from the plot (or lack?) <br /> <br /> Anyway, cut a long (and extremely boring and protracted story short, both Raine and his men (the "Inglorious Basterds") and the only survivor of chapter one, both have separate plots to kill Hitler at the show of a Nazi propaganda movie, in A French theater (owned by the former survivor, who has now grown up) <br /> <br /> More boring (and useless) conversations follow, as Pitt gives away at an audience tomorrow. And the true tensions that lead to the killing of the deadliest tyrant of all time are being thrown away by the directors. It is demanded that the David Bowie song be placed in a WWII movie in 1980. <br /> <br /> My problem (and there are many) with this movie is the repetition of the problem I have with most Tarantino products ... he seldom knows when to start or stop . I don't need a homage to get a joke (whatever it may be). I knew of Inglorious Bastards, Enzo Castellari, Aldo Ray, Hugo Stiglitz (and the ultimate crime of the whole movie). Ennio Morricone haunting count of REVOLVER. I'm going to the theater to see the stars ..... As the best you can do is brave Barad Pitt, I will assume you (Tarantino) is the main line here? I don't want the audience to direct the movie. I pay to see your vision, your ideas, your creativity .... NOT how you can load endless screens of endless movies. It is high time the fan boys (on IMDb) used a "hard love" on your "idol" (God knows, if you don't ... the studios should?) <br /> <br /> The tired old argument with Tarantino worshipers is "well, if you can do better ... do it." Let me tell you, if I was a 46-year-old director with the (unlucky) draw QT ..... I'd like to offer you much more than a warmed up rehash of better WWII movies than these trips. The directors he is trying to imitate have so much accident, or budget constraints. It's a policeman, time and time again, to hear his fans' lack of imagination as' art '. I'm sure he is better able (but after giving him the benefit of the doubt again.) And not two and a half hours of my life to talk .....) He may not be?
