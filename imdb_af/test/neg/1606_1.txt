The horror of this for TV films was that it didn't end with this one. It created a regular weekly series that was even worse than the pilot / movie. Most movies about different careers have a kind of realism for them and of course it is jazzed to make it exciting. It had nothing to do with this. If the intention was to make it in "Camp", it succeeded. It returned a couple of years ago on the cable and failed again. Richard Jaeckel's performance as the chief doing all this was the only saving part of this movie. Camper as the Batman series of the 60's.
