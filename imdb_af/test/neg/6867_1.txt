Idea is great, spoil the time by the judges. <br /> <br /> Why make people fun? as the inventors say is true, and as most of them say, they have spent their lifesaving on the invention, the minimum is to reject the idea without making fun of people. <br /> <br /> This also shows when they want to get an idea by the caretaker they added to the judges. <br /> <br /> The only one I respect from the judges is the one who always sits on the right side of the table, he is a respected person <br /> <br /> Of course, the English snob is claiming to be a businessman, wearing a suite, not a dick for you. <br /> <br /> Last but not the biggest who sits between the English and the Crier. waking up, the job is not a profession and inventing to call yourself one. An inventor is a trait that is not a workman. <br /> <br /> I think they wanted to add someone like Simon to the American idol, they thought it worked there. It can also work here. the context is different and the idea is completely different. <br /> <br /> It's a good idea and they could have done a good performance if they just changed the judges and removed their act and attitude. /> <br /> Stop making fun of the people.
