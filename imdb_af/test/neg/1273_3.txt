Yes, I had the misfortune to watch this movie when I was younger at a friend's house as his mother was a teacher and she wanted to screen the movie and see if there were inappropriate scenes that a parent might object to. Well, besides the indifferent jokes, I think this one was in the bright, and the indecent jokes and the strange scene where the corpse like Ernest beats a girl. So yes, Ernest is thrown into jail, due to a similar appearance, and continues to try to escape, and there are other things like making him magnetize at one point, shoot electricity and get into a very painful final. look. There are a few jokes, but nothing too much to talk about, except for the rifle that has been cut from soap. I think it's the only scene I or my friend's mother laughed out loud. This and camp are the only two Ernest movies I've ever seen and of what I've seen in them, I'm not going to find the other movies. Ernest was good at small doses, but a movie is just too much, even when it is as short as this one. I see though the movies have made money, mainly because everything you need is Varney, a place and a theme and you have your movie.
