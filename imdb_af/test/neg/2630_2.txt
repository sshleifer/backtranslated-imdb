It's easily one of the worst movies I've seen in many years. I started watching the movie, and not expecting much and that's exactly what it did .... not much! In fact, it eventually delivered even less than I expected. My first reaction when I saw the opening parts of the movie was that I would probably eventually get a "4". I thought it had pretty good photos and a ghostly atmosphere. <br /> <br /> As the film progresses, however, the rating has declined occasionally in my mind, mainly due to pedestrian work and a plot of Be just foolish and tasteless at the beginning of both stupid and negligent be the end. By the time the movie was over, I was prepared to rate it no more than a "1". <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time or money on this one.
