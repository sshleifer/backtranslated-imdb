There was a time when Joel Schumacher was quite high on my favorite directors list. Back in the late 80's and early 90's, when his name was attached to several great films such as "The Lost Boys", Flatliners and Falling Down, he was truly one of the most talented directors in Hollywood. Then the stupid Batman sequels came unhappy and after that it seemed that every potentially sublime script had changed into a huge mess in Schumacher's hands. Both "8MM" and "Phone Booth" could have been much better movies and even the incredible imbecile concept of The Number 23 had to be transformed into a slightly more compelling and entertaining movie. Literally, from start to finish, "The Number 23" is an urgent attempt to be a mysterious and unpleasant thriller, so use all the terrible clich√©s from the big book of the history of the cinema, including the spoken narrative, flashback, disorderly structure, characters with multiple personalities, numerous plot twists growing increasingly absurd and sinister asylum institutions. However, nothing just helps because of the mere confusion of the basic formula and the clearly uninspired involvement of cast & crew. As much as you try to associate with the main character and be open-minded about the insane theories, it still remains a movie about two-digit numbers and two-digit numbers are not scary. Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey in a rare non-comic role) is a bored animal striker whose wife Agatha gives him a bizarre book on his birthday. The book tells of all kinds of demonic theories and strange coincidences related to the number 23. Walter quickly identifies himself with the book's protagonist (a messy detective investigating a grim case of suicide) and begins with great examples of the 23 puzzles in his own private life. I did research on Google and Wikipedia, and apparently these entire 23 numerology ignorance really do exist and some people honestly believe that most disasters and accidents are directly related to this evil number. Well, that's just? crazy! But hey, I'm not here to judge people's beliefs and fears, no matter how demented they are, and I can only share my humble opinion on a movie based on an out-of-out berserk enigma. "The number 23" is not stressful, despite several bleak pieces and nasty makeup effects, and never at one point to make you think about the role of numbers in your own life. All the role-players perform their normal abilities, but it was nevertheless a delight to the lovely lady. Virginia Madsen again to see a relatively large production. Definitely not recommended if you are looking for a solid and creepy night of thriller fun, but repeatable and not completely without merit.
