My friend, Zac, hired this movie for free, as his mother worked at a rental shop. I still feel torn because I will never be able to get those 100 minutes of my life. After watching the first "Dark Harvest" the night before this show, I expected to see at least a crappy remake of the first movie. Wrong. <br /> <br /> There is no single scarecrow in the movie (unless you're counting one of the lid of the box), and there's no real death. The film has its R-rating of an 8-year-old girl who shouted "god d ** n" to her father. <br /> <br /> There is no tequila that can make this movie bearable. Believe me, we tried.
