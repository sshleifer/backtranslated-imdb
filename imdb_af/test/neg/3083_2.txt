I saw this movie because Calexico made the score. A real disappointment. Annoying, trendy scenes, with urban hipsters and their clich√© hip lifestyles. Cheesy stereotypical Mexican border culture (mystical grandfather with rattlesnake and drinks, granddaughter in her Mariachi-style restaurant style). Some laugh, but faster than you, and many are missing and the basic movie maker.
