"An evil spirit takes a girl over and disturbs panic in the Louvre museum." That's all I think, the summary of the movie and the movie itself! What I think is one of the worst French or non-French movies ever made in the history of the theater! <br /> <br /> Nothing good here except the music (only the credits!), some soft moments of (Sophie Marceau) and of course the movie's final shot. Not because it looks like it's ages to end up being a countless number of years we've had to look at THIS CRAP, but also to be as perfect as a magical CGI work that was too good to be true! <br /> <br /> By the way, I want to change the plot summary to be so. An evil spirit takes over a few filmmakers to make films. Just like this one sure.
