Solo is an action movie about a Terminator-like Android set up and trained for the army. When an error is discovered, it is issued to be programmed. Rather than face death, he chose to flee into Central America's jungles, where he escaped into a village. The army is chasing him there, leading to a great action festival. <br /> <br /> Mario Van Peebles does a decent performance of the android. His movements and gestures seem mechanical enough to get the job done. Real scientific realism is abandoned to make a good action hero. And it works out; The action scenes aren't as spectacular, but it's not bad either. The actions of the other characters are pretty bad, but I didn't expect anything too good. The special effects were also decent. <br /> <br /> Solo is decent as an action movie, but very forgetful. It doesn't have the most movie content. But if you just want to pass a few hours without much thought, it will get the job done.
