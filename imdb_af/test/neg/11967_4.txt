I thought 'Scarecrow Gone Wild' is a dull slasher flick. Yes, it has a good point, but it is a rehash of another movie. The deeds are so terrible, even the plot. <br /> <br /> The story goes from a legend about a live scarecrow on the wheat. When an initiation becomes a prank and life threatens a boy, the scarecrow comes alive and begins a deadly madness. Sounds familiar, right? It's derived from Scream, Friday the 13th, Jeepeer Creepers, Children of the Corn, call it! <br /> <br /> "Scarecrow Gone Wild" is below the average movie. Barely a terrifying moment. Even the last scene is laughable! Unfortunately, we can still enjoy it as our killer. But I prefer you to rather look at something else. Unless you are a big fan, bad and cute movies are of course. <br /> <br /> 4/10
