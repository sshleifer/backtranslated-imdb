Sayles had a very interesting movie on his hands with Silver City, but it somehow became very confused when it came to an end. Chris Cooper did an exceptional job embodying the essence of his character, a Dubya of all kinds, but he was not nearly enough screen time. Instead, we find ourselves on a rampage with a character who feels less personal, less developed and generally confusing. The road that this Danny Huston guides us inevitably becomes the downfall of the movie. Too many characters are introduced to us in such a short time. These characters were randomly involved in the progression of the plot, which went too far with each passing minute. Sayles knew what he had created, I just felt as though it wasn't translating well into the silver screen. <br /> <br /> Sayles is a master of his trade. His films continue to inspire and evoke, even if they are not commercial successes. The problem with Silver City is that I think he got himself too deep with not enough money or time to explain it all. At the start of the movie I had an idea of ​​what had happened, but as more and more characters were introduced, as more and more plots were trying to avoid, I lost the sense of the movie at the end. While the end was very clever and very dark, I needed more explanation. I think some of the reason I lost my mind about this movie was because of Danny Huston's decision as our guide. He was pathetic. I didn't consider him a very exciting person to lead us on this adventure. He seemed to go through the movements, but didn't reach much at all. It was the first downfall of Sayles' major film. <br /> <br /> While I would admit that the characters played by Richard Dreyfuss, Miguel Ferrer, James Gammon and Daryl Hannah were interesting, I just needed a better guide to help me get their roles understand in this political scandal. Danny Huston just didn't cut it for me. Outside the characters, Sayles needs a stronger script. I sometimes felt that, unless I was deeply rooted in the political world, some of the references were good about my head. The whole reason why Silver City should be built and the corruption behind it escaped me. I'm a simpleton who likes advanced movies, but this one just didn't make much sense to me. There were a few times I asked myself, "Why" instead of seeing the whole picture. I felt as though the individual stories were as clear as glass, but the whole picture was dusty and dark at the same time. Sayles needed more to focus more on the bigger picture instead of these smaller issues, which eventually dropped this movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe I went in the movie with the wrong idea. I expected to see a different version of primary colors, but instead saw something less sad and more technical. Without ending, I thought the final scene was one of the most beautiful moments in political theater history. The brilliant symbolism has remained in my mind for the past two days after watching this movie, while the rest of the movie has quickly shifted from my head. Maybe a second look would be better for me, but for some reason Silver City just didn't click me. There were too many loopholes that were never explained or justified. An ensemble piece is always good with me, but if the characters are introduced without explanation, it just loses steam. It was one of those rare occasions. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was very upset about this movie. Being very democratic, I wanted to see a side of politics that I wasn't aware of and another side that would make you. I wanted to be engulfed with the world of corporate money and the dufus' being elected. I wanted an intelligent humor formulated by George W.'s words. But all I found was a very confusing story aimed at a certain audience I would never share. Sad, this picture had so much wasted promise. <br /> <br /> Degree: ** from *****
