Well, first of all, don't excuse me for the lame pun in the title. I was looking for movies to rent the other day and saw it. I heard something about it, so I picked it up and looked back and there was a brief overview of John Fallon AKA Arrow in the head! At that moment I thought, "Well, if he likes, then I'll have to do it!" So I rented it and just got around to watching it last night (college keeps me so busy). Oh and I might add that I'm reading a bit of Arrow's review and it appears that out of 4 stars he gave it 1 and a half. So my expectations of this movie went from very high to iffy. Well, after watching it, I agree with Arrow again (and it turns out that the quote from the review was the only positive thing he said about it!) Wow, did this movie stink or what? Where do I start with why? Well, the movie was so boring in my opinion. Not even the cool gore kids made me excited and when a deapitation doesn't excite you in a movie, it's bad! The characters I really hated and from the beginning I could tell who would die and who wouldn't. Actually, the film proved wrong on some points, but the worst is that one particular character I wanted to die for! What is the heck? And the chemistry between the head girl and the guy she met? Didn't feel it. Of course he was just there to be candy and gave her a love interest, otherwise I thought he was a waste! And as a horror fan I have to know that the "dumb horror movie" sometimes happened, otherwise there wouldn't be much of a movie, but the one that looked at me! Hello? Why are you in the room of the murderer when you have to look out of her? And it was no less because of the so-called smarter characters. The turn .... ah, it would have been good if it wasn't done a billion times and I didn't need this movie to reach it! My main point: Stupid movie that sucked me in with a few words of my favorite (actually my only favorite) film critic. Pluck!
