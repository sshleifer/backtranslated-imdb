We gave this movie a star for terrible, but it really depends on how you see it. We are currently watching channel 5 at 3:30 am and we have not stopped laughing, so maybe we can give it a 10, just for the entertainment value. From the start, with the 'manic' minds of the stalker being conveyed in comic fashion, we laughed. Is this me or the Knott's Landing chick looks like one of the characters of the Donker Crystal. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to spoil you, but you'll be pretty stupid. To see it coming, I don't think its smart enough for double bluffs. <br /> <br /> It should be the worst / best movie we've ever seen, if we played the 'mock the clich√©'. 'drinking game, then we are already wasted.
