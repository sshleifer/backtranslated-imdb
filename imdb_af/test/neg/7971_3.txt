First of all, I have to read everything about this topic and I know it inside, and I was excited to see it too. But just read the book based on this mini-series to realize it's not the true story of what really happened, almost 90 years ago. It is loosely based on the facts, the rest is taken from the author's imagination. And unfortunately these changes are all but successful and mostly completely unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? Vita and Violet did not use the names Mitya and Lushka until their relationship began, and during that Violet also called Vita Dmitri and Julian. It was Violet who chased Vita with a dagger when they were teenagers. The "seduction" scene when their relationship started Violet was far more passive than represented here and Vita certainly didn't even kiss. I can continue, and these examples are all included when the series just started. Besides all these changes to the facts, the characteristics are also wrong. Sometimes Vita plays like a crazy woman. Especially the scene where she saw the newspaper Violet's engagement notice is just ridiculous. Vita holds her emotions. It was Violet who was temperamental and showed her feelings (good or bad). Al Vita when she read it was that she had become almost faint, that's all. Harold avoids real-life confrontations, but here he is sometimes quite strict and accusing. Harold and Vita always discussed their intimate things in letters, not verbally. And Violet ... I know this series has deliberately focused on Vita and Harold, but that doesn't mean that all the other characters should just be sidelined. Here she is completely one-dimensional, and the lines given to her are usually embarrassing. Actually, she was intelligent, gifted, quite an extraordinary woman who rarely received the credit she deserved. I've always thought of her much more interesting person than Vita. In this series, her unhappiness, loneliness and her problems with her mother are completely ignored. Viewer also has little idea of ​​her background and family, what kind of relationship (and marriage) with Denys Trefusis she had or how hard she struggled over Vita. Vita was the only love of her life, her raison d'etre, and if Harold suffered during business, it also did Violet. After that, her life was in ruins, and it took time to get her back together again. Statue could have played the role of Denys, as much depth as his character. Lady Sackville West is just a badly drawn caricature; an annoying talk box with exaggerated French accent. <br /> <br /> The series ends on the totally badly written scene in Amiens, and that was the end of this case, according to the author. No, it continued for a whole year, and it is much more urgent and sad than is offered here. But what cares about the stupid end when the whole series is stupid from the beginning. I have to give some credit to actors, they tried to give them the best of them, although Janet McTeer, since Vita is the only one who really shines. One cannot complain about the institutions either. All complaints go to director and mostly, author. Instead of informative character studies, there are too many sex scenes and blatant conversations. Many of the scenes are too long, some are useless and nothing to the storyline. On the other hand, many details are completely shortened or omitted. Especially, there had to be more information about Vita's and Violet's youth, and how their friendship developed. It's a fascinating story that deserves a much better fit. Maybe someone will ever do it. Right now, one can make much more of this story by reading the actual book or Violet's letters to Vita, which is brilliant.
