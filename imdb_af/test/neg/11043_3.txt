Oldboy is in Korea and starts off as a drunken Da-su Oh (Min-Sik Choi) is kidnapped by his friend alone. Days-su wake up and find him in a small room he will be captured in the next fifteen years. Days-su is fed and cared for by its unknown prisoners, but is never allowed out of the room. Dae-su begins to avenge himself after getting out what he plans to do by removing the cement from the brickwork with a chopstick. But before Days-su finishes, he is gas conscious and unconsciously delivered. Days-su find himself free on the roof of a long building dressed and everything that is gained. Days-su immediately set out to try to find out who had caught him after meeting the beautiful Mido (Hye-jeong Kang). The two fall in love, and with her help Dae-su eventually finds what he is looking for, but the truth comes at a price ... <br /> <br /> This South Korean production is co-written and directed by Chan-wook Park and received a number of glowing reviews (the kind that distributors can pick their quotes and win on the video box) and even the jury's Grand Prize in Cannes while also nominated for the Golden Palm. So sure is Oldboy a true classic? Well, not for me, because I can't understand why it's so willing and I'll go so far to say I hate it pretty much, apart from one or two isolated moments. For a start I couldn't go into the story at all. I just didn't like it, because I thought it was slow and boring. And while many would believe outside, Oldboy had the best, most shocking strife I ever thought was fairly straightforward and not well done. The end in which Dae-su goes to the New Zealand islands to be hypnotized also feels as if the makers wanted a happy ending. Nearly two hours I almost fell asleep. I was so bored, the violence is soft and that is the thought of what I would think most people have a problem rather than actually being shown. In fact, Oldboy has a very low count of about seven and one soft sex scene, it's really not as graphical or memorable. I didn't warm up for any of the characters, and while accepting Oldboy has a good concept and premium it doesn't deliver, it's one movie I will never understand why so many people look. <br /> <br /> Based on a Japanese Manga of the same name Oldboy, the movie looks good. There are one or two nice visual moments here. Although everyone was raving about the battle in one continuous shot, I was pretty unobstructed and thought the combat chorography was rather boring. . The actual illegal violence on the screen is very low, Dae-su eats a live Octopus which is normally in Korea anyway. There are a few battle scenes, a cut hand, some teeth are pulled out and there is some blood at the end. <br /> <br /> The budget was supposedly filmed around the $ 4,000,000 point that is actually a fair bit filmed in South Korea and New Zealand. The play looks good, but it's hard to tell when actors speak a different language. <br /> <br /> Oldboy is a movie I had an absolute job to go through, I don't mind capturing movies or foreign films or paying attention to the plot if I followed the thing perfectly, but I just didn't like it and it's as simple and simple as that. Apparently the second in director Choi-wook Park's revenge trilogy, which is also sympathetic to Mr. Vengeance (2002) and Lady Vengeance (2005) include.
