My guess is that it will initially be at least two parts, and therefore at least a quarter longer, otherwise you can explain the confused, shortened storyline. I was never completely lost, but I was often partially lost and usually unclear about character motivation. The movie feels like it is at plot points to push it into its time slot. <br /> <br /> If it was longer, it could make more sense, but it would still not be very good. The film's most interesting idea is that the war between Zeus and Hera is a war between the husband and wife, but the movie is about to hit the ball and make Hera's fans pretty awful, while it's not clear what they say followers do or believe. The movie is also interesting because you don't see the gods and there is no real certainty that they exist. So it has some interesting ideas, but it doesn't do anything to them. <br /> <br /> Bad dialogue, cardboard characters and one interesting scene involving Hercules and his three antagonistic boys. Not irreconcilable, but not worth watching either.
