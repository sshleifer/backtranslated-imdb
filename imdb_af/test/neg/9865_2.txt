Yes! this movie was just bad on all kinds of things like throws, effects, boredom, excitement and of course fantastic and we all know that the four heroes in this one were a little more colorful compared to the new ones, but it still has to go, " A fantastic drill like this was really just stupid stuff I knew nobody wanted if I saw it, I guess with that budget about 3 or 4 GOOD movies could be made, but no. I'm just glad the new version this year has shown completely how the fantastic four had to be made with good story, a good role like Jessica Alba, one of my favorite actresses, otherwise it would have been completely forgotten, but grateful no. The new one was excellent when I saw it at my friends at the theater, but this old fantastic drill should go.
