this is horrible movie. it is stupid. First, the only thing the twins care about is what they look like and which boys they love. they are in the 7th grade. not to say I'm a prude or anything but it sends the wrong message to girls of all ages. Being beautiful and popular is not everything. but that's what the twins make up. The plot is even worse. the girl's grandfather only happens to the ambassador (sp?) to France. He has a co-worker, takes the girls around Paris and meets two "cute French boys" with motorcycles. they sob out to meet the boys, start to meet them ETC ..... they meet a supermodel in the process and go around in Paris with total strangers they think is cute. should I say more? this movie may be cute for 8 and 9 year olds. the twins play these losers who want boyfriends. This makes the wrong idea to girls. the movie itself is not good either. I do not recommend it to anyone. I passport to paris 2/10
