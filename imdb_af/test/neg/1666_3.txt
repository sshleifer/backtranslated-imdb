This is probably my least favorite episode. I've lived in Cape Girardeau for quite some time. I can tell you there are no ocean or shrimp boats, fresh crabs or scabies anywhere in Missouri. Cape Girardeau is the only inland Cape, on the Mississippi River. It looked like the license plates were from Mississippi, which could explain why there was so much racial tension. Missouri and Mississippi are two completely different states that don't touch each other. There are many roads inside and outside the city and none of them are Route 6 or Route 666. This whole inaccuracy was very distracting. Cassie did not look like someone who wanted the Dean to hang out if she was well educated. I didn't buy them as a couple and didn't enjoy the long love scene. Jo was more dean's style.
