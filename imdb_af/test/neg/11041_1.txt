***** Classic **** Excellent *** Good ** Fair * Tragic <br /> <br /> Overview: <br /> <br /> Oldboy is not for everyone. It is continuous violence, eating its live octopus and this is unimaginable story. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on a man who has been kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years. Oh Days-Su is released, only to find that he must find his prisoner in 5 days. Now, however, it seems as if the story begins to begin, but once you look at this bloated and un-original blood festival, it develops into a little blood and a powerful movie. <br /> <br /> It is straight on average and in no case the standards of what a South Korean thriller should be. Oldboys plays are leveled with dull humor and a poor writer's writing. <br /> <br /> Old boy is sometimes presented with thin stray performances, one can only feel embarrassed. <br /> <br /> Pronunciation: <br /> <br /> Not for everyone, but its scope and vision is not clear enough to see beyond the gray abyss. <br /> <br /> * Tragic
