Hire 3 bad movies to watch with my friends. <br /> <br /> Leprechaun 4, Jack Frost and The Prey. <br /> <br /> I picked up Jack and Lep 4 because they are well known bad movies I've never seen before. <br /> <br /> I pulled out this movie because it matches the folder 'How to find a bad movie on badmovies.org, No real description, no photos of the movie on the back, and I did it never heard, had to be a winner :) <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS, but this movie is so terrible, it doesn't matter: P) <br /> <br /> This is a WHERE bad movie, Lep 4 and Jack Frost are dumb with purpose, it's stupid, despite the best efforts of the cast and crew. <br /> <br /> This "movie" starts much like Evil Dead, even the actors look similar and have the same style of dress. Unlike Evil Dead, it never gets speed. For a slasher movie it is pretty vague, in 80 minutes, 6 people are killed, but it is spread so far that it quickly becomes boring. <br /> <br /> The director threw many boring shots on animals. hunt, of course, to go with the whole "Prey" theme, but they do nothing to promote the story and are very boring. The gore is terrible. All these extra shots were to make up for a lack of script and story. <br /> <br /> The last 5 minutes of the movie are usually shot in slow motion, but another way to add length to it. The "climax" is such a total joke, it's hard to laugh at it, so bad. The back of the box says, "The end will shock and haunt you." Yes, it will shock you that someone can put such a bad "twitch" on film and "haunt you" because you won't believe you were paid to see this crap. <br /> <br /> The tagline is also "It's not human, and it has an ax!" One person is killed with an ax throughout the movie and it is outside the screen. <br /> <br /> A real one out of 10. I LOVE laughing for bad movies, but this one is so bad it even misses properties. No bad movie companion competes without a real character building movie: P
