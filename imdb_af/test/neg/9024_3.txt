The most dying John Wayne worshipers will ring when they watch The Lawless Frontier. Even for a poverty-driving studio, this is one stinkeroo. <br /> <br /> Unusual to Western, we have a criminal who is a sex crime maker. Earl Dwire plays a half-width white and Indian pretending to be a Mexican, hokey accent and all for reasons that are not explained. Dwire sounds like the Frito Bandito of advertising fame back in the day. <br /> <br /> He and his gang happen on Gabby Hayes and his daughter, Sheila Terry. They really have nothing to rob, but Dwire just wants an excuse to kidnap Terry and go away with her. She hears the turbulent fate she has in the store and she and Hayes flee the farm. <br /> <br /> Where they happen to meet John Wayne who is on the bandits route. They also run into a very stupid sheriff who believes Wayne is one of the bandits. Again for reasons I can't quite understand. <br /> <br /> It was a difficult way to earn a living horse like the duke's. Fortunately, better things were coming.
