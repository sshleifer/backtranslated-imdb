Usually for movie reviews, I'm trying to be constructive and objective, but there's only one word for this, uh, "movie": SUCKS !!!!!!! The dialogue, acting, special effects, plot, set and characters all seem to be made by, my potted plants. Don't see it for the sake of everything that is good and right in this world! :)
