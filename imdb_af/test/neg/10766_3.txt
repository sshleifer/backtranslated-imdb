As someone who has read Baroness Orczy's books and seen the most movies on them, I must say that the 1980s, with Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour, were better than that. It was better written and fixed more to the spirit of the story than this one, which seemed to go out to engage people to be shot. This new adaptation is less light-hearted, but does not have as much depth. Although there is a good thing, the actors didn't have much to work with. Beautiful costumes.
