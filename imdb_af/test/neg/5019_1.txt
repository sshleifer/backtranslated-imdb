This movie is absolutely incredible. The only way a girl would do this on a dog is if she had serious mental health issues or had a long history of sexual abuse or coercion. Yet we are asked to believe that an otherwise 'normal' healthy woman just got a little bored and made a little mistake and oops had a sexual encounter with a dog. In addition, it never had a detrimental effect on her, except when she told someone. <br /> <br /> She was raped by a dog or the dog did something she couldn't resist - she started oral sex actively and completed this activity with a pet dog of her own choice . She wasn't on drugs or anything she'd just felt. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is trying to put this action in the light of "hey it can happen to anyone she's just honest". <br /> <br /> But really because it has to be believed, we have to believe that it is a woman who is able to do something absolutely when she feels the same. Think about it - could she have considered the rights and injustices of this action before being executed? If she did, she would have stopped in her tracks. People have instinctive boundaries for reasons. If we now consider the bestiality as a "cute" aberration, what are the next? Child abuse? Yet, the "heroine" is portrayed as a hard done by a beautiful girl who had one moment of disorder. If she had been forced to do this action through an abuse, the story would make more sense and I could accept the storyline. But there's no way to get someone to do the long-lasting activity that is needed and even refer to it once - if it's not a bit deep, it is disturbed which requires a lot of psychiatric help. It is NOT a way to do a one-off event in an otherwise perfect life. <br /> <br /> I know it's just a movie, but it is through the normalization of behavior like this via the media that society becomes desensitized and more and more terrible realities are possible. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that an abuser suggests a child to convince them that it's not such a big problem and then go ahead with their agenda. It can also be used by an abuse to underline a child not to talk about the abuse. For see how people will respond to you if you do. <br /> <br /> It's not about the truth. The director wants people to think it's about truth. It's about degradation and how easily people (the viewing public) can be manipulated to accept the most frightening concepts if they are wrapped in the right way. The viewing public is manipulated, broken down and laughed. <br /> <br /> This is a film in which actors and viewers are humiliated and foolishly sophisticated by a clever but extremely distorted film writer. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to me that as a vehicle for the creator of the movie it is used to the excitement of abusing your thoughts. I don't know if it's aware of them - but it's the most classic example of Mind F *** k I've ever experienced. <br /> <br /> I hope it doesn't offend anyone too much. But if you watched this movie, I don't think there's a room more than offensive.
