1 Bolo Yeung is 10 minutes in the movie, including when serving ice cream to his boss. 2 A large number of street people who look like the gunmen are immediately attacked by the Asian superhero who speak like an illegal alien, just from the back of a truck. 3 (villain) leave it to me - nice, gay model like muscles - heee-haaw! hee-heeew! klaphap! - he is dead on the floor with his neck, elbow, chin or balls broken - 4 cheap semi-sex scenes where the white broad comes from the north, digging the Asian superhero. 5 Norton (former C action movie star) does nothing but an eccentric, trendy weapon smuggler, who picked up a white blind girl by hand at a nightclub where they willingly follow some idiots as a millionaire they snap ( you reap what you sow) 6 Yes, the local police captain is involved and yes, the first butcher is the former superhero patrol team mate (yaawn!). 7 Action scenes are fake, like A) hee-haw! Chinese trying a spinning kick B) Sharp leg of chinese to the throat of blackhead C) The rounding of death is moving too much to Walker Texas Ranger false action. 8 end titles finally <br /> <br /> full of clutter. Those people are good enough to just be in the other C movies, or to double in the movies. Credit is mostly credited as "stunt crew fed by the county".
