There is NO Esperanto in this movie <br /> <br /> I watched this movie, especially since IMDb contains Esperanto as one of the languages ​​used. But IMDb is wrong about the languages ​​used in this movie. There is absolutely no Esperanto. It's almost all English with a few words from Navajo. Don't see this movie if you're looking for Esperanto movies. Other options instead are "Idiot's Delight" (with Clark Gable) that has a bit of Esperanto, "Incubus" is Esperanto (though utterly wrong), and there are a few Esperanto street signs in Charlie Chaplin's "The Great dictator. " There was supposed to be a spoken Esperanto in "Gattaca", but I never heard. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the other reviewer is right. This movie is a complete mess. <br /> <br /> Spend your time elsewhere.
