Ed Wood's Classic 'Plan 9' has been the worst film ever made for years. Forget it The Rollerblade Seven is infinitely worse. The film is made up of well-known brothers and almost known or actors and actresses. The plot along with the budget and the writing is not existent. The current time does not exist in the classic Ed Wood stockpile style. Instead, there is endless slow motion and repeated action. And for the Roller Blade Seven, not even seven of them! <br /> <br /> You should see this movie just to know how bad movie making can really be. To give independent filmmakers hope everywhere.
