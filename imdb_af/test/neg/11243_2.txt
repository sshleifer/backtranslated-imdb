When this show started, it was quite interesting: we had to see what the crab boat fisherman had to go through during the crab season. However, shortly thereafter, the focus is on fishing and it almost completely focuses on the drama in the life of the fisherman. Episodes have become nothing more than 'the captain doesn't like the new Greenhorn', 'somebody is injured or ill' ', a fisherman gets a word from a problem at home and is frustrated that he's stuck on' a boat, repeat. I don't know how people can see the latest seasons, because each episode looks essentially the same as before and after. This show should be moved to another channel and changed to "Crab Boat Drama", or even better, it would have made a perfect one-off segment on Dirtiest Jobs. <br /> <br /> Don't teach the Discovery Channel their lesson to American Choppers?
