I was just cautious when all the boys loved Mandy Lane, as I remember immediately reading and reading a wide variety of views? both positive and negative ?? in the short time between his short film release and the distribution to videostore shelves. It was supposedly the most ingenious and refreshing new horror movie in years, with non-stereotypical teenage characters and unpredictable plot changes. Okay, the basic concept may sound pretty innovative, but inevitably the script goes back to the same old and annoying slasher clich√©s, and as soon as it's over, even the icy stylistic brands can't save the movie from terrible mediocrity. The opening round is indeed wonderful and is literally bathed in a moody melancholy atmosphere, which makes it more and more painful to see the movie tray to the "ordinary" level of rudimentary shine. After the sublime intro, which shows a drunken macho child, his leap of a roof is dismissed to impress the titular beauty, "All the Boys Love Mandy Lane" just seems to be another handbook and a unconscious horror movie about a lot of idiotic children getting stoned and horny on a secluded farm before being killed by a not-so-unknown maniac. The film's entire pretentious set-up falls off faster than a mystery house: we never get a proper explanation why Mandy wore herself so fresh and haughty towards all her admirers (because she became an orphan, maybe? hoo), the boys soon show that they will settle for sex with any random bimbo and not just with the "divine" Mandy and the final? although undeniably unfair ?? is not pointless. The middle part of is rather sowing and doesn't even offer a really terrible excitement (shotgun murder!) Or a real, rancid slam. My generous rating of 4 out of 10 goes all the way to the grainy and disturbing 70's filming style (with faded colors, bizarre but beautiful photographic images?) And the surprisingly wonderful soundtrack. Director Jonathan Levine chose the classic Bobby Vinton song "Sealed with a Kiss" to play during the trailer and end credits while initially convinced that the film would inevitably contain Barry Manilow's cute love song "Mandy".
