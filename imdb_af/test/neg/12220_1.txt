I'm sure there's a documentary somewhere under the ruins of this Yawn festival, given enough time, maybe the producers can find it. I do not associate with any of the characters. This is a problem for a documentary. This decoupling will soon be in complete hostility adjacent to hostility. Although due to the poor story flowing, I'm not really sure what is happening to them and what are the consequences of whatever they are trying to do. The story and faces are spinning so fast, it's very hard to understand what's going on. The third founder who takes them for $ 700K is being launched late in the film. Khaleil and Tom must be fruitless to explain: "Oh yes, this man also created the idea." And just when I thought I understood a little bit about who all the tertiary characters were, was a mad woman ranting to get a puppy? How about this? Also, did Tom really give all the awkward speeches to the staff? I can only imagine the boredom they feel when it really happens. Actually, I think I feel for them.
