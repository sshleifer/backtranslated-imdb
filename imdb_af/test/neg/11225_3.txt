I found this movie to be preachy and unrealistic. It is trying to be a movie that fights children against the system, but it does not even offer a positive solution. I think I didn't really feel for the kids. I can fully understand what they were grabbing and I know how poor the state of schools is, but I found their solution and the way the exterior handled it is a lot of fees. When it comes to TV, don't waste your time. Watch short circles for the 235th time.
