... "Escape the live dead" sports production values ​​that director Scott's substandard script believes "I'm a producer can't tell it?" Thomas and two hacks who will remain nameless because I feel sorry they should attach that name to this turkey. Apparently, it's actually shot on film. This direct-to-DVD edition has virtually nothing that happened, though you haven't seen a hundred times. <br /> <br /> Despite the presence of a number of recognizable character players such as Richard "Three O'Clock High" Tyson, Erick "Stargate" Avari, and Raymond J. "Little Children" Barry, and a bunch of others not so recognizable, "FoLD" is predominantly populated with cardboard, most of which end up soaked in unconvincing false blood. There are a few (precious few) gags that work (the umbrella and the zombie trapped in its seat are both at stake), but most of the essays are pedestrian and comic-book stupid and I'm here to assure you that we are talking pedestrian and silly again. You will never believe for a moment that "FoLD" is nothing but a cheap cash in film with pretensions of cool. God prevents it from ever promising the successor's idiotic promise. <br /> <br /> Strictly free viewing, depending on how impeccable your local library is, and otherwise suitable for sloppy and indifferent.
