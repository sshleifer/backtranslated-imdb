Last night I saw a promotion for this movie on Spike channel, it was grouped with a Patrick swazy from another movie he made and thought, was swazy in this sequel ..... boy was I wrong .... I see the writer author also played in it, and I think the budget was a bit tight. I'm surprised to see Will Patton in the movie, he has much better credits in his name to play in such a "c" movie. Bussey Jr. tried so hard to portray the image of his father (one of the best bad guys actors ever) who failed. The only redeeming features in the movie were the chicks ,,,,, nice and with lots of T & A just not worth the time or your hard earned dollar to rent it
