The previews were so funny I couldn't wait to see this movie. I just got home and I must say I couldn't have been embarrassed by this movie anymore. Yes, there were times when the jokes were funny, but the stereotypical roles were painful. Joan Plowright is a good actress, but the scene with the "spiritual" was only in bad taste. Needless to say, the laughter was few and far between in the movie house for a largely white crowd (I was one of a very small handful of blacks).
