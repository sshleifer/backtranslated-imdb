The only reason I saw this movie - since it was released about a decade ago - was because of Ian Holm; I was intrigued to see his portrayal of my second favorite character in this play. Anyway, this movie is as eager as the Old Zeff has produced since "Jesus of Nazareth". But some of the best parts of the play have been omitted. I understand the directing / editing choices, but I don't think it really does the right thing. Maybe I'm too much a purist. I will have to lead people (who have read it) to Branagh's version, if it's not that I despise his tendency to over-estimate. He also plays a better Hamlet than Gibson. But then we're not all waiting for Gibson to prove himself an actor? Now all he has done is prove that he wants to make films in extinct languages. <br /> <br /> Maybe the only Shakespeare-worthy play here is Scofield as the Ghost.
