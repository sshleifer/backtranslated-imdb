A group of teenagers discover a bootleg video game, but as soon as they start playing, they start killing each one just as they do in the video game. As they become addicted to the game, they need to find a way to beat the game's central villain, The Blood Countess, before killing them all. <br /> <br /> The point of departure sounds a little silly and familiar, but this film could still have been generously entertaining. However, this horror movie is not scary at all. It's actually more of a comedy than anything else. The movie takes itself too seriously and the movie is not much fun to watch. Certainly, there is occasional laughter, but for the most part the movie is very boring. PG-13 horror movies can still be good like The Ring of Cry Wolf. The Ring and Stay Alive are not really the same kind of horror movie. Stay Alive is more of a slasher movie and since its rated PG-13, the dead scenes are very soft. It had to be the movie's main sales and as it had an interesting concept, the deaths could really have been good. Unfortunately, the studio wanted a bigger audience and the movie had to be changed. <br /> <br /> The play is a complete joke and most of the movies are terrific. Jon Foster is not a very good leading man. He does not have the charisma to really engage the audience or the audience to care about him. His character is not unlikely, just very dirty. Samaire Armstrong actually gives a good performance, though a little too thin to really stick out. Frankie Muniz is probably the best show in Stay Alive. It is an honor at the level of the best player on the Houston Texans. Sophia Bush is absolutely horrible like October. Her performance feels so chased and so fake. The most annoying character in the movie is Phineas played by Jimmi Simpson. His character is so unlikely that you will root for him to die. <br /> <br /> In fact, most characters are pretty unlikely, making it even harder to get interested in the movie. It's just hard to be sorry for some of these annoying kids and it's great to see if you want to survive the characters. The only real good thing about the movie is the atmosphere. It's a bit old, but it's kind of work. The movie is also very short, so it's not too much pain to go through. I wouldn't really blame the role because they worked with an inexperienced director and writer. The direction is not very good and the script is not much better. Stay Alive is actually not the worst horror movie of 2006. The honor will go to When a stranger calls. Stay Alive is still a missed opportunity. In the end, these stockings and lame horror film were better placed on the shelf. Rating 4/10.
