One of the many silent comedies Stan Laurel appeared before forging with Oliver Hardy, 'Mud and Sand' is a ho-hum loft. The story is weak from one another - although it may be due to modern editing - and the humor itself is not inventive at all. <br /> <br /> Potential plotlines are started and ignored; For example, Stan's promise to pay Fillet de Sole for what she was doing to him never came into being. Stan's character also doesn't look very centered, but it is a common criticism of his work before he developed 'Stanley' from Laurel & Hardy. So I can only expect this shortcoming. <br /> <br /> I strongly believe that all the silent movies should be kept and I am glad this one is still available. It's just not a good movie.
