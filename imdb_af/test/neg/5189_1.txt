About 20 minutes into this terrible apology for a movie, I realized it reminded me of one of those annoying people at work, who always say they really make jokes or do very unpredictable things because they think it's funny and try to entertain everyone. <br /> <br /> This film is billed as main characters Traci Lords, she is not so bad at an actress, but her lines are not funny and she is NOT the star <br /> <br /> The play is some of The most god-fearing I have ever seen, except for Lords, the girl Casey plays, and maybe the colonel - which seems strange. I can't imagine why a retired military colonel wants to start a SNOWBOARDING ACADEMY. Does it even do that? <br /> <br /> The budget would have been better to nurture these women to make a porn feature. <br /> <br /> "Freddy Got Fingered" currently has a 3.5 score, "Frostbite" has a 2.7. I'm surprised that these two movies are within a 1.0, FGF is "The Godfather" compared to this garbage. <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars
