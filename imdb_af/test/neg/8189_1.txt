This person is a so-called entertainer who has to be superfluous for curse, vulgarity and slander to make others believe he has talent. I have often seen that cartoons use some of each with effect, but if all you can say is nailed, it is a sign of a drug-related twisted mind. Let me wonder where his twisted and fried brain will be in a few years of abuse. Arm man !!! I admit I couldn't see everything - too stupid for words. The wonderful part of this is that someone actually believes he's a philosopher !!! No wonder self-respect and decency are diminishing and perversity is rising. Could it be that the UFC was a factor in its deadened brain?
