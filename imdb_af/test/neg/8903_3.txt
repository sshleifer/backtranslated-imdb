Abderrahmane Sissako may have known what he did when he made "Bamako", but the rest of us could just move back into mystification and confusion to try to figure out what that purpose would be. <br /> <br /> The nominal "plot" involves a young African singer who plans to leave her unemployed man to find work in the city. But much more of the screenplay is addressed with what the film's publishers describe as "a mockery of key financial institutions dealing with the overwhelming economic hardship of Africa." It is all good and good, but if the arguments and ideas are unamended and pedanted in a way they are here, they lose power and impact. If the director found the means to address issues such as the harmful effects of colonialism on the African population and the problem of African debt in something even remotely resembling a compelling storyline, the film would be the intellectual and emotional resonance it is so clear now. <br /> <br /> The topics that the film deals with can be relevant and important, but try to go down that is worth two hours to speak as a real, honest-to-God. movie probably won't get much of an audience for your message.
