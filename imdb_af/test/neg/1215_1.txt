It's amazing that such a cliche-driven yuppie anxiety film was actually made in the first place. The characters are so weak, and the play is so uninspired that it is impossible to care about any of them - especially Brooke Shields. The temptation to move forward through the slow parts is almost irresistible. If you like this genre, you'll be better off renting "Singles" or "Bodies, Rest and Movement".
