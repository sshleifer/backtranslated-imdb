I was drawn into this movie early, to my surprise, because I didn't want to see it at all. Now I wish I didn't. The tension starts well, with the hit-and-run that leads to death and the question of whether the guilty character confesses or is found out, or (now practicable, though no no in the old days of making movies) ) Get away with it. The plot has been done before - which plot does it have - but the tension inherent with the additional complications and motivation arising from the illegal love affair allows for an initial first half. Then the movie leaves the hits to begin with a foggy outline of two unanswered, suffering love. The two traces of plot - hits and unreasonable love - just don't have enough to do with each other and that they involve the same characters, don't tie them enough to justify the departure of the original story. line. The scriptwriter had chosen one plot or the other. At the end of the film, in the middle of the second funeral of the movie, I thought to myself, "Now, what is it about the hit industry?" The filmmakers may think the answer is obvious, but I think the movie is suddenly worked out and executed.
