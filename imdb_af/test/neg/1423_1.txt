Jerry Lewis was marginally funny when he didn't write his own material and had a good director like Frank Tashlin. When he started writing and directing his own films, which little talent he owns, is overshadowed by his egoism. When his films would fail (and so) on the American market (they made money in France), Lewis always blamed everyone and everything except himself; For example, he blamed the film's failure because Lewis was issued a double account with the Deep Throat porn attribute. If someone had to complain about the situation, it had to be the producers of "Deep Throat". It is an absolutely idiotic "comedy" about the world's richest man (Lewis) rejected in World War II for military service and decides to run a special "team" to go to Germany and hit Hitler himself capture. Besides the many flaws this movie has, Lewis's "direction" is inconsistent, the film has the appearance of a cheap home movie. Lewis apparently thought that he was a good idea with no talent, exaggerated -hill Borscht Belt comics like Jan Murray and Sidney Miller; He had to think they would be so bad that they would make him look good. He was half right; they are embarrassingly bad, but he even gets worse than they do. For a "comedy", Lewis's character is dumb, angry and intrusive; The way he is abusing his subversion makes you wonder why they will ever follow such a bully on a dangerous mission like catching Hitler. The fact that this movie has somehow collected is amazing. This is by far the worst Jerry Lewis movie I have ever seen. I heard that "Slapstick" is even more pathetic, but I can't see if it's true or not - and should be avoided at all possible costs.
