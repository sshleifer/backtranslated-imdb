Oh my earth !!!! It was the first movie Broken Lizard to be made as a group (although it has just recently become video), and I have never been disappointed in my whole life !!! I tell you what if I saw this movie before I saw Super Troopers (which is a kick, a $$ movie !!!) I would never have watched !! I read several reviews online, as well as on the cover of the DVD, which it means "Broken Lizard's funniest movie ever! Now, referring to Super Troopers as their funniest movie ever, I won't vote, but not this one "Talk about dry. It took the movie a good 45 minutes to even go, and then I was out of the mood to see it, it's not even worth it. Maybe you should be high for it really. I don't know, I love these guys, I really do, but the movie is by far the worst they have made. Club Dread was a good movie, but this one, just wow. Highly recommended if you want a good laugh, but if you want more of a romance, drama, with some funny places, I want to say with Puddle Cruiser. Just my opinion is all right on their own! :)
