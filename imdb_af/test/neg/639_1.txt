I'm a big fan of sci-fi movies. When I saw this movie in the EPG, I thought I was an enjoyable evening. What a disappointment! Such a poor performance of "special" effects I could not imagine in 1980, but in 2005? Come on, why would you do special effects from a helicopter in the desert when you can make a real one movie for a much lower price (I think)? And the killers "muppets" ... well, I can do better than that in a few hours in the garage. You can expect to have a low budget on a movie, but I don't think it's reasonable to have a low film for any budget. As for the "star" of the movie (tonight I use many quotes ...), Lou Diamond Philips, the man is not even an actor. Maybe he had to stay with the martial arts movies. All in all, a horrible movie. Maybe I'm in a bad mood tonight. Then again, maybe not. A sincere 1 out of 10.
