Quentin, in my opinion, wrote and directed only one good film and that was the multiple award-winning pulp fiction. However, most of the movies, especially of recent, are real REAL turkeys. People still rate them today and its good and I really don't see why. There are many other directors and writers who are now much more entertained in all aspects of their movies. From this point on, I won't believe the hype that is a Tarantino movie. <br /> <br /> Greedy was too long and worse, you felt it. The humor was good, minimal and not humorous. The violence was nothing new (minus the final scene). The dialogue is sometimes very much signed out. <br /> <br /> For some, they will love this movie; and for others they will hate it. <br /> <br /> ... and I thought Nazi's topic was finally put to the test with the incredible 2004 German film Der Untergang.
