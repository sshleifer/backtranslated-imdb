I'm a big fan of when it comes to Doctor Who series and still is. But I was very disappointed when I started looking at this new series. <br /> <br /> Children under the age of 15, or even below the age of 10, are likely to enjoy the best and possibly new fans who haven't seen any of the original ranges. But as far as fans of the original series are concerned, this series will lack much of the charm that the original series made. as well, it took David Tennant to appreciate me. Appreciate how much better Christoper Eccellestion was than a doctor in the 1st season. <br /> <br /> I would only recommend this series to people not much of the original series, people under 15, and EXTREMELY THE HARD who fans, everyone will just laugh and mumble swear words about Russel T. Davies screwed one of our favorite TV shows.
