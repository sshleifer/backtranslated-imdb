Jackie Chan movies are typical examples of how the supply is greater than demand. Well, to be honest, what question? In this one, Jackie Chan, whatever his name is in this one, I doubt he knows, and he's a kind of driver. Well, he drives 10 miles an hour and then the footage is pushed up, so I can do all the stunts myself. During the big final, in which Jackie Chan wants to arrest the bad man by hitting him In a race we finally see how scary this production really is. China's fight, especially in the casino, is decent, but if we talk about special effects, best Lord.And, should everyone in this race crash? This is not dumb. And here it really isn't safe for the drivers. There is not even a concrete wall in the area. And don't start me about what kind of horrible story it has, I mean, it's Hong Kong, it's probably written with gun point by eight-year-olds, but still, what a mess. I like Chan as much as the next man, maybe more since I saw Rush Hour, but his agent's delayed cousin has to choose his projects better.
