The better to describe it than scuzzy criminals on TV? And I don't mean COPS in the show; here they are actually presented as major players. <br /> <br /> I do not see any remedial value in this show unless you have a wrong affection for human tragedies. Whitney Houston is a tragic example of the fallen star; a star that helped Bobby Brown pull out of the air. Bobby Brown is nothing but a lower-life criminal. Why watch him? Why doesn't Whitney stand with him, how contemptuous is he? This couple should be locked up and it is a horrible shame that they make money and get a mercy of glory to see the septic tank their lives and human waste are their character.
