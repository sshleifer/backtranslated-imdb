My mom forced me to watch this movie with her. She will apparently see anything with a vampire advice in it. I was bored throughout. <br /> <br /> At various points, Underworld: Rise of the Lycans, reminiscent of Spartacus, Battle for the monkey planet, the passion of Christ and Mandingo! What reminds me the most is the Italian sword and sandal photos of the nineteenth-sixties (not the good ones) who spend an extraordinary amount of time talking Greek or Roman despots in robes and being ransacked while waiting impatiently spermanerman hero and his lover, usually the desperate daughter, to do something. <br /> <br /> This film was in desperate need of some color and tension. The characters were nice two-dimensional. <br /> <br /> The kits look like they are built entirely of tin! I wonder how many Civil War sets are melted to make this movie. <br /> <br /> Everyone who wears fishing socks on your arms and black lipstick feels free to click NO.
