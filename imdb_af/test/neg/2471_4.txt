For what it's worth, it's a pretty decent Road Runner cartoon, a bit short (just under 6 minutes). The gags are at best adequate, the animation is capable and the new restored DVD master looks good. But this is where the features end. Allow me to give a little background: in 1958, WB used a bunch of tinsel music, which was used by a labor dispute, in 6 of the year's cartoons. <br /> <br /> There is only one phrase to describe this short music, and that is "it has the 4Kids sound". I use the phrase to describe music that has absolutely no correspondence to screen performance, and feels it has been recorded by an orchestra consisting of members of a Sonic Youth Coat. The music in this short feels hopelessly and incredibly stupid, especially since there are scenes in this short (namely the piano trap) that would be best with little or no music. <br /> <br /> I don't think a WB cartoon will be devastated by terrible music (even Lava's scores aren't that unnecessary), but in the light of the cartoon it's not that significant, but It is almost painful to watch the music. It's similar to how late 80's episodes of Doctor Who can be bad anyway, yet made unwavering because of Keff McCulloch's incredibly horrible music (which seemed to hit the demo button at all 5 Casio keyboards at the same time ). <br /> <br /> I'm going to make people love this, but I can easily see one of Larriva's RR cartoons about this. At least, the canned music was usually in line with the action on it.
