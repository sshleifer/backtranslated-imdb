The Poisonous Avenger ... <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​this movie is that a person who would call the general public this person a looser and then thrown to a barrel of toxic waste, in a superhero change is completely unsuitable sounded OK, even for 1985. This movie is listed as a horror ... I even read of a cult following with this series .... <br /> <br /> Now this is movie even when it was made was so bad I couldn't stop watching ... the acting is terrible, even for an independent movie I think the horror would be part of this movie ... <br /> < drug trading, sumo, Godzilla entrance .... I'm all for anti-drug movies ... heck I even love Godzilla and sumo ... I'm not into it, but I even think that Sumo heights will love to give this movie the 1000 hand flap and ground salt in the eyes of the people who made this movie. <br /> <br /> Personally, I am almost ready to write to the film company that made it and ask them the 87 min of my life back. <br /> <br /> For me, 1 out of 10 is too high, it's too bad there's no 0 (zero) or even negative integers to put on a movie here. <br /> <br /> In other words, this movie is JUNK ...... would rather be paint dry and deal with explosive diarrhea and then watch this movie again ... I'll be the first person to come use Not only the packaging of this movie as kindling, but I will be for a good movie and script fire.
