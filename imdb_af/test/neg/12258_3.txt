It seems to be two movies in one split. First, ZaSu Pitts is an apostate in a small town. She wants to help Marjorie Woodworth's romantic life. OK: I've never heard of her before. But she and Pitts are in both parts of this contraction. <br /> <br /> Before we know it, Pitts is no longer, Miss {Polly. She's Emmie. I had to rewind to see if I had fallen asleep somewhere. I didn't. She is no longer in a small town, but heading for the Honeymoon destination title. <br /> <br /> The movie has some cute moments. The first part is better, with roles for what every third-class character actress looks like in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> And what about Mrs. Woolworth? She sounds a bit like Betty Hutton. She sounds a bit like Marie Wilson. She's pretty, sure. But she's not a comedy. <br /> <br /> Pitts are often used in very small roles. Here she has the greatest role. She's always fun, though this movie makes me wonder if a little of her is not completely over. (As a comic book. When she was a tragic actress in Von Stroheim's silence - "The Wedding March" and Greed "are the two I saw - she was brilliant.)
