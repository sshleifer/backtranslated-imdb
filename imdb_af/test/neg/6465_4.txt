It is definitely a "lesser known" comedy short of the 1920s. The only reason I saw it was because it was on a DVD of Kino Films containing non-Laurel and Hardy shorts with Ollie. They are interesting and historically important, but generally average to below average for the style film. Compared to shorts by Chaplin, Keaton, Arbuckle and Lloyd, they are definitely a step among them in quality and humor. Also the accompanying music was pretty poor by the standards of other silent DVDs. I eventually turned off the sound due to the impropriety of the music to set the right mood. But despite this, they are still worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I must be honest about this brief. It was the last of 8 on this DVD and by the time I got there, I was pretty bored with the mediocrity of 7 of the 8 shorts. So, it is possible the movie could be a little better than a 4 - but definitely, if not, better than a 5! The movie is a nice standard short of an unauthorized bellboy. Nothing very interesting and there are certainly much better still shorts out there.
