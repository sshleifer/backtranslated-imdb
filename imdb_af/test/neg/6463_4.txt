On a Thursday evening at 22:00, my local west coast ABC affiliated with the pilot division of Northern Exposure. The ABC network usually airs "Men in Trees" in the time slot, but the program is predicted for a lively sporting event. <br /> <br /> Despite both shows being set up and filmed in Alaska on the Pacific Northwest location (Exposure in Washington State, Trees in Vancouver, BC), reconsider "Northern Exposure" (as well as some episodes from "Sex and the City"), how do I remind myself of the poorly budding hybrid "Men in Trees". <br /> <br /> Anne Heche can be a good actress with the right material. Unfortunately, her role as a writer falls into my small town in Alaska. Perhaps because I feel that Heche is in disrepair, I am not convinced of her out-of-water character. <br /> <br /> I can't help but feel the supporting role fits the typical peculiar stereotypes. The nice local, the friendly bar owner, the forest rider, the local police officers, the dull but deliberate radio DJ, etc. <br /> <br /> The only stereotype that might have broken was teddy bear and veteran "ER" actress Abraham Benrubi as the local barman in love with two different women. As one of the executive producers was the movie maker James Mangold (his films "Heavy" and "Cop Land" capitals that were big men), I'm not surprised why Benrubi was cast in a non-typical role. <Br /> <br /> However, I can see why there are many dedicated viewers who love "Men in Trees". It fits the peculiar niche for television groups. I wish the show could find its own voice instead of borrowing ideas from better performances.
