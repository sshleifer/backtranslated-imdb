The emperor's NEW GROOVE return for Disney Pictures follows, but this time the spotlight is on Kronk (pronounced by Patrick Warburton), who is no longer Yzma's (Eartha Kitt) handyman. Kronk started a new life and is very happy with his role as chef of his own restaurant. Things go along happily until Kronk gets word that she is visiting Papi (John Mahoney). Kronk is worried because he knows his life won't impress his Papi. One thing he always wanted and never received is an inch from his father. A flurry of blunders and a huge cheese blast in the restaurant make our hero very deep in trouble and anxiety. To save that day, a little help from his friends. <br /> <br /> Other voices: Tracey Ullman, David Spade, John Goodman, Wendie Malick, April Winchell and Gatlin Green.
