I would very much like to believe that the above quotation (specifically the English caption translation), which is actually written, is not spoken, in a rejection letter that a publisher sends to the protagonist, self-referring in a tongue-in-check manner. But if so, director Leos Carax apparently failed to inform the actors of the true nature of the film. They are all so terribly serious in their portrayals that I have to close down Carax, actually take themselves seriously, or else have so little contempt for everyone, especially the viewers, that he cannot be bothered to leave anyone in the joke. br /> <br /> Some authors can get away with making oblique, bizarre films because they do it with Ã©lan and unique personal style (eg David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky). Others use a subtle approach while still weaving surreal elements in the fabric of the story (for example, Krzysztof Kieslowski, and David Cronenberg's later, less bizarre works). In Pola X, Carax throws an unusual mess at the viewer and dares to find fault with it. Well, here it is: the pacing is volatile and choppy, in particular, continuity is often done away; superfluous characters flow (eg, gypsy mother and child); most of the shows are overwhelmed; The lighting is often poor, especially in the often discussed sex scene; Unconnected screens are placed in the movie for the clear reason. and the list goes on. <br /> <br /> Not to be completely negative, please note that there were some lifting exceptions. I like the musical score, even the cacophonic industrial techno music is played in the vast, deserted complex that the main characters return in the second half of the film (perhaps a reference to Andy Warhol's' 60s' Factory '? ). Much of the rural photography was beautiful, a clear attempt to contrast with the grim city institutions. And even in the middle age, Cathering Deneuve shows that she still has "it". Her performance was also the only one of the main characters who did not sink into bados. <br /> <br /> There was an earlier time when I would consider such films as "Pola X" more purposeful. Experimentation is admirable even when the experiment does not work. But Carax doesn't try anything new here; The film is a surprise of elements borrowed from many earlier films, and after a few decades of movie viewing and literally thousands of movies later, I simply no longer have the patience for this kind of original, poorly crafted tri-head. At this early moment in the 21st century, it is still being asked: With the exception of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, there are * any * directors in France who know how to make a viewable movie more? Rating: 3/10.
