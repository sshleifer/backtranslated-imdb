I'm a big fan of Thomas Harris, I read all his novels at least 5 times and Hannibal is the book I love the most. That's why the movie was my biggest disappointment and I didn't really get it why some people didn't give it a nine or even a ten. Similarly, their claims are very low, or they have not read the book or both. Even if I didn't read the book, I would consider the movie an absolute mean and I would have a five. The spectacular, mysterious atmosphere of the novel does not appear in the movie once. When I first saw it in the movie, I even fell asleep. Why was Margot Verger, a very important character, completely omitted? Why is Barney shown as a stupid ignorant whose only purpose is to earn money? And most often, why was the psychological process that Starling went through caused by the drugs that Lecter applied? Not to mention the fact that the end has also been left out and completely changed? Well, the reasons why Jodie Foster refused to play Starling again is well-known and I accepted it, although I am definitely many others, I am very disappointed because I identified Starling with her. For stories like Red Dragon, The silence of the lambs or Hannibal possessing such psychological depth is very important to identify with a character when adapted to the screen, but as the Germans say, it is a snow of yesterday . Ridley Scott did amazingly good movies, but with this one he doesn't live up to his name. Jonathan Demme had exactly the right feel for the plot, the characters and their relationships to each other. The silence of the lambs, he also had to do Hannibal. My only consolation is that I only saw the movie twice. long ago and thanks for the reason, I can't see the scenes of the movie when I read the novel. I'm sorry, but I really can't recommend it to anyone.
