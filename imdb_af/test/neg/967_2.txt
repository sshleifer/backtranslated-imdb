For all purposes, Showtime was the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Why? Because you have Deniro in the cast, you add instant credibility and let's see the movie. I also made the mistake of recently watching 48 hours and Beverly Hills Cop before I see Showtime and for a strange reason thought Eddie Murphy was still funny. Well, he's not. In fact, it seems he is almost. While watching this movie, I was surprised that Deniro decided it was a good writing to give his name as well. No chemistry between him and Murphy whatsoever. Terrible writing, horrible jokes, a movie you think is supposed to be good can't be much worse than that. Not too long after I saw the misery that Showtime was, I watched National Security Judge Martin Lawrence look. The movie had its funny parts, but it wasn't that good. But it was still 20 times better than Showtime. Please, if you don't see a fan of Deniro this movie !!
