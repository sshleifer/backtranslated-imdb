There's a point in the movie where the female boss of the death machines (a multi-ethnic trio to please everyone, including I think it's called today) talks about using leverage on a businessman. Apart from that, it's her delivery that sounds like learning. At what point did this viewer discover that this dull movie was a corner in a new world of kinkiness. But it didn't. The boss lady had to do the talking, as the "kill machines" didn't say a single word throughout the movie. Endlessly. There is action in the movie, but it's not that exciting and the plot staggers from one clich√© to another. The three dumb "dead machines" live to survive another day at the end of the movie. Hopefully there wasn't a successor.
