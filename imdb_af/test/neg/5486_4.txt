I've seen a lot of movies by Pedro Almodóvar, but so far it will be the most disappointing. This movie seemed to be the zaniness that is usually everywhere in his films, and the story just never interested me. Many Almodóvar tribes appear in this movie, so it's not as if there was a lack of screen talent, but this movie was just more serious than its other movies. If there was a comic edge for this movie, I certainly couldn't find it, and it made for one surprisingly poor movie.
