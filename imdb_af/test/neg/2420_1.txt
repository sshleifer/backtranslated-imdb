Awful movie. Terrible acting, cheesy, totally unrealistic, embarrassing for anyone who played the game. For a start, the man is not a hooker, he will be slapped in two. As for 'I score, it's my job' 'no it isn't. For the uneducated American audience it can come as a good movie. For me, it's a few hours of my life, I'll never come back. I read through the reviews and came across the one where the man sounded that he knew what he was talking about. Then I read - <br /> <br /> "And while American rugby can never reach the level of talent that New Zealand or South Africa has, third in the world is also nothing to hang your head over '' <br /> <br /> All I can say is, LMFAO! <br /> <br /> Keep playing your American football and baseball, leave the right sports to the big boys.
