This movie was terrible. It was so terrible. <br /> <br /> Most annoying was the way the trial was conducted. The lawyer is allowed to walk over and over when a witness is questioned without the prosecution raising any objections. He attacked the children to testify to cruel cruelty and repeatedly shouted to them that they were lying. It's just not stuff they are subject to sexually abused children. The trial is stupid and it ruins the whole movie ... (Law and Order has spoiled me for courtroom accuracy-ness).
