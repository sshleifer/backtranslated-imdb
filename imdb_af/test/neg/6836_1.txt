It's hard to screw this story up. GREAT book / GOOD Movie version of Fred Zinneman, but this movie is AWFUL! At first the casting was terrible. Richard Gere has to play the Jackal himself, as Edward Fox was a similar kind of cypher and they don't have to waste the original script by adding so much worthless (expensive) fluff. This movie reminds me of so many Bruce Willis movies, as you see huge costs with NOTHING movies to show for it. (This is his "Conspiracy Theory"). It actually requires a movie that is so bad of such a good original script. EVERY person from Michael Caton Jones must be banned from making films for 10 years; So the insult this movie is for real filmmakers. Was Hollywood going to trial because they didn't have an idea of ​​what they did, this movie will exhibit A. Shame on you EVERYTHING!
