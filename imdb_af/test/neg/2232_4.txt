If it's considered an independent feature, I can't say it's bad, but from where I stand this successor and the original "Lady and the Tramp" don't agree! They are two completely different movies of different style, different voting qualities, different narratives and about the only thing they share with each other is the footage (eg, the townhouse of Jim Dear, Darling, Lady and Tramp) and nothing has changed. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for any kind of continuity for the release of the original for those memorable songs such as "Bella Notte" and "The Siamesse Cats Song", this sequel won't give you any at all! Just about every song has a little pop and the good old characters like Jock and Trusty, Jim Dear and Darling and Aunt Sarah and her cats can be seen well, but they seem to be somehow replaced by new characters, not to speak. Peg does not occur, whose voices are very irritating. Even Lady and Tramp do not appear often enough and for Scamp? He is so spoiled! And treat his father, Tramp, with total contempt, then walk away with no regrets even after hearing how much he missed at home! And they called his shameless way an adventure! I want to say Scott Wolf really took out the battered bad boy in Scamp, who erases the typical cute Disney animal. Even the old characters just hurt you about it; Trust sounds like Goofy sick in bed, Jock (Jeff-stupid-Bennett) - and his VOICE - doesn't sound Scottish or worth hearing! Spread it as far as possible to free our poor ears from its voice and for the stupid, feathery, surprising JUNKYARD DOG !!!!!! Someone put them down !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> "Lady and the Tramp 2" is not bad if you don't have a tough day yet, but I expect much more charm from a sequel to a true classic - Scamp is chavvy, so is his friend Angel and there is a bad storyline. Yet I think you should try it at least once, because, as I say, there are many worse movies.
