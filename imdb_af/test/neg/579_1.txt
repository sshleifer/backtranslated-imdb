I'm a big Robert Taylor fan and I've been trying to find all his movies. This is one I did not have, but I recently watched Fox Movie Channel and was very disappointed. I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script. Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable. Taking into account the relationship between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry was on the screen between the two. But the premise of the movie was so ridiculous: that the US president would order a fleet to leave the service secretly to hunt down bankers and only report to the president that making it difficult to do anything else about the film. The deadly scenes were completely disrupted. The only thing worse than Taylor's play was Stanwyck's song. She later became better in the ball of fire thanks to heaven.
