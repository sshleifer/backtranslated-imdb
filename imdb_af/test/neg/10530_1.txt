Seagal fans watch-He does action scenes up to almost an hour in this mess. Instead, Seagal runs away from numerous battles, so Ja Rule convincingly loses every battle. In fact, Ja Rule can be an emerging action star, but at least Hollywood has to let him down late (which will happen in a few years ...) What kind of commando / terrorist also wears a bare-midriff outfit? The chick in this atrocity looks like a backing singer for Christina Aguilera. Back to Seagal. When he is finally cut loose, it is his stunt double (PLEASE PADDED to look at the inflated Seagal) doing a lot of work and taking the fall. I also don't remember aikido. It's just your standard kicks and punches you want to see in any straight-to-video martial arts turkey. Not even "so-bad-it-funny". Not so boring ...
