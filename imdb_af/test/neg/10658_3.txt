Two redemptive features of this film were the film snapshot and a storyline that was difficult to resist. However, the writing, the direction and some scenes were just awful. I asked myself why such a good role would have built such a bad movie. My only conclusion was that these actors must believe in the charity underlying the plot of the movie, but knew that the movie was filled with errors. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been so much better and has a bigger audience accordingly. What makes me think is that with all the problems of the movie, some scenes are painfully bad to watch, I still wanted to see how the obvious conclusion would solve him.
