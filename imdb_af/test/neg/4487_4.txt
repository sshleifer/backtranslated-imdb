I look forward to the view of two bright young actors appearing in "Dear John", but it was moving very slowly; and I felt that both the script and the direction hampered the flexibility of the starting performers. I usually enjoy movie adaptations of these novels. Ironically, I thought the movie did an excellent job of portraying realistic military action. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was great to face with love letters, focusing just enough on a keyword or phrase in each letter. I felt that Channing Tatum got stuck in what became a very "hang dog" series of expressions in response to loss.
