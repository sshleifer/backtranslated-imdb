I recently rented this movie on DVD and thought it would be an interesting choice as I am interested in northern England (Bradford) in the film environment. However, it soon became clear that this film was a decent developmental dissertation. The characters were poor and often stereotyped and the story had no content. The subject can be an interesting base for a movie. However, delivering this seems naive and unfocused. <br /> <br /> The end felt like it was definitely about the characters - punishment and rewarding where the filmmakers felt needed. It got a little uncomfortable and stupid, and it looked like the "realism" used in the shooting style. For me, the movie treated the characters and the subject in a rather heavy-handed and clumsy way. It seemed as if the author had already decided how to end the story and sit down over the crow, and everything else to fit in. <br /> <br /> Another point I feel strongly about is the dimmed Ken Loach feel the movie has. I'm quite upset that British film financiers can't see that there are more British movies than 'gritty realism'. It has almost become a safe option. Film is an endless wonderful playground for imaginative ideas and is not exploited by British film producers. There's a lot of talent here in the UK. It's a pity that most of these individuals eventually make either music videos and movies 100% of the time or they go to America. <br /> <br /> Love + Hate would have worked better if it cut down to 30 or 60 minutes and appeared as a one-time TV drama.
