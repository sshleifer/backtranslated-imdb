Can you stop people to believe everything this man says. Get <br /> <br /> your facts straight before starting to praise this liar. He is not even <br /> <br /> of Flint. He just says to make his "blue collar" look. He is <br /> <br /> a rich suburb of Flint. I mean he went to a private school. <br /> <br /> His parents paid him to go to school. Wow, it looks like <br /> <br /> as much of Flint's. He was also born in Canada. Oh wait, it makes him a Canadian citizen. I wish he would just move there. Instead, he lives here in his $ 1 million apartment in New York. It's the working class right there. I can't wait for his DVD set to come out. I want to talk about how big companies are bad. Where will I get those DVDs? Oh yes, at Target and Wal-Mart. The two largest companies in the US, which were also the only two stores, allowed them to sell.
