There is an underlying stream in all the positive reviews of this movie - it's just a mindless comedy, don't take it seriously. Chillax dude !!! Well, this is a point of view. The other would be - why do we accept exactly the same writing, the same formula and the same indifferent people in all these "comedies". <br /> <br /> What you get is a slacker that, by some totally unreal circumstances, must change his life (always a man), overcome a set of circumstances that are just a problem or a raccoon or teenager would cause, the equally stupid bad guy who defeated the bile he met two days earlier and triumphed by a slacker, but with more money / self-esteem. On the way someone does something rough but very illogical. This means that the viewer can call someone to the movie and say something, "You won't believe it. This man finds the otter drowning in the bucket of diarrhea. The other man left behind after eating lax brownies. Then poured he puts his shoes on it ". Hilarious. <br /> <br /> Most of the common names come up. David Spade and Rob Schneider do indecent shtick, but they are crrrazzeee characters - a Russian and I keep my sides, a waiter in a vegan restaurant. Adam Sandler, king of the brainless unfunny, co-producing illogical comedy and a few unloved nobody called Dante again. The US will have to explain to the rest of the world what this man Dante is famous for because we are uncertain. Allen Covert plays a 36-year-old who received the biggest nocturnal laugh from me. He was 42 years old. <br /> <br /> Did I laugh? Yeah, but not more than I'm at a TV, and I don't have to pay a penny to see it. Please stop making these movies.
