A show about an amazing stupid, male child and his gritty hot wife. 99% of the sites revolve around Doug, do something incredibly stupid and then come up with a variable: a) he also hides it from his wife or b) tells his wife, his emasculates him and then it is to the father-in-law (Arthur: the typecast character of Seinfeld) to aggravate the situation. <br /> <br /> And the authors dare say it's influenced by the "Honeymooners" (an absolute classic) and that the plots are drawn from real-life situations unless you live in a cave, you know it is not true. <br /> <br /> Anyway, let's put it that way. If Kevin James was thin, the show would have canceled. If you're 12 or you love fat jokes. Be my guest, watch this show (or any of Kevin James movies). <br /> <br /> I noticed that some posters compare this travesty to much better shows such as Friends, Seinfeld and Everyone Love Raymond. I still wonder how someone can do it
