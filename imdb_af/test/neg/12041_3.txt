"Carlito's Angels" is a spoof of Charlie's Angels, who is not afraid to sometimes even spoof, but that does not mean that the film is beyond the criticism of the viewers. It's amateurish and young (I think fast). -motion "became funny in 1914. The oncoming rap music often drowns the dialogue, and the film feels longer than it is, even though it hardly goes for an hour! The girls themselves are warm and beautiful, with wonderful lean bodies, and even if they never get naked, their outfits leave little imagination, by looking at their IMDb pages, I found out that one of them (Alessandra Ramos) is actually going with a movie career; I wish her luck because although this movie is bad, she (as well as the other girls) has everything that has energy, and i will not mind seeing her again on the screen.
