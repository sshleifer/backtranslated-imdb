The bad, verbally abused film student head runs his male assistant, who has been traced to tracking requests, while the young man holds firmly under his thumb with constant threats to unemployment. After a year of office terrorism, the work finally cracked. Author-director George Huang may have a little bit more than he can chew here. His "Swim With Sharks" is not a diatribe against Hollywood, nor is it a tribute to the hardworking downfall. Instead, it is stunt movie making with a twist, a once-off pony with tunnel vision. The environment doesn't look or feel like Tinsel Town (perhaps due to a limited budget) and we never get a sense of this stressful environment as a filmmaking entity (it can be a brokerage office in the valley, for everything we know). Suffer Kevin Spacey, who also served as one of the film's producers, gives a controlled and focused performance as the mighty magul whose ego is out of control. he does good work, and yet the character does not call true. We learn so little about him and his acquaintances that his important position and high status do not come down with what we see; who answers this man? What drives him to humiliate someone else for sport? What projects did he give to the youth, except the one we see, passed? The film is so emotionally crammed and subdued, it looks like a play that is trapped for the big screen - yet one without enough characters or motivation in it. Maybe Huang wanted to keep things simple, but instead she looks like a half-baked project that needs much more insight, humor and atmosphere. ** of ****
