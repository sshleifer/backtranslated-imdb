Few movies scattered expectations and upset me as much as Fire did. The movie is pretentious garbage. It doesn't reach anything at artistic level. The only thing that got it done is a ban in India. If only because of the poor quality of film production rather than the current controversy, the ban would be more justifiable. Now that I have my distress out of my system, I am more able to analyze the movie: <br /> <br /> * From the beginning, the movie feels unreal, especially when the lead actors speak English. Of course, the director did not make the film for an Indian audience; but it underestimated its international audiences by simplifying it. Looking at the character of the domestic conversation in perfect English is too unreal to be true. <br /> <br /> * Next we get regular glimpses in Radha's dreams. These scenes are not very effective. They come up like a shock and hamper the flow of the movie. I still wonder how this philosophical dialogue is linked to the story. I felt the surrealism was lost. <br /> <br /> * Love stories feel voyeuristic and are probably meant for hearing loss rather than being a powerful statement. In any case, they do not reach either. <br /> <br /> * The names chosen for women, Radha and Sita, are names of Hindu deities and are therefore chosen to shock the audiences. However, as the film is not intended primarily for the Indian audiences, the shock-by-name selection is not intended to achieve its purpose, which is absurd. <br /> <br /> * The quality of direction is very poor and some key and delicate scenes are poorly handled. A better director could have made a powerful emotional drama out of the subject. <br /> <br /> * The acting felt wood, though Nandita Das played a bit of life in the role, the other was wasted. I always thought Shabana Azmi was a good actress, but her talent is not clear in this movie. The male leaders were full of garbage. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Earth and would like to see more of the director, stay away from this one. Please.
