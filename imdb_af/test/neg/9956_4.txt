First of all I have to say that I am generally not a big fan of werewolf missions in general. It's not that I don't like them, just that I don't like many of them. There are a few that I enjoyed. London Werewolf (1935, Stuart Walker), an American Werewolf in London (1981, John Landis) ... and some I thought were okay but nothing special. Man (1941, George Waggner), The Howling (1981, Joe Dante), Dog Soldiers (2002, Neil Marshall) are a few examples ... but generally, the werewolf subgenre is not my favorite. But I had this one on one of the 50 movie sets, so I thought I'd give it a watch and see how it was. <br /> <br /> Spoilers follow ... <br /> <br /> The Mad Monster is a werewolf story, but the werewolf is used primarily as a vengeance by a mad scientist, dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco). Dr. Cameron discovered a way to turn people into beings, specifically wolves, but mocked and eliminated by the larger scientific community. He vanishes from a sought after position and enraged those who mocked him in an old country house. He lives with his daughter Lenora (beautiful Anne Nagel) and his assistant Petro (Glenn Strange) with limited spiritual abilities. Using his serum, dr. Cameron Petro in a werewolf and sent him off to kill his old rivals. Eventually, the werewolf Petro becomes out of control and kills both the mad doctor and his creation. <br /> <br /> The movie also plays a bit like a murder / crime drama, with Lenora's journalist trialist (Johnny Downs) investigating the doctor's strange behavior and the outcome of murders. The story lends many elements to other great photos before it came. There are memories of Frankenstein (1931, James Whale) in the creation of a monster running amok, and the creature kills an innocent child. Visions of dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931, Rouben Mamoulian or the 1941 Victor Fleming version) and The Wolf Man (1941, George Waggner) also appear. And this is one of the problems with this movie in my opinion - it is a mediocre report on some good movies. It doesn't add much to the genre. <br /> <br /> True, there are some redeeming features. George Zucco's performance was convincing, and dr. Lorenzo shows with his visions / hallucinations of his tormentors, works well for me to show his madness. There is some reasonable character building, at least in the case of his character. But Glenn Strange's character is not convincing at all, and apparently this comical quality, whether intentional or not, I'm not sure - it doesn't fit in the movie as a whole. <br /> <br /> I looked more like IMDb users, based on my 4/10 rating, but it was still an underdated movie. Perhaps it is worth seeing if you're a fan of early werewolf movies or a huge fan of the 1930s and 1940's horror movies, but it probably won't appeal to you.
