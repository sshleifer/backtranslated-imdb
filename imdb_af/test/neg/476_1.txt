Boys, what can I tell you? I'm Bulgarian. I can't remember how many times I talk to Americans and let them say they don't have the slightest idea of ​​what Bulgaria is, but they say things like, "There is a war going on there?" or "I never thought in a place like Bulgaria people had internet." Check out Bruce Campbell's "The Man With The Screaming Brain". I was curious about this movie because 1) I'm Bruce Campbell's "Evil Dead" trilogy and "The Adventures of Brisco County Jr." 2) The film was shot entirely in place in Bulgaria, the second after "Alien Apocalypse" which is also almost inaccessible. 3) I enjoy fine B movies <br /> <br /> Well ... The movie presents our country like a never-ending Gypsy Town where they attack your car, waves around illegal guns, and you can be killed at any moment. . And Bruce's line "Bull $ h1t Bulgaria" is more than offensive. <br /> <br /> Ted Raimi and Stacy Ceach make a good team, Bruce does his special - get up and that's all. Nothing more to see here. <br /> <br /> Peoeple gives this movie 10 only because of Bruce's cult status, but it does not earn more than 3. Film waste.
