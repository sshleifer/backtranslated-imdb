Okay, so I forgot to watch and just caught the last episode, thinking it was the first or second. Honestly, I thought CM would have at least one installment to fix plot points. The Rangers are stranded on the plains ("We must eat the horses"), for one thing. Little Newt was robbed for another. What a downer ends! But my biggest complaint, especially. if it were the final, it was the episode had no tension, no big climax, no dramatic confrontations. Even the last battle between Blue Duck and Buffalo Hump was poorly performed. The whole episode had terrible pacing, that's what a Western management. Steve Zahn was viewable, Karl Urban (a sound for Johnny Knoxville) played as a man with a terminal case of lockjaw. All glowing appearance and jingling spurs and chin. And what are the Rangers? They talked a great deal about the clearance of Texas, and are then intentionally ground in the center of town and drunk. And how nice of Hal Holbrook, Val Kilmer, his Mark Twain wig and bump! The set Austin was like the false Rock Ridge of Blazing Saddles, all the facade. I admit that I was drawn in the plot, but it is mainly because there were many things that I did not do, due to the late arrival of the story. If I looked from the beginning, I might not have found episode three. Now I have to see Silverado clean my palette.
