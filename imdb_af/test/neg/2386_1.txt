"The New Twenty" is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Yes, some may argue that small-scale formal small-budget movies look worse, but I would argue that a pseudo-intellectual anti-formal "indie" film pretending to be more is worse. <br /> <br /> "The New Twenty" was written and directed by Chris Mason Johnson, and I will never return the 91 minutes of my life that I have wasted on his film. <br /> <br /> THE SCREENPLAY & CHARACTERS <br /> <br /> From the start to the end, the script failed to provide an anti-hero or hero with a moral core that the audience wanted to see , succeed or fail. <br /> <br /> In the storytelling, the three dramatic conflicts are man-to-man, man against the world and man against himself. <br /> <br /> The screenplay focuses on a group of colleagues in New York and is engaged in the dynamics of mankind against himself, where each of the characters of the film is so absorbed in depression and self-destructive behavior that the film much in front of the audience's eyes. <br /> <br /> Every main character gives inexplicable bad behaviors (heroin addiction without history why the character is an addict; a fiance who has sex with her fiance's boss / investor, although the character is written to have sex with such a cunning character, a man who starts out as a decent man, but is attracted to a false mouth investor, and for an unknown reason transforms into a similar dirty mouth, kubergeek, who does nothing but finds dates online and a Gay-Asian man dating an HIV-positive older man but has no scenes to determine why the relationship works and why love develops.) Important scenes the cause of the character's addiction, the suffering and restraint of the fiancee, which may be why she would sleep with a sleaze bag; the back story that would explain why a decent man would be attracted to a "Gordon Gecko" type character and a jackass; a story line for the chubby kubergeek; and more scenes of interaction between the Asian man and HIV-positive boyfriend are missing. <br /> <br /> Without proper establishment of details, all the characters' actions seem forced and confronted. <br /> <br /> DIRECTION, CINEMATOGRAPHY & SCORE <br /> <br /> I found Mr. Johnson's direction without a clear point of view is leaving the actors emotionally incoherent. <br /> <br /> Cinematography can best be described as commonplace. Mr. Johnson chose small spaces to shoot and not catch the grandeur of New York City. This failure created a claustrophobic movie, which is considered the filming of a play, not a movie. <br /> <br /> The score was terribly absent from most of the movie. I assume Mr. Johnson must blame, as he can be asked for the full score to improve understanding in every shot. <br /> <br /> CLOSING <br /> <br /> "The New Twenty" is a nasty and unauthorized failure in making movies.
