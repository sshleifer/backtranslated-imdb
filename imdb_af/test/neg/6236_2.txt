Business executive is kidnapped, made to pass miles and miles into a forest for days and days to exchange dialogue with his kidnapper. And we have to listen to all the nonsense ... Meanwhile, his Snotty wife and family are at home with the FBI wondering what to do ... ..... at no time does she worry about the fate of her husband except when it comes to the ransom ..... A "love story"? Give me a break! <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous. And almost every scene is filled with an air of expectation that something significant will happen, but it never does. <br /> <br /> The result of the kidnapping is predictable and stupid, and it becomes even more stupid when we learn the fate of the kidnapper. <br /> <br /> It's garbage: <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
