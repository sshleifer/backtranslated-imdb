It was pretty inevitable. This movie is borrowed from "The Core" and from the movie he borrowed from, "Armageddon", and the movies he borrowed, and so on. Besides this time, there is also Luke Perry. This movie version of the well-known red-the-world plot involves super earthquakes that begin in the Pacific Northwest and also extend the entire ring of fire. She soon found that everyone on earth could only be doomed. So the army and some scientists are building one of the high-tech drilling machines to go inside the Earth and fix things (it just won't be as much fun if they don't have to go somewhere like space or planet) ). There is even a line that tries to make the journey into the Earth more impressive than space travel (such as the one in Armageddon). This is a sci-fi network movie, so the script is paint by numbers disaster movie. There is a fight between scientists and military guys, there are rock-melting lasers, people are dying and sacrificing themselves for the good of all, and above all (weak CGI) special effects. Not original and not all that is entertaining. It's a movie to watch when you have nothing, especially if you have beer.
