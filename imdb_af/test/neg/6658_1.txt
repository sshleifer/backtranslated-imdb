This movie, "Desperate Measures", was .... I'm not quite sure how to put it into words. Was it supposed to be a comedy? I couldn't stop laughing at how absolutely ridiculous it was. I love Michael Keaton, and I can't really understand that he did. They did a good job keeping my attention, because I couldn't wait to see how much more ridiculous it would be. I just registered on this site so I could get it. I don't review movies. I don't have time for this, but I can't let it know, because I didn't do my civil duty, by telling people (who have an IQ of 85 and above) that it's not an action . It's honest. to goodness funny. You people who really get stress out of it scare me. Look at a good movie like Million Dollar Baby. Clint Eastwood's play is not excellent, but I flew in the end. Practice your brain America!
