Jealous man holds hostage hostage while Williams loads every time the viewer with his exhausted Mork shtick. Dug. <br /> <br /> Payment channel pig. An unusually bad writing along with a less than convincing Robin Williams as a smooth talk, captured Philandering Queens' salesman in a hostage-work crisis. The laugh is not there, the message (s) or morals are just wrong, and the film can never decide whether it is a comedy or a drama. Pretty good throws everything worthy. When a movie becomes so aging so quickly, you have a stinker. Not much else to say other than maybe, avoid at all costs. Handbook of mediocre movies like this is actually more boring, and less enjoyable than the upper bombs.
