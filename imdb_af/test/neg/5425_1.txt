I can't say I was surprised at this horror when I watched it a few months or weeks ago (can't remember). I saw it as a two-episode of Zoey 101 because that's how they showed it in Canada. <br /> <br /> I was incredibly annoyed at the Makeover a Nerd thing, it's just an example of how unacceptable, unpleasant, superficial, negative, biased, and stereotypical the people in the entertainment industry are honest and honest. It wasn't funny at all. A Nerd is a stereotype and it makes people very offensive. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the people in Zoey 101 don't have real problems. Logan has a big house, he has a famous father, he has everything and Zoey is also rich. They should never handle the things that today's tweens and teenagers have to deal with, such as peer pressure, and stereotype problems. The actors are also terrible. Jamie Lynn Spears doesn't deserve to be as successful as Zoey 101 in a television program (what's wrong with the world?), She has no talent as an actor. In fact, she's worse than Britney! The Chase and Zoey thing was incredibly predictable, I mean how can the show continue with Zoey and Chase dating? What other problems might they have? Except Chase doesn't get the girl he wants, everything is perfect! The absolute worse 48 minutes from my television looks at life. Ever. 0/10 (and it's generous)
