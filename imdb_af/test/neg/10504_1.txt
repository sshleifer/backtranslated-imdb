This movie was pathetically terrible. The noise was terrible, the action was ridiculous and the effects were misleading. If you have a life, see this movie, because you want to kill yourself. This movie completely loads sheets (it's undoubtedly a very good movie ... or trilogy I have to say). <br /> <br /> I don't care who the actors are, this movie is just awful. I watched it for 10 minutes and had to come to my computer and comment on just how bad this movie is. I really don't know why my family still doesn't look it ... oh wait, yes I do. They almost inevitably laugh at the stupid action, dialogue and acting.
