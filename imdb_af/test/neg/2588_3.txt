I watched this one without a commercial break, and let me tell you, even for a TV movie, it was pretty predictable. The actors did a real job with what they had, and the movie was fairly accomplished - Barry Bostwick, Jane Seymour, Frances Fisher, etc. The writing, however, was not only predictable (except for the last scene), but the dialogue was treacly and sounding as if it was lifted from a third-class romance novel. Jane Seymour's psychotic monologues were laughing. I'm sorry, but I find it hard to believe that anyone who is creepy will not raise suspicions. Worse than Theresa Russell was in "Black Widow" - and she probably stuffed it - at least she had the sense to play her pseudo-characters somewhat straight. Seymour is a much better actress, but has not overcome the material here. <br /> <br /> Finally, the musical score is incredibly cheesy. It's almost a satire of his genre, like a Kenny G crash. A movie with such a dull and distracted script really had to be something more precious.
