The first time I watched this show, it was OK. There were a few funny moments and I laughed a few times, but this performance is getting worse and worse. Carly and Sam's web application is NOT the least funny. They play a silly video from the internet, screaming at the camera and making some very bad jokes. And then the laugh track goes off! One problem with the show is that none of the main characters is funny. Carly is not funny. Miranda Cosgrove's performance is at its best in the darkest. Her acting in this show is nothing like her acting from Drake and Josh. Her friend Sam is very rude and rough and the show is written in a way that makes her look like a kind of hill. I mean that they make jokes about her mother driving a red old truck, her mother hitting an old TV with a bat, and then there are the jokes about Sam not in school. None of them are at all. Then there is Freddy who is a computer yellow. He's not too funny unless his mother treats him like a baby. The show's only funny full-time character is Carly's brother Spencer. He makes some funny jokes and does some funny things like pretending to drive a spaceship while making spacecraft sounds, and knocking over a girl's cookie table for revenge, as they do the same thing to him has. His material is the only dignity to laugh. Apart from the characters, other things also make the show bad. Like the fact that a couple of kids are doing a local webshow of a Seattle apartment, is it a worldwide hit and got a free trip to Tokyo? Another thing is how a 26-year-old single man with no real work for a 2-level apartment in downtown Seattle can pay and raise his 13-year-old sister and pay for a room full of camera and audio equipment, including " a remote-controlled projector and a green screen and an HD camera? It sounds like it was written by a 10-year-old. The worst thing is that the show contains some reasonably dubious content. There are a few times when Carly (remember a 13 year old girl) appeared on her internet web show in a bikini top. WTF? Then I saw an episode where Freddy told Carly and Sam that he had just slept his socks the night before. "I mean WTF? Then there is an episode where Carly's rival Nevel expresses her by accepting her site rights and agrees to give her back the site in exchange for a kiss. Creepy! And I just have an episode seen where Carly met a boy who just moved into their apartment building and he had some kind of back injury, and he took off his shirt and Carly stood there and shot over him, I can't believe Nick, even leaving them that kind of stuff shows and I can't believe it was created by the same man responsible for Drake and Josh. This show is not suitable for children under the age of 12 and it is even doubtful that iCarly is just another addition to the long list of horrible Nick programming.
