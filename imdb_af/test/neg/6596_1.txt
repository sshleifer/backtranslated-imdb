Okay, I missed the first 15 minutes of the movie, so I missed credits and well. So when I finally got there, I was like, "Who is hell, is this man?" I found out it was like an hour after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Flex didn't look like Michael Jackson. Not one piece. He couldn't dance like he was, or as he moved, the only thing he almost had was the voice. People commented on Elizabeth Taylor, but I can't really comment on that because I don't know much about her. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was like an ordinary wack. The dialogue sucked. The cinematography - if it can be called - sucked. The soundtrack sucked. The acting sucked. Yeah, even Flex ... I'm so upset about that already. I didn't want it to suck. I'm so sad that Flex said he could get away with it. But the whole thing looks like dress. You know? It's like no one seemed to be supposed to except Joseph Jackson. <br /> <br /> The concert series just sucked. I'm sorry, but Flex just can't dance like Michael. I mean, as hell thinks VH1? The makeup didn't even match the time of everything Michael went through. For example, in the movie he was still dark when Neverland first caught the first time. In real life, MJ was white like hell. There was a kind of dull delay in his skin discoloration. <br /> <br /> The movie wasn't boring, but for me it wasn't. It wasn't really something. I was just as upset about everything that was wrong with it. I wanted to see how it turned out and if Flex could leave himself. He didn't really. The only part I found to be a bit interesting was the whole Lisa Marie thing. When they fell in love. It was nice. But I had to throw my face away when they kissed. Heh. And just two parts let me down with the laugh. The first time they were off Michael with short hair, you know the Thriller era, to Michael with long flowing hair from the Dangerous era and he was still black! It was funny. The second time I laughed was when they showed all of Michael's posters and memorabilia, but rather had Flex's face! It was so funny. <br /> Overall, this movie was cheap waste. It was just two hours of dressing and could have been so much better. But no, VH1 is cheap. See if you want. But this movie is not funny, considering its ridicule. I felt angry from this. And when I found out that it was Flex, I started to feel just as bad. So ... look if you want.
