Unlike most of the judges of this particular movie, I'm really not the biggest of a Cynthia Rothrock fan, to say the least. But when I saw that movie Fred Williamson and Robert Forster (both big actors) had, I just had to watch the movie. Williamson is a Dakota Smith, an alcoholic policeman demolished to scrub toothbrush toilets, and even worse to track down Cynthia's captain's prescription (Robert Forster). Forster is always visible, it's just a crying shame that the movie itself is so dirty and clipped. It also features one of the least frightening villains ever connected to celluloid. Williamson would return to the Dakota character in a few more films, the next one being "Down N Dirty".
