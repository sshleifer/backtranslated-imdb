Bad acting? Yes, but it wasn't a surprise. Stupid story? Yes, so what? <br /> <br /> But why, tell me, Director, why all the slow motion crap? Vegtonele was bad, really bad, due to slow motion and bad cuts. Not because of Seagal. <br /> <br /> "What if I only accelerate it for 2 seconds and then delay the next 5 seconds and then ... Maybe I should change the currency to decide?" What did you think, Mr. Director ???
