O Sex Live From The Potato Men, Which False Demon Created You? This is a movie you watch, a bit of a quirk during the runtime and then if you call it, others have seen it, you just can't help when you talk. But it's not that the sex life of the Potato men is actually a funny movie and one that inspires you to smile when you talk or think about it, is not that the movie is so bizarre; is so abusive and is not shameless in his attempt to get a gentle laugh to do sex and sex life in general that you just can't help but break your mouth in a smile. Don't keep in mind that what the smirk is like is a sink of the head; a consequent shaking of the head and a step of the index finger and thumb for both eyebrows while gently rubbing them, in an attempt to remind you of your time to look at this trash. <br /> <br /> But that's what the movie is, it's dirt; It is very brave and shamelessly trash, but not trash. Whoever sustained this idea, put it on paper and distributed it over the industry to try and make it, must be either very brave or very desperate. It's strange to have a movie that is definitely 'about', but one that doesn't have a decisive story under any circumstances. It follows the notion that most European films are artistic and his stories are ambiguous and open and themes favor over most other things. In the sex life of the Potato men, the same and technically the same joke is repeated over and over. It's an ideaie that consists of: "sex is a very, very funny thing." These ideas may be more suitable for an American movie, so it is no wonder that after a while things start to look at this movie, things start a bit. <br /> <br /> The movie begins and ends in the same way, creating a circular feel; a circular journey that has gone nowhere and has been achieved absolutely nothing. Three blocks sit around a table that speaks and what doesn't. Their boss joins them and the conversation is limited to any rude and disgusting stories, situations or scenarios that everyone can think of. The weird thing here, that's when one man says something, the other grimaces, but has an equally dirty story to give in exchange that creates a contradiction in what these men find to cross the line and what they don't do not. The men are Dave (Vegas) and Ferris (Crook), two people joined by Tolly (Coleman), when the movie fits into a third face to crack even more nasty sex jokes or some strange stories to break. They are employed by Jeremy (Gattis), a man who has deeper problems and problems, but issues whose film is more involved in exploitation for the sake of humor rather than studying. <br /> <br /> So what is the situation in Sex Life of the Potato Men? The three to four men are in crisis and for the duration of the film we will take on the role of the unfortunate fly on the wall, as we see what dirty game these people are emerging in about a week. If the humor that revolves around Dave and Ferris is disgusting and repulsive, then Jeremy is just spooky. It all starts innocently and it seems like there is a woman he likes and one who likes him as well, but if the essence that Jeremy is merely a stalker crawls, it is when the jaws fall. The character of Jeremy is used and conveyed in a way that looks like unmade love and stalking in general. Jeremy sits in his flat and listens to classical music and writes letters of abuse to Ruth (Davis), which contains a kind of psychotic persona that is more related to Hannibal Lecter writing his letter to Clarice in 2001 Hannibal. But any sympathy we may have for him at this stage is made absolutely untrue when it is later revealed to the true origin of their relationship. Suddenly we feel as an audience how to feel a myth, earlier on him, and for whatever reason, what he did, what he did in the first place, it just seems cowardly and unpleasant. To say what it was would ruin, how little surprises lie in the film. <br /> <br /> Very sad, how does he write in one of Jeremy's letters about something that calls out "No artistic vision - just one big mess". I hate it as words spoken by the characters, the movie they are in. Sexual Life of the Potato Men does not investigate someone's psyche or particular interest in a fetish, or why they have the need to go around with as much sex as possible; staple. Rather than taking group sex and exploring what one manages to search for it, it makes a jolly joke (numbered cards!?); rather than getting into the minds of a Sadomasochism fan, the movie hangs from a cellar ceiling and warns everyone of 'incoming salt and vinegar' as he climbs. Ferris covers his face in horror and the camera disappears to the next scene without too much of a fuss. It's a relief the movie had no audiences abroad. It is part of British culture, indeed, of the British mentality I pray will be limited to our coast and ignored accordingly.
