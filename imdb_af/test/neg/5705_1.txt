If it does not appear on every list of "what not to see", it should only be because those who keep the specific list are unaware of its existence, which is the acceptable alternative as long as it is. . I don't joke you, it's a * bad * movie. Joseph Meeker returns from death, with various vague, indefinite supernatural powers, most of which in reality appear to be in new, increasingly comical and ridiculous (and never scary or creepy ... in general, when it comes to the latter of those who excite it are just bizarre, and efforts on former work only, period) outfits and stereotypes / archetypes, and he is portrayed by David Keith (who I respect in ... good, at least Daredevil), do a more often than not terribly contradictory (also dealing with writing) and often the best performance. A character or two have personalities that are so incredibly annoying that they are painful to watch. The editing thinks it's much smarter than it really is (and what was on Earth with the red tint for flashbacks?). Cinematography ... oh dear. Framework, coverage, effective use of the corner (which one can also ascribe to editing, perhaps), please, guys, stop me if I say something you've ever heard about the existence of. On the technical side, it's a nice excuse for something worthwhile to put in the projector as an unobstructed movie. But why do you stop there? The plot is just poor. The basic idea was done, and so much better than that (the crow would be one). The way it is told is clumsy, and although there is an explanation behind the flashbacks, it still doesn't. Pacing is about non-existence. The lead is clearly unlikely, and there is more personality in a barn door, not to mention that it is also significantly less wood. Kelly Perine and Thomas Ian Nicholas? What are you doing in the name of all that is good and fair (pun intended)? Perine, you were funny at The Drew Carey Show, Nicholas. Well, I didn't see you in anything that was previously American Pie, but if nothing else was, you were funny later and in those productions the entertainment was deliberate. Dialogue is ... the less said, the better. Language is unobstructed and tends to be stupid. The violence is being made scarce, and they don't even seem to try to hide it (it can be the smarter strategy). Characters, don't start me. Why spend so much energy depicting unspeakable, sometimes illogical, events? The more you think about this, the worse it gets. It is not even acceptable as a "bad horrorflick", or a B-movie (it may well go through the rest of the alphabet and go further), it can't scare you on the frightening day of your life it had an electrified machine. I only recommend it to people who want to refuse how bad it is, and don't say I didn't warn you. 10/01
