I wrote spoiler warning, but there's really not much that can be spoiled. It's like spoiled rotten meat. This movie is probably the worst I have ever seen. Not because of the actors or the special effects, but because of the sheer number of errors, both factual and physical. First, the MIGs aren't actually MIGs. They are Mirages, and they are French. And how can Doug's father handle the maneuvers his son makes to fight the "MIGs" without a g-pack? And why would Chappy try to drive his plane without a g-pack? And how can Doug defeat the enemy pilot with such ease? Anyway, I didn't like this movie. And the worst thing is that it has 3 backgrounds, the latest from as late as 1995. Now it's scary.
