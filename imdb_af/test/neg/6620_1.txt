There is a reason. Council Chairman has a 2 (which is too high). This movie is one of the worse movies of all time and I've seen my share of rotten movies. Board Chairman dies two of the most annoying actors / people today, Carrot Top and Courtney Thorne Smith. Carrot Top is no longer funny and was not in this garbage. Courtney Thorne Smith is no better, just look "According to Jim" and you will see an excellent example of what I'm talking about. Council President has a one of me, because it's low as you can go, it's so bad. I'm a little shocked that this piece of litter is not somewhere on the IMdb bottom 100, I will put it in the top 5 on the list, but it works slowly there.
