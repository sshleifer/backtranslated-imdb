Wow, this movie is bad. Think 'Flashdance' with ninjas. The worst part is when a sword has to float in midair, but you can see the strings. Or perhaps the worst part is the gigantic eye spot (which looks like a courier) wearing the good ninja. Actually, there are so many bad parts, I can't make my mind the worst. I can't believe anyone is actually setting up the money to make this thing. The only redeeming value is that it is good to laugh.
