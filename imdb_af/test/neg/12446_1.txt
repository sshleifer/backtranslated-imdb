Wow, this movie really sucked under the normal scale of dull, boring and imaginative movies I've seen recently. The acting was poor and robot. The story was so mixed you could have summed it up with a simple 5-minute short. Audio was so poor and dirty, it was difficult to even listen; Maybe it's unintentional from the camera where it's shot? I'm not sure which movie the 3 glowing judges comment on, but it wasn't this one. Perhaps the director had his hand to see that his film received a good review, at least before the real reviews started. <br /> <br /> Save your time or spend your time and money just wasting this movie. Absolutely suck!
