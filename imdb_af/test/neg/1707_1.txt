There was a time when Michael Jackson was honored as King of Pop. Then came a time when he drew negative publicity, as much as lemon roots attract. Finally, it's time we really feel sorry for this man. <br /> <br /> This 'movie' is another reason. I promised to see a rabid Michael Jackson fan with her. You know the kind of fan - someone who tells him or her to do everything that the object of love has ever done. While I watched this movie, which she's seen twice, I realized how far this fandom goes. Probably far enough to judge this movie over 1/10, as some people did wonderfully. <br /> <br /> The movie aims to be a parody of many other films and series, especially Cast Off, Lost and Jurassic Park. Unfortunately, it fails at any level. The play does not save the absolutely horrible story, the filming has the quality of too often played video tape. The special effects are better performed in Be Kind Rewind (for those who do not now use this movie: with aluminum foil). All these things will be funny if the movie succeeds in being good. Unfortunately it is not. It hurts to see it. <br /> <br /> And there's Michael Jackson's look in this garbage. He appeared on a projection screen to deliver an important message, and managed to get as mobile as Jabba the Hutt and as serious as a 4-year-old. Just when I thought, "Who is the terrible person who has lured this poor man into taking part in this movie and making a total fool of himself?" Did I (finally) reach the final credit and discovered that the movie was actually shot at Jackson. Neverland Ranch. In other words: He. Hold. This. <br /> <br /> This movie, and Jackson's involvement in it, is really upsetting. Don't even look for the haha, a movie in the IMDb Bottom 100 effect. Or be warned.
