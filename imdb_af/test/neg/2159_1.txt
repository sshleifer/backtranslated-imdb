Yes, my summary tells about everything. <br /> <br /> If you didn't watch it, try it. But not for pleasure. For studies of one of the worst examples to try politically correct, family-oriented and "cool" at the same time. <br /> <br /> The men always think they know everything, are stupid and end up with the beautiful women. Etc. This is especially offensive when all the characters are just as horrible and stereotypical. I mean, okay, "Cody" was funny sometime, but unlike other "stupid characters (tm)" like Woody in Cheers or Joey in backup, he doesn't get good lines. His stupidity is thrown in a stupid way, which becomes quite annoying after a while. <br /> <br /> The family morale is terrible. Everything for the family. Mother and father are chief dictators, who constantly say that they love their children between the heavy and old-fashioned parenting, and of course, in the end, the children love them back * barf *. <br /> <br /> And there is always a "stain" as it is constrained in the "action", where American (c) (tm) moral lessons are forced on viewers, about sex (in adults you can not having sex you are 18 (!!), kind of way), or drugs. Even church habits are well described here. The whole concept is directly ill, everything is done in a half-hearted way to make money. If there are people like Karen and Frank there, they shut them up and dissolve the key. <br /> <br /> So, with themes ranging from religious propaganda, it is fair to conclude as I did. my profession ...
