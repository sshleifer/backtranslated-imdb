No wonder that many of us hate classical music; And what are the children to think about? With "educational" PR like this, serious music will soon slip from life support to the mortuary. Children know when they are spoken, and that is no exception; Why can't anyone do a movie about classical music for children? I must admit that I enjoyed the actor who played Beethoven, with the enthusiasm and sharp balance of the gripping and humorous aspects of Beethoven's character; of course he did his research. Otherwise, it is a third time rehash of the old ABC Afterschool Special format, with no charm that had those short films. Sorry about the rant, but it is an important topic for young people to know, and it could have been good; I wonder if musicians or filmmakers were responsible? Anyway, the kids are hipper than you think, people ... <br /> <br /> Medtner
