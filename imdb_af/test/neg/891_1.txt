I am also a Home Party Fan ... Home Party I am my favorite movie of all time. House Party 4 is a disgrace to all HP's and Kid n Play ... It was supposed to be part of a series really .. there was nothing about child a play in this movie or any of the other veterans. child's play was probably too old to throw a house party movie b / c its kind focused on teenagers .. but a child's play could at least have made a cameo look ... you could tell how good it was b / c It didn't even make it to the movie theaters. Immature was in House Party 3, so it made sense for them to continue the legacy ... but they had to be right ... they had to leave it at House Party 3. I am 27 years old and I have watched House Party I have been 11 years old (16 years ago) and since then I have been a fan. When I first saw House Party 4, I was as they really think ... There was nothing known about this movie that would be comparable to the previous 3 movies. I thought it was a black Ferris Bueller.
