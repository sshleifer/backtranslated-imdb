After some misfires, we are still waiting for the French horror film that critics will certainly condemn, but will start a new trend. Not this time. Doug Headline cannot be accused of not being known in the genre. (He is editor of a high-class fantasy print, worked for legendary Starfix magazine.) But why use a scenario that every click in the book (except perhaps the Odious Comic relief)? Why make it so predictable? Even the nods to Argento failed. It's not even a euro-teen movie like the German "Anatomy", much better, just a combination of scenes that have hardly any relationship to each other and contain lots of plot holes. The whole "Celtic" aspect is hardly touched. And after a "revenge" painfully predictable, the screenplay offers us a boring, endless chase in an underground necropole that looks bigger than Parisian catacombs. I wanted to love this movie. Really. But even a mother didn't want to. Oh, and writer Valerio Evangelisti was supposed to have a cameo, but I looked in vain at him.
