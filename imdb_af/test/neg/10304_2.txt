Fox is pretty lame. They cancel the wrong shows. It is bizarre that they will cancel a well-written program such as "Arrested Development" and yet they keep this show and "War at Home". I feel Fox loved having broken barriers with the then "Married to Children", but now it just becomes ridiculous. "The Walk" is a senseless and boring watch, and their greasy jokes just fall flat. To make the comedy work, keep the jokes. "Family Guy" and "The Simpons" work because there is a constant flow of jokes. Fox must pull their heads out of their rectal cavities and stop writing their relatives to write this mediocre tribulation. I mean, if you're going to invest money to make something entertaining, make it entertaining. Also, use "no-named" actors. It's great to have up-and-comers, but you need to anchor a well-known person. Duh, Fox.
