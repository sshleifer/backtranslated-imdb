"The polar express" was a horrible movie. What this film does is the hypocrisy to present itself as an innocent, pure and harmless story for children about the "true" meaning of Christmas. I never read the book Chris Van Allsburg in what it was inspired, but the most disappointing is that it was directed by Robert Zemeckis, the same who made the big "Who Framed Roger Rabbit"? An excellent movie where he proves that the animation can also be equally appreciated for children and adults. In this movie, it seems that he was the victim of his own ambition and he gives too much importance to creating impressive detail as an interesting story. I'm sorry to say this, but "The Polar Express" has so much artistic level as a publicity campaign of a video game or toy. Everything in this movie looks so lifeless: the characters may look like people, but they have nothing of life on them and they have a malicious touch in their eyes. <br /> <br /> But the worst ... is the message in this movie. You can see it on some parts of the movie and believe me, it was dirty. Take one scene, for example, where one child refuses to enter the Polar Express. Note that the character that looks like Tom Hanks makes a gesture like saying, "You're not stupid to accept my offer." On the other hand, when the girl says the toys are so hot and stuff like that. All the damn movie the kids keep talking about is how great the gifts Santa would give them. There's even a song about the gifts! The vagabond is an irrelevant and poor character. And in the last scene does the character seem to "discover" the true meaning of Christmas: and what would it be? What do you think ? the gifts! Many Christmas movies are close to saying something like that, but "The Polar Express" is an ode to materialism and greed. Seriously, I refuse to call it a "children's movie" because if that is what the children would learn, I don't want to think about how our future will be.
