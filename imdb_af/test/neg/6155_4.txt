Combine good casting, bad writing, good orchestral stories, bad dialogue and good story idea with lots of potential, but never realize, then you have Slipstream. <br /> <br /> Just bought the movie for a goat, it's worth it, but not much more. <br /> <br /> Good to see Mark Hamill again. <br /> <br /> There must be a decent successor to repair the damage to the original. Or give it at least the necessary attention it should receive in the first place. <br /> <br /> Berstein's score has drawn your attention from the opening credits, but the long shots of slipstream planes and the longer revealing of interesting plots make his point of getting the score. <br /> <br /> It's really easy to handle a movie like this. This is because of the manufacturer of STARWARS and the director of TRON and a tremendous role, but that is what it is. And that's not much. <br /> <br /> Favorite line- "We're going to make it, ha-ha! ... (BOOM!)"
