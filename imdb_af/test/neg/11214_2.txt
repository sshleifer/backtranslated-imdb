This review features a SPOILER --- <br /> <br /> The movie is an American Ninja mysteriously trained in martial arts. He falls to the colonel's daughter and turns from the most hated shit on the post to the "People's Hero" at the end of the movie. This film is extremely cheesy and very poorly investigated. It's good for people who don't care about plot development or reality. Good for children under 14. The military mistakes in this movie are comical. I remember during my three years in the army, our privates were not required to greet or mention the "Sir" of the NCO. The film does it in different places. The colonel's hair is too long on the ears. The Master's Sergeant's mustache was lengthy against the military protocol. At the post, the colonel was the only officer. No other officer showed up to run the post. You made idiot-Ninjas branding swords against M-16s, rather weak. <br /> <br /> People filmed this film. Michael Dudikoff is not really that bad of an actor, he only has ugly scripts. The Ninjas were more hilarious than dangerous. Avoid this movie
