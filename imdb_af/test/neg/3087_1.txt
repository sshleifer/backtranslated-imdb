The film's producers hope Cameron Diaz's name will help sell this photo. Unfortunately nothing can save what has already been captured on the screen. In spite of some beautiful European locations and some solid production design elements, the movie mostly fails because of its awkward, incredible romance between Brewster and Eccleston. An improper movie story.
