A plane with employees of a large biotech firm - including the CEO's daughter - goes off in thick woodland in the Pacific Northwest. When the search and rescue mission is downloaded, CEO, Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen), has set up a small response group to carry out their own search and rescue mission. But just what is Knowles looking for and trying to save, and just what are they following and watching them in the woods? <br /> <br /> What a mess this movie is! It was a pity because it is one of the star Lance Henriksen, who is one of my favorite modern genre actors, and two, it can easily be a decent movie. It suffers from two major mistakes, and they are probably both the writer / director Jonas Quastel's fault. This movie (which I will mention by his aka Sasquatch) has only the worst editing I've ever seen along Alone. in the dark (2005), and Quastel's constant advice for the cast seems to be: "Oh, let's try this again, but this time I want everyone to talk to each other, improvise non-followers and usually try so irritating as possible ". <br /> <br /> The potential was there. Despite the rip-off aspects (any material related to the plane crash was obviously trying to cripple The Blair Witch Project (1999) and any material related to the titular sample, Predator (1987) jumped). Ed Wood-like outline and ridiculous dialogue, the plot has promise and potential for more subtle and far less saccharine sub-texts. The monster costume, when we actually get it, was more than enough for my taste. , could have been great if Quastel and co-writer Chris Lanning had turned the 11 to at least 5 stereo and spent more time exploring their relationships, the monster's "lair" had a nice production design, specifically the decorations, a more primitive Jeepers Creepers (2001), if properly processed, there were screens with decent dialogue that could easily be effective. <br /> <br /> But the most frightening thing about Sasquatch i s the number of mistakes made: Quastel thinks for some reason it's a good idea to cut down the dialogs that occur in real-time within minutes, so that instead of some see scene A, then a few lines of scene B, then back to A, back to B, and so on. . <br /> <br /> For some reason he thinks it's a good idea to regularly make use of black screens between dialogue buttons, or we need the idea of ​​an indefinite amount of time between irrelevant comments or the irrelevant comment seems to be on time. <br /> <br /> For some reason he doesn't care if shots were shot in the morning, noon, midnight. He just cut them at random. For the case, the screens we are shown are randomly chosen. Important events never appear or hardly occur, and we are stuck with too many senseless scenes. <br /> <br /> For some reason he left a scene about cave in the movie when it also needed more exposition to justify getting there, or it just had to be eradicated because it is not that important (the monster's intelligence and "humanity" could easily be shown differently). <br /> <br /> For some reason there is a whole character - Mary Mancini - is in writing, though she is redundant. <br /> <br /> For some reason we suddenly go to a very soft core porn scene, even if the motif is never repeated. br /> <br /> For some reason characters like Harlan Knowles "Mr. H" are known as their stereotypes of Asian domination. <br /> <br /> For some reason Quastel insists on using the "ambiguity". Cam "and" Distorto-Cam "for the monster attack screens, although the costume doesn't look that bad, and it would have been very effective to place a dung, a subtle filter, or something other than bad cinematography. br /> <br /> I can go on but you get the idea. <br /> <br /> I really wanted this movie better than me? I'm a Henriksen fan, I'm interested in the subject, I have loved the area, I love walking and it is basically a walking role on one level - but I could not. Every time I thought it would "be better from this point to the end," Quastel another terrible step, in the end my score was a 3 out of 10.
