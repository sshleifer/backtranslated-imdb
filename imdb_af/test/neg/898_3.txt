I didn't just have Barnens O? This is one of the strangest things I watched. The soundtrack was rather unusual ?? written and performed by Jean Michel Jarre - it makes the film more than it was. I have to admit that I'm almost going to change it and instead look at another one. Sometimes the movie seems silly or stupid to me? or confusing. There are quite a few sexual references in that movie ?? trough them is also kind of mess. Probably, the only phrase I will remember about it will be: "If you are alone, you can control things" ?? and "I'll show them" - or something. The boy in that movie was obsessed with the idea of ​​not growing up ?? "last summer as a child" did he think once? and he certainly lived it to the maximum. So if you have a few hours to save, can you see this movie? but you won't miss much if you don't.
