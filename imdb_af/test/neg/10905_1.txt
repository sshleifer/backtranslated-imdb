I don't write reviews here regularly, but I can't help and other people suffer from this movie without even trying to warn them. This movie is terrible and it's not because "I don't know what the director is trying to convey" or "I'm too stupid to understand the plot"; This movie is terrible due to poor direction, screenwriting and acting. This is the "trifecta" of bad move making and the reason the movie was directly after video. It tries to be something like "High Voltage", "Hostel" and "TCSM" when it comes to lifting some of the ideas, but it just doesn't work. I didn't have high expectations, or even mediums in the movie, but were still very disappointed. It had the potential to be very good with a nice environment and good idea for a movie, but it was wasted.
