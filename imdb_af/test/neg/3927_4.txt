I preface saying I'm a big fan of JJL and not one of Patrick. That's why I watched it show her performance and that was of course excellent. I don't feel the director was adequate for the movie, as many very bad choices were made. Shooting angles, blocking, etc. If the director tried to give it a "realistic" feeling, they failed and lost good performance because of It. Almost always felt that the camera was too static, too far from intense face reactions - and as often as the action was dependent on the intimacy of main characters, the dialogue was slow and over. It could easily be solved by cutaways or camera angle changes. But the impression I got was that the budget was too small and only one camera was used! I also got the impression that maybe screens were shot several times and the energy coming from the actors was ... eaten.
