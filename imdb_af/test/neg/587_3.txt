Wow, well, you know the shock they use in hospitals to get your heart pumped again? I need one for my brain after watching this movie. It took me almost 4 hours to watch, because I had to take a break and repeat my brain for semi-normal functionality so often. I mean this movie is soooooo slooooow its ridiculous, to say that the writing has about 10 pages of dialogue will be generous. They just don't speak !! And while I'm talking, it's all, and I admit there were a few scenes where only the music was needed, and the music was great, it was probably the best part, but then listening to a symphony or something and forget about the movie. So many people give these wonderful reviews, and for the time being, I want to say the special effects and filmography are pretty good, but for the acting, or lack thereof, it only needs a little more, no shootem ups or sex etc. ., a little more emotion, these guys were like stones, just sit there with long faces. All in all, if you need something to calm yourself down, just play the movie, don't even start when you've seen it before, just start nowhere, lie down and relax, it'll make you sleep. .
