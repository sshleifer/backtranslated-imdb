I would probably like to give this movie a zero if it is not the climax, which does not really include snakes on a train, but rather in a snake train. The point of departure was much more than probably boiled in the course of a night's beer after hearing about snakes on a plane in production (it was indeed released to coincide with the film's release). The joke is probably not lost to those who seek it; I don't think there will be a soul that will consider this as a serious action-thriller effort (unless at an ironic level beyond the rational thinking capacity). It's about a Mayan curse placed on a woman condemned by her family to leave with another man, and is soon seen sick and coughing to green mucus, of course with snakes. She and her beau go on a train heading to Los Angeles, and very soon after the more than clich√© characters are busy snake-engaging snakes with the original woman herself a snake. <br /> <br /> It would be worth mentioning more about the movie I want, but there is not enough time during the day. All that can be said for the quality factor is that it is almost inconsistent; There are student short films with bigger budgets. Perhaps it was a sensible calculation of the filmmakers' end, that so many copies would be sold, just for the joke factor alone, that they would recall their budget in the first weekend. Because you look at the sets (the trains themselves change randomly in the middle of a scene!), The actors (if you can call them, with just one other actor - one with the very thin hair that touches one woman throughout the movie - which has benefited from the movie being produced), the FX (also alongside the non-existent, which makes the effects in snakes on an airplane look like Star Wars), and the actual CGI snakes themselves, with the final giant snake something to see in sci-fi movie channel terms. <br /> <br /> That means everything, basically, that it's a laugh riot every step of the way (especially, as cruel as it sounds, when a girl gets involved in a snake's "attention"), with great contempt for good taste, works well in his favor. It is said, it is also 100% disposable, such as a B-movie acid-flavored lollipop.
