Here we are another pop star in the grand TV country and from my observations of her pop careers directors say yes your big Gwen you can be a real star, maybe you'll ever be in the A movie, they will do anything to expanding the display, there is not only a beautiful face but also an acting ability to spend almost overnight. Gwen has a few who have the ability to act by acting actors such as James Dean or Clint to the east. Please give the right people in the world to sit behind the box and experience pop star attempts to try. Please keep gwen with your nice pop videos with your jap posts and don't insult the British with your efforts as an actress. Anyway, I go back to my work class work and think of myself God, I can do it. but yeah i will work till i am 65 if i live so long and yes, you put your girlfriend with your royalties every three months, marry money right xxx
