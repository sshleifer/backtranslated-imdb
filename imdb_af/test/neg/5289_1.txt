I started watching it because I thought it was a very funny porn. As I keep looking at the only excitement I got from this movie, finding out what its name was so that I could look it up and rip it on. I just completed it and considered ending my life because I knew someone really made this movie. <br /> <br /> For those who commented on this movie on a good script and good acting, my words of wisdom are for you to probably have no friends because you were in the movie. You probably wish you had been back from your life all the time that you wasted to make this movie. <br /> <br /> There's no way it's a serious movie. There was an old man stabbed and it didn't hurt him at all. And when everyone is stabbed differently, they die. <br /> <br /> It was probably important that these people killed and ate random people and also hung up with an 80-year-old man who wanted to put the parts in his body. . <br /> <br /> My favorite part was when the old man found the "hemoglobin" or how you played it because it made the movie look intellectually and probably helped reach the older crowd. <br /> <br /> What I really thought was that they decided to throw that random scene over college girls looking for fake skulls in the bush. <br /> <br /> If you are trying to see this movie, you should surely fill it in your bath and let your hairdryer come in and be ready to jump in. THIS IS A MUST SEE !!! .... For anyone who believes there, life cannot get worse because it will help you realize there are people out there (the creators of this movie) who are even more pathetic and do not live in life no.
