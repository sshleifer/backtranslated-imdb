One of the more prominent / popular episodes, but clearly one of the worst. A red-shirt woman falls to Khan (instead of letting down - for a change) and then betrays Kirk and the Enterprise as if loyalty was a non-existent trait on the ship. One wonders what kind of psychology test this so-called brilliant Star Fleet uses to test people when they rent. We have the same kind of absurd lack of loyalty in "Wink Of An Eye", when a red-shirted male takes the enemy's side just because he falls in love! Same as in SS. (In that episode, however, the betrayal plays a small role in the overall plot.) It's very silly because again Kirk's crew looks like a bunch of soft, easy-to-impress, which - once they fall in love with the enemy - is able to do just about anything. The fact that McGivers switches back to Kirk's side does not improve illogical in any way. Lord McGiveth and Lord McTaketh ... Why did Khan realize behind a regular door if they knew he had superior power? This is one of several ST plot devices that undermine Kirk's intelligence. Why is Khan holding a knife against McCoy's throat? If Khan is such a superior intelligence, he would expect him to be more tired of the way he carries himself. And what about a Sikh with a Latino accent? Montalban had to be provided with a vocal coach. I half expected the "pest! The plaaaain!" To hear. at any time in the background. Why would Kirk (or any captain of the ship) offer unlimited use of the ship's library to the inside technical details of the business to anyone? Is the Star Fleet an idiot-only institution? <br /> <br /> SS is a very funny, stupid episode, so don't wonder, Trekkies loves it. It doesn't have too many sci-fi elements in it, and that's what Trekkies hate most. It is also shown that the ST franchise chose to revive this dull character for the second movie, that way, pleasant racial Trekkies, who were so disappointed with the first movie - you guessed it - far too much sci -fi for the average small Trekkie brain.
