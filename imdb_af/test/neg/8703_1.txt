This movie was terrible. Bibles very inaccurate. Moses was 80 years old when he led the people from Egypt. The movie has about forty. Moses was about forty years old when he fled Egypt. He was forty years old and had been with them for forty years. Moses was 120 years old when he died, and was privileged to go over to the promised land. I realize movies use a lot of "poetic license", since the biblical account is not so long, but if they make a biblical movie, they must reflect the familiar facts and the general taste of the main biblical character. This movie fails in this aspect, and in many others. Although the 1956 version also has its problems, it was better theater.
