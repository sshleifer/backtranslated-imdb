I've never seen a B-movie like this ... from the side that kills Sofia ... a hand from a woman appears on the band that handles the stick. How bad is that? LOL, I laughed seriously and didn't want to see the movie anymore, but I looked to see if this movie could get worse. LOL ... it's bad for itself. Arm Pinocchio. The only nice bit is The first time you see some special effects of Pinocchio's face moving. In addition, the whole movie is terrible ... it's not really worth your time if you don't really save a lot! But if you have nothing to do, go ahead ... deal with some "Z" movie cos. B movie is too good for this one ... LOL
