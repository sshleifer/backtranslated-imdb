Bulletproof is clearly a disposable film. The kind where bullets walked, good guys and bad guys, are split everywhere, so much so that you don't really see it as humans. The way between the lines of Wayans and Sandler is indeed wide. They try hard, but, unfortunately and badly, personally do not make a good movie. Jimmy Caan plays a handsome villain, but he always had that redneck edge in the right place. My favorite scene is the repeated tracks of a TV ad that Caan reveals that the virtues of America can be shown to the world by having 2 cars in each garage. Apart from that, it is a friend movie with guns for the brain. Pass on this one.
