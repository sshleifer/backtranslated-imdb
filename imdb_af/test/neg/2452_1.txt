When I think of TV movies, I always think of this movie, I watched it several times on Sky Movies. It was terrible. <br /> <br /> It has been a long time since I saw this movie, just looking and coming here: -S. <br /> <br /> A microbiologist (Linda Flemming) goes on holiday with her son (William Flemming), at this resort, meet them with Paul Johnson (taxi driver / owner of a bar?), and Kathy Johnson. <br /> <br /> It's like a strange romantic thing, and William starts to fall for Kathy, and Paul falls for Linda. <br /> <br /> Some guys go out into a street, he has some on his arm, Joseph (Joseph was a deep sea diver, diving on some, light or something, and to religion converted), says he will take care of this person, there is a gap in my memory, then there is a wide outbreak of the virus, I think Linda offers her help, to get a cure, Kathy gets infected (William notices a mark on Kathy's arm), with the virus, also do Joseph. <br /> <br /> Paul says a few lines to Joseph, and Joseph stumbles away. The next time you see Joseph, he is healed, how is that information used to heal the infected, then there is a beach party.
