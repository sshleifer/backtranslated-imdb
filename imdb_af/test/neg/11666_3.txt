This is without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen. However, it is also one of the most unintentionally hilarious. I like to compare it to Plan 9, because it can be so bad, so terrible, so stupid, and such a waste of time that I laugh myself out loud. <br /> <br /> One of my biggest problems with this is a complete ripoff of Robin Hood, and be honest and say I love Robin Hood with Errol Flynn and Robin Hood: Men in Tights. But let's face it, from the forbidden love between Peck (which definitely slumbers it. Although in all fairness, it was a few more years before the masterpiece killed a Mockingbird) and the female character ( What was so oblivious, apparently I forgot her name.) To the final scene where the good guys as monks dress to deceive the bad guys, "ROBIN HOOD" shouts about it. <br /> <br /> But I don't think the movie is not worth seeing. On the contrary, I think it's one of the funniest movies I've seen for years, even though it was unintentional.
