Here is another low quality movie from the "Disney" company. There is no more Disney spirit. The story is boring. All emotions are fake. It's not cute or moving. Disney company was at one time a kind of magic that provided dreams for children. It's about making money now. Shame on the people who use Disney name for their personal benefit. This is the fall of an empire. And by the way, Pixar is NOT Disney!
