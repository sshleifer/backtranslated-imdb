* spoiler warning! * It only gets me the nerves some people need to rebuild (and I use the term loose here.) good movies. In the American version of this Dutch thriller, someone decided that the original ending was not pasteurized for American audiences. so what are they doing? they create a new one! a stupid, unlikely, I-pretend-I-dead-but-to-life-again-the-good-man-can-kick-my-butt-yet-more-like end. Do yourself a favor and get the original.
