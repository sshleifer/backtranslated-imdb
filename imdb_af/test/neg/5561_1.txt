Another try, another miss. France may be doomed for not producing a good horror movie. I mean ... the least they could do was shoot the movie in the forest of Broc√©liande, but even the forest is fake! It's shot near Paris! The subject is useless, the actors are really insignificant and the text makes you wish you were deaf. Nothing can save it. <br /> <br /> Bad ... to the bone. I'm not warned. I want my money back.
