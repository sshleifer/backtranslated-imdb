This movie is about a young couple running away to start a new life in LA, eventually pounded by a psycho on a deserted resting place. Actually, it's just about the girl (Nicole) as her boyfriend literally disappears within a few minutes. The movie goes very fast, and in time you wonder how it might extend its story to length. It is not long before you realize that the movie does it by wasting time with unnecessary scenes that go nowhere. <br /> <br /> The story is not just paper thin, but unstructured, silly and incoherent. Minutes after the disappearance of her boyfriend and car, Nicole finds a mobile home at the rest stop. She sees the flashing of a camera, and knows that people are inside, but she easily gives her help when nobody answers her door. After being informed by the killer that her boyfriend is in danger, she walks around the rest and does all sorts of stupid and unnecessary things. This includes turning on a TV (and even amusing when she thinks she's stumbled upon a porn movie, even in this difficult situation), and sits around, wanders and drinks for an hour from a bottle of liquor. She does all this because she kidnapped her boyfriend, that the killer is still loose and her stalk and without doing anything to ensure her immediate safety (she doesn't bother closing or being vigilant). Oh yeah, she's trying to use a radio to ask for help, but why bother even when there is a mobile home with people inside right at the rest stop? The scriptwriter seems to have forgotten about this important fact while writing this section of the story. <br /> <br /> There is no sense of arrest or ever present danger in this story. The hero walks freely into and around the various buildings at the rest, and the murderer only drives occasionally to scare her before she gets off again. There is nothing to stop Nicole just taking away (even if the rest stops a long way from anywhere, it's better than sitting around), but she prefers to stay anyway. At one point in the movie, the main character even recognizes that she can run, but not. <br /> <br /> The story goes nowhere and just jumps from a useless segment to a useless segment. Nicole eventually gets inside the mobile home, and it appears that the residents are a family of sheltered, presumably innate or psychotic religious fanatics. They deliberately look ignorant or unaware of the murderer's actions (but there is no indication that they are in any way connected with him) and then kick in after a few minutes after Nicole. <br /> <br /> In the next irrelevant segment, the main character wanders into the bathroom building. She discovers one of the killers' previous victims (a young woman named Tracy) who is still in the closet. For a strange reason, Tracy starts ridiculous amounts of blood. Nicole goes off to pick up a crow to open the cupboard door, and if she comes back a moment later, both Tracy and her bloodbath disappeared without any explanation. What was the point? Nicole finds a plate of many missing people and sees Tracy disappear in 1971. So, was Tracy a ghost or something? The writer never makes it difficult to explain. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the night, a policeman appeared to man the police station at the resting place, which was conveniently left unattended all day. Nicole tells him all about what is going on, and when the killer in his truck drives out of the office, the police go outside to confront him. What does the police officer do and know that something is seriously wrong? He goes up and talks quietly with the murderer (who even pointed out Nicole to the man who stole her), and buys in the murderer's lie that he simply needs driving and directions. Seriously. The police then talked to Nicole outside, totally unaware that the bakkie turned over and crossed over. <br /> <br /> Police are starting to tell Nicole that he is a goner who is still breathing, but he doesn't die strangely for a while. The two of them do a few senseless talks, and the all-encompassing fact that he has a gun is not even annoyingly mentioned. When the two finally tried to use the gun, Nicole wasted most of her bullets that shot blindly at a door when the killer was behind. With two bullets, the policeman told Nicole to use one to euthanize him. She burned one in his mouth, and he lay for a few moments, blowing a piece from his head. Then he shouts suddenly and inexplicably "You missed!" and she must shoot him again. Totally cheap attempt at shock. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Nicole confronts the murderer and fails. The movie ends with a scene that has not taken place long before, with a woman coming to the now strangely more active resting place. In the bathroom building she hears Nicole crying for help in the closet (locked like Tracy). She gets a policeman to go inside and check, but he finds a plain normal and clean cupboard. Leaving the policeman and thinking he was deceived. A Nicole is seen because of a few boxes in the closet (she would have easily been traced if the police had been watching for 10 seconds), apparently too stupid to say or do anything when the policeman was there. WOW. <br /> <br /> This movie is apparently the first in a new range of "quality" direct-to-DVD movies being marketed as too ecstatic for theaters. In fact, it's just more clich√©, B-Movie garbage.
