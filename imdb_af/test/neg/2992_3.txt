There are many fans of this movie, but I found it boring, slow, tortuous and useless. And I watch and enjoy many art house and independent movies, so I didn't expect an action movie. I didn't sympathize with any character. The man from the countryside was a bad guest and didn't seem to be trying very hard to find a job, and his family member in Istanbul was humorous and ended emotionally. <br /> <br /> In an interview on the DVD, the director says the movie is about a general situation in Turkey. The person who leaves in the countryside because there is no work and comes to Istanbul and stays with family while trying to find work. This in itself is interesting, but the movie was not.
