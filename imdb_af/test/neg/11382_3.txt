Unfortunately, the golden times of the stylish Italian theater seem to have sunk into oblivion. And the recent brainchild of renowned film producer Lamberto Bava is another clear proof of the assumption. <br /> <br /> I felt happy to watch many movies from this productive director (such as Body Puzzle, Delerium, Macabre and both Demons). Although not quite satisfactory, they have never been so dull. <br /> <br /> A suspicion that this new entry to my DVD collection has thrown money into the wind, arose shortly after the car accident scene, an uncomfortable and unlikely display showing the body position below the flipchart motor. <br /> <br /> And the sense of eagerness grew up in the painful chain of events that followed. <br /> <br /> Dumb dialogue, suspicious writing and a total waste of talents from the international cast. The only character that provided more or less customizable performance was that the ominous Mark's son satiated the entire boredom. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mario's son's work on all accounts can hardly be welcomed. <br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing his murder house hopefully be an improvement.
