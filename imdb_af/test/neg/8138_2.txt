This movie was cheesy and it was more than that. It was about this man who got a curse on him and he became a gorilla. I had to see how bad it was because of the title. Before this man becomes a gorilla, he is married. I was a little upset because she wasn't a gorilla bride. She is now the gorilla's wife. She had to marry him when he was a gorilla, and the title would have made more sense. There are also all these people in the middle of the jungle and they all want to leave. It's not just a B movie, it's more like a Z movie. I didn't even see a banana for a wedding gift. Oh, he was not yet cursed.
