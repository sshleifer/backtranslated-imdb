Would it be too much for me to make a review of just the word "STUPID" over and over again? Probably. <br /> <br /> It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Seriously. There are better movies at Mystery Science Theater 3000. I saw the movie for the first time at a friend's birthday party when it was still in theaters. Even though it was * with friends * and at one of their * birthday parties, * I had to leave. I actually had to leave. I just excused and went out. Fortunately, some of the parents did the same thing, so I didn't look like a total jerk. Anyway, this movie is terrible. There is nothing to keep it from. It is painful (as it actually causes physical pain) slow, and sickly (causing literal vomiting) unfunny. You almost feel sorry for Tom Arnold, but then you don't because you remember he was in the movie. It hurts me to even think about it. <br /> <br /> It was a couple of months ago on TV, and I decided to see it only once. Then I remember why I went out in the first place and found guilty to increase his ratings by even one viewer. The gags are not funny, the characters are not interesting. It's just a senseless mess of pratfalls and stupidity. <br /> <br /> There is a small crowd of eight-year-olds who watched the movie when it came out and considered it "brilliant". If you think your face has been removed with an herb with an ice cream, it is brilliant, then you have to rent it completely. But if you avoid any dignity whatsoever, you should completely avoid this great STOP rubble. SCORE: 0/10 ... maybe a negative 1, actually.
