It was just broadcast here in the US. Others commented on the fidelity (or lack of the same) to the novel; The 1983 version of the BBC is much better than that and all the other scores. Given the scope of the novel, it should not be condensed for up to 85 minutes. Key divisions should be rushed or referred to or omitted; There is hardly enough time just to get into the chronology of events, so character development must be sacrificed: we can't get much of a sense of who the people are, who rob us of what Austen is doing so well. <br /> <br /> One big negative for me was the cinematography, which I thought was just awful, and quite literally sick. The camera continually makes ultra-closeups and turns in circles. Maybe it's on a small TV cabinet well, but on our 40 "hi-def screen it was so literally dizzy that my wife and I had to watch the set repeatedly (my dramamine stock ran out). the rather slimmest I-only-read-what-in-the-script (isolated scenes are done well, but not enough to save things). <br /> <br /> The score so far is in the full YES Sweepstakes: I'll see the Northanger Abbey as a success because of better directions and production values ​​(and the story makes it better for short treatment), "Persuasion" OK (although not equal to other versions), with condensation that is again guilty is far from this endeavor, I would hope better in the two remaining novels in this TV reader's Digest Jane Austen, like others, I'm grateful that they left P & P alone!
