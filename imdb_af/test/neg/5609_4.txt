Romantic comedies are definitely the most fertile genre for bellow from average movies and source of frustration for viewers. This one is a perfect example of this and has a place in my top ten worst movies. <br /> <br /> History is far from creative and jokes are weak. I didn't find any reason for a single laugh during the whole movie! Characters are clear and the actors are performing well. History develops slowly, it is boring and predictable. End is also available and sugar-coated. <br /> <br /> It's one that watches movies you watch in a rainy Saturday afternoon when you can't see anything better in my humble opinion.
