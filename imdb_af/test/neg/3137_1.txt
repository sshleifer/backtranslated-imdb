Critics are a strange kind of people. Some of them are ordinary people like you and me. Some of them are not. When a critic says Subconscius Cruelty is beautiful, do I wonder where they grew up? What is great about filming a field, some clouds or a tree with an old camera if you can't do it with style and can capture the mood of the environments. Karim Hussain certainly can't. I saw children doing better pictures than Karim managed to do in Subconscius Cruelty. But this is not the worst part. The worst part is the whole recording, I refuse to call it a movie, is just a bad excuse to portray nudity and extreme torture, rape of both sexes, masturbation, sperm, pissing, cannibalism, child murder and much more. I love gore / plover and I love horror. This is not one of them. It's absolutely crazy, and if my comments just left one person left, Subconscius Cruelty is worth it. Always remember that your life won't last forever, don't waste two hours of precious time on Subconscius Cruelty. You're warned.
