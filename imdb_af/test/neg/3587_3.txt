We've seen a story before: a woman in marital trouble (played by Nastassja Kinski) enters sex with a stranger (William Baldwin) and then wants to return to her life with her husband and girlfriend. When she returns home, she finds out that her husband has finally found a job. Everything looks bright. However, Kinski thinks her husband's new boss is actually the stranger who is still interested in her and looks anything to get what he wants. What to do? Say nothing? <br /> <br /> I didn't really like the movie. While it wasn't just bad, it clearly had nothing. Perhaps it should be more focused on what goes on in Kinski's head. Nothing to say about the actors themselves (I think Baldwin was a good choice for the role of the obsession boss), but the characters were somewhat stereotypical, resulting in how you would see characters in your everyday TV movies. Finally, the end completely destroyed what could be an interesting plot. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the movie tried to look cool, it has a little shaky camera work here and there, a few stills, quick cuts and shine, but in the end I think it fits Spelling- productions much better. The same goes for the music. Otherwise it didn't look that bad. <br /> <br /> Some people may like this, but it certainly wasn't my cup of tea. To be fair, I don't usually see these kind of exciters. This one felt too long, even though it was only half an hour, I think it could have worked better than an hour long episode in some TV shows. There was absolutely no need for some of the screens, especially the shower tones. <br /> <br /> My advice: Try before you buy!
