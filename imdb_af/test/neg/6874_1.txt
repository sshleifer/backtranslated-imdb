this movie has wasted my time. I only saw one part of it and I cried for the wasted time I could spend doing something productive and useful for this earth. For anyone who has watched this movie more than once, I blame them for global warming, as the amount of black balloons that came from this piece of earth was not needed and if they come from another movie, I would have forgiven them. Robin Williams has lowered his standards to share in this movie for more than 10 seconds and Tim Robbins, how he left this movie after Shawhsank's salvation, I have no idea. Please do not watch this movie for the safety of the earth. cease to release black balloons into the earth from a movie they have never funded or released. please burn all the copies before anyone else should look at this crap.
