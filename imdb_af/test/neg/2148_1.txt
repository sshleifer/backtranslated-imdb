You know you have a bad movie if you hear that the soundtrack is completely performed on a single cheap programmable synthesizer, without any melody or rhythm. <br /> <br /> It's hard to see how anyone can use movie seriously, even if it gives a bad review. This movie is under 'bad'. <br /> <br /> The continuity of this film is far-reaching. In one battle scene, we turn the hero (with blue coats and underwear) a corner with two revolvers in his hand; he doubles back, just now he has two semi-automatic in his hands; he turns another angle and now he has an automatic gun in his hands; he chases down a corridor and comes out (suddenly dressed in the standard force of the army) with a shotgun; after which he left the building with another automatic gun. Or here's one for the books - a bus barred at a high-speed car; the car will fly, thrown by a huge explosion - cut to the bus that is completely unscathed from the same explosion? The narrative continuity suffers from an equally seductive sense of unreality; The bad guys really want to kill the hero - of course - but every time they knock him out or get him in a vulnerable position, they suddenly decide they want him to live to see it! Huh? One of the nicer moments of the film is when the hero is released from isolation because his lawyer has come to see him; then the bad man decides not to let the two meet; and this despite the fact that the villain, the hero and his attorney all know what is going on anyway, so the hero writes a note to the lawyer and then we see that the note transferred to the lawyer by another prisoner although we never see the hero give it to him. (This lawyer, VAT, has full access to the offices of the ATF in California, including his confidential computer files.) Huh? Well, but it's an incessant action movie - so how are the action scenes? Not bad, surprising; Unfortunately, they are formulated from about a dozen Hong Kong films made five or ten years earlier. The opening scene, a shooting in a junker garage, actually has shots stolen directly from "Hard Boiled" - so clear that it's a miracle. John Woo did not plead for plagiarism. <br /> Other Hong Kong stolen movies include "Fire on Prison", "Fire on Fire", "Burning Paradise," "Police Story", I, II and III (also known as "Supercop"). I thought I also got some Sammo Hung clips here. In other words, the action scenes are exciting just to the extent that they are successful duplicates of action scenes from other films. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that one can do with this movie unless one shoots and just needs a lot. of visual stimuli that do not make sense. <br /> <br /> Very funny movie, for all the wrong reasons.
