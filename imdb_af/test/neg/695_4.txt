Suggestions and images of child abuse, mutilated bodies (alive or dead), other gruesome scenes, plot holes, boring acting, have made this a regrettable experience. The basic idea of ​​entering someone else's mind is not even new to the movies or TV. Limit episode was better to explore this idea). I gave it 4/10 because some special effects were nice.
