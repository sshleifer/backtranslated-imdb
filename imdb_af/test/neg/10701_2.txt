This movie hit. There is not much more to it. The final battle looked like Walker was taking my grandmother, not a supernatural demon with the power of ten men. I found the ads more interesting. The plot turns and jokes can be seen a mile away. The only redeeming quality of this movie was that it ended. Avoid it at all costs ... unless you enjoy the bad Chuck Norris movies.
