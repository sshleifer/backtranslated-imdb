I just throw in this review to show that I'm not crazy. I love Wynorski's work. - Deathstalker 2, Chopping Mall. Against the law is fast and very enjoyable - just to prove that I'm "I'm not blind, I have to call it, along with some Shannon Tweed" Body Chemistry 3 or 4 or something "are the guys - I have nothing against prolonged sex series, but Julie Strain's breasts are so unnatural you can't help but stare at them - which may be the desired effect, but I didn't enjoy staring at them - and several members of this role seems suppressed or uninteresting. The "erotic thriller" was the worst thing to do with low budget slips ever, and thank God that their day has done more or less.
