No movie I've ever seen has even come close to being as boring and stupid as the drunk of the mess. And I've always been a big B movie. Having seen this total piece of shit, I can honestly say that it's not even close to a B-movie. <br /> <br /> No one in this movie can act if their life depended on it. The script is so stupid I don't think I've ever heard anyone talk like this in my life. The author should spend a few years studying real people just to see how they are acting and speaking, even then they will not be able to make a viewable movie, as it is so obvious that no one is involved in this movie any talent doesn't have them at all. <br /> <br /> I could make a better movie with a digital camera and some monster toys. Also, forget about sexy scenes, the women in the leather outfits are so grotesque, you'll get out faster than turning on! <br /> <br /> Avoid this useless drive if you don't want to be bored!
