"The Beautiful Country" is a huge disappointment. It doesn't come to my expectation. Bihn, a long-muscled man, is a son of an American GI and a Vietnamese woman during the Vietnam War. We said he was treated "less than dust" in Vietnam in the early nineties, so he fled to America to seek his American father. <br /> <br /> Sounds like a broken material? Maybe, but in this movie. I find myself hard to connect emotionally to Bihn, because the film is full of clich√© and I simply don't understand or believe him. Writing this movie is a total failure. The plot is full of holes. It tackles some events on a required basis to stir the emotion of the audience. We are not so stupid and it doesn't work that way. Let's see what the movie is trying to do. So, you don't feel Bihn's boating (yes, he was on a boat!) Is loud enough, let's have a storm over night and let the ship shake a little. Still not touched? Fine! Get a little kid to suffer the heat, hunger, disease, adult violence on the boat, hopefully it'll do the trick to touch the audience. Still not touched? Your heartless SOB, let's ... OK, I don't wanna give the movie a spoiler, but you get the idea. <br /> <br /> The movie is very long and slow. It never tells us why Bihn didn't go to find his mom and dad, right now in the movie when he was gone to look for his mother and father. What did he do for 20 years before going to Saigon to look for his mother? And guess what? He is lucky and everyone will tell him where the person he is looking for will find, and he will get anyone without a scratch. I really think that the Department of Home Security should hire this Vietnam which Bihn helped. The beautiful country? Which one? Both Vietnam and America seem hell to Bihn.
