(r # 64) <br /> <br /> Incompatible, earnings-less, and above all dry trash. You know a movie is going to be bad if its only strong force is Lance Henriksen. The French title for this movie says it all: "Inexplicable". How can you possibly make a movie that is incredibly bad in this day and age? Whatever Jonah Quastel's trick is, it worked. It's over-trash, I'm talking about 'Manos' level crap, meaningless, irreconcilable, non-bad-it-good, high-order movie role. <br /> <br /> Lance Henriksen Is Harlan Knowles, a character who might have been interesting if he wasn't quite without features or personality. He, along with a bunch of morons, goes on a driveway to look for an evil Sasquatch who allegedly has attacked an airplane crashing into the forest or something. Not much else happens. There are some soft core (meaning: Teletubbie level) nudity and some blatant rip-offs from "Predator". After 92 minutes of pain and another torn scene, this time of "Blair Witch", the movie finally rises over the finish line and ends. As a bonus we only see the monster itself for about one or two scenes throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> There's really not much to say about this movie. All you need to know is, it's a very bad movie and isn't even worth watching as a "so-bad-it-good" movie. "The Untold" is appreciated by the fact that Orlando Bloom is playing character. Avoid it like arsenic.
