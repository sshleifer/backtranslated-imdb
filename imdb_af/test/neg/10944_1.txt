Most people get the luxury of typing in the title of a movie, and finding out about the movie before it is watched, but unfortunately I have never been one of those people. I won't even read the synopsis of fear of spoilage, but there are two sides. Because if you ignore such warnings and even give a movie a chance after it has been in the theaters, you go in at your own risk and may just end up with a bad taste in your mouth. That's exactly how I feel about this silly movie. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the only thing good about Shakalaka-Crap-Crap is some songs (and seriously excluding the title track). Even the ever-promising Kangana Renaut talent (Metro, Gangster, Woh Lamhe) is seriously wasted as she plays Ruhi, the woman who plays the attention of both leading male characters played by Bobby Deol. and Upen Patel (who plays Reggi, an upcoming artist crossing AJ's path). Celina Jaitley provides the right amount of OOMPH needed for a social person who gets Reggi (who helped her get into the record industry's door). It doesn't sound like a mix or movie that Anupam Kher should contain right? Well, you're wrong because he's in it as Reggi's father (another wasted talent). <br /> <br /> The movie may not have been so bad as they did not overshadow the writing behind Deol's character. The moral message was too preachy (revenge had a deadly dark side) and the end was too exaggerated. This will make you wonder why you were sitting on such a foolish movie in the first place. Truly this is the characteristic of the shit.
