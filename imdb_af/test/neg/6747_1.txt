Only in the Hollywood audiovisual fiction world can anyone, including FBI agents, be so incredibly stupid. The good guys are stupid enough to catch up with everything they're interested in, answer phones, step up, all in search of a demolition expert who's all coming out. Oh, and then we get the Hollywood SUPERVILLAIN. He can be shot, even if he has a jacket and then falls off a long walk and then he still has the upper hand over his stupid pursuers. Every click you can watch in stressed movies is used. I just watched it because Yuki Amami is so hot. Oh yes, but it's great to see how morally better this FBI agent is, when she's pretty sure there's a bomb in an opera house, and she doesn't sound the alarm. Who writes these scripts ????????????
