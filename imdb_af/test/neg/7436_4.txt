The problem with this movie is that Bill Murray cannot use it to the best of his ability, simply because of the co-star. <br /> <br /> If it was a road movie with another comic actor, it could work. Even if they both try to get the elephant across the country, it will at least allow them to share an amusing dialogue. As it stands, Murray is talking to an elephant who can't answer with a witty villain. In essence, it means Murray speaks to himself, and it makes the movie more boring than it might have been if he had another character to refuse. <br /> <br /> Children will enjoy this movie, simply because of the elephant, but anyone who wants to watch Bill Murray's bite delivery and enjoy an excellent script should look elsewhere.
