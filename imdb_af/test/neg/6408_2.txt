Not just because of that theme in the movie. What was one of the lame excuses for something reminiscent of plot. No. <br /> <br /> I watched it, knowing I wouldn't want it. I HATE Numerology. When someone starts walking with numbers with numbers, I feel the urge to hit them. My own brain starts to hurt with empathy. And fully aware of this, a movie is just about that subject, I couldn't resist the urge to see it and maybe get a good laugh. But it wasn't funny. Just exactly the stupid kind of "Isn't it quite scary and yet incredibly cool?! I can change a shit in 23!" dialogue I was afraid of. As soon as the boy started to visit, I knew this movie was a maze, no matter what happened. But I hardly keep looking at a movie I started. I put it through it. I enjoy the pain. <br /> <br /> The movie proposes mocking numerology under the disguise of how obsessing can end. But it drives as much as it's supposed to crush it. I don't see the message. I just see characters about a stupid number with a small plot to justify. <br /> <br /> Stay down with the usual "surprises" - try to make another spin to throw you off, it doesn't make sense, and you almost believe it because of the quality of the story to there - and you get a hollow piece of film. It just happens to be centered on the subject I despise. If it wasn't serious and was rather a hilarious actor with actors, I wouldn't be afraid. But I started to keep Carrey ... while it's not his fault, he tries. It is not even good to look with a lot of friends and mst3k the hell out of it. <br /> <br /> My expectations were low enough for someone to travel on, but this movie managed to be one of them. the worst I have ever seen.
