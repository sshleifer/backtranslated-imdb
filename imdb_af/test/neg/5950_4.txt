Just finished watching this movie. I couldn't imagine watching it on VHS, because there were scenes where I needed the captions to hear an accent or sound effect, although the scene was in English itself. <br /> <br /> Visually, the movie is pretty attractive. The few CG effects were very obvious inserts, but the prosthetics / headaches were not bad. Not perfect, but photography and editing (which was pretty good) made a lot. Acting was generally bad, although how many of them could be blamed on the director, I couldn't say, as I've never seen the actors. The exception, I think, was M. Gomez (Uxia). She stole every scene she had part and not just because of a very beautiful face, but there was something like an urgency to her performance that none of the others had. The writing could have been much better - the plot was still unmistakably Lovecraft, and a lot of Lovecraft details were entered, but I could personally do without the most dialogue.
