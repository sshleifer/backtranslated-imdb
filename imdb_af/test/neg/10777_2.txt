The title, though singular, will undoubtedly remind actual horror fans of Tod Browning's immortal classics of a group of circus freaks and how they have been misunderstood by the outside world. However, I can assure you that this "thing" has absolutely nothing to do with "Freaks" or even with the art of professional movies in general. This movie was recommended to me, presumably because it is raw, disturbing and thoughtful, despite the low budget production values. Yeah right? The person who recommended it to me can now consider him my personal enemy! The low budget factor is correct, but it summarizes it. "Freak" is very slow, poor and every character that is introduced is actually unbearable ?? and that includes the freak. Two brothers and sisters heading for a new life, a disabled mental patient who escaped from the truck to another hospital returned to the house where he killed his mother at the age of 9. It could have been an interesting victim with good isolated filming locations but instead Tyler Sharpe decided to make this boring and useless family drama. The main actress's efforts to look emotionally devastated are quite lax and the total lack of tension and action can hardly be blamed on the limited budget. Total failure!
