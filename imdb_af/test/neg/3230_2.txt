okay my question who is the idiot who wrote this movie and gave the same name as Dean Koontz's wonderful book? It's terrible, nothing like the book. You have the dog and the viewer, but there are the similarities that end. It might be good if you didn't read the book, but it really disappointed me. . <br /> <br /> they have to make a new one, and let it write it ... now it would be a good movie ... I'll say it again, this movie is disgusting to me ... absolutely disgust me. It was terrible, it was absolutely nothing like the book. I will never see it again.
