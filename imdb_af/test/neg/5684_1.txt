I watched the first 10 minutes and it bored me to death. So, I forward all the way forward. This movie has to be the worst of all in the low budget sci-fi movie category so far. Bad acting, throwing, directions, Lara Craft custom imitation, story, plot, everything! Throughout the movie, I think maybe there are only 6 to 7 people in the whole movie, but ONLY two of them started in the whole movie. I expected something like the Starship Trooper, but it was nothing close. I was deceived by the movie and the picture on the DVD cover. Don't waste your time watching this boring and bad movie. Think about it, wondering why they even bother to express bad movies like this one?
