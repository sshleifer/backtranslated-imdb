Just seen which way to the front? On TCM (UK) it's a really horrible movie. If I paid at the pictures, I would have gone out. <br /> <br /> A terrible mess of a movie. Byers (Lewis) and his friends wandered around in uniforms of an Italian sci-fi film of the 1960s. Were the CND / Peace symbol weapons on the uniforms intended to be? The sets were pure 1970, I'm sure a Hollywood TV back party could offer a more realistic set. <br /> <br /> The film is hit with racism. The movie picks up the mickey from veterans. <br /> <br /> Not funny how Lewis has to make another movie is beyond me.
