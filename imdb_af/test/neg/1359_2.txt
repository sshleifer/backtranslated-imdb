For those who have never heard of the movie (which I assume there are many happy people who do not have), I will sum it up for you. Ryan Gosling plays the title character of Leland, who also serves as the film's narrator (a lazy Kevin Spacey in American Beauty, but without the intelligent observations of life). Leland goes to prison to kill a delayed child, and the film tries to figure out why he did it. He looks like he's a pretty boy (if not mentally absent) and is portrayed by Gosling with a complete lack of violence, anger or agenda (and if you're waiting for him to reveal his sinister later in the movie, Don't waste your time - it's not that kind of movie. Once in young jail, Leland goes to classes taught by Pearl Madison, barely portrayed by Don Cheadle (who is unable to do anything other than quality, even when in bad movies). Pearl is trying to unlock the mystery of Leland in an attempt to find out how such a child could do so, and so he could later write a book on it. Besides a young prison teacher, Pearl is also an aspiring writer. . <br /> <br /> The relationship between Leland and Pearl is the driving force behind the film, as their conversations reveal Leland's past to the audience. To mention this, however, the central focus would imply that this meandering film had one. It doesn't. The United States of Leland boasts an impressive role, which is to the detriment of the film. Author / director Matthew Ryan Hodge (don't worry you didn't hear from him has never done anything) every character needs a personal story bow and personality error to let the actors play. Most of these features and stories are cliché, and most are underdeveloped and unresolved. <br /> <br /> I'll try to break them down here: Martin Donovan and Ann Magnuson are the parents of the murdered delayed boy. how the movie continued to "slow down" the child, never "mentally disabled". That part made me laugh inside, they apparently have a cold, because all suburban marriages in contemporary theater must be cold. Their other two children are Michelle Williams, who is apparently an aspiring actress to attend the college, and she always plays heroin addiction with the same upset teenage archetype. Malone was also Leland's friend, giving him his link to his victim. Williams's boyfriend, who had orphaned and came with the family, is a baseball player who goes to the same college as his girlfriend, played by Chris Klein. He ends more with his character than any of the other little players, who can sometimes steal the movie. Lena Olin is Leland's mother, who for some reason seems to be sad. Kevin Spacey (also the executive producer) is Leland's cold and absent father, who is a famous novelist. Eventually Sherilyn Fenn will get a ripple in Leland's story - if you even care at that point. Oh, and there's a drug-dealing ex-boyfriend, some fellow youths, and a Pearl's co-worker with whom he has a relationship with his long-distance friend (played by Kerry Washington). <br /> <br /> Sorry if all that synopsis and character breakdown took so long. If it was senseless and boring, you just watched a little bit of what I did during the 108 minutes I spent. But the unfair supporting movie of excessive clichés is the least of the crimes of this film. The biggest one is that the whole exercise is completely useless. We do not get a fascinating look at a troubled mind, we do not get an effective explanation, we are not given much of everything. Since it has sucked so much, I'm going to put an end to you so you should never see it: Leland stabbed the retard because all Leland could see in the world, was sad, and wanted to save Corky (or whatever the victim did) name was the sadness in his eyes. It's as if the worst emo band in the world has made an album and titled "The World Is Sad, So I Killed A Retard". Oh, and Leland eventually dies, in a sequence so dependent on incredible accidents that it would ruin the movie, if the movie doesn't suck. Of course he eventually dies because it made the movie so deep. <br /> <br /> I give the movie 2 stars, because the actors themselves all did a good job with the junk they gave. The scenes with Cheadle and Gosling were even interesting at some levels. But to paraphrase the film itself, you have to believe that movies are more than the sum of their parts, kiddo.
