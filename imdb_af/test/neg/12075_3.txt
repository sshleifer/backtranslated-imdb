Wow, this episode started with a STOOOOOPID premise! The company is moving together when Abraham Lincoln suddenly moves into space and welcomes the Enterprise !!!!!!! Is it just me, or is it a very clever idea? Lincoln boarded and they welcomed them. Abe suggests they storm into an infertile planet, where they meet other well-known dead people - good and evil. It seems like a really cheesy rock monster has assembled a team of GOOD and JOY people to execute it for rule. The whole thing looks really daffy and inherently unfair, because the GOOD side is anointed with Surak - a Vulcan that Gandhi looks like Rambo !! Despite a completely AWFUL point of view, the action is pretty good and it is good to see overhead shots of clear doubles exercising in this grudge match. But don't miss out on high art or deep sci-fi. The bottom line is that the series was on its last legs as a first series and it really looked as if they had dusted off this turkey and filmed it, regardless of the absurdity of the premise.
