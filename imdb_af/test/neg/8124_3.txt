I still remember when Frosk Baseball first broadcast on MTV. In a strange, surrealistic way, the cartoon engages in the stupid actions I think every boy grows in America. I now think of how I burned a cripple locust with a magnifying glass, but it was interesting at the moment for some reason. Growth in the 1980s we all knew "stoners". It was the children who carried Iron Maiden-t shirts to school, grew their hair long, had immature snores and were at least two inches longer than everyone else because they had a grade or two. We laughed at them because they were so stupid when they were not stoned. So it was easy to understand Beavis & Co, because we already knew them, some of us were even them. To the extent that GenXers, like me, would distort the remains of the 1980s and embrace the shaky movement of the 1990s, Beavis & Co was kind of a strange postmodern anthem to us. Strange because, like Beavis & Co, we don't care if we had an anthem. It was just an inside joke that we all got right away even if it was terrible.
