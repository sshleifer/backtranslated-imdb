I saw it as part of a vampire movie marathon with research purpose, otherwise there's no way I watched it all the time. The first scene in which a lot of vampires in very bad wigs seem to be electrolyzed by several slow moving weapons worn by an even slower moving Van Helsing wannabe ... in black and white ... with a voice over, set the Fit for the rest of the movie. The battle scenes seem ridiculous, the dialouge will be funny if the act is not so bad, the plot runs out, doesn't make sense, and bites the production values ​​(from the pleather down from Spike's coat worn by the hero to the I saw bad movies (watch The Magic Sword with B. Rathbone, or the Raven with a very young Jack N.), but this one gets my vote for the worst of all time.
