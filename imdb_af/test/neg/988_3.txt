As a history buff, I rented this movie because of the subject. The idea of ​​the Ellis Island experience at the beginning of the century, focusing on a small group, is intriguing. Unfortunately, the movie falls flat. Much of the story is simply boring; nothing happens to long regions. The director uses goofy images (presented in the form of daydream sequences) in an apparent attempt to break the glacier pacing, but instead clashes with the authentic appearance of the movie. The characters are also poorly drawn. In the end, we don't care about them as much as we belong. It's a pity it wasn't what it could have been. I would like to see a good movie about American immigrant experience, but this one is not.
