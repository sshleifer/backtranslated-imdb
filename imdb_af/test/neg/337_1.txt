This movie was very simple and simple! The animated scenes had absolutely terrible graphics. It was very clear to see that this movie had my grocery account budget !! The acting was just as bad. I saw better in pornographic movies. I'll take the hour and twenty minutes of my life seriously. In fact, I registered on IMDb just so other people are not sucked to watch it as I did. Don't get me wrong, even though I love sci-fi movies! This one looks more like the intro for a video game: (I'm glad I just spent a dollar to see this one! The story line reminded me of the movie height black. A prisoner on a ship in the outer space escapes goodness .. what are we going to do? I won't even let it play in the background of my house while cleaning! Bottom line here you can do better.
