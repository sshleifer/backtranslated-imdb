I will repeat - what a stupid scenario. <br /> <br /> Is there something new inside? I don't know who wrote it. But I believe this guy has all the Hollywood kids' eyes-family-toned movies ever made ... all the scenes and dilouges you can see anywhere. Why do your people make these movies? children like adults? they love money golden cars ... and they are positive? they have happiness ... and emotions of course ... without it being able to. o the young actors - wow :-) I like when camera is focused on their pretty faces? what a crap ... there are 90% better kids movies that this one! It's not a creative or funny movie. It's simply nothing. <br /> <br /> D.
