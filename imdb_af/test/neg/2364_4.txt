A young woman named "T.N.T." Because it is virtual dynamite in battle and a knockout in terms of appearance, go to the lawless part of Hong Kong looking for her missing brother, Stag Jackson. When she learns that he was murdered, she decides that she will bring the murderer right in the way she can. <br /> <br /> Sounds good, not that. Well, there is really nothing wrong with the basic premise as a basis for a martial arts / blaxploitation action thriller, which is what it aims to be. The leaders also seem pretty good with Jeanne Bell who is fine in the role of "T.N.T." Pass. and Stan Shaw does well as the ambitious, hungry Charlie. Where it fails, it is in terms of the combat action it offers. The battle scenes are completely unconvincing and / or sometimes so completely over the top, it reaches the point of ridicule that doesn't help if the basic focus of your movie is a Kung Fu action heroine. Also, the poor lighting, actors' sporty accent that they hardly understand, the confusing camera work and the sometimes poor sound doesn't help this clear low budget effort. It delivers in one area that pleases some fans, but it offers a lot of T in "T & A". Virtually every battle scene in the film has been continued by a kind of nudity scene and Jeanne Bell actually has an extended fight in which she is completely topless. <br /> <br /> In the end, it fails to be something you want to repeat because the fights are so pathetic, laughing bad.
