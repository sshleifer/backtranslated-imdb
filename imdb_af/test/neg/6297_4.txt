Actually a road movie. The gay, transsexual and other gender-themed themes are quite disturbing, especially when the child is involved. You have to hand it over to the costume designers. As for the actors, the only one I know was Terence Stamp. I think it was a very good thing, from his (or anyone's) normal range. The movie as a whole was shallow, just a vehicle for the smart, bitchy banter. All in all, I do not recommend this one.
