To call this a Sunday School movie can be generous, because as a Christian I have found the religious message so one-dimensional that I don't want to see it in my church. The message is, "Read your Bible, go to church and sign up for fire insurance, so you won't be left behind at the rapture." There was no love. I think if you come right away, I don't believe in the god depicted in this movie. The man who was supposed to have all the spiritual answers came like Count Dracula. <br /> <br /> Apart from the spiritual / religious element, the writing was boring - the same and over and over. It would be possible for some of the actors to make up, which for the first time could not deliver a convincing line, so they just said the same thing over and over. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the final scenes. I thought it made a point without beating someone over the head or bowing to a Sunday school formula. The movie wasn't bad, just the most. <br /> <br /> I'm in favor of more clean movies that have been well done and that offer the truth in a non-fun way. It wasn't one of those I regret to say. I took my family to this movie and wanted to support that kind of movie. Now I want my money back.
