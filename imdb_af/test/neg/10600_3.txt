This movie has good production values, good lighting, costumes, sets, cinematography and acting. But someone took the writing somewhere and replaced all the dialogue with grade school level, barely literate writing. I thought of my IQ points when any character spoke. <br /> <br /> Did they deliberately do this? Was it just an accident from Brain Dead Studio Executives? At this point we do not know. <br /> <br /> All I know is this movie was a big mistake from start to finish. We don't even see how the team has become police, so instead of any character development we find what remains like a bad TV movie from the 60's. Or when. <br /> <br /> Find the screenwriters, beat it with a sock full of quarters. Everyone else, nice work, but read your scripts the next time. <br /> <br /> 3/10
