Burt Reynolds plays Gator McKlusky, a happy ex-convict who has just been released from prison, helping the Fed's neighbor, a corrupt little village sheriff. Retired Reynolds have often been accused by critics of calling only 'good-looking boys' performances. He's really on the car. But in his day Reynolds just knew how to make a low key effort, working well for himself. Reynolds looks so handsome and handsome as he can without breaking up; He seems to know these backwoods as well as any movie star, while director Joesph Sargent offers an easy fit and a sweaty atmosphere that makes South Africa lively. Unfortunately, the story isn't much, and supporting actors Ned Beatty and Bo Hopkins surpass (as usual). Diane Ladd is good in a small part, and the real daughter Laura Dern can be seen in the background. Reynolds returned to this character for 1976's "Gator". * 1/2 of ****
