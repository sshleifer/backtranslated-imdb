If you enjoy sitting in the dark, both literally and figuratively, for ninety minutes, then this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> A waste of actors, sources and audience time. Eventually a waste of space. Don't be tempted by the CV. There is nothing out of any further dust out there. The movie doesn't have all the basics you'd expect from the genre; plot, character, development, denial. Perhaps the cast may come to know that their efforts in this case will be completely forgotten, and over time their careers may improve. <br /> <br /> Absolute tripe.
