Perhaps one of the best, most horrible b-movies ever, as it is so bad and random, is a hilarious one and I don't know how to feel about it. I think of Cabin Fever .. there's just something about that kid jumping. From the veranda, karate shouts and shouts 'pancakes' which is intriguing. As many people have already described the plot, all I'm going to do is summarize the quality of the movie with one quote: "I'm the park keeper who's going to fetch you." yes, enough said? If you're looking for quality or a very scary movie, I don't recommend it. but if you like these movies, then I think you'll enjoy them. I don't know how, but I think some people will.
