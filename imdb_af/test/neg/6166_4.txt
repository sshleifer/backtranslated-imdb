Based on the Elmore Leonard novel of the same name, Killshot suffers from a lack of focus, direction and creativity ?? All the elements that the original story probably had and negative test screens required serious modifications (including the complete elimination of a character) that resulted in a movie that almost didn't feel like a Leonard story. Too many characters fill a storyline too simplistic and straightforward (not a typical feature of the author's work) and the focus is constantly changing between two hard-hit hits and an agitated couple who do not recommend our sympathy. While the story itself offers precious few turns, it is sad at the end of the movie that the appeal remains a mystery. <br /> <br /> Crop-beater Armand "The Blackbird" Degas (Mickey Rourke) follows a strict code during his missions that accidentally deliver his latest mission. Now underway from his former employer, he randomly joins the unfair criminal Richie Nix (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) to earn a quick cash by expressing a rich broker. If they struggle, Carmen and Wayne Colson (Diane Lane and Thomas Jane) are catching the devils' blundering plot. They are forced to hide, because the mad murderers will stop quieting the two witnesses. <br /> <br /> Killshot proves it's based on an Elmore Leonard novel, no grounds for immediate success or even a promising adjustment. The characters, situations, and even resolutions in the movie are all tired and inexperienced and just a hint of something more. It's not that there wasn't any potential, especially if Rourke's black-dressed, calm, and assassin hit a hit perfectly during the opening hours? purpose and principals are constantly abandoned as every minute ticks away. The style and manner in which each character is introduced is the most intriguing; Visually, the roles of bird and even Wayne are worked out, giving immediate interest and depth to people who typically end up in creative impasse. <br /> <br /> Coupling the cold and calculation of Black Bird with the irrational and explosive Richie is a seductive combination (comparisons with Fargo would be excessively nice), except that every character apparently slows away from the features that initially kept them interesting. As Richie begins to pick up the more experienced killer's habits, Bird releases his grip on his own killing methods. Regardless of what he sees in his instant movie with Donna (Rosario Dawson), it's hard to imagine that his final confrontation with panic-like Carmen will cause a confession of his true nature and consequential messiness that will drastically affect his outcome. Probably or not, it's Killshot's unfortunate downfall ?? And little entertainment can be obtained from these characters who continually lose their originality by constantly contradicting the habits they once made. <br /> <br /> - The Massie Twins
