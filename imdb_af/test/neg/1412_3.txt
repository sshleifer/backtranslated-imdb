I mostly saw this movie because it looks so good in the trailers. Robin Williams and Barry Levinson must be the same size. Instead, it's just Williams's bad stripe movie. What's wrong with the movie? More right: the ensemble team has a good job at Robin, and as usual Christopher Walken is fantastic. It is said, this movie is simply not good. I really only recommend seeing it if you want to see how it will be if Jon Stewart runs and wins for president. To say he won, is not a spoiler, because it was in the trailer. The concept and idea is really amusing, but that's all. Most of Robin's jokes are only recycled from old comedy trays, and there is very little loud laughing and most are just stupid. As most comedies seem to suck, all the funny pieces are placed in the trailer. It's really no surprise, but come on! Some of the movies read like a Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn novel! People expected it to be Robin's return to greatness. Instead, it's more of a Flubber.
