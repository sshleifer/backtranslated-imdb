I'm a big fan of the first Critters movie. The second episode is good, but it's not as good as the first Critters. The third episode is a bit boring, but nice. And what is it? What a crap! It's stupid and really, very boring. This is the worst of the series. I can't see it again because I fell asleep at the first watch. And Ug's evil side ... eeewww ... this is one of the most horrible moments of the movie. In the first 50 minutes we can't see the little hairy monsters, so the audience fell asleep at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> It could have been much better. <Br /> <br /> 2/10
