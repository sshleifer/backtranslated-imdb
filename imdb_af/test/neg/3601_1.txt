This is the worst waste of time I have ever experienced. Not even close to the first one. The story line hard to follow - plot was poor - at best. The whole thing looks like three stories, trying to tie them together and make a movie. It had some good lines here and there - and the attempted message was admirable, but they went from Houston to New York to come to Dallas. It was really hard to tell what time the current time was taking. The movie was just over an hour and it felt like we were watching the movie that afternoon. Maywe points out that he is honest - but a boy shouldn't do whatever Kronk feels he should do. Do yourself a favor - look again at Kuzco.
