It didn't feel like a movie and was briefly short (under 90 minutes). It feels more like a commercial possibility in computer graphics: most of the special effects are great, to be sure. But it doesn't make a good or even a good movie. Not to say it is absolutely worthless to look, as it is possible to see what the possibilities are in CGI or GCI, or what it is ever called. <br /> <br /> As I read somewhere, you can't fix it in the cut. room ", a bad story and non-directed actors, cannot be fixed in the cutting room or even the most wonderful special effects! Things can be improved in the cutting room if they have a real director and material to work on. <br /> <br /> But they thought it could be sold in the US, anyone's idea, as the US is the crooks. <br /> <br /> And isn't that typical of low budget stories not, they have to create an imaginative country south of Mexico? <br /> <br /> Well, I got it 2! Just because of the special effects, the rest is absolute waste!
