I accidentally saw this cartoon on television when I couldn't sleep. It didn't help in the slightest. I looked at the roof myself and tried to forget that face. I can never see this cartoon again, just because of that face. <br /> <br /> Now, don't get me wrong - I love fairy tales and nurseries as much as anyone. But this twisted and frightening version is simply disturbing. It's mainly the cruel laughter, and the exaggerated features that scare me, and I still have nightmares about it. Please, I encourage you not to allow your children to see it. It's far, scary too. Please, I pray, keep it away.
