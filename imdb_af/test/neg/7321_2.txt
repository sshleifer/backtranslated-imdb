I watched this movie on video with some friends as part of a teenage comedy triangular head, next to Dorm Daze and Going Greek. It was clear that we were not going for quality, but for entertainment expressions and exchange opportunities. Generally we have what we came for, but Wild Romans really stood out: To be awful. <br /> <br /> First impression, the cover: The Norwegian flyhalf covered breasts and a lot of seemingly "crazy" creamy in the background; Do photos of drunk semi-naked teenagers doing bunches of funny things aren't they? - The "crazy" creamies on the front page didn't even appear in the picture. And the funny things you accept will do them. - Also not present. <br /> <br /> This movie was on the label comedy, which is a bit odd as it is not even funny. Relationship drama will be more accurate. <br /> <br /> In short, the movie is about a young couple who inherit a poor home in LA, and are forced to get some rooms to meet the ends. These campsites eventually put both the young couple's patience and relationship with the test because they are so "wild". Problem is, it's not. And here lies the problem of this movie: The protagonist couple are so anal-retentive and neurotic that they manage to generate zero sympathy. You will find that you are rooting halfway through the movie for the antagonist spaces. Add mediocre acting, lame dialogue and boring direction and you have yourself a movie that is the best unseen. <br /> <br /> See something else.
