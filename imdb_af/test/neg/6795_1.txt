First, nobody with any law enforcement experience (not ER or EMT, but true law enforcement) takes this performance seriously. Walker will be thrashed by any US police force for his illegal and totally unprofessional tactics. In addition, he is a cartoon character --- no acting ability, amazingly striking lines, no character development. The fact that Alex Cahill loves him just shows how stupid the dominee really is. And Trivett is the ultimate clown in black face. Come on --- if you think Walker is a sincere performance without prejudice, then explain why JT is treated as a fool, is always the subject of Walker's jokes, never be the one to solve the crime and Walker will never save. , who must be dead 50 times for the stupid things he does. Although it may be true that many criminals are even more stupid than the detectives who go after them (and believe me, most policemen are thinner than dirty), the smart walker suggests that it is never the point that Walker is once caught not, The yoke must be put off its misery. But then Norris made the show and also played in it, so how can he become willing or even show how stupid his tactics are. As if six guys are waiting to take him one at a time. What a terrible series! It's more humiliating than any of the Hokey Westerns like The Lone Ranger, Roy Rogers, The Cisco Kid and Wild Bill Hickock, although I think most of you here are too much to remember those shows. But like those shows, in the same way it shows, Walker TR is just as offensive and simple stupid.
