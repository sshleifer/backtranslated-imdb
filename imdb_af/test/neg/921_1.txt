How did I find it to look? Worst ever. The acting was terrible, when I read that it was a comedy, I expected to smile at least once or twice, but .... If you want to lose half your lives, this is the real movie . I recommend looking just in a wall or something, anything else, but look at this "movie". Yoy can even watch a documentary (if you are an old man) about pregnant women, I guarantee it will be more entertaining.) The actor in this one (I forgot his name) is not that bad, and I'm surprised how he had the role. Anyway, "I want someone to eat cheese" is the right movie if you want to punish someone.
