My Age: 13 <br /> <br /> Keats, played by Damon Wayans, and Archie Moses, played by Adam Sandler, are the best friends and have been around for a year. What Moses doesn't know is that Keats is really Jack Carter, a vice-captain, waiting for the right time to breastfeed Moses and Frank Colton, a great criminal involved in Moses. When Colton and Moses find out that Keats is a policeman, Colton wants to kill Moses, but he gets away after he shot Carter in the head, which didn't kill Carter. Moses is found by the police and is taken as evidence of Colton's offense. But when police, including Carter, accompany him on a plane across the country, all the other police are killed and Moses and Carter are alone in the desert. Carter must stay alive and also take Moses. <br /> <br /> Fairly average action comedy, Bulletproof has a fair plot, but much of the movie is just stupid. For a comedy I found most of the jokes completely unfunny. But as an action movie, it has some pretty good action scenes. Not a good fan of Adam Sandler or Damon Wayans, but I found the acting and therefore the characters, well below par. The climax is not really good, and the film is so unrealistic. It's not quite bad, but not too good, and it's too short. For less than 85 minutes I walked another 15 minutes before it ended, but there was not and the film felt too short. Not a complete waste of time, but I still wouldn't recommend Bulletproof. <br /> <br /> Australian Classification: MA 15+: Medium Level Violence, Sexual References, Medium Level Rough Language <br /> <br /> Rating: 56 out of 100
