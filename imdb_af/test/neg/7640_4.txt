The synopsis of this movie led me to believe that it would be a story of an unconventional woman who doubted the conventions of society. I like strong female characters and expect a movie very much according to the lines of "Chocolat" with a lesser fairy tale and more bites. What I got was a throw of despicable characters. <br /> <br /> For a character-driven movie to be effective, I need to feel a connection or compassion for the people. There was no one I could relate to in the movie. Grazia (Golino, whose work I admired in "Rain Man") shows a mentally ill, probably bipolar, female woman who is often rude, aggressive and violent. Her husband scared and screamed, if he didn't hit or hit. The kids are rude brats. They shout at each other and the women in the movie. They attack other children with no provocation. Violence causes violence. It seems to be an island of uncomfortable, aggressive, violent and rude people altogether. <br /> <br /> The direction is not compelling. There are mixed scenes that are trying to be art, but instead they carry the viewer. The location is extraordinarily beautiful, but even this is not captured to the extent it can be on film. <br /> <br /> I should recommend staying away from this movie failure.
