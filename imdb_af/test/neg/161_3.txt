This film deals with the intricate friendship, romance and cheating between two men and two women during World War II. <br /> <br /> Much effort has been put into making "The Edge of Love". . However, I find this effort too excessive, especially in terms of tone of color. Most of the first half of the film is processed so much to have a strong blue tone. It's hard to figure out who's who in this show. <br /> <br /> Another disadvantage is the fancy use of image sharing lens. There are many scenes that have three or four images of the same thing, like three Keira Knightley smiling faces or four pairs of arms embraced. It simply makes the movie confusing and difficult to follow, rather than being artistic. <br /> <br /> Regarding the plot, it's simply boring. The way the story unfolds is not becoming involved at all. Sienna Miller's unstable character is annoying. In fact, all the main characters are annoying and unlikely. Keira Knightley's accent is impossible to understand, making it a further obstacle to understanding the plot. I strongly recommend avoiding the "Edge of Love" unless you just watch a movie to appreciate good costumes, nice sets. and lighting.
