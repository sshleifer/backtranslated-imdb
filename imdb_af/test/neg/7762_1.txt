On weekends, these women just wipe off all the men from their feet. Really get it. None of these women are "knockouts". Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) looks like the kind of woman that men would pick up. 45:00 before the bar closed after their vision and standards equal ten or eleven martinis. Yet she is the Queen's, a super-sexy man killer. The other three are not much better. And their constant, dirty oral comment ... not to mention they are jumping with strangers in and out of bed and never getting a disease. This show is pathetic. And creepy. I don't think any man would be terribly attracted to any of these women, even though he sustained Viagra like Tic Tacs while on the beach.
