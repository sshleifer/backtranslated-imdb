On paper, this movie has a few characters: a street child who overcomes past trauma, rebuilds his life and succeeds in the world writing him. Big things, everyone loves a happy ending. <br /> <br /> In the theater, however, there were a few omissions that left the film dead. The dialogue was hollow and uninteresting, the characters were almost cartoon-like in their lack of dimension and complexity, and why did everyone have to be gay? I have nothing against homosexual themes or characters in a movie, but when used in this way, it is not only offensive to homosexuals, it trivializes the lifestyle and makes the movie cheap. If the story worked without this cheap trick, it had to be cut. <br /> <br /> Every character looked like it came from the same cookie cutter: Every one has one big mistake and one small mistake, every character is kind or they are successful or not, and everyone has one or them in had an abusive relationship with someone. <br /> <br /> The most annoying fact of the movie is that they never allow you to name "pip" out of great expectations. They give it to you once and it should be enough. The story shares enough with the Dickens classics to make this fact clear. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of the movie is the story of the grandfather and the cassette he left for Pip, and how Pip, the main character, learns to grow up from the lessons learned from the band. In the end, with the learned lessons, Pip confronts his dark past and film with his life ahead.
