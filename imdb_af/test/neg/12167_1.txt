I hated this movie and it's the first movie written by Stephen King, which I didn't complete. I was really disappointed, it was the worst crazy I've ever seen. What do you think is three hours? It can have a pretty good story, but actors? No. Suspension? No. Romantic? No. Horror? No. It had nothing. <br /> <br /> It has this strange, crazy science man with Einstein hair, the classic thing. Not really. And a man is still younger. They seem to have only used the name of Stephen King to make a crazy, too long movie with nothing exciting. <br /> <br /> I give this movie "1 (terrible)". If they were like -5, I'd probably rather take it. It was a total waste of time.
