Great acting, good production values, good direction. <br /> <br /> But the script starts with great tension and interest in the first half and then falls apart in the second half. We are clear about character and motivation for the first half, but then the second half leaves many questions unanswered. <br /> <br /> The conflicts generated are compelling but the succession is poor. For example, we are very clear that Rudyard Kipling is a pre-war, but we do not know if that philosophical attitude changes over the course of the film. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of picture that makes me want to look up the facts in history books. I don't feel that I can rely on the film to get a clear idea. <br /> <br /> The depiction of the war itself is sadly correct, although the woman's lack of enthusiasm does not reflect the war hysteria that Britain had erased at that time. Perhaps it is historically accurate; Like so much in this movie, I simply don't know.
