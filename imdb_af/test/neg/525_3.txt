Some aspects of this production are good, such as the performances of Angela Lansbury, George Hearn, Cris Groenendaal and Sal Mistretta. But am I the only one distracted by the terrible performance of Betsy Joslyn as Johanna? She's horrible! She beat the songs with her screaming voice and overworked it in a role she clearly didn't understand. I also think the choir is not sniffing. They drag the pace and make the worst facial expressions. Overall, I think this production is good, but Sweeney Todd can be so much more if done correctly. This production does not come close to the level this material demands. The concert version with George Hearn and Patti LuPone is much better.
