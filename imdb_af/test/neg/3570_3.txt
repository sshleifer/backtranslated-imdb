I have to agree that the movie is not the best I've ever seen, but I would like to mention that the actors depicting Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey were the true Dorsey brothers. As actors, they were wonderful musicians. The movie, based on their famous split, would have been better if professional actors played the parts. Many movies made during this time frame benefited from the popularity of Big Bands. Often the movies were not so good, because musicians are not actors by trade. Most of the filmmakers didn't see Tommy or Jimmy Dorsey playing themselves; They went for the plot and the music. I've never been much of a Dorsey fan, but the music is even good today. <br /> <br /> I have to comment on a previous post about the actors who played Mom and Pop Dorsey and that their accents would be considered an extreme by a Dublin audience. Arthur Shields and Sara Allgood were actually Irish actors, both born in Dublin. You can mr. Shields remember as the reverend Mr. Playfair in the quiet man and me. Allgood like Mrs. Monahan in cheaper at the dozen.
