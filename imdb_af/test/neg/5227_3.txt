I'm a fan of Ed Harris's work and I really had high expectations about this movie. Having such good actors as Harris and Von Sydow is always a great benefit to a director, but if the script is bad, what can you do? I really think that Essential Things is the worst movie of Harris's filmography and that it was a big mistake. Anyway, I saw a lot of worse movies in my life, but Essential Things was a disappointment because of the waste of acting talent. The story as a whole seems too incredible and false. I don't know if it's because of the book, because I didn't read it. But if the writing was so bad, I couldn't see the reason for filming it. Perhaps it was the commercial success of King's books, or the need for low-quality films for the 90's VHS era. Whatever the reason, this movie was a very bad choice for anyone involved.
