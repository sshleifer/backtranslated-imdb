I don't know about the real Cobb, but I got the clear impression that the filmmakers were aiming to soften its edge and reputation, and didn't give us a real portrait of the man himself. In the movie, he has, apart from some racist remarks, shown that he is just another stubborn, cantakerous old coot (he is so full of life!) With a heart of gold (more or less). It is also the worst thing I have seen doing T.L. Jones (he doesn't bring anything new or subtle to his stereotype). He just flashes Cobb in a way that pulls me into the movie. Not for a minute I forgot that it was Tommy Lee Jones on the screen as if it were Ty Cobb. Robert Wuhl also didn't impress. The "comedic" elements in this movie were just distracting and didn't go at all. A bloody waste of time, that is
