Interesting topic. Pathetic delivery - writing and direction. <br /> <br /> Our hero, Miles, thaws and has his emergency world-first life recovery operation. That's where the fun begins. The underlying problem is that Miles has NO SOUL !!! It is used to declare its quasi-volatile behavior to be indirectly responsible for two deaths (I believe this is the total number of deaths in 104 minutes). <br /> <br /> On the lively side, Miles prefers the strange glass of brandy, burning fireplaces and his young adult female cousin. The final is right on this movie. <br /> <br /> Single Thoughts: 1. Producer $ $ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ J.D. Feigelson was the screenwriter and a (or only) producer. It seems he has not learned a lesson on how to bring an interesting idea to life, if one considers his other writing credits. This will support the credibility of this writing. <br /> <br /> 2. Now available on DVD !!! It's really scary. Must be forever "Bottom of shelf" in VHS format. <br /> <br /> 3. A revived person without soul will be defeated at an evil entity. <br /> <br /> 4. The score provides minimal support. Not even an in-form Jerry Goldsmith can save it. <br /> <br /> 5. Forget about the 0230 time slot on TV and a touch more entertainment than the infomercials + test patterns it looked at me when I watched my viewing. <br /> <br /> 6. Fortunately, a sequel to ala Wes Craven's "Nightmare" session has not continued. Chiller Too: The return of Miles, or something like that. <br /> <br /> Despite my score of 1, I still recommend this movie as a good example of how to kill a acting or script writing career. This should apply to directing, but Wes Craven will be released forever because of his only good piece "A Nightmare on Elm Street" 1984.
