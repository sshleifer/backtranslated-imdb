The return is a ghost on inspiring sports movies, and let me just tell you - it's not a good one. Tom Brady (the director) probably found it hilaries that referring sports movies (from Gridiron Gang, Invincible and even Miracle! To the longest yard and Dodgeball-ja Dodgeball!) And in a few sex jokes, would be the funniest thing to be since airplane! Well, he was wrong. They did such a quick job, you thought it was written in a week. I found that as a director of the genre, the movie would be good. Apparently, Brady doesn't like the genre he spoils. This movie is a rubbish piece of garbage that is not worth seeing, so it doesn't!
