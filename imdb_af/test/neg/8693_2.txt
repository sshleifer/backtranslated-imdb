Beautiful attempt to liven up the Shakespeare language in a post-apocalyptic environment, but the final result is scary. Futuristic Liverpool is not convincing at all; The budget was apparently not very big, but the production designer could have a slightly more creative approach to the issue. Alex Cox made good movies, eg. Repo Man and Highway Patrol Man, but I really don't know what he's thinking here. Just an opinion.
