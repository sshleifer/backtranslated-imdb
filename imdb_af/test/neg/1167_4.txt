Since then he has played in Lone Wolf McQuade, actor / stuntman Kane Hodder was busy. His film, Hatchet, received publicity last year, but annually he makes a few more movies. He had to skip this one. <br /> <br /> Hodder seems to be the king of the slashers. He played Jason Voorhees from Jason X (2001) on Friday the 13th, Part VII: The New Blood (1988). He is working on a new movie that looks like a Halloween remake. He's a lot I would call the serial killer with his methodical, expressionless thirst for blood. <br /> <br /> However, there was not much blood in this movie and very little action was taken on camera. It feels like I'm watching an actual law enforcement episode on A&E. <br /> <br /> I won't be completely blamed on Hodder's shoulders, because the rest of the actors didn't contribute much. <br /> <br /> The Hills Has Eyes (The Devil's Rejects) just ran his mouth until Gein closed him. Adrienne Frantz ("The Bold and the Beautiful") was cute. Veteran actress ("Three's Company") and Penthouse Pet, Priscilla Barnes, have done a credible job. I'm sure there are other horror favorites, but they all seemed to run through their roles.
