When this show is broadcast first, I will admit that it is fascinated by the premise and the institution. With an open mind, I watched the first two episodes and sent it off as a half-season, of course. I recently watched A / E and saw an advertisement for this garbage and I could barely contain my surprise. I really hope people look at it for a laugh and don't take it seriously. The characters are actually some of the most ridiculous and really ridiculous on television, written or otherwise. This is, of course, setting up ratings, so I have to give the creators credit for the creation and maintenance of a fan base, but I seriously hope that no one is watching it under any pretext.
