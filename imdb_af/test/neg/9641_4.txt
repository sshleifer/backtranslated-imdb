My mistake to think was a serious war-hell movie before I see it. It has ended seconds in the movie when the "MTV" logo appeared. It can be called "National Lampoon's Sexy-N-Loose." And it played to the MTV crowd; The movie that followed the comic first few seconds played like the music videos they played 40+ years ago. At least Disney was smart enough to send his graded stuff to Toucheone and allowed us to take it seriously. All right, I'm hard; It wasn't that bad of a movie. However, it certainly has its share of overtime and the film is extremely biased / unilateral. I'm not a war movie buffalo. I can't see more than once 'Platoon,' 'Full Metal Jacket' or 'Private Ryan'. Certainly, they were good movies, but they are not my forts, and after a while they look where I cannot distinguish one of the following. After a tour in Iraq, Phillippe plans to live after the war, but is withdrawn due to a clause in his contract. Or, it's at least the military's plan until he goes AWOL and the characters speed across the country at a few dollars never caught unbelievably. No, I didn't work in any war or in Iraq, and I don't agree with it either. I also have no knowledge of the recruitment or signing of their contracts. I can say that, although I am sorry to be withdrawn from this conflict, I cannot feel too much for someone who is so stupid not to read the fine print. It's as if someone was leaning on their deathbed to read the Surgeon General's warning on their cigarette case and saying, "Oh, they're what? Deadly? I'll sue them!"
