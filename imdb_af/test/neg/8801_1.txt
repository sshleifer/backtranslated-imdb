I don't understand how some people can play 'Half-Life: Counter-Strike' when there are so much better first-person shooting games available. <br /> <br /> "Counter-Strike" is a game that uses no imaginative ideas in its weapon. All the weapons in the game are a real weapon, but at least there could be a cheat that allowed players to have access to a "supernatural" weapon, such as the almighty BFG in the Quake & Doom games. <Br /> <br /> Another problem is that the player actually needs to recharge the weapon. It can become extremely irritating, especially when you are in the middle of a firefight when you kill so close to the enemy. The reload delay also gives the feeling that the gun is slow to perform its task. <br /> <br /> There are not many choices of characters to choose from. If I remember correctly, there are 4 types of characters each for the terrorist and counter-terrorist forces. This means that many of the characters look the same as each other, which actually reduces the game's realism. <br /> <br /> The game is pretty sexist when it comes to character choices. In the early version of Counter-Strike, a woman was available to choose (in the Terrorist Force Selection) that was good for the female gamers. However, in the latest versions, the female character has been removed and replaced with a different male character. I wonder if the women who played the game were disappointed in the newer versions. <br /> <br /> Finally, the cards in the game are very small. The biggest map seems to be the desert map, but it has standard detail. In fact, all the cards in the game have standard graphics. In other words, nothing new. <br /> <br /> In short, I think "Half-Life: Counter-Strike" is the most unimaginable first-person shooting game of all time. There are many better and more imaginative shooting games to play, so why do you waste your time on this boring game? You better play the Unreal Tournament, Quake, and Doom games. Avoid this overpriced and overheated game. <br /> <br /> I give the game a 1/10.
