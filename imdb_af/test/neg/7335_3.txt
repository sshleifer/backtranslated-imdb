The movie starts well, with a cartoon film about the customs of Swedish housewives. Then we get a detailed reconstruction of post-war Scandinavia with many wonderful cars, electronic equipment and interior design; minimal jazz score, nice cinematography and stylish titles. There are also some funny Scandinavian races as in the Von Triers' Riggie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the kitchen stories, such as the Twin Towers on 9/11, are falling behind the set. Potatoes trying to portray emotion are a jealousy by staring just before them. Corny dialogue filled with boring gay symbolism in vain: "I don't like white swans, I prefer bear and wolves ... you've ever fed meat?" The music becomes cheesier than Yann Tiersen at its worst. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the director made every effort in this great setting, just to screw it off after the weeks.
