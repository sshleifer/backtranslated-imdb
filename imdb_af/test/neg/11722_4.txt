I saw this movie for one reason: the tagline is "Upset the head and you're dead!" Cracks. It is not surprising that this dull horror comedy runs out of steam before the band is out of the box, but it leaves some laughs from the strange appearance and characters of characters: an eagle-eye-human radar, a great strongman and large The broken sexual magnet is controlled by a large head in a chair. He is not happy that his family is being sacked by a murderous scoundrel. It seems like a promising mix of ham and cheese, before it becomes clear that the characters are one joke and the plot is pretty ordinary if you ignore the head.
