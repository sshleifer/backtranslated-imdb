OK, so is it horror? I get horror - but I don't get scary. Black and white are artistic, but too much black is left over ... enough said about the lighting. The story - a serial killer ....... many of these rounds. It has been done in the past and yes, it will continue to do so ..... but I hope not. My question is, when will the audience become brave to relive this malicious dilemma? I think the director thought he would do something else - killing children. Well, this has been done before. So, I think he should have shock value ..... they killed in the darkest fashions. Okay ..... the audience was shocked ...... sick .... disgusting ..... doomed. And when I got up from my seat, I felt all this stuff. So was the director successful? Yes! Absolutely! These are the things he wanted me to feel and I did. Now, what am I doing with the feelings? And more importantly, what is the "message" here? With the wonderful talent Francis Xavier was "gifted" with ..... can he ever consider making movies that speak, dare I say, come out of the dark? I was left in the dark after I saw this movie, my soul was assaulted .... is that what this vessel is about? There are many such movies out there - they make the money I'm told. So how are the people who want to see all these deceptive visions? What happens in this world that people will pay to be terribly shocked? Would I see it again ..... not ever.
