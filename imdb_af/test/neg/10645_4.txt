There is a lot of ketchup, but not a whole lot of sense in the supposedly explanatory third successor, which results in the naff-visual effects. Good old Alan Smithee directed this one, in which several members of the same family (all played, poor, by Bruce Ramsay) terrorized by Pinhead (Doug Bradley, driven away from mothballs for the umpteenth time). Peter Atkins tries to suppress his writing with poetic touches, but does not seem to realize that his dialogue is as deep and meaningful as a plate of sickness. The incoherent plot fails to adequately fill the movie's meager running time, although it has more to do with studio interference than the filmmakers meant.
