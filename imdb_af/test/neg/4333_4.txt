The author of the "Prince" manages to get an excellent movie, a decent story, a mediocre manuscript, and gathers them carefully in one boring, monotonous, amateurish mess. Despite a strong central performance by Frank Nasso, the Prince, this detached film wanders aimlessly from scene to scene, painfully in the hashish. The result is a sigh of relief at the end where the tears should be joyful. A sad waste of time and talent and a good example of how not to direct a movie. <br /> <br />
