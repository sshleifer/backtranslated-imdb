Of course I saw the previews at the beginning of another Lion's Gate extravaganza, so of course it was just the best parts and so it looks intriguing. And it's up to a point. A young college student (Sarah) finds riddles everywhere and becomes busy answering them, thereby becoming unknowingly involved in a game. Now it's really intriguing there, but unfortunately it all gets lost and it gets so complicated that the viewer (like myself) is likely to get frustrated. Characters appear with little introduction and you don't really know who they are or why Sarah knows them or hangs out with them. All of this has something to do with this woman who tried to drown a young boy years ago, and her reason was that it was quite a part of the design. In reality, it's all part of the "very sketchy script" and if the film is over, you feel you've lost about half an hour of your life for more productive uses of your time. such as cleaning the bathroom. 4 out of 10.
