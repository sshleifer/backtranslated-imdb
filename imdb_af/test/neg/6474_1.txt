The Disney studios' reminder of their own 1965 slapstick classic is about a clever cat that is a F.B.I. agent for a kidnapped woman. Christina Ricci gives a captivating, loose show here as the cat's owner, and the feed is played by Doug E. Doug, shockingly over the top, like a human cartoon. A few rich neurotics (Dyan Cannon and the original "Cat" -shared member Dean Jones) are funny and the formula plot has a little juice in it, but the handling here is so heavy and lugubrious and the cat is so lifeless. . , that this is strict DOA <br /> <br /> * of ****
