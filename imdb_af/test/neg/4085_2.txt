This is definitely not a comedy - I don't know what it is so marketed for. As a serious movie, it has no substance. Unless you're out of Sunday school or fixing your Noah, you'll tear your tears. <br /> <br /> The supporting role kept away from what little of the movie was about. Lauren Graham plays an empty housewife with no real depth. His kids don't really add anything to the movie. They just seem to be breeding about their absent father at the beginning. Jonah Hill plays a creepy internet addict who doesn't come out as humorous. <br /> <br /> I found the original to be a decent movie. Disappointed that this one didn't really go anywhere.
