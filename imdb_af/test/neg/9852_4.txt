The TV program was moving slowly and the "horrible" characters were sometimes annoying. Only by the wonder of fast forward I could make it through the first 2 hours. <br /> <br /> The headline indicates it's a kind of comedy / mystery, but I haven't seen much of it. <br /> <br /> If it really comes up after the first 2 hours, please let me know, because I doubt I will see the rest without a recommendation. <br /> <br /> This review is supposed to be without spoilers, so I'll continue in a vague, non-spoiler, fashion. I found the two main characters uninteresting and unsympathetic. I asked myself, "Will an ordinary adult do that?" The man with the hedge trimmer looking out of the window was irritating and when the male lead interacted with him, he looked pathetically. Will a normal adult with someone be as irritating as he is?
