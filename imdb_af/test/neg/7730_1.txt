This film is right there with The Oscar and Moment at Moment as one of unintentional funny films of all time. <br /> <br /> It's worth the rent for some very big laughs. <br /> <br /> The story is absolutely ridiculous. Nothing in life will happen like that. It's so amazing. the way James Woods tries and presses heavy heaters, as they give this supposed two-bit hustler a job, 3000km away in LA, a joke <br /> <br /> I love the old beat VW -bug to indicate how low they are. Sean Young is as incredibly bad as the "I will love you forever, no matter what, wife", you will ever see. . And as bad as you will ever see. <br /> <br /> James Wood dominates the whole movie and he is so funny, and it's over, it's just not to believe. Woods looks like a parody of a cocaine enemy of Saturday Night Live. But watch Woods on "ludes" is the price of the rental worth. <br /> <br /> I love it if Woods tells the guy who wants to give him more, that he doesn't do those things anymore. Just before that, Woods made only three huge lines of coke. <br /> <br /> These are some very funny things. <br /> <br /> The end is so comical, but compared to the rest of the movie.
