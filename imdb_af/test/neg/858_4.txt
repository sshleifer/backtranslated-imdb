The Duke is a film based in the heart of the British aristocracy where an old duke (John Neville) dies and avoids his great property and the great wealth he has after the death of 2 apostate aristocrats (Oliver Muirhead and Sophie Heyman); He goes to his dog's Dukeship. The dog's best friend, an American girl named Charlotte (played by Courtnee Draper) whose parents are dying, is becoming by the former Duke orphan because of her great uncle. A young chef named Florian comes, with him and Charlotte, who are immediately connected to creating a romantic subplot that in its own way serves as the undertone of the main feature that Hubert, The Duke's activities and many activities are. love interests with other dogs. All this was watched by James Doohan who plays a Butler determined to try and serve his old Duke by doing his best to serve his new master, Hubert. Doohan acts as the older character to comfort and advise the younger one as he looks at the various similar tasks under his new master. A good comedian show mixed with drama elements to end the career of a fine and influential actor. <br /> <br /> Although I don't like this movie from the technical point of view, I just looked at the discovery of James Doohan's role. Although the plot is good, elements of writing and directing should be obscured. If I ignore the absurdity of a Doggie Duke, I personally ignore the use of comic and outrageous jokes on the 'bad' characters because of their mockery. The dependence on hygiene-related humor as you please is far too clear and general psychology of many characters does not address me. The director, Phillip Spink, uses too much of an overbubbled voice in the middle of long shots or influences overall sound quality. Plus, the acting of Muirhead and Heyman, while being good in the dramatic and romantic order, falls sharply and meets the wholesale requirements regarding the role. <br /> <br /> But as a mature movie lover, I find it easy to be critical of a simple family movie designed to make you laugh. I can admit that I got some bits of funny and other pieces along with a plot that is far-fetched but has definite connections. I do not recommend this movie to adult filmmakers, but I highly recommend it to Dog lovers, families who would like a funny movie for their child and James Doohan fans who want to see Scotty in his final role.
