I rented this movie because I love Kristanna Loken and I watched her on many TV shows and since she became known for 15 minutes with her new T3 movie, I wanted to see what other movies she was in. <Br /> <br /> She's just OK in terms of acting. Not good and not bad either. She finishes everything by being very beautiful. YUMMMM <br /> <br /> Rodney Rowland was quite a surprise as the hero. He provided the only solid stuff in the movie. He is a very good actor and should probably be an action star. <br /> <br /> Besides Kristanna is OK and Rodney is really good, everything else about this movie is rubbish in its purest form. <br /> <br /> A computer hacker hacks into the system of a plane from the ground up and using a joystick he tries to plane into a nuclear power plant ..... or something. And of course there are the heroes who stand in his way and destroy his game. <br /> <br /> It's one of the worst scripts I've ever seen and no wonder it was a low budget slip. <br /> <br /> What is shocking is that this movie was made in 2001 and it has far too many similarities with the 11th tragedies in September. <br /> <br /> Why do they make such a movie in the first place? <br /> <br /> Panic * - one star (a waste of good actors) (also a waste of time) (also known as Air Panic)
