Solomon and Saba came down in Hollywood, not for the quality of the movie, but for the fact that Tyrone Power died while making it. I was in 5th grade and remember the big news for days when that tragedy happened. I didn't know who Tyrone Power was at, but I learned and learned to appreciate the body of his work. <br /> <br /> I often wonder if Ty had a meaning on this movie and what a dud proved it. He was also the named producer of this. Maybe he just didn't want to face the critics. Good thing Power actually went out with Witness for the prosecution, although you can see him in long shots when you look close. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a biblical stove that would probably baffle the great Solomon himself. Several incidents described in the Bible, which deal with the Bible separately, are plotted together in one plot with some additions made by Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The real story of the queen of Saba is that she went on a trade mission to the kingdom of Israel, a little talk of Solomon, returned with many merchandise and that was it. The story of a romance between her and Solomon is legend. The ancient kingdom of Saba is about where Yemen allegedly moved people to the African continent, and that's how Ethiopia was founded. <br /> <br /> The Queen never saw Solomon's well-known wife as the two women with separate claims for a baby, and she was also not involved in building the First Temple. And she wasn't for destroying it either. Nor was Solomon the case. <br /> <br /> And she was not involved in the dispute over the succession when Solomon's brother Adonijah argued. This is the heart of this movie. Adonijah, when he heard the news that King David was dying, declared himself king. Of course, David meets temporarily and says that God came to him and said Solomon should succeed. When David heard of what Adonijah had done, he said, "All that God has done, Adonijah is greedy." Then Adonijah will plot. <br /> <br /> Things seem full circle, as Ty Power has been on the set while joining George Sanders as Adonijah. Sanders and Power were rivals in many films, especially in Lloyds of London, which was Power's breakthrough role. If Sanders wasn't quite the sophisticated sophistication he was in Samson and Delilah. He is still Sanders, the Biblical cad. <br /> <br /> When Power died, Yul Brynner was brought in to play Solomon and a wig so that existing footage of Power in Long Shot can be saved. Brynner is investing in the dialogue with proper dignity, but I think he is likely to regret the pinch. <br /> <br /> Gina Lollobrigida is the Queen of Saba and is tempting as a biblical tempter in the Cecil B. DeMille tradition. . She seems to have no real conviction and my guess is that she is shocked by Power's sudden downfall and has to do it again. Marisa Pavan as Abishag can deliver the best performance in the film. <br /> <br /> The right story with Adonijah is not as comprehensive as this movie. He challenged Solomon's succession and gathered a group of King David's court as supporters. Solomon forgave them once, and Adonijah asked Abishag to marry. Abishag in the Bible and here was an adopted daughter of King David in his old age. When Solomon heard it, he decided that Adonijah would be greedy and murdered him. The Bible mentions someone named Bernia who is going to tour, basically contracting Adonijah's supporters. <br /> <br /> What we have in the movie is a spectacular climax with a miracle I was looking for and couldn't find. It came from the fertile imagination of director King Vidor who ended a long and sought after career on a letter. It was a question whether Vidor was trying to perform Cecil B. DeMille in Biblical spectacle. <br /> <br /> He didn't make it.
