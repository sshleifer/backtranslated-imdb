This movie was hired for free, I had no misconception about being a very bad movie. I rented it for Thanksgiving because we were eating turkey and then the family watched a terrible movie. So you ask, what makes this movie so bad you just gave it 2 stars? Dialog. The lack of dialogue makes it a movie that is perfect for a deaf audience. In fact, turn the volume to zero and press into any heavy metal CD of your favorite artist. I know you will enjoy it better. The plot of this holiday turkey was so busy with technology and geek. You need a translator for the narration. Now for all your people who enjoy good sci-fi effects ... uh, they're not much better than video game trailers or cut scenes in cases worse. The actors, both of them, are not much to look at. They say nothing much about the whole movie. Many of the technical aspects will make you laugh like the scene where the hero straps herself on a missile and burns it 70km from the city (it never showed how she landed). The scene before that we see a firearm on her with a cannon from 12 feet away and he misses several shots. We are also told that the political division between the antagonist and protagonist is biotechnology (genetically enhanced people) versus cyber technology (machine-enhanced people), but both look like cyborgs or improved people. What told me was a bad movie at the shop. It was the cover that looked like a video game art and there was only one copy. Good new issues have many copies available.
