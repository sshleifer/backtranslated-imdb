Very strange. But meant to be. This director is his own man. Even through there are tribes like Polanski, Bergman, and Kafka at least in episode 6, the peeping tom one. What made it so strange and reminiscent of the above three artists was that it was all over, you never knew where it was going and could have ended up everywhere. And finally, when it was finished, it could continue. The end is hardly a final, no one can tell you what these two characters would do in the next framework. One more thing to be said about the director: No wonder Kubrick found him fascinating. There are many Eyes Wide Shut in this episode, somehow, in the direct approach to character, the realistic fantasy elements of both. A Kubrick placement of the camera without any strong effects, much more washed out and hurried, not so fussed about. That being said, back to the beginning, this man still has his own things to say and says good. Yet, for some reason, there's no single scene I ever want to see again. But it certainly did not feel the least, but it once looked over. But I still had the feeling of three or four other director-ghosts moving through the parade and blurring everything. The reservation was that it was only episode six: the other nine could take me completely differently. But since this episode has turned to watch, watch, the absolute domain of the movie, I'll say it, he didn't take any of the usual routes, definitely went his own way while he was carrying the baggage of very good directors behind him worn.
