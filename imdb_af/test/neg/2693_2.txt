I am a Shakespeare lover since childhood. I'm also a Jew. The Venice merchant is anti-Semitic through and through, no matter how difficult scholars and literature lovers try to reinterpret it. <br /> <br /> In the play Shylock is portrayed as demonic and cold and has no forgiveness, no warmth, no love except for money and cruel revenge, while Christians are kind, moral people. His motifs in the play revolve around money (he sees revenge from the beginning on the basis of damage to his business and blind races hate), not noble ideas or sore racial pride as this movie wants you to believe. And this characterization is given to him by Shakespeare himself, not by the other characters. As the last proof, the happy ending is where the Jew loses his money and is forced to convert to Christianity. <br /> <br /> I recognize it and continue. This is part of history and I enjoy Shakepeare despite this fact. That's why I expect a movie based on this play to play it straight. I'd rather see the work tailored to its rich language and storytelling without any whitewash. <br /> <br /> However, many of the bard's spectacular subtle and playful characters are lost in this movie. For example, in the last scene where the men discovered Portia's shelter as a man who also took away their rings, instead of the playful words and misunderstandings as the truth reveals themselves, it becomes a moderate game where two bitchy women play cruelly with their golden men. <br /> <br /> Instead, we are left alone with beautiful detailed sets, fragments of rich language with poor reinterpretation, poor decisions, one intense courtroom scene and a controversy. <br /> <br /> The truth is, I think it will be much easier to identify and continue the anti-Semitism in the story if it remains. In spite of all the whitewashing, the makers of this movie are out of their minds, there is a lot of hatred over, just now people can make excuses and pretend that the portrayal of Jews is no longer so bad. <br /> <br /> And lastly, another problem is that most of the actors are scared. Pacino is out of his league and is very uncomfortable with the language, and not the awful false accent. Fiennes as Bassanio is charming and uncomfortable with the language. Irons are reliable as always, but do not do much with its role. Portia is somewhat good but careless, and covered with bad makeup, just like the movie.
