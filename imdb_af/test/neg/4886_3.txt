From the late teens to the 1920s, Stan Laurel was a solo act in movies. During this time, Laurel was definitely not among the top echels of talent and his humor is not as good as contemporaries like Lloyd or Keaton. For second-level short comedies, however, he created a decent niche. As far as the quality of the films went, they rang wildly. Some, like DR. MUCH AN MR. PRICES were great while most of the average was below average of quality. <br /> <br /> FROZEN HEARTS is a strange movie. Like many of the films he made for Hal Roach and distributed by Pat√© during this period, the costumes were absolutely first-rate and the film looked very nice. Despite this and with the support of James Finlayson, one thing they forgot to include in this movie was humor. Neither of the jokes seems to work and the movie looks like a drama, not a comedy. Only the bad intertitle cards betray the type of movie it is supposed to be. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch all his Laurel and Hardy movies and then watch the solo movies. In addition to DR. PYCKLE, tries to see the FLOWERS and MUD AND SAND - two of his more tolerant solo shorts.
