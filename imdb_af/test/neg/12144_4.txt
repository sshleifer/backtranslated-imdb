It's a serious movie about black revolutionaries and not really an action movie. Billy Dee plays a young man struggling with racism who decides to take things into their own hands. It is fairly neat and realistic without exploiting the characters, but it is not so interesting and Billy Dee's character, although abused by white authority figures, does not come as sympathetically. It was also hurt by the extremely low budget. Still, it is interesting to look at, as it is a good illustration of the social problems of 1970.
