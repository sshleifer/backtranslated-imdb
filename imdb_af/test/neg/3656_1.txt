From the back of the box was my first thought that it's probably a beat of Saw 2. I couldn't get any further from the truth. It seemed to me that they had given someone a corporate phone and $ 10.00 for a camera and told them to make a movie. The plot did not exist nor the play. It was almost as if I was growing a quiet movie about grass. It didn't surprise me to find out later that the whole movie was "improvised". By the end of this "movie" I lost the will to live and I might have got AIDS just when I watched this film movie. It was about 70 minutes that I could spend something less painful. Like jumping off a building.
