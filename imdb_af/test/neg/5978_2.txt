This movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This movie goes on and on and I almost switched it off, but I gave it a shot. I didn't expect anything good, but I expected more than that. Good thing I work at a video store and seen it for free, because I don't want to spend a dime on this movie. I gave this movie a 2, just because I saw the worst. If I were you, I'd stay away from this, far away.
