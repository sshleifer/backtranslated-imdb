The acting was flat (at least one of the actors sounded like they had the script this morning) and the movie and sound quality reminded me of the 70-year film of the weekly bombs. The only thing that told me it wasn't actually a 70-year-old movie this week was the reference to DNA testing. But for me, Eastern Orthodox, the most real thing about this .... movie was the total romance of the religion. Romania is 88% Orthodox, but you will never know about this movie: Father Soren is Irish. And I would have known that, even if I didn't see the actor, I saw the Irish pub. Keep Michael Sullivan in Star Trek: Voyager's Fairhaven episodes. The bishop wore Roman clothes (and for the record, even Orthodox bishops use their clothes unless they say the liturgy, especially if they live in a monastery). Over the only non-Roman accessories I saw, the 3-beam cross was on the church door, and even then I had to see it. The first reviewer said the producers did their research. Well, if that's true, they messed up the religious aspect of the movie.
