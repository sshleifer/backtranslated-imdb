First of all, "Mexican werewolf in Texas" is not a werewolf effect. This title is bullcrap. The story is actually about a Chupacabra that kills all locals in the village of Furlough, Texas. I suppose the distributors have renamed the original title so that it could make extra money or something. And I think it actually works because that is why I bought this piece, it sounded so silly. Anyway, the movie is not good. Actually, it's bloody terrible. But I didn't expect anything else when I bought it. This is a low budget horror movie featuring a Chupacabra monster. If you enjoy a low budget horror with bad dialogue, actors and a few gore, look at this movie. But I have to warn you, this movie is really baaaaaaad. <br /> <br /> This movie has some of the worst plays I've ever seen. The actors are trying hard and it becomes completely ridiculous. They almost never say a line in a normal way. They always have this very wrong tone about just what they say. It's so stupid, it almost looks like a freakin parody. It was as if they had just shot every scene and were happy about it. The worst of them all is the blonde girl who is supposed to play a bimbo. She's the worst of them all. I have never seen an actor as bad as her (and I saw Pteradactyl). Even when her boyfriend dies, she can't stop being a bimbo about it. I hate her. <br /> <br /> Some of the shots in this movie were pretty good. Those who shot in the day are all pretty decent for a low budget project. But most of the movie is shot at night when the Chupacabra hits and the lighting is too dark. The gore screens are small and short, but really grizzly and violent. The effects are really hilarious, but that's the way I like it. The Chupacabra looks pretty messy, and it's easy to see it's an old one. <br /> <br /> Overall this movie should only be watched by extreme fans of low budget flicks and it is very important not to watch it alone. for you will probably be bored. I recommend watching this movie with your friends and beer.
