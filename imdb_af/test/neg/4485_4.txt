I was talking to see it through a girl .. John was a good old, sweet, sensitive and looks good with no shirt on !! I thought it was a love story about both of them, but it was mainly about his responses to her letters. Savannah was a special character at the start of the movie, but as she plunged, I lost respect for her. She said it tore her apart, away from him and it was difficult. He was one million miles away, he killed people and the only contact he had was through her letters !!! She didn't have a hard time, she had family and money and he had a tournament! I was so frustrated at the end when he forgave her - he was too much of a darling. I would have waited the 3 years and welcomed him with open arms.
