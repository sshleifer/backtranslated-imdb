I wanted this movie, but somehow I couldn't find it in myself to do it. <br /> <br /> Shows a duality of fighting styles, that's Li vs. Li in a somewhat decent fight for supremacy. br /> <br /> This is one of those movies where the story carries the representations. Li's play is extremely amateurish, reluctant and stiff for most of this movie ... to the end. Initially I walked in the pride to believe he did it only for one of his two characters. You know, to show a difference in personalities. But it was inexperienced or lacking in talent. It got a little better, more relaxed, to the end. But it wasn't enough to save his performance. Jet Li's play improves as his career moves forward. I don't hate his acting. I just hated him. <br /> <br /> I also have to say that the effects were many "B" class effects. What effects are there? <br /> <br /> The story itself had great potential. It was uniquely creative, bold and fresh. Unfortunately, the budget did not have enough to accommodate better lighting, effects, film quality and some plays, or the director just didn't mind bothering these little details. He also did not bother with science in science fiction. A fact that was a great opponent of this movie. <br /> <br /> The order of battle was a bit one-sided as he gave more than one character and small to the other. But all in all, the story line made for a very pleasant effort. <br /> <br /> As nice as it was, I couldn't help, think all the way through, that it was just one of those movies You can't help but watch it for what it should be , rather than what it is. <br /> <br /> This is a 6.0 / 10 on the "B" scale. <br /> <br /> It's a 4.2 / 10 (on the A scale) for a good plot, from ... <br /> <br /> the Enemy :.
