I first heard of this movie at the "Flashback Weekend" in Chicago 2007 for the Nightmare on Elm Street. Robert Englund was really talking about the movie and he was wonderful in his part of "Hatchet". The same can be said for Tony Todd. Knowing this is a low budget for the first time director / writer, it delivers as much as the big budget and also "Holloween" (2007) remake / re-imagining. <br /> <br /> Technically, it falls short in a few places. The alligator attack seen was too dark. When that happened, the dark head of the alligator almost became invisible against the swamp clinging to the black pants. The mood music in the bogs was too loud in volume and canned, like a bad sitcom. And just like "Holloween" (2007), someone is smart enough to have a gun, but of course the killer just shoots a pause for the killer. The end, well, as soon as I see where it goes, I knew what was going to happen, not very original. <br /> <br /> The highlights of the movie are the characters and their interactions. Unlike "Holloween" (2007), we met and cared for what happened to them. Ben (Joel Moore, who is also the lead of "Spiral"), is the assassination and Marcus ("Not another teenage movie") as the best friend and funny man to root in the movie. Shapiro (Joel Murry "Dharma & Greg"), Jenna (Joleigh Fioreavanti) and Misty (Mercedes McNab from Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Series, "Angel: The Series" and "The Addams Family" for topless women. Mr. And Mrs Permatteo played by television travelers (Richard Riehle, "Grounded for Life", Patrika Darbo, "Step by Step"), as the older couple you know don't offer a chance, even the tour guide Shawn (Parry Shen) is a I hope to see more of everyone involved in this movie, but I think it will be better on home video than in the theater, sorry.
