Like the KOMODO COURSE was for the creature feature genre, Jim Wynorski's CHEERLEADER MASSACRE is a straight-face parody of slasher movies, such as SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE. A psycho, who escaped from his stuffed cell, (.. he was sent to the loony bin by the death of eleven people), is working on the mountainous backwoods countryside of Bobcat County that anyone within his reach attacks. A load of cheerleaders, their teacher, two equipment's hands and the driver are heading for a game when their vehicle runs out of fuel while a supposed short cut is being taken to prevent them from turning back. Fortunately, the group finds a cabin, but a killer attacks each victim one by one. The psychic solution in the country could not have killed one girl because she was in the locker room's dressing room while he was elsewhere, meaning that someone was among them guilty. Meanwhile, the sheriff of the country and his deputy pursued the place of their psycho, while also trying to find the location of the missing cheerleader group. <br /> <br /> Shooting cheaply on video, Wynorski does what he can with the limited budget should find smart ways to kill characters outside the screen without the luxury of properly effective special effects. In other words, many melons have been stabbed, the sound effect told us that some victims in a black glove had gone astray in the dark. Wynorski incorporates a scene of SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE regarding Brinke Stevens' character Linda, while being attacked by a murderer with a drill ... That killer and Linda both died, but I think Wynorski wanted his film on the one couple, though rather weak). It was quite nice to see her, even though it was a glorious cameo. Tamie Sheffield, like Ms Hendricks, the teacher of the students in trouble, has a long swim in the shower that smoothes her naked body and fake breasts. The girls who make up the cheerleaders are a little unconvincing, as they are apparently in their twenties. Aging of soft core pornstar Samantha Philips (.. as a police officer attacked by the psychopath she is looking for) and Nikki Fritz (.. a hiker who is being victimized while running over a dangerous bridge) does not have to be surprised. not. Wynorski veterinarians Bill Langlois Monroe (.. as Sheriff Murdock) and Melissa Brasselle (.. as a detective helping Murdock on his case) contribute to the sub-summary of the search for John Colton's McPherson ceremony. Interestingly, the McPherson story serves as a McGuffan, because the film's flesh is actually devoted to the cheerleading group and their dangerous situation. I'm not sure if slasher fans will embrace this movie, because it takes too long to kill the shots and when they finally enter the picture, violence is neither powerful nor shocking enough to satisfy.
