With such a promising film and a director I heard good things about, I was totally disappointed with this movie. It began with signs of a large epic gangster story and fell into a completely clogged mess with many unanswered questions and some completely ridiculous and useless scenes. (And yes, I watched the full length version). I love Robert DeNiro and as usual he did a fine job, but in all his other gangster movies, no matter how many people he kills, I always had respect for his character, but in this movie he was a drug addict, rapist without caring for anyone other than himself. Also, James Woods, another fine actor, has some totally ridiculous scenes written for him. I thought the parts where Robert DeNiro made him crazy, and he came out, came completely out of the left field and by the end the authors threw this random comment on how his father died in a nursing home and therefore James Woods didn't like getting mad. So much has been left undeveloped in this movie. Also, we never find out what the guys in the beginning are trying to kill Noodles and we never get out of Joe Pesci's character again. It appears that the authors have gathered about five different stories and never fully explained one of them. The only redeeming quality of the film was the story when the characters were young children. The story ran smoothly in this part of the movie and the kids did a great job. Overall, I was thoroughly disappointed by this movie and I don't see how anyone can even compare it to Godfather 1 and 2, or even Goodfellas. I'm sad that I wasted four hours of my life watching this movie
