Don't get me wrong, I love bad movies ... no, I guess bad movies, Troll 2 .... oh painfully, Manos. The hands of the lot ... just watch Torgo go, Guru the Mad Monk. Is it traffic noise in the medieval background? OK, it's clear, but it's one of those movies that are clearly trying to be better, but didn't make it. Why not? Well, it would be easy to blame the plot, but, we have seen worse, there were not too many holes and I know there is not much originality in it, but then it doesn't have to kill a movie . The effects are not bad (if you completely ignore the last scene), the monster is OK, the truck is pretty threatening, where did it go wrong? Well, I'd love to blame it on the 'Chris Moyles' Look-a-like Harley, so I'll! Comedy and horror are difficult to mix well, bad comedy and horror are even worse and there is the problem. I perverted this man from the moment he raised his head (literally), the constant mockery of the exuberant Adam being irritating, so annoying that you lost faith that the mildest people would not respond by pushing him out of the moving car by ... and I thought it was the monster bits that the director intended to convince us. Why are bad movies fun? Well, you have fun in them, laugh at the script, all the cryers, etc. This movie is not the sought-after category of the worst movies, as she's just bad because of the annoying nuff. Don't bother, go see anything else and you'll be a better person for that ... I promise! (Fade to Chants of Torgo Torgo Torgo)
