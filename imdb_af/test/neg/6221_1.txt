I love musical, all of them, from joyful Oklahoma to Poignant Porgy and Bess, to the upcoming romantic "Damn Yankees." And I know most songs, sometimes they sing spontaneously, with a crowd or humming them alone. <br /> <br /> In a "real" musical, differentiated from this vaudeville show, each song is carefully crafted to fit the exact moment. It is an expression of sadness, regret, love, joy or exaltation - a natural extension where mere words fail. So, in "Guys and Dolls", the "My Time of Day" describes the adventurous life of Sky Masterson, as it will compromise the most unlikely woman. Every song in this brilliant example of the genre creates a mood, or develops a character, creates a fantasy magoria of the place, has become absolutely credible by the self who announces the singer. <br /> <br /> For this lover of the Broadway Musical, and their screen adjustments during the latter half of the 20th century, Mama Mia is somewhere between satire and a brutal disturbance of the genre. There the songs of these musicals progressed to the often elaborate, often beautiful, plot lines. While the songs just picked up from a collection, it only interfered with the shaky presentation of the movie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps most of the viewers making this film in a monumental success are simply no exposure to the art form of 20th-century Musicals. They have no idea of ​​the magic performed by writer and lyricist, who can turn a dance hall into a dance hall into someone we know and love, as reached in "Sweet Charity." <br /> <br /> Let me apologize for the arrogance of this review. Maybe, another day, another mood, I could've gotten it and wasn't that critical of this review. <br /> <br /> But I can't help but think what Richard Roger, Oscar Hammerstein, Cole Porter, Irving Berlin and so many others can even do with this foolish prescription. I think about it, while the memories to see this movie are fresh, and I can't help but grieve the big loss.
