Not every movie with lesbian chicks and vampires, which touches our favorite trash / cult genre, is nice. Unfortunately, this movie of originality and the performances do not meet the rubbish standards. Says the creator's intention to make it cult, it failed. Trash films are garbage films because this happens. You can't create these kind of movies. I don't know if Mr Creepo is a legend (the first time I heard his name), but if he was wondering, the reason was ... terrible. Even the lesbian screens are pathetic, so any fan of erotic x-plodding movies won't be happy, as there are thousands of movies better than Barely Legal Lesbian Vampires.
