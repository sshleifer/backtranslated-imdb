I give it a 2 - I keep a 1 rating for Guy Ritchie and Woody Allen movies. We don't even remember what this movie is about. The only thing we remember is one shooting range where the actors fall to the ground, roll to the other side of a corridor or something and then kick back. It was like watching 80-year-olds with 2 broken legs to perform the "stunts". Also, when the characters drive in a truck, the engine sound (or radio will not be recalled) can disappear completely when the actors speak. <br /> <br /> Like others, we bought it because of the Sandra Bullock cover. very sad, very bad.
