I waited a long time to finally see what I was thinking, was a fun little hairdresser and was shocked to discover scary direction, awkward dialogue, an intrepid pace, unmotivated slapstick gags and an overall coarse penetration throughout the movie . Just not funny! The sets look cheap, the costumes of the usually excellent Donfeld are curly and distracting. Even the title song is annoying. The entire children's book characters don't come close to what the married couple represent whose life is upside down when he loses his job. For a film that seems to be an arrow on the unfairness of welfare and unemployment systems, filmmakers have no problem making themselves unfair, playing Hispanic, black and gay stereotypes on such a cruel level. The look of the movie looks like any episode of Love American Style. It's not a compliment. Clothing in the seventies fashions flow into this world of white-collar theft that only offers an air of indifference to every situation. Outside a clever initial idea, and two capable stars in Jane Fonda and George Segal, this dated exercise in social commentary comes down as forced and intended for minorities, especially for gay people. If you want a better caper film, you're better off with The Hot Rock with George Segal and Robert Redford or What's Up Doc with Ryan O'Neal and Barbra Streisand. Now it's funny!
