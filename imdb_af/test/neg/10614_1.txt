I love these terrible 80's summer camp movies. The best part about "Party Camp" is the fact that it literally has no plot. It just leaves a bad batch of characters in one place and sometimes it happens. The cliches here are unlimited (SPOILERS): the nerds against the jocks, the secret camera in the girls' locker room, the hikers who are on a nudist colony, the game to the conclusion, the mysterious camp administrators, and the embarrassment of fools sexual insinuation mocked. The only cliche missing is the presence of Corey Feldman. This movie will make you laugh, but never deliberately. I repeat, never. A final note, be prepared to break a gut to see the nonsense the "dramatic" scene where Jerry Riviera and D.A. Experience a beer late at night and waste their guts. The dialogue literally makes no sense, and the play belongs to a high school. It's a classic.
