It opens - and runs for half an hour - like an educational program on the Old Testament, although it is not without humor. The movie eventually begins to grow as the biblical cant fall. In a scene of mixed success, Martin Donovan (Jesus) decides to escape to kick the Apocalypse and the last quarter is a kind of humanistic 'what is all the fuss?' play-out, gilded with optimistic assumption against a (retrospective, zealously ironic) long shot of the WTC twin store. <br /> <br /> In addition to Donovan's authority, the play is divided. There is the thespian melodrama of the rest of the cast: this, though formally designed for Biblical performance, is suited to the modern, paranoid comedy that Hartley's goal is. But I was also pleasantly surprised by the contribution of PJ Harvey (who is therefore credited and in the danger of being in the movie, only if the pop star entity she is, not least in a fixed stage scene in a record store and a dangerous slam that does not contribute). She remains cool - a kind of dishonest lack of focus - in the way of many pop icons that have taken to film (I think the Jagger or Performance here) but still maintains a convincing integration with both cast and project. <Br /> <br /> Ultimately affirmative, but this bittersweet set is a bit too much like one and relies more on perseverance than the imagination of his audience. 10/04
