It's easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is so much at home that goes wrong, it won't happen, it's not even funny. Admittedly, this is a movie that means that things that don't happen in normal life happen here, but this movie is far more far-fetched than the theories where no child left behind. All these people are in the house and no one has noticed anyone, not to mention the damn owl everywhere, but in his cage. I can handle the owl for the first few times, but after an hour I can't take it. I'd rather kill myself than to see that dam hole again. Did I laugh at this movie? no. Not once? no. Horrible, Horrible, Horrible. The fact that this pile of garbage is cut off with Ashton Kutcher, bends his boss over and takes out his pants all over, making this movie worse. But wait, the day is saved, because the damnil can fly. HAPPINESS! However, I give this movie some faith, it's not as bad as Epic Movie .....
