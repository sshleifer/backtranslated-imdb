Shy young woman, homeschooling and possibly gifted, has a disturbed, exaggerated emotional side that comes to the surface after her absent father visited her mother to ask for divorce. Targeted by celebrated filmmaker William A. Fraker, this bad psychological thriller falls into the trap of filming most of the films by photography directors: each shot is crafted for the ultimate style, but at the sacrifice of liquid speed and a tight , poignant story. Fraker (and his kin, László Kovács) love gauzy whites and golden tones, giving the picture a burnt, tableaux feel. The cottage in the middle of the action looks like a funeral room, and Fraker fits the whistling yarn just like a funeral. Robert Shaw and Sally Kellerman (as Shaw's fiancée), two of the most interesting actors of the 1970s, cut through the plastic cover and forced them despite the turbulent editing (which changed their plays into small pieces of the semi-realized business ). Sondra Locke, another interesting peculiarity, seems to her similarity to Catherine Deneuve in "Repulsion". Pale and saucer eyes, with imposing thick and long hair, Locke is a peculiar human puzzle, and she is initially quite intimidating and dangerous; However, this role is so cute that Locke can't find anything fresh to get out of the freezer, and his flounders. Fraker lets Locke's freak-out screens go and go, while Shaw (remarkably the bonbons look) is placed in the impossible position to feel her. All this nonsense can be worth blowing out if the screenplay is peppered to some degree (or, at least, a dry white or humorous relief). As it is, Lewis John Carlino and Edward Hume's loosehead is adapted from Stanton Forbes's novel, "Go To Your Deathbed", starting the viewer early and only the charisma of the players gets us to the finish line. * 1/2 of ****
