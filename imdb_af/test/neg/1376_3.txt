I just saw most of the series, as I noise the TV as a backdrop in my dorm. <br /> <br /> I was a fan of Mencia, but this show doesn't really work much for me. Sometimes he will say something or do something to pull out, but he has this aura of smugness that completely destroys it. <br /> <br /> I always thought he was funny because of his angry madman routine It's not terribly common in this TV series. Instead, he just walked. I think it reflects just how funny his comedy is: foolish and uninteresting when not in the right mode of delivery. I saw him sometimes go into his performance, but he usually just sat there and smiled and looked, and he didn't fit well. <br /> <br /> Already my opinion is.
