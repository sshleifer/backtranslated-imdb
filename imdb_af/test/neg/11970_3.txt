Jerk hazer Mike (David Zelina plays this college frat man as one big bastard you want to see immediately die) and his colonial colleagues leave hypoglycemic diabetic Sam (Caleb Roehrig) hanging on a wooden cross with this scarecrow who is a legendary ghost story is. They get PO from Sam, who is really shocked and strives for a swaying punch at Mike who has let down his girlfriend Patty (Kristina Sheldon). Somehow, Sam's soul is "brought forth" with the lifeless scarecrow coming out of the cross to destroy all who left the poor guy there. Mike and the gang are sending the untouched villages back to Sam, but they are the first to receive a swinging blade over their throat. Mike and his beach head spit head play volleyball and bump until the scarecrow comes to end their little soiree. Sam's replacement brother Jack (Matthew Linhardt) is supposed to look at him, but decides to replace Beth (Samantha Aisling) with new love interests. So when he received a cellphone message from Mike about leaving Sam while they were on the beach in the sun and sand, Jack was terrified.

There are also some dubbing problems where it is clear that the sounds of their voices often do not match the movements of their lips. In particular, the inadvertently hilarious sequence where Ed (Travis Parker), wannabe rock star, sings his friends a terrible song that they all feel very impressed with.
