The opening scene of the beach at Fircombe, while in itself amusing, unfortunately offers a suitable metaphor for the film - unsatisfactory and rinsed. It's not as critical as most of the others in the Carry On series, but maybe it's not really fun. It is a fair bet that the title will appeal to fans of the Benny Hill show, but those who look for attractive females in bikinis and mini skirts, while watching this, will probably enjoy other titles in the series , like "Wearing Abroad" or "Wearing the Jungle" more. The rise of early 1970's feminism is used as a plot device that looks rather self-defeating.
