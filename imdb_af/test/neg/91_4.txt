Be careful, My Lovely (1952) Dir: Harry Horner <br /> <br /> Production: The Filmmakers / RKO Radio Pictures <br /> <br /> Credible Stress of Pioneering Producer Team Collier Young and Ida Lupino, aka The Filmmakers (with Lupino going in some unknown directions). <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan is the "Danger" and Ida Lupino is the "woman" in this entry into the "Dangerous Woman" movie. Ryan plays Howard Wilton, a tightly wounded psychotic handyman drifter (noooo, Ryan? I know, hard to believe). Lupino is the lonely war widow, Helen Gordon, who adores Howard to do work around her home. Things go down from there as Howard makes Helen a prisoner in her own home. <br /> <br /> Howard has a nasty secret, not that he can reveal it. You see, consciousness is a real challenge for him. Keep it, this is. He has an unfortunate habit of meeting and killing his employers. This is part of the movie's problem. The nature of Howard's psychosis is so extreme that it is almost impossible to believe that he can be released into the village free from the village, even in the year 1918 (when the film was established). He can't remember anything that happened ten minutes ago. His violent, threatening, antisocial tendencies are set apart by the smallest and most common of things (a young girl who flirts, insufficient problems with the war, because he is rejected for service). I don't know how he even made it to the interview with Helen. There are other imperfections. If you are locked up with a man in your home but left for periods on your own, can't you escape a way? <br /> <br /> I think Ryan is defeating the material. It feels as if he is overlaying his hand. His range of ticks and spasms and the dense flushes of dementia all made a leg-there - the robotic feeling for them. At this stage in his career, he probably played this character, to some extent, and showed it. We are encouraged to encourage Howard (I do not) by showing pieces of mankind as he is trapped by a music box in his tracks and relating to a group of children who will not judge him. Lupino should only be deceived and in trouble, which she is more than capable of doing. <br /> <br /> The photo had one thing for it; what would be the ultimate solution to the conflict? So, of course, there was a disappointing end that was sudden and ineffective. <br /> <br /> Light interest was a recurring motif where the camera would detect Howard's reflection (in mirrors, water, Christmas tree decorations). This has indicated that something is going on or going in the head. Horner (1953's Vicki), who made his reputation in product design, does a good job of making the house feel like a prison. Credit also, the always reliable RCO art department for home work. In the end, sub-standard work of principals, which all have much better movies for their credit. <br /> <br /> * Â½ out of 4
