Jon Good's Wife (just one of the worst titles for a movie ever), or The Red Right Hand (another absolutely terrible sounding title that doesn't matter and is not relevant to the movie) under which I saw it, is in Salem, Massachusettes 1978 '(provisionally the year I was born, which was probably the best thing to happen during the 365 days) where five old college friends met for a school meeting, gay-boy bassoon Roger Mather (John Kuntz, who's actually saying it out loud ...), Martha Alden (Kim Brockington), Rebecca Lawson (Jenna Stern) and her boyfriend Jake Stabler (John Doe), Alan Hobbes (Michael Kevin Walker) and his wife Sandy ( Megan Rawa) plus John Good (Marc Ardito, why is the spelling of 'John' different in the title?) And his wife, Sara (Abigail Morgan). From the word there is an awkward tension in the air and when someone calls their 'missing' friend Calef (Jason Winther), there are many unpleasant memories that are flooded. Then come the telephone conversations, the mysterious nosebleed, hallucinations and guilt as the real horror of the events all the years ago, finally come to light ... <br /> <br /> Produced, executed by Kurt Gioscia also the thing wrote & Kurt St. Thomas, who also gets the art credit, and if that wasn't enough, they both got in the movie! Personally, I thought Jon Good's Wife was terrible, I mean she can't cook or anything! Ha ha, not joke! Although I didn't think much of the movie overall, for a start it is very slow and the first 30 minutes are solid sneakers of the reunion consisting of many catching with each other and dull character building exposition. The film never explains itself, how about the strange nosebleed for the sake of God, the mysterious calls, the almost inconspicuous death of one of the group who may or may not be natural She comes across as some nosie, sex crazy, dirty Speaking, shameless, bitter extortion knows it all whore who apparently sleeps with just about every man she meets! Some of the dialogue she spits will not be in a porn and it just seems to be at odds with the rest of the movie playing more like a drama than the horror / thriller it was supposed to be. Then there is the end, if there is a worse way to end a movie, then just literally keep everything in the air without closing, which I still have to see. The whole thing was also very predictable, and I mean, is someone who sees it, will not know that when they all call their friend, Calef "was missing," wouldn't it be? <br /> <br /> Directors Gioscia & Thomas make a special movie, beyond the predictability and annoying climax, there is a retrospective story by Alan that I simply don't understand because he no longer has or less meaning than anyone else and at what time does he tell? The reasons for this narrative are never made or worked out. There is no tension, because the whole thing is so close to the numbers. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is OK, but nothing special and some of the places and clothes don't look so real to me, it never convinced me. This happened during the late 70's. The act was good and what about actor John Kuntz's name? I suspect that if his wife were standing next to him, we could describe them as some Kuntz, right? <br /> <br /> I really didn't think much of Jon Good's Wife (an inflatable doll would have been better! Ha ha ha) and I'm not sure who will address it. Forget about any gore, horror, violence, fear, atmosphere or excitement, really forget about everything this movie could see, because it's not here. Not recommended.
