I rented Dark Harvest (the first one) because it looked like a cheesy monster-on-the-box type of excitement. Scarecrow also touches me. The movie had an effective title series, but it became quite lame (flat, bad lighting, acting, editing, direction ...). Recently I noticed that DH 2: The Maize had a fairly extensive advertising campaign. I thought maybe the first one was slightly successful, so they built up the ants on this one, which could possibly cause bigger budget issues and fx of the killer terrorists. Well, there's no scarecrow in the video ... Not a problem. The problems begin in DH 2 with a title series that looks like an unfinished concept, with strange shapes and bars wiping titles and what isn't. As for real photography, every time the sun shines in a shot, you want to wipe out all those white ones, and confirm that you are looking at an ultra-low budget mini DV project that some Midwestern filmed. farm. The acting didn't work at all. The cheap finishing of The Shining twin girls was under US film student standards. The editing was extremely amateur and lazy. The sound was crisp and handsome. (eg every time the editor cut to a new shot, you want the sound change perspective with it). It is as if someone has been gathering their friends and family (actors) for three days, taking out a video camera for three days in a wheat field, putting a light on the roof for the night scenes (no joke - this is what they actually did) stick the wallpaper in their computer, cut a (very) rough version, throw it into some music, pass any imaginative sound work or mix, burn it directly to DVD and throw it on the video store shelf. Any horror fan must be insulted by this type directly to video work that is invalid of any skill or style. Just because a person owns a video camera and is able to get some image on tape doesn't mean it should be made public. If I could give it a rating lower than a ONE, I would.
