I saw it on the shelves at the rental site and I rented everything else so I said why. Why not because it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It seems to have been shot with the home camcorder. I think that's all the budget will allow. There were fewer boobs in it than I thought it would be. Some people made it out as soft porn with a few murders. The funniest part of the whole movie is in the extra stuff. There is a place with deleted scenes. Well, there's only one, but it's the stupid one and I think it might have dropped the rest of the movie. The girls come in a whirlpool and find chocolate syrup in the bathroom. Yes it all ends up over them. Good stuff !!! This movie is very bad. Don't bother.
