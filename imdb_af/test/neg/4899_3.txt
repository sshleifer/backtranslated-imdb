It's a shame. Barry Humphries' notorious Sir Les Patterson character had it in his boiled spy / comedy. This film reminded me of the Beatty / Hoffman stinker, Ishtar (1987). Humphries had to learn about the mistakes the movie made - if you were going to change gears on a concept, DO NOT USE SPEAKS! Like Ishtar, the first 20 minutes or so offer something different. It would have been great to see the anachronistic and native Patterson moving around the world of Australian politics. One of the characters even points out that Patterson is from the present time - you think Humphires can make a field day commenting on the Hawke government (I can only make a scene with Patterson and Hawkie in a drinking game) . But instead of a movie that may be clever and even a biting look in the world, we get Patterson to run the world, as James Bond is trying to save the world from bio-chemical weapons running out of steam the halfway. <br /> <br /> Disappointing.
