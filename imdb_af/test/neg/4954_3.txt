Although a fan of shock and gore, I found this movie disappointing to say the least. The effects and puppetwork were impressive, yes, and the humor went well, but ... something was missing. Look, the first act of the film is spent determining nuances of Jack Brooks's character, despite the fact that everything we need to know about his aggression is delivered within minutes of the first title cards. As for the narrative and lots of flashbacks: unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The pacing during the second act was annoying. Most of them are focused on Freddy Krueger who eats, then vomits, then eats a little, then flames his arms and says something funny or rude. All the time the schlock is played with short screens from Jack who discuss his anger problems with a therapist. (Definitely the entertaining scenes in the film - excellent dialogue worthy of many believers.) Then Jack decides to kill some monsters. And then it's over. <br /> <br /> All in all, as a setback to the 1980s horror movies, Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer has a lot of potential, but it is aimless and is without conflict or resolution. <br /> <br /> Hopefully these issues will be addressed before Jack Brooks VII: Jack Goes to Hell or Jack vs Ash are in production.
