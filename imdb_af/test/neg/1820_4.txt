It's not easy to find Judas Kiss on VHS (it's not available on DVD), but I wanted to add this rather obscure movie to my Alan Rickman movie collection. <br /> <br /> I can't understand how the talented Mr. . Rickman gets into these mediocre movies? Judas Kiss boasts several wonderful actors, an interesting plot and intriguing twists, but has ruined his strange visual walks and cut editing that could be a great crime drama. Many scenes seem to lack important information to explain the character's actions: Why was our hero immediately suspicious of his boss? Why did he trust the detective he replaced? There were times when I honestly could not say whether the director Judas Kiss intended to be a legal crime drama or a camp spoof. Why would he throw in the topless / alien / lesbian porn scene for the first two minutes (that little surprise definitely hurt me for the remote because my kids were close!)? Did he instruct his two leading English actors (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson) to use such terrible New Orleans accents? Like an Alan Freak, I confess that I still thought Mr Rickman was sexy: in a tattered, tired, "take-him-home-and-tik-him-in" kind. <br /> <br /> Judas Kiss is not a good movie, but it has some interesting moments, but I don't recommend it unless you try to immerse yourself in Alan Rickman.
