The best part in this movie is the first one located in Sicily. Crialese shows a good talent for photography and the movie is amazingly surprising. The rest of the story is rather boring. Crialese insists on stereotypical situations and characters, and tries to melt neo-realistic suggestions and video music technique, Fellinian surrealistic memories and a very annoying and completely out-of-sound track, leading the whole thing to a halt, which makes you feel give an overly long story cut short cut. Frankly, it is a true over-rated movie and Crialese is a real over-the-top director.
