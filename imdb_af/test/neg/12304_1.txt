An absolute horrible adaptation of the wonderful children's book. Raw and inappropriate humor, some terrible parts and a sickly story about the mother's boyfriend who wants to send the boy to the military school to get him out of the way makes it totally inappropriate for the kids who are likely to see it because of the book (3-8) years old. Don't waste your money, your time or your good judgment.
