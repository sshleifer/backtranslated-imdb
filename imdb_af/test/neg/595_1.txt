Let's see that cardboard characters such as Muslim terrorists have forced a cardboard scientist to do some exotic drug tests on some carton people who have been covered and kidnapped. You will surely laugh if these pathetic excuses for humanoids get their net deserts! It turns out the drug experiments have given them the ability to recognize another world .... the world of religious fantasy! - Complete with cardboard demons that seem to be made from Paper Mache. Everyone is dragged to hell, except for a poor shit going to heaven where he can probably spend eternity with the blockheads that created this Masterpiece of Absurd. I think I'll pick myself up for Hellfire. Go see something else, unless you are stoned, in which case, you can actually find it! Can't get hurt!
