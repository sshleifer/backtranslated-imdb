I really don't see how anyone can enjoy this movie. I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as sowing like this slumbering piece of junk. It would probably have been better if the director did not spend most of the movie, but showing his own artwork, which is not so significant. Another thing I didn't really like is when a character is hit in the face, a liter of blood will soon emerge. I don't know how people are blooming there in Japan, but I hope they have a lot of blood donors.
