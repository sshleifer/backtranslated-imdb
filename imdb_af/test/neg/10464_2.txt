Well, I'll probably agree with all the bad comments about this movie. Honestly, I thought it was such a piece of crap. I think the actors did a terrible play and the script was all terrible. Although the special effects weren't a bit bad, but I think it had to be thought much harder than that. I mean, how did Clara Bryant play successfully in this movie, I mean she would do much better if she looked a little further and it is the same with Kristen's treasure, I mean her character dies and she doesn't bother trying to defend herself, I mean it should be a total joke. She must at least do much better than she does, become a soldier or more of a heroine or something like bravery. But the point is that the actors did a complete, rare, crazy job and so did the director and writer who made this film. they had to go to the film school to devise better ideas and I hope everyone agrees with my methods because they probably think the same thing.
