and totally non-scary movie. The characters don't matter, and most of the time is spent in a car. The dog is at best ugly, never really scary. To have interest, a more threatening threat would have been needed, at least a few people you care about and some emotions in your call. And not least, something interesting should happen. Something unexpected. As it is, this movie just pulls on and off, which looks like forever. Perhaps a Saint Bernhard was not so smart to choose as the Terrible Threat to Life and Society? <br /> <br /> In most scary movies / thrillers / mystery, just what genre, there must be characters that interest and make you want to know what's happening. You don't mind, you just wait for everything to stop, and wonder if it would be better to see something else. One of the worst King adjustments.
