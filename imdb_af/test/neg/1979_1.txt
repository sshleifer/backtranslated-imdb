Final Fantasy: Advent Children is and will remain a classic example of style over the content that went wrong. Instead of drawing on the unforgettable characters and fascinating mythology of the original game, Square Enix chose a frivolous fitting of incomprehensible combat scene. Yes, I said "incomprehensible." Did you know that Tifa knows how fast Kung Fu techniques shine, which can shift the camera angle every time? That cloud can easily suspend itself in the middle for a full minute while swinging with its 2-ton sword? The English dub is mediocre. Although it's not really bad, it's far from well-produced. The quality is comparable to that of an average anime dub. <br /> <br /> Here's what I'd like to say to the mortal FFVII fans who don't stop talking about this movie: Advent Children is the best fan service you could expect from Square Enix, but even A trashy CG flick like Galerians: Rion had a better story. You will be embarrassed by this movie and its lack of thought at the right time. The days of his novelty are numbered. <br /> <br /> Movies like Advent Children let me ask if Square Enix recognizes the potential of its franchises. After all (and no offense), it's a Japanese company. Japanese developers can deliver fun games, but most of their offers are disappointing. However, they are absolutely psychoscopic when it comes to the quality of production. Advent Children has some of the most spectacular deliveries in CG history, but it does not save its intricate plot and cardboard characters. <br /> <br /> Any fan who followed this movie knows Sephiroth is coming back. The above story to accommodate his resurrection was a big mistake. NOTE: The one point I give to this movie is in honor of the 10,000 addicted Japanese animators who gave their lives to deliver every bleached blonde hair. on cloud's slight caucasian head.
