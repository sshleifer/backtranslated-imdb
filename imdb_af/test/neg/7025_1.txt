Until 1970, Lucille Ball was a great comedy. She was such a perfect clown I just wish more people could have seen her with Bob Hope in "The Facts of Life" because she could also do a dry deadpan. as well as slapstick .. <br /> Yes, Lucille Ball was great. . . to "Mame." <br /> <br /> Trying to see Lucille Ball in Mame is physically impossible as there is so much Vaseline on the already filtered lenses that you need Windex to see Lucille Ball in some scenes. So even if you see Lucille Ball in "Mame", you can't really see Lucille Ball in "Mame". It's a blessing. <br /> <br /> It's about the most beautiful thing I can say about Mame, the movie of the play's musical (but it has started with a very funny book called "Auntie Mame") . To give it a bad rap is like beating a sponge. So it doesn't matter that the music is singing rather than singing. Most of the songs were not much anyway. There is no difference in the first three. "It's today," "Open a new window," and "We have a little Christmas" are all the same song. Celene Dion has to do an album with them, they are so big and boring. The killer ballad "If He Gone In My Life Today" needs a confidence, a wonderful voice. (Edyie Gorme won a Grammy to do so in 1967) which Lucie Ball did not own when making this movie. (True, Elaine Stritch also can't carry a lean in a bucket, but Stritch can at least transmit a song.) <br /> <br /> If you still feel, your life won't be complete unless you watch the movie music "Mame", watch how it is dancing, but when Lucy / Mame starts doing anything other than a palsied shuffle, cut the camera away, return right when the number is over and the star stands at the dancers. Again, this is just as good. Jane Connell took back the role of pathetic Agnes Gooch after Lucille Ball fired Madeline Kahn to ensure no comic originality would rise the star. Connell is a stage artist who, like Carol Channing and Ethyl Merman, can't scale down her film performances, so joins Lucille Ball to be embarrassing, but for different reasons. <br /> <br /> The cute gowns are by Theadora Van Runkle (From Wrinkle?) and they provide the color in all but one of the cast. <br /> <br /> Bea Arthur as actress Vera Charles, Mame's best friend, ignores everyone and does her own fun thing. If she was just in more scenes. She is also too old for her role, but at least she did not mutilate it.
