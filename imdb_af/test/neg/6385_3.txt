Well ..... horror it is, but ....... !!! ??? A terribly low low budget backwood movie of the worst kind, kind of ... so very charming and funny to watch ... at least on my TV set !!! A cross between Pete Walker, Herschell Gordon Lewis and ... say .... damn, I give up ... just can't get a "finer" deal for this turbulent movie. Everything is so wrong that I just have to buy it in my movie collection with .... Death In Venice ..... Nekromantik ..... Blue Velvet and the good, bad, ugly ... right !! ?? People with a little bit of talent for adding gory inserts or sexy movies to movie, they buy other people, should upload this movie right away. It's probably a fat lol 'o' gold mine waiting here, oh maaaannnn !!!!!
