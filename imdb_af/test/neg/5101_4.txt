It's the 1990's TV show, not the 1979 movie. It seems to be three episodes that are just under 90 minutes. When I looked, I thought it was one of the movie performances, and I noticed immediately that it was a TV show. Feel I just felt that the story wasn't there, and there wasn't much in the way of excitement or drama. I watched the time that went on my DVD player regularly, as I was really bored. I also thought some of the dialogue was to make it polite, not good.plus, I thought the scene left a lot to be desired. but it's just me, it's good clean, healthy family entertainment. There is definitely nothing offensive here. Children will probably enjoy it. For me, the Black Stallion is 4/10
