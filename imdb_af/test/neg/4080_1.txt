Was it supposed to be funny? It's one of those movies that just doesn't work. The first one, Bruce Almighty with Jim Carey, had some very funny moments. This one had nothing. <br /> <br /> Steve Carrell, who was brilliant at Bruce Almighty, failed to deliver here. His performance is very common and he can't pay off like Carey did. <br /> <br /> The one good thing about this is that I only paid $ 1.95 to rent it. It is a movie for children ... very young children who only saw about 4 movies in their short lives. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that where Jim Carey is a movie star and a sequel without him, it's usually a big turkey. Anyone remember Son of Mask? (IMDB Worst 100 Movies of All Time) Avoid these one movie lovers.
