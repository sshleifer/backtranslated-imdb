I saw graves years ago, and it was one of those movies that I kept in mind for a long time. It was intense from start to finish and with very sudden turns. But all this made sense. <br /> <br /> I can't tell the same about Dead Bodies. Above the title is a subtitle that claims to be "even better than the ordinary grave". It's a big lie. <br /> <br /> Dead bodies lose power and become much less convincing during the movie. <br /> <br /> Two supporting characters, for example, seem to be far less innocent. as they once seemed. It can work as a surprise, but it didn't surprise me. I can only see it a few minutes before, and * it's * a big difference with Shallow Grave. <br /> <br /> Another thing I need to mention is that characters in this movie don't respond very realistically. They act so often when the movie ends. <br /> <br /> I would have found it more interesting if some of the characters remained completely innocent without knowing what was going on. It would have been better for the contrast with, for example, Tommy and his friend who have a great secret with them. <br /> <br /> But for some stupid reason, the makers of this movie have decided that all characters should show their darkest sides. It doesn't work in a movie like this. <br /> <br /> The end feels very much like an open end. It left me with a dissatisfied feeling. I expected a lot more from it. <br /> <br /> Initially, I would have given this movie six stars because it is not quite a bad movie. I liked to see it. Most of the time. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, though, I have seen some poor acting and unrealistic scenes and because of the disappointing open end, this time I keep four stars. And because it was a mistake, I spent my time and money on it. Unlike the coarse grave, I will soon forget Death Bodies. It's just not such a special movie. <br /> <br /> The creators could have done a much better job with this movie. It's a pity they didn't.
