Cobb. It sucked. I didn't learn anything from the man I hadn't heard yet. The performances were on top. A place where Cobb and Al are driving a snowy road looking for women in Reno must be one of the worst imaginary scenes in recent memory. It is simply STUPID and unattractive. The flashback sequence was terrible. And they used the same series over and over. If I had Cobb's second shot with somebody on a basis, I would have been physically ill. Watching this movie teaches us nothing about what it was like in Cobb's era. We learn nothing about his relationship with his players, nothing of his days as a manager, nothing of his relationship with his relatives except they don't like him. I thought when I sat down to watch this movie, I would just learn about the era of baseball in which Cobb played. Instead, all I had to see was a repeat of how Cobb hated everything and everyone and how they hated him. Son, what a wonderful movie (sarcasm meant). Cobb is portrayed as a constant liar in the film, so which one of his stories should be accurate? Who knows? Who cares? No one will look at this piece of crazy. If you decide to rent this movie, make sure the quick button on your video recorder works because you will be prompted to use it repeatedly. Hopefully somebody will make a good movie about Ty Cobb someday. I like this movie about as much as the people in it hold Cobb, who says - I hated it. Now I know why I found it in the RENT ONE GET ONE FREE section of the video store. I think I'll ask my fifty cents back from the video clerk, as I can't get the time I wasted to watch this garbage. Oh well, what I might have thought of a movie that Robert Wuhl would entail.
