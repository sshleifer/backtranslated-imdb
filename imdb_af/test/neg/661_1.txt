OK, we can start with the best. the building. Although it was difficult to believe, it had electricity and running water after 35 years, and was interesting because of a fire, the gruesome walls and strange objects. Other than that, it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> As far as the bad, it is done by WWE movies. WTF? Is it supposed to see it? If anything, stay away. Terrible, horrible idea for them to make movies and lead Gregory Dark. bad choice. the previews were previously interesting and entertaining. <br /> <br /> I can't even begin to discuss how bad this movie is. undisputed actors and a disappointing, vague storyline. apparently many of the actors from the show are "all saints". It's a wonder why I've never heard of them or their performance. Other than that, the bus driver you've never seen before, just the one who closes the door, had more action just to get around. at least he handles stunts for some decent movies. <br /> <br /> I like scary movies, I really do. but this one blew so much, the whole audience laughed at it and halfway through the characters. very irritating. The child behind me shouted more during the previews of other horror films. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie to watch, even less if you have to pay for it.
