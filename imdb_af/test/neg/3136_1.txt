For those who compared this TRASH to the glamor of David Lynch, etc. ... please listen to your caregiver when they say ... Don't use other people's computer without their permission! <br /> <br /> This is completely and UTTER POO! There is NO art here. It is someone trying to make a name for himself with some brutal ideas that he was not smart enough to enforce in ONE main idea. Instead, he went the easy way. <br /> <br /> Anyone with half a brain can sit at home and watch some controversial images shocking viewers, but it requires a person with real imagination to make it into a movie. <br /> <br /> I'm a LOVER of shock bios. I saw OWN, actually everything you can get ... And I strongly recommend everyone who likes the world of movies to manage this garbage. <br /> <br /> This one is ONLY for people who like to analyze what they're watching, or for the 17-year-old first-time drinkers who don't know better. <br /> <br /> 0/10! <br /> <br />
