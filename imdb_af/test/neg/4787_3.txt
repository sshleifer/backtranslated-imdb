After I could ignore the hype about the show, I started the season one and it struck me so well and I was addicted. For about 5 episodes, it started spiraling downwards. Why? First, Ethan Suplee was written to act as a complete idiot. This, of course, confirms this by spreading semi-random things in great expectations that it somehow becomes the next best joke. <br /> <br /> Jaime Pressly has a beautiful view, but if she thinks her lips stretch to examine parts of the face they normally never go and make strange grim to emphasize what she says, is hilarious, she is planning. Maybe she thought her character would be too flat, faded and she wanted to make it colorful and spicy, but made a flood of colors, left over spices and screamed loudly for attention and it hurt my eyes, ears and intellect. <Br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this show, as I said, the point of departure is great (come from the same shelf as The Fabulous Destiny by Amelie Poulain) and Jason Lee does a good job here. with some of the other actors, but there is no way I would suck in and forget that it is just a show, because Pressly's and Suplee's surreal, extreme characters suddenly wake me up when they arrive. It is important to note that their characters and acting will be good if it wasn't a 70-part series and if they didn't have that much screenplay time.
