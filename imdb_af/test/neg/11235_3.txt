So when Bob and Marion Boxletter see a man at a hotel, Marion believes it is her lost brother, Brian, but if she approaches him, it looks like he is someone else, just with the same face. Marion manages his fingerprints and takes them to the police and when the identity is confirmed it is actually leaving her brother, Brian, and Bob, to New York after finding his place. They get a grip of Brian, but still he doesn't know what they're talking about, but all the couples really want to know is where Brian has their 8-year-old son Joey. And even when they see Joey, he doesn't know them either. The plot thickens and they find them one day and think they are somebody else. Experiments just made to make the perfect killers are the question why they would bother Bob and Marion in the same building as each other, is outside of me. Personally, Gregory Harrison played his 2 parts well, but I have no idea what was wrong with the other actors, they were bored and lost. 3 out of 10, a little stress yes but that's it.
