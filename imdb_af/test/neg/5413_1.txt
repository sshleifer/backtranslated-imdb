Wow, where to start with this one. Well, if you enjoy laughing at the total failures of filmmakers, then this one is for you. I bought this movie for $ 5 because I never got the opportunity to laugh at B-movie God Casper Van Dien's blunders, and the boy was this one. It may have been enough that this movie ever contains the single lame film sample. This thing, which is supposed to be an Indian ghost, looks more like a plastic candy skeleton that you put on your front door on Halloween. He down a bonnet that is apparently a rubbish bag, complete with what apparently is a bucket-shaped bonnet over his head. On some points it is a man in costume. In others, it is clearly a plastic strut placed on top of a horse. This monster has the incredible ability to see with a "predator" vision, a clear rip-off, and may appear miraculous after throwing its spear. Sometimes the spear cuts people, sometimes it doesn't happen. This thing also manages a helicopter with a single arrow. Wow, it makes a lot of sense as if the child inflates a spaceship with a firewall at the end of the "Critters". This creature is impenetrable to bullets, but somehow dies at the end of the movie. At the end of his deadly spree, which we never really find out why he is, he is inflated. It's an incredible achievement because we've seen it in the movie three times. But I think this last time was the charm. <br /> <br /> Don't even let me start on the cowardice of the other characters. First of all, what Delta Force unit does women use? Lastly, I checked the military, leaving women still in combat situations. This unit is also "sheltered". Why? What possible reason should they be sheltered? And they aren't even good at it, I think no one will realize they were military if they didn't have uniforms, BUT THIS IS ALL TURN MACHINE GUNS (which at times sounds sound effects throughout the film, sounds like some air rifles BB guns, and at other guns). There is one part when the Skeleton throws some builders of a catwalk, and you can clearly see the path they fall on. At another point. Michael Rooker falls down on a hill that is clearly flat. They tilted the camera slightly to make the appearance of a slope look, but he clearly pushed him into this looooooonnnnnggggggg fall scene. Then, when he is brought back the hill, the rope is flat, and when it shows the woman at the top of the "hill," the rope goes up from her grip, not as it would if she didn't pull someone up " a hill. Rooker actually has a line that says, "I'm not going after him, I'll go after it." What? This is probably the dumbest thing I've ever heard, and I look at these bad movies as a hobby. The saddest part of this quote is that you can say that everyone involved in the writing / production of this movie thought it was so bad-ass. Believe it or not, compared to the rest of the dialogue, it's good. <br /> <br /> The acting, bad. The makeup, really bad. These characters also had lesions or wounds that wanted to change their face. Maybe it's alien scars running around on your face. Yes, I think I'll make a movie about it, "Attack of the Alien Scars moving around on your face." That villain would be more intimidating than the Skeleton, and the movie would probably be scarcer.
