It's amazing that this non-talent actor Chapa has all these famous stars to appear in this dull, pathetic, chaotic and oblong film about a low-life gangster who looks white but half Mexican, much of the acting bad and many of the well-known stars in this trashy movie are given a screenplay that seems to exist through a 16-year-old. I'm sure this movie is the lower point for actors like Dunaway, Wagner, Keach, Tilly and Busey, which I'm sure very shy about having ever appeared in this turkey's movie. I doubt many people have ever heard of Chapa and after this terrible movie I am sure he will disappear into oblivion where he belongs.
