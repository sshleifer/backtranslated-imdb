*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** What's happening here? <br /> <br /> Barbara Hershey, definitely look unsexy - as if she stole her grandmother's sparrow - put an unconvincing performance If a woman killing a man's wife, she has a relationship with " self-defense 'after she hit her with an ax forty times. <br /> <br /> Like Lizzy Borden, she was acquitted, but the most unconvincing argument ever presented to a jury by the representative of a so-called "innocent" defendant I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Lizzy Borden took an ax and gave her father forty chicks. When she saw what she was doing - she pleaded with self-defense <br /> <br /> I don't think so <br /> <br /> I find the defendants guilty of displaying an unconvincing representation and no choice other than to award this film a 4-sentence of 10 (which would be lower than the previous good behavior of some of the people involved) <br /> <br />
