Well, what can be said about a "horror comedy" that doesn't contain horror or comedy? There are no characters in the movie, but too many plot lines - everything underdeveloped and mostly redundant. <br /> <br /> The computer-generated creatures look bad, a bit like Disney versions of big rats without a tail. The undead is the biggest rip-off, apart from the title, it will look like death in Landis's movie, but is far removed. They look just like bad actors with an abstract plastic and a bull's blood. <br /> <br /> Two plot lines really showed a few promises (the love story and the "company" story), but failed like the director, the writers, the SFX department, the production and the actors.
