Author-director Patrice Leconte takes a universal and potentially bottomless topic - friendship - and turns it into a flat and meaningless farce, despite A-list actors, fine cinematography and elegant production design. It's all in the plot, and the plot is laughing. "Teach me how to be fun", an artist François Coste (Daniel Auteuil) tells a random stranger (Dany Boon), and summarizes it. We learn nothing about friendship, and Daniel Auteuil can be a good actor, but not one minute, we believe he can be the throat, even the script depends on him. Just as we hope the travesty is over, Leconte draws one of his usual cathartic third acts, quickly ahead of damage to disaster. Like François' treasured Greek vase, everyone and everything in this movie is a fake. Leconte's only asset is Julie Gayet, part of Coste's business partner Catherine. He looks swelling and sexy, despite a huge haircut.
