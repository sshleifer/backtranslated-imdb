Jessica is a young, virgin and very innocent girl who lives with her aunt on a remote farm. Jessica is also a powerful psychic, capable of dowsing, retro cognition, precognition and esp. When visiting young and handsome Gordon Hawthorne, he is immediately skeptical about Jessica's powers ... until her skills uncover a lost wristwatch and discover an old treasure chest. However, the treasure chest holds the cut off head of an ancient dead satanist named Gideon Drew, whose forces are much stronger than Jessica. Despite her warnings of evil in their midst, Drew mentally enslaved everyone uncomfortably to make eye contact with him. But Drew wants most of Jessica. He needs her dowsing skills to discover his body, so that he can rise from the dead and rule over humanity. Will Jessica's powerful fleur de lis, combined with Gordon's love, avert the old evil before it can destroy them all? <br /> <br /> It's not a very interesting movie. It could have been - the basic story is interesting and imaginative, but the play is loaded and the whole thing moves too slowly to keep interest. Jessica is too innocent - almost annoying, and Gordon's love interest is wood, stiff and completely emotional. None of the characters are very nice, and the low budget is painfully obvious. A rushed end doesn't matter either. Avoid it unless it's the MST3K version.
