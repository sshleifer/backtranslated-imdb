Bog Creatures shows exactly what can happen when many enthusiastic people come together with a little cash, a little knowledge of film making, a mixed bag of aspiring actors and a lot of determination, but all without the necessary knowledge and skills to pull something more as a reasonably poor search for school special (in a bad way, not a nostalgic good way). I mean it's so-so quality home movie / student movie stuff if you want to give it around to family and friends for free. Luckily I found it somewhere in a boot. Sure, there may be some sort of market out there for this kind of thing, but it's a market that's just plain default, as there are so many poor B movies out there. Even more so now in this day and age. <br /> <br /> The only people I recommend this move are aspiring guerrilla filmmakers. First, I recommend watching the special feature of the thing included on the disc. See the movie teams enthusiasm, their hard work, joy, and very high opinions of their own product. Then look at the movie. Within a few frames you will hopefully understand what went wrong. Bored, I went through the whole thing and clearly tried the director and filmographer but didn't know enough about what they were doing. They knew enough to have fun, but in the long run, without the necessary skills, interpreting it: They knew enough to be dangerous. It's like a bad Nickelodeon movie (as applied to a more decent one I think). A few of the actors did well, and the cool stoner who tattooed (real or fake tattoo I don't know) was probably the best and most natural and I hope he makes it. But their natural acting talent was what came through despite the bad movie, bad writing and so-ruling principles. If the director spent more time helping these aspiring actors develop their characters, they studied successful proven camera techniques and lighting principles to better manage their crew, and if the writing actually worked instead of in a Written this week or so (according to the very indulgent documentary) it may be more of a movie. Instead, it's a movie that has a sense of potential, and has a few moments in it (more than the genre than the movie itself), but ends with almost every frame that doesn't. If you want to see how a decent low budget horror movie really looks, watch Phantasm or even Laserblast. If you want a glorified home movie (no joke), get Bog Creatures.
