I rented this movie after Chris Gore heard something about "five stars!" on that show of show show. Well, when I turned around the DVD and showed it the 3 phases of hell, I had to buy it. Just to scream the spectacle of a mother shouting her son to drop her other son into a flaming pit. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect ECW or CZW for an hour and eighteen minutes, but I expected at least a summary of what was the main highlight of this movie. Well, unfortunately there was nothing like that. The 3 stages of the death section happen right from the start, and it is quite downhill from there. Nothing really happens in this documentary. It was pretty raw, bare and unbiased. Not a bad thing, but there is a narrator in this one. You will expect him to have opinions on the subject of this documentary, but he does not. It would be nice to have a message or reason for this document. There was no real reason to have a narrator, but only text explaining some of the less obvious scenes. <br /> <br /> Do not really explain the lives of these wrestlers. It shows a few moments of some dramatic scenes, which are interesting, but the reality is not as big as it sounds. For example, mom looks at her son and pushes with light bulbs and stickers, for the first time, at a public park. Instead of seeing her reaction to the wrestling, they show her responding to the camera, rather than giving an interview later, or just to see her reactions. <br /> <br /> Show legitimacy document, this one is not. The source material was thin to begin with. Nothing really deep or interesting really happens. No conclusion to some of the more interesting stories. No real point or final thought to backyard wrestling, badly edited together, and she and it's basically a cheap, failed frost of Beyond the Mat. <br /> <br /> Show wrestling, it's pretty boring. The better bumps are at the beginning and are becoming less amazing and shocking. If you've seen Japanese wrestling, Indie wrestling, or even Backyard Wrestling DVDs, if it won't be shocking and awe. If you want to struggle, don't make the same mistake I did and see this one. Get some CZW ECW or XPW Dvds. <br /> <br /> The only thing I got from this documentary was how stupid people can be. Not for the support of self-mutilation or dangerous stunts, but their reasoning for committing these acts. The backyard looks stupid to struggle. Most of them are unemployed, and probably some problems in their minds, and wrestling is a kind of therapy for them. Then the fans seem even more idiotic. Mothers basically take the whole "if you can't beat," they say. They have to fix themselves to kill themselves. School government figures support their students in their dangerous stunts because it is an alternative to joining gangs and reducing drugs. It's a bit funny, as the segment has been in a rural town where people live like 20 miles apart. People are stupid. This is what I have withdrawn from this documentary. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the reasoning and thoughts for someone who wrestles themselves and basically promises the back of this DVD, UNSCARRED gets the life of Nick Mondo. It's more wonderful, and interesting than the backyard, and much more entertaining. Oh and this is actually good.
