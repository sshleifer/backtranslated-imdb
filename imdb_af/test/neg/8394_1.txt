When my GF and I were going to watch this movie, we didn't know what to expect, but she assured me it had good reviews. So I went with it. We bought in the theater and bought tickets and went into the screen. After a while, waiting for the movie to start, no one else walked through the door. I was very suspicious because you usually get a few more people in any movie screen. The movie finally started and we sat there. After a while of very little dialogue and many "arty" type of moody scenes, I began to realize why we were the only people. It was incompatible with random cuts of the main story to children in a skate park, the story itself makes no sense. The child was meant to commit a crime when he did not. If he did, it's not an answer and you shouldn't feel guilty just because you wrote the letter. He had to be punished. There was nothing like this movie. I have no idea why we were not going to get our money back, part of the road through the movie. I tried to give it a chance I think. There was little concept for this movie, and the performance was shameful. The author and director, and just about all who made this film, had to realize what they did and stopped. It's an hour plus that I'll never ever come back. I'm sorry for anyone who likes this movie, but ... it's just so terrible, I really mean really bad. Oh, at least, I should never undergo it again.
