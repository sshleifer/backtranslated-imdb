Although it's better than most made-to-TV movies, "Bury Alive" is nothing more than a revenge story. There are so many plot holes in this one, it makes you wonder why scriptwriters don't write a series of revisions. The end has a good twist on it, but it's hardly credible. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Jason Leigh's acting is awesome, as always, but Tim Matheson puts it up with cheese-like one-liners that remind Nicholson of "The Shining". Don't save with this one.
