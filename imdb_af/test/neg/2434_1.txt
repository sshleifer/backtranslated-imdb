I think it was a terrible mistake on Disney's part. First, Kuzco must NOT pass "emperor school" to become emperor! It never happened. Second, the new voices don't sound like the original ones. Very poorly repeated. And while I loved the movie The Emperor's New Groove, the New School is just stupid. Like all the jokes is the same, and much of the movie. The plot is redundant, always Yzma (is that how you play it)? Try to become emperor, Kuzco stops her, etc. Or Kuzco learns to become a better person. I think Kuzco gets annoying with his constant complaints and questions. He's a spoil and it bothers me. I don't think it's five minutes of your time, much less than half an hour.
