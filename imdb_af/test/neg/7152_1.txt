If this movie comes to a theater near you, consider it a threat. I was unhappy enough to see this movie here in Tokyo. Since being Dutch, I was surprised to play a Dutch film in a metropolis such as Tokyo. I thought it should be somebody's special when a Dutch movie made it to Japan. So I went with friends, and fortunately we told the theater staff that we were Dutch and that we were so curious about the movie. As it turned out, it was one of the most infantile, stupid, stupid, worst-performing, with the worst-spoken English movie I've seen in maybe 10 years. I left the theater to avoid the staff because I almost felt responsible for this disaster movie. Sometimes you get the feeling that you know what the director is aiming for: Lola Rennt, Trainspotting kind of similar movie. Instead, it was more like MacGyver on drugs with outdated breakbeat music than a score. But if I wasn't too annoyed, the movie was inadvertently hilarious, as it showed Holland at its smallest.
