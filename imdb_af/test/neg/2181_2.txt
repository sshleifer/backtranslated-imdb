I bought this video at a video table showdown and expect a good role in what is considered an award-winning Brit sex comedy. I think I had to read the finer pressure. I seldom write a panning review, but go here. <br /> <br /> These actors in gay roles really play games with your memories of many more worthy movies. This comedy was a very cruel joke at the expense of the actors, the public and all the nice films that contributed to their reputation. <br /> <br /> I repeat: is the joke about the actors' Other highly respectable screeners with this shrill trashy flick? Can the reference to the Austen classic "Pride and Prejudice" and "Sense and Sensibility" be anything else? How much of a political statement was it to make these melodramas using these stars? Are we meant to simply accept it as a gap that all actors are gay and therefore affect their role-plays on the screen, affecting our way of life, do we accept their private homosexual relationships in our faces? I'm sorry, but I don't think so. I say NO to this one.
