I didn't see this movie when it originally came out, but there were some songs that shared the title and the term is still used from time to time. I thought there should be something to the flick, so I dug it up and gave it a view. Now I would like to get the estimated hours and forty-five minutes of my life back (it was much longer). There was nothing special about the movie, the acting was good, no big plot holes, of course there wasn't much plot to have holes. There wasn't much to the movie. There was some chemistry between the two, but nothing was compelling about their relationship; Nothing interesting about their story. Near the end when he was trying to catch the train to catch his fleeting romance, my wife didn't want me to catch him either. Honestly we thought they were better off with each other and if they came back together, we didn't really care. So what does this say about this love story when even a 25 year old juicy romantic like my wife had no emotional investment in the relationship. I had to leave this one in the "missed" category. <br /> <br /> Logan Lamech www.eloquentbooks.com/LingeringPoets.html
