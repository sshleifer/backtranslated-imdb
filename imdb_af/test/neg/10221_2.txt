I found the first little stop animation plot, and the mostly live action was short, with the girl going on in which country my interest was held, but the other 11 shorts didn't really interest me or remind me of anything not all. The music and the 8mm footage were all so random that it just seemed random. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you see it for free. <br /> <br /> As the music was so in step, it didn't come across. I rented the DVD because I thought it was all stop motion animation or SMA mixed with live action and only the first short was SMA, the second mixed a little stop motion with mostly live action. There were paper cuts in one, and the rest were outdoor shots of an 8mm camera with the music bed. I just had nothing I could see.
