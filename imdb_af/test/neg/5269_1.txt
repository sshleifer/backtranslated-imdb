"Usually Powerful Criminals" is based on the benefits of Martin Cahill, already the subject of John Boorman's 1998 film "The General". Cahill had a rough education in a slum area and went from small crime to armed robbery with praise. He justified his criminal career by pointing out his poor background at every opportunity. It is a common excuse for criminals who look forward to the thousands of slum dwellers who do not turn to rob post offices and sell guns to meet ends. Cahill made fools of the police and local authorities, not to mention the IRA, which earned him a kind of "heroism" status and made him many enemies. However, he was basically an amoral, self-serving thief. <br /> <br /> My primary problem with "ODC" is that the protagonist is to be a lovely Irish rogue. Kevin Spacey does a good job depicting Michael Lynch with a mix of oily charm and quiet threat, but the character is too amoral and selfish to see as any kind of hero, even an anti-hero. <br /> <br /> The movie is well shot and well-acted by a good role, but what made it off is the script. Author Gerard Stembridge cannot keep in mind; does he write an Irish "Lock Stock" or a smarter treatment of Martin Cahill's fraudulent career? This is the problem when a writer bases his central character on a real person. <br /> <br /> It is also a pity that "ODC" followed the movie release of John Boorman's "The General", which was a more accurate portrayal of Martin Cahill's story. Cahill was a cunning thief who knew the value of good publicity. It is therefore not surprising that his exploitation received the film treatment. What is surprising is that a studio was prepared to take Cahill's story and end it with happy Hollywood style ending. Kevin Spacey's charismatic twink bigamist thief Michael Lynch gets an anonymity on his motorcycle in "ODC". In the real world, Martin Cahill was executed by the IRA, proving that nobody is making the fools of an obsolete, sectarian and corrupt para-military organization and getting away with it. <br /> <br /> The real Cahill would never walk away from his fame, for it strengthened his self-image of the people of the people. With Michael Lynch doing everything to avoid death in the "ODC" is an exchange ending in a weak and shallow movie.
