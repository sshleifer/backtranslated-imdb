It's not even two years since I first saw this movie, and yet I can almost remember a thing about this movie. Needless to say, I found it to be very forgetful. From what I remember, nothing seems to be very good. A talented cast was wasted in what I was supposed to be a dark comedy, but if that was the case, it failed miserably. At best, this movie is gently interesting. At worst, the seemingly ubiquitous cloudy sky is more interesting than the storyline. If you like watching movies where it always looks damp and cool, then I think you can find something in this picture. Just try to ignore what's going on because it's barely vigilant.
