All the criticism of this movie is pretty valid! It's pretty boring, and filled with all sorts of useless ridiculous things. A few swaps about their "good grub." A medium shot of a desk when a phone rings until someone finally arrives, sits down and answers it at a fairly quiet pace. Quadruple or more when people look at things. Single banjo tuning and playing, a break for a beer. To give a joke to a fawn, about a generous frog trying to learn how to feed its babies. Complete with a few great moneys (needed for the weak punchline). The portion of cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal, which becomes the seakek, becomes unpleasant when people are being burned in a fire. Many of the apparent stock images are close to shots of animals, birds, insects and spiders in the bush. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a forest fire, then some people in that forest at least a few decades later. the same forest is killed by an ax. The killer was apparently not too happy with the ax he had stolen, and other people with other occasions or naked hands died. <br /> <br /> If it's true that the movie in the version is cut on the out-of-print video tape, maybe if there are a lot of footage being cut, it deserves another look at DVD. Otherwise, it's simply not very interesting, and will probably try the patience of even the hardcore outdoor shooter fan.
