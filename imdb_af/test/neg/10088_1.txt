It was very simple and simple. What was their message? Where was the movie with it? It has all the ingredients of a sub-B movie. The inexorable storyline is the bad act of cheese-slow-mo cinematography. I will soon see a movie I've seen like Goodfellas, a Bronx Tale, even Grease. There are NO durable characters. Eventually, you just want everyone to die. Save 2 hours of your life and save this one.
