I somehow failed to see this movie, though it was very successful and generated many conversations in Israel. I'm sorry I didn't postpone it indefinitely. <br /> <br /> The theme of "Kadosh" is a very real and painful one for those who know the Jewish religious world - the place of women in orthodox family and society. The basic situation on the film's premises is possible. The problem is that the way it is displayed on the screen and the "solution" that describes the conflicts in the movie is wrong. Gitai does not look too much sympathy for men in the religious world, but his approach to choosing characters that are either fanatical or not expressing their human feelings makes the whole story simplistic. He also does not have much better service to his wife characters, though he at least shows more sympathy and he also enjoys the participation of two beautiful and talented actresses in Yael Abecassis and Meital Barda. Overall Gitai's vision is too one-sided, his theater means too basic. He focuses on the technical details of Jewish religious life. It can be interesting for people they don't know, but not relevant in the context of the whole story. From interesting places we find here, a boring movie that looks longer than it is, with a very static way of acting, obsessive use of music playing in the same register, not only from a musical but also from " an emotional perspective and a very unconvincing if not even confused. What a difference between this film and "Ha Ushpizin" is inspired by and describes the same social landscape and has managed to convey human feelings on the screen. In 'Kadosh' there is too little cinema and too few human emotions.
