This movie was horrible ... It had absolutely nothing to do with Dark Harvest. And the DVD was very misleading, as it showed a scarecrow and a crook. No one appeared in this movie. <br /> <br /> The beginning was a delusion of random scenes most of which had nothing to do with the movie, except that it was kind of pointing to the man being psychic ... but not too good. . <br /> <br /> After the first 10 minutes of the movie, there is an hour of just the man character watching for his daughters. It becomes vaguely interesting when the girls meet two girls who died the previous year. But that's the extent of it. <br /> <br /> And why, may I ask, was this movie rated R? There were two drops of blood and four swear words. And how on earth did it stream into a video store? This movie was poorly acted, poorly filmed, poorly written, and utterly horrific.
