This is one of those movies you see with a group of people. You will have the best time. It's really bad, as Showgirls does but without the quality of Showgirls. <br /> <br /> You have the best mix of bad actors, bad directors and bad manuscripts here. Anything that might be wrong can make for an entertaining evening, you have here. The first thing the tagline is is a lot of teenagers ... "These people are so many" teens "as my grandmother. <br /> <br /> The director has no sense of tension or tension. "teens" are standing around and the "monster" comes out and attacks and it almost happens throughout the movie when the monsters are revealed, there is no tension to build up to this or surprise or anything. Children were pretending to be pursued by monsters and just as good as you went, and if I used the word "monsters" I would exaggerate it. More than a few guys in Halloween masks added the .99 cents shop bought. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that this script has been deleted in a few days, no rewrite and I can only imagine how badly and poorly formatted it looked on the page because it was clear by An amateur was written without any idea, this is another example of one of the bad things of this day and age: some someone can make a movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, the best thing about this movie is the play. It's as bad as you can get. There is not one person in this who has the slightest skill to act and guidance is the absolute worst. He delivers each line in this monotonous way without any expression and you have to wonder how anyone who could possibly participate in any movie no matter who he knows. When he had to "cry" when his girlfriend was killed, it was one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in a movie. Watching these people, seeing some of the terrible dialogue, is very funny. But when the black man said "tell her ... tell her ... I love her ..." before his death scene, there was a big laugh among our group. Funny, funny things. <br /> <br /> My only hope is that this movie gets hard enough ratings to its place where it should be: in the IMDb lowest score 100 movies. We can do it, people! <br /> <br /> PS. Is it a surprise that the one "big" comment this movie received was from someone in Virginia (who has one comment, only on this movie and nothing else). And guess where the movie was made? Virginia. I said before and I will say it again: people working on the movie may NOT comment on it.
