Not a bad concept. I just wish they'd taken it in a different direction. It's a movie that is interesting to interest you by shocking your bestiality, which works for most people (poor-stomach prudes). In addition, there is not much to this movie. It's not funny or romantic, so someone changes the label. And since I already knew that the bestiality was actually legitimate places and a million dollar industry, I wasn't really shocked. But most people don't know it and I thought how the movie developed after the secret came out was just disappointing because it could have been one of those shocking eye-catchers films that would teach the ignorant a fetish that is very real (yes, I did my homework) hundreds of thousands of people. So if you like to watch bad movies you can dream about how to make it better while you see it, you can do it.
