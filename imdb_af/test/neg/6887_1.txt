I think when people say it is beautifully filmed, they talk about the close ups of frogs and the cooking of meals. It certainly does not refer to the set that looks like it consists of about 3 rooms with no outside shots. It is also filmed too close. <br /> <br /> I got sick of the little boy who stuck to Miu or stabbed with hot wax over ants. Vietnam also spends all their time on their hooks? Similar to half the way this movie depicts it - one shell of it would be enough, not a dozen or more. <br /> <br /> Finally, part two ... a chick flag for Vietnamese girls with the perfect, handsome rich man who spends the piano all day (he is grown). The pretty girl steals him like the forbidden green mango fruit. Deep. <br /> <br /> Apart from some nice close-ups, this movie is a dud. This is kind of soap opera with out of dialogue. It's being thrown in. How is it beautiful ?? The set looks completely fake. <br /> <br /> Don't make the mistake I did and hire it because someone recommended it. I expected beautiful shots from the coastal mountains of Vietnam or something when I heard it was a visual gem. <br /> <br /> I wanted to keep this movie. I like foreign films even they prefer. But this movie is stupid and boring. It makes you annoyed that something like that won a lot of prizes.
