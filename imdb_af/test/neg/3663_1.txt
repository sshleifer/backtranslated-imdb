The not the best movie in the world ???? It was an understatement. I didn't watch this movie at all. Not because of the story line, not because of the graphic violence and the nudity. The nudity didn't really need to be in it, it didn't do anything for the story, except perhaps the girls had gone through a rough time and naked they were probably even more tinkering. But one of the things in the movie I hated was that it was so dark. You couldn't really figure out what's going on. I think if it wasn't that dark, and you could see where they were, it might not be that bad. All you know is a basement somewhere. You see no home, no road, the murderer in it, all you could see was half his face for about 5 seconds. I want to see things in a movie. It gets boring after 20 minutes of lots of darkness and everything you sometimes see is a flashlight or a wall. Then you will hear the girl crying. There was nothing that really struck me, it was good about the movie, maybe the tension in the first 10 minutes of the movie ... but not the tension of how the movie will end, but the tension of .. will I get nothing in this movie, but a few mere bodies and several flashing lights. But frankly, it was a Saw meets Blair Witch Project wannabe. Both top films, and both with the correct lighting to find out what's going on. Forget this movie if you can see. If you're a blind person, maybe you can rent it to hear the screams when you're in that sort of thing. But then again when you're blind, you probably won't read it .. so anyway ... BAD MOVIE !!!!
