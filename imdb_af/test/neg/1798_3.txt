Roeg's attack on Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" was not exactly what I expected. Although based on one of the most studied and interesting texts of history, the film has just become so boring. The story never succeeds in understanding the viewer. It just as indifferent in a way. <br /> <br /> Traces of the text are easily traced, but it is not actually Conrad's "Heart of Darkness". Benedict Fitzgerald (who also wrote the "Passion of the Christ") uses only Conrad as inspiration and thus becomes Fitzgerald's "Heart of Darkness". The movie just isn't worth it, unless you're particularly interested in Conrad or maybe John Malkovich.
