The only thing this one shows is Corey's release as the lunatic killer on the loose. What remains is an impossible story of revenge and divorce. During the walkie-talkie scenes, I had the feeling that Cotten was a nice potato and not a communication device. Another interesting thing about this one is that Alan Hale (the "Gilligan's Island" Skipper) is not yet so thick and he can lower his arms under his waist. Other than that, there is not much to recommend here.
