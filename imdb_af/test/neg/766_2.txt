Tom and Jerry transport goods by plane to Africa. But if they are white men, they are worried that they will not be safe, so they sit on black to fit. As soon as they wear it, they adopt black dialect and live their new characters abundantly. They crash into the sea and use the wing of the aircraft as a raft. Before their land reaches, they suffer the advancement of an exaggerated octopus and more serious danger of sharks, swordfish and whale. Once on land they are scared by fantastic creatures, and someday in a cave. Inside it is even worse when they come to life. And when the cave comes out, things are worse than that when discovered by cannibals. <br /> <br /> "Plane Dumb" is a particularly messy attempt by Van Beuren Studios. One example: A lion, unknown to Tom and Jerry, enters the cave before doing so. But the animators must have forgotten about it, because the lion never appears again. Another example is the end that is not an end. It's just an arbitrary stop. <br /> <br /> According to a YouTube poster, the cartoon "originally intended the voices and caricatures of a popular Negro comedy team Aubrey Lyles died of tuberculosis before the survey session was completed, and co-directors John Foster and George Rufle had to rework the animation in a Tom & Jerry story. <br /> <br /> They didn't bother, the rough animation and poorly executed gags made the movie a loser from start to finish. end.
