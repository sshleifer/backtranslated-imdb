SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> A clich√©-riddled movie that somehow makes an anti-death with valuation, though it tries to do the opposite. Washington is a paralyzed forensic officer who has been suffering for the past four years and wants to die (apparently he wrote his big salesman only a year ago, so it's not all desperate). He arranges suicide assistants with his doctor who will return within a week. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, he is helping on a serious business. He recruits the gutsy, I don't want to do that, but I'm just as good about it, policeman Jolie, and they track impossible clues to highly unlikely conclusions in moments. Hi, that old bolt means the killer has the millionaire's wife in a steam tunnel through the old Woolworth building. Shyeah, right. It's laughing. Yet it is not enough to find out that the doctor who is going to help him is the killer. <br /> <br /> When he comes to Washington to kill him (ahead of schedule), he has a heartbreak and struggles incredibly for his life. Cut the mandatory bad guy to shoot the good old scene when BANG goes off the rifle --- but the bad guy didn't fire! No, the woman stepped out of the corner, she just shot him in the back.
