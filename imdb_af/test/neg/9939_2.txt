Creepy face shields and slasher films went together like cheese and chives throughout the long life cycle. People often claim that it was John Carpenter who started the trend, but as with many of the genre's cliches - the Italians did it first. Movies like Eyeball, Torso and Blood and Black Lace were the creators of a coat of arms in a murder mystery. There were also some American pre-Halloween slashers that justify a listing. Classroom Massacre, Keep my grave open and Savage Weekend clear before 1978, while The Town that Dreaded Sundown is widely regarded as one of the first teenage deadly movies. <br /> <br /> Carpenter's brand new movie may not have been the stomach-masked nightmare, but it certainly started with the competing race between directors to reveal the haunting disguise for their bosses. Over the years we have seen some unforgettable contenders, but my favorites would be: My Bloody Valentine's maniacal mineral, The Prowler's sadistic soldier and Wicked Games' copper-confronted killer. I am also very interested in many of the killer clowns that made the look of the category. The final scene in The House on Sorority Row should be listed as one of the best. The Clown of Midnight is also one of the biggest men's costumes. <br /> <br /> A leather mask was probably the last type to be. used in a treasure trove film, probably because they are widely linked to sexual perversion, which of course does not really make a terrible disguise. But in later years, both Blackout and this darkness decided that fear could be dealt with with a gimp suit. Here's how the last of the two sails? <br /> <br /> The screen lights up with the rush of blue sirens, such as a cop race to the scene of a hostage situation. It seems that a stressed man might have had enough to be thrown in as an extra in rugged lower-level turkeys, so he decided to keep his wife and child on a firearm. Detective Shine (David Clover) manages to wrestle with the armed man, but unfortunately for him he loses the battle to grab a loose gun and it seems to be the end of the road for the gray-haired officer. Fortunately, he has been saved for some time by a few precision market makers from Lisa Ryder (Donna Adams), the California Police Department's hottest female law enforcement officer. <br /> <br /> Her heroic encounter deserves the dark-haired awards to detectives first-class, and this is a hard-earned performance by her male counterparts. Meanwhile, a leather-clad maniac is sneaking the gates of the village and dumping their bloody bodies on street corners. Ryder and Shine are placed on the case of the murderous gimp and their first call of interrogation is a clever back-street photographer named Michael Walker (John Mandell). Lisa is such a top inspector that the normal police regulation does not apply to her, so long before she goes to the cameraman, although he presumably suspects numero uno. When the bodies still roam around the city, she decides to cover in an effort to rinse out the S&M man? <br /> <br /> As something, Zipperface effortlessly removes everything that went wrong with the slasher genre to the end of its tar. What started out as a great stepping stone for emerging filmmakers and theses, was reduced to flat-screen movies, zero-tension or shock and talented, mediocre actors into a sewerage theater theater. The boom years of the early eighties played flashes to hide their lack of strong dramatic excitement, with good-looking special effects and exciting live thriving. Unfortunately, at this point in the cycling titles such as Rush Week, Deadly Dreams and The Majorettes, they produced a conspiracy to place the category where many of the aforementioned attributes ended up. In an early grave. <br /> <br /> Donna Adams doesn't even convince vaguely as a knowledge officer and her inexplicable idiotic behavior - this includes doing a striptease for a top suspect in a nationwide murder investigation. mind cowardly pathetic than you would ever expect it to be. Mansour Pourmand was unable to enter traffic and the vast majority of members would struggle to get a second radio commercial. I searched and searched but found nothing of merit or note here. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, if you manage to keep the TV up to the end, you may be quite surprised by the killer's identity. To be honest, however, I doubt that by that time you will even take care. And another plus? Well, the .... the disk is perfectly symmetrical, which means you can use it as a mat to place your cup of tea? In addition, there is really no other reason to go out and buy Zipperface. Bad and not in a good way, it's 90 minutes of my life that I could spend more constructively by picking my hair. Abysmal.
