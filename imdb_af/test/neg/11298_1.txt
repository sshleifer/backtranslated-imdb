Hannibal must be the most God-horrible movie I've seen in the past. In fact, I want my money back. What a waste of time. No plot, minimal character development, dubious motives, poor dialogue, substandard acting. What else can I say? If you haven't seen it, don't worry. I won't even rent the video and if you get it on TV, change the channel. The only reason someone might have to watch this movie is to see if the generous violence has lived on all the hype (which is honestly why they added it). If you want to see how one eats one's own brain, then forward to that bit. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of this movie? It's like someone who just asked, "I wonder what Hannibal is up to these days" and we just went along for the ride. He is free in the beginning and he is free at the end. In between is very confident on the part of Anthony Hopkins and the filmmakers. Julianne Moore bravely tries to inject a little life into her Clarice, but they gave her a substandard script and, as far as I was concerned, she was about to fail. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it's just a very bad story in every sense of the word. The only reason it made so much money was because of the senseless violence they added, which at the end of the day despised you with a sense of disdain as the abomination you are supposed to feel. <br /> <br /> I give it a big fat RASPBERRY!
