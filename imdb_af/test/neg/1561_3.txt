Edge Vs. Michaels-boring in general (love the sweet music in the chair) 4/10 Taker Vs. Heidenreich-One of the worst games I saw predictable as hell 1/10 Trip Threat WWE match-Why do I look at them, no one ever wins a championship at the rumble, it's not the main event. Did it when Show JBL drove through the wall. 3/10 World Heavyweight Championship-Pretty OK game, kind of more a beat-down by Tripe H than a game, but I was happy to see it after I watched. 5/10 Royal Rumble-Good Rumble, Chose the brand image, the Hassan thing, and the end. 7/10 Overall shit. Why does someone look at the rumble ???
