Los Angeles, 1976. Indian film brat John Carpenter, fresh from film school and with one movie - his class project's no-budget spoof of 2001, called Dark Star - under his belt, ending with an eager actor called Assault On Precinct 13. The story of an almost deserted police station under siege by an unseen LA gang, it was a small hit on the entryway and received little praise from the few critics who cared, but hardly set fire to the film world. unlike Carpenter's follow-up smash Halloween (1978). In this field, Carpenter has still learned how to use its almost non-existent budget by using lower-disc actors, keeping the action on one bright little place and moving the movie together with a combination of editing, intelligent camera work and enabled genre. <br /> <br /> No one wants or needs to be hungry in Hollywood, especially if the week's catering letter on the 2005 version of Assault On Precinct 13 is over full. of the original. It translates into a kind of laziness on the role of a movie maker - you have a solid big union staff, a studio and a marketing company that all do your thinking for you. That's why twenty years after the Carpenter movie I can still see, every glorious moment, from the little girl being thrown into cold blood while buying an ice cream, to the relentless pounding sentiment. A week after assault 2005 I remember Larry Fishburne's unmoving ping-pong ball eyes and slightly different. <br /> <br /> "Forgetful popcorn action" fits perfectly at the top of the poster. It's New Years Eve at Precinct 13, a skeleton-station station to see in its last hours. Call is Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), an ex-narcian now deeply upset and jumped on Jack Daniels and Seconol after his friends in the opening scene. Iris (The Sopranos' Drea de Matteo), a nymph heap with a thing for criminal types, and Jasper (Brian Dennehy), a crisp old timer who once fired off retirement. As in Carpenter's assault ... a bus with four criminals is being sent to the area. All blinding eyes are on the gang of gangster gangs (Fishburne, still beef of his time in the Matrix) who have survived an assassination attempt by a sub-captain and are planning to blow the lid on endemic corruption in organized crime unit led by Marcus Duvall (a tired Gabriel Byrne). Soon, the phones are out, the power lines are off, and both crimes and police find themselves heavily armed with a serious police arsenal and are consumed with paranoia while they are fighting war against a task force of Duvall's corrupt police sports white balls, infrared bazookas and more high-tech equipment than the Skywalker Ranch. It is expected of us if the helicopter's buzz around the police station shoots missiles in windows, is a clandestine operation to cover Duvall's tracks. He can also take out billboards on Hollywood Boulevard. <br /> <br /> As with the recent seventies genre that Dawn Of The Dead recreated, assault 2005 takes on the key aspects of John Carpenter's original and, in the seventies, quote, "it does its own thing, man ". The main question is - why bother? John Carpenter's 1976 is a cult lover among genre buffs, but is almost branded in the public's collective consciousness. Carpenter himself was reworking the Howard Hawks classic western Rio Bravo into a tight, claustrophobic urban thriller for only $ 20,000. French wunderkind director and rap producer Jean-Francois Richet, an independent fan of John Carpenter's work, seems to be less concerned with paying homage to Hawks or JC - although the script is referring to cowboys and injuries. pressure in as many flash and fire as the multi-million dollar budget can withstand. The result: a few moments with handy POV cameras, an unexpectedly high (and bloody) body number, some neat plot turns, but essentially a very high price B-grade urban action. Regarding the name of the Carpenter, it is pure imagination of the filmmakers who do not pay. <br /> <br /> For Mr Richet, I say bon voyage and I wish you luck in your music career.
