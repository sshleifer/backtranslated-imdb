I was looking for the movies on demand and saw Underdog for free and it was only 82 minutes so I decided to see it. I didn't expect much, but it exceeded my expectations to be terrible. Everything about the film was worthy. The dialogue was horrible, including very terrible words. The jokes were terrible too. I shouted and left myself off my TV screen as I passed through this trash. It hit his target audience very well, but I don't see how anyone else can enjoy this movie. It made me very angry and almost cried because everything was terrible. The only nice thing about this movie was giving it a 1/10 after watching it. I ask you to avoid this at all costs. I understand the fact that it is made for children, but there is nothing at all.
