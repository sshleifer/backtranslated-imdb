This movie can be great, but it is a complete ripoff of Bill Forsythe's Comfort and Joy. C&J is one of the favorite movies I've ever seen without becoming diabetic. <br /> <br /> It's good if you want it, but realize that ALL in this movie is a direct rip. <br /> <br /> The original is http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0087072 I can recommend almost anything by forsythe - Local Hero, Gregory's Girl, That Sinking Feeling. I'm going to rent better tonight. Locally, he has a young Peter Capaldi, and an old Burt Lancaster. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he acted after filming after some very nasty Hollywood treatments. Heart broken.
