While reading the script online, I thought "Capote" needed a trim. Having only seen it on PPV, I can tell you it's not cut, it's slaughtered like the poor family! For example, in the writing, Truman dubs Shawn "Adorable One"; here he is, Mr. Shawn. <br /> <br /> Badly enough, the amateurs behind this movie deflect Capote and bash his circle (should we really think they thought so little about Nelle, did they open her little pastry like a silly in-joke? ), they turn Perry Smith into this oh-so-sensitive victim, even as he showed he sent the Clutters. It's one thing to obscure the facts, it's another to drop the ball: the executions were performed between 12: 45-1: 19, 14 April. Truman is shown in prison 22 hours later! <br /> <br /> I was totally obsessed with the "play". Keener doesn't even sound like an Alabama resident. The way Cooper kept "Alvin!" Shout, I waited for the Chimpmunks to show up! Hoffman does not give us the charms, but a pathetic sucking look that sees a horrible act as his big time ticket. When Hoffman surrendered that he was tortured by the endless appeals, I wanted to give him a shotgun so he could both make us a favor and blow his brain out!
