For a few reasons I gave this movie a four star rating. First, I felt that this movie definitely preached and I hate it. Yet, it is my own fault to watch a Christian film first of all. <br /> <br /> My friend and I rented this movie because it was interesting. The back of the case was pointing to a spiritual battle, someone opening a kind of border that leaves demons in our world and the like. Something I am very interested in indeed. This movie almost hit the target. It was more like the edge of the target, more on the tree than the target itself. <br /> <br /> The basic plot of this movie is that two couples are kidnapped by a group of terrorist victims of experiments. However, since their experimental serum comes from the research of a scientist who claims to be able to bridge the gap between the physical and the spiritual world, the couples of the couples can now feel the smells, smell, hear and see the spiritual world. . In that order. Apparently the feeling of taste is not in the realm. <br /> <br /> This movie is very clicked. They took the title seriously if the men, chained to the beds, demand that their wives look after them, because there is something there. <br /> <br /> Although a good effort for what it was, I think the special effects can be made so much better. The devil who scratched the woman was hilarious. The woman was unpleasant like hell and everyone in the room was almost shouting when she died. We all hope that she will be beaten by the other woman. <br /> <br /> The message is one that I don't care to comment on, other than I think Christian filmmakers should have found a better medium for it. <br /> <br /> And so I give it four stars because it's not the movie's fault. I am not a Christian and do not like this kind of message, and I have a kick out of making comments throughout. My friend and I watch this movie look like an episode of MST3K.
