The plot of the open dig is very simple: it's about a board game called Mamba, where the real life players die the same way they die in the game. Tasty deaths include murder by computer-dug crabs and snakes. The characters are cardboard and deliberately annoying and there is not even a bit of tension. I love Eliza Dushku in "Wrong Turn", but she's totally wasted and unmemorable here. The climax with CGI witch coming out of the sea is totally laughing and stupid. The only reason to see open digs is some interesting camera angles plus sexy Eliza Dushku. If such movies are horrifying for the future, then I will give it serious consideration. Give me any 70's or 80's low-budget horror flick about this modern piece of crap.A generous 3 out of 10.
