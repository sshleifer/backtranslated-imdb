Perhaps it's just the format of this movie, a documentary, but I believe that the movie would serve much better through good actors and more solid dialogue. The fact that the actors are also the business owners is a two-edged sword. They know better than anyone else the emotions and complexities of the business they were doing, but because they are not professional actors, they do a very bad job of conveying the emotions and suffering the documentary. There were some unforgettable scenes in this movie and very good lines, but they were so badly rendered that they blur with time and the only memory I have of this documentary version is that they had good screens I can't remember no. . <br /> <br /> See if you want a first-hand account of the .com bust and see what happened to the 99% of people in the industry who didn't immediately become millionaires. However, be prepared for some wrong camera work, poor acting, poor dialogue, and an overall bad movie depicting the era of the Internet boom.
