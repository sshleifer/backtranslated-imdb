It was said that some directors make small budget photographs, resembling blockbusters. Albert Pyun makes small budget photos look like high school A / V project movies. This film lacked quite a bit in all departments. Almost every scene is dragging too much, the "experimental" lighting and camera work is terrible, Rob Lowe seems to be crooked with acting, and the poor deadly Euro-pop numbers stop the movie. On the positive side, Burt Reynolds does a very good job with what he has given (which is not much), Mario Van Peebles is surprisingly decent and Ice-T is in another long, recent series of B-movie gangs. Not Pyun's worst work (Urban Menace), but definitely not his best (average rifles).
