I was just in the theater in the city of Prague watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Not because of the poster, I found a lot of Holywood old-fashioned heroic style. Not because of the high levels that remind me that most <br /> <br /> of the high-starring French films are usually pathetic. But just <br /> <br /> because there aren't so many movies in my French native language in a city like Prague. And because I love Adjani, Depardieu and Rappenau's <br /> <br /> Cyrano. Then I decided to write this little comment because I think <br /> <br /> I'm not really with the mainstream of the commentary on this movie on Imdb. <br /> <br /> I wasn't disappointed. The movie looks just like the poster. The <br /> <br /> characters are just as stupid as they look. For a while I <br /> <br /> thought Adjani would be like a caricature - just a funny character <br /> <br /> that you can laugh at. No she's not! For example, when she decides to <br /> <br /> tell, Depardieu is the one who started killing the fat she killed at <br /> <br /> and then the violets came in a big fat pattern. br /> <br /> music that should make you cry and realize that Adajani's character is a <br /> <br /> deeper person as she looks. Maybe it was humorous at the 10th <br /> <br /> level, but I'm sorry, my sense of humor isn't that high! If I <br /> <br /> want to see some funny French movies in World War II, I look back at La Grande <br /> <br /> Watrouille! This is definitely better! I also read on imdb <br /> <br /> that Lemoine is a good performance in this movie. I have to <br /> <br /> say I've never seen such an act! (Well, I've never seen an Ed <br /> <br /> Wood movie). Yet the film is filmed well with great <br /> <br /> (very expensive) scenes like the one with the Pantheon in the morning <br /> <br /> when the German army arrives in Paris or when the refugees establish <br /> <br /> on a bridge in Bordeaux. I think Rappeneau is a good filmmaker, but <br /> <br /> that he does better with a good script. It was easy with Cyrano. He <br /> <br /> didn't have to write the dialogs! <br /> <br /> I give 1/10.
