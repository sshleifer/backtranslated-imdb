Danny De Vito shows us here he is definitely, indeed infinite, a better on-screen performer than down. He plays the role of Owen, a miserable writer with a fiery old mother (wonderfully played by Anne Ramsey). He wants to see death. Billy Crystal is Larry, a very frustrated writing teacher with an estranged wife, in the same way. So, after watching Hitchcock's "Strangers on a Train", Owen suggests exchanging murders. <br /> <br /> As a director, De Vito's control is inconsistent because he disappears this clever idea, while his movie from the very humorous to the very bare ones. He and Crystal are good at the lead, but the show belongs to Anne Ramsey as the cantanker Mrs. Elevator. <br /> <br /> Saturday, June 20, 1992 - Video
