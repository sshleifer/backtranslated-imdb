Didn't really hear too much about this movie, so I went and saw it. I realized that this movie only appeals to someone who has not lived in the real world. And even those people will think this movie is moving too slowly. <br /> <br /> When the movie opens, you see Nicole Kidman go to a nudist camp. Whoa. Shock. That scene, the movie, was all great. And then the movie went downhill. <br /> <br /> While respecting the vision the movie maker must have, this movie sucked. It was too slow, too predictable, and not moving enough. Robert Downey Jr. is great as usual, but this movie is not good enough to go through. It tries to be shocking and abnormal, but makes poor use of the talents of all actors. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money, even the sex scene was boring.
