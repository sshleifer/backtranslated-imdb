This movie was probably one of the worst movies I've seen for a long time. A friend of mine grabbed it from the shelf at the video rental shop and it forced me to see it, an action that we both regret. Ehh ... Where to start? The writing, the acting, the quality? All this, sucked. <br /> <br /> Certainly, some of the worst writing ever shown in a movie. The dialogue was worse than I thought it could ever be in the movies. Blatant dialogue, like "how is it?" ... "Not so good, doctor" (directly after an attempt to eradicate a man's daughter and then his wife's attempt at suicide. Of course, he is not that big not.) points, kind of funny. If not terribly written, planned and obvious. The general plot of the movie, the writing and the way it worked is terrible. It was as if the authors couldn't do anything better to do, then they wrote a lot of cartoon dialogue and cast as many sex and nudity scenes as they could randomly. The only almost good sex scene (between the preacher and the tattooed & Peirced girl) is filmed with such poor quality that it looks more like a cheap porn movie. Oh yes, and they never actually did the act. <br /> <br /> The acting? Horrible. x100. I think the only good actor was the short Spanish man who played Miguel, Del Zamora. And his part was written terribly. The worst acting? Probably, Paul Kappellas, whose play was combined with brilliant music, a gun and a half-blue blue white girl running around in the bush, almost made the movie unbearable. He even screwed his own dead shield, one that had to be easily run over. Although most of the acting was terrible. <br /> <br /> The shortage of characters also contributed to the overall suction of the movie. There were just enough characters, so nearly half of the characters died, the same number of people owned at one point, and the remaining characters could not be counted on one hand. Like ... 50 inches off. <br /> <br /> P.S. What about the climax of exorcism movies happening in a stable?
