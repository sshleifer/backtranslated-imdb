If you value, shape or shape your life in any way, you will do yourself courtesy and go through this seemingly "interesting" movie on the DVD rack. <br /> <br /> I know what you think, "I've seen the preview and it looks BIG!" But buyer beware, I fell in the same trap. One of my friends expressed some reluctance to watch this movie, but I forced her to put it out. Oh, I regret that decision. <br /> <br /> Like most horror movies, the movie starts cheerfully in a sunny Mexican resort where two couples are lured by a co-transfer to an ancient Mayan ruin. On arrival they are disturbed by the appearance of two jungle people who are all unaware of their greetings. As if it is not ominous enough, the tour group throws away large vegetation and declares an unused pathway consumed by wildlife, a perfect route to their destination. I think it won't be much of a movie if they have used rational decision making and just turned around, but anyway, it wasn't much of a movie. <br /> <br /> After a few steps, the seasons (the resort has brought a friend) stumble upon the ruins and immediately their doubts are driven by its beauty and history. That is to say, naughty tribes from the jungle wake up with a vengeance, for no reason, especially in a fearless language. Since then, brutal verbal attacks that have been attacked by calm, condescending language - don't ask me - but the decision is trying, at any rate, to no avail. Suddenly, the sixth track member, Dimitri, is packed with several Mayan arrows and the hell breaks loose. A gunhead finishes the job and the horrific travelers soon pull up the ruin. <br /> <br /> Now, if there was ever a plot for this movie, it ended here. The introduction took a maximum of 20 minutes and unfortunately it was the best 20 minutes of the movie. On top of the ruins, the latest people realize that they are being stranded by murderous residents and continue to make many good decisions. One of them is to use a withered rope to drop one of their members into the intestines of destruction. Needless to say, the adventurer was seriously hurt and then trapped inside the ruins and the two girlfriends were seriously injured to save him. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie continues unceasingly, with no real horror. blood and gore, as shown when one girl grows a plant that grows in her, sprays blood, and then when someone's legs are cut off, only to have the same flat inside the girl, he must strangle him later. <br /> <My only satisfaction in this movie was to see the very handsome Jonathon Tucker, and to play Jeff McIntire, is becoming increasingly frustrated and distressed and sitting long enough to establish that almost all the cast is a terrible, horrible death. Their simulated pain seems to be a sufficient reward for the time this movie sucks. <br /> <br /> Suppose the storyline is that the ruin is an ancient home of dangerous spirits with an evil meat-eating plant to deviate and prevent unhappy visitors. Unfortunately, I didn't get such a warning from screaming bloodthirsty plants, and the only evil thing about this movie I'm really shocked at is the author.
