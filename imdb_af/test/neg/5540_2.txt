I loved the original P.H. and was somewhat satisfied with Bloodwings (II) and As to As (III), then I saw part IV. Oh boy ..... As a Pumpkinghead enthusiast, I did my best to give part 4 as much credit as I could, but it's pretty bad. The wedding reception battle right at the start of the movie is a terrible mess for one thing. The Hatfield and McCoy story is incomprehensible stupid and clich√©. How did the producers get away with the use of that tired family story? Wow, incredible. The acting, except Henrickson, is below average. The plot and the writing are annoying. The actual editing and cinematography is average, just like directing. I mean, the movie is not a total loss. As always: I enjoy watching Pumpkinhead, I like to see Haggis the Hitch, and like watching Harley's ghost in action. But all three characters had WAY too much screen time. I thought Haggis and Harley would come to a dinner club for an evening bite to eat and drink, as they were so girlfriend in her cabin. The bottom line is .... Is it I wanted to kill all the characters in this puke festival of a plot line within 20 minutes of starting the picture. Where does Sci-Fi get these so-called "movie production workers" from? I can do a better job of writing a disk cold drunk writing. I'm sure there was a limited budget and everything, but come on! See it as your a fan of the other three, but only once. And then go back and stick to the original two. Shame on you Sci-Fi !!!!
