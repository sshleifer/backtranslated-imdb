If you are looking for a movie masterpiece, it is not. If you are looking for one of those horrible movies that are so horrible that they are really good then it might be for you. There is so much unintentional laughter in this movie, that it can almost be considered a comedy. Let's start with the opening titles, which says "Jack-O", and then add the word "Lantern", as if the viewer couldn't find out that the movie over a pumpkin didn't go through the giant pumpkin on both covers. appears and in the opening scene of the movie. Then the film goes in about 20 different directions, which doesn't make much sense. Jack-o is everywhere, he's in human homes, in the woods, and yet he doesn't look much like anything. He made a few manslaughter, but the long build-up of the murders was so poorly constructed and built that you almost wished. Jack-o will put his wrath on you the viewer. Unlike this, the plot consists of poor acting, generous nudity and a ridiculous plot line. The play in this movie is one of the worst I've ever seen in my 35 plus year of movie viewing. The boy starring in the movie (the director's son) has about as much emotion as a body, and almost all the other actors / actresses are just as bad for various reasons (especially the bug-eyed lady with eyes larger than saucers). But if you have said it all, if you take it for what it is (it is a steaming pile of dung), then you will get some laugh from this movie. What I also found amusing is that the makers of the DVD were fit to release a "10th birthday version" of this movie (as if the original wasn't good enough). And somebody actually had the idea of ​​making a mini-movie behind the scenes that was also included in the 10th anniversary edition (I don't know why) ....... I'll get these 3 broken pumpkins out of 10 ...
