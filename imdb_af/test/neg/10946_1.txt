This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life! I'm wasting my time on this. I watched this movie because I made it a punishment for me. I wonder how Suneel Darshan could make such a movie? it has no continuity. It feels like he's just shooting screens and then joining them in some editing software !!! Of course, music is good, but the movie doesn't need so many unwanted songs. Kangana Ranaut looks fake and I wonder what role does Celina Jaietly have in the movie? Bobby deol is good. at least he can act! Upen Patel has to take some stage lessons, rather than picking up his shirts in almost all screens! The end was the most pathetic! <br /> <br /> I watched Shakalaka Boom Boom after watching 300 (the movie), you can really imagine what I felt about this bollywood movie. <br /> <br /> I really respect bollywood, but please directors and producers, really, not everything is fantasy!
