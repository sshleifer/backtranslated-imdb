I was looking forward to seeing this movie because the trailer made it look so cool. But the fact is that this movie is boring, and totally astounded. There is no plot, and half of the movie is fast flashing shots from soccer matches. Zoom in shots, which gives you no overview of the games. I watched the timer constantly to see when the movie was over! <br /> <br /> There's only ONE good thing about this movie. The sound !! The soundtrack is great! ......... Don't expect anything from this movie.
