Dear reader, watch out! This movie is not really a movie, though its creators have the rigidity to call it that way. If you're not warned about its contents, go here: the movie is just a series of representations that are constantly flowing and trying to get a sense, concept. They can therefore be called symbols. The images are accompanied by a soundtrack, designed to create atmosphere. However, the images chosen by the director can only convey feelings to an American audience because they are in overwhelming numbers of American icons. Although the film is meant to express the idea of ​​"civilized warfare", it does not fail to do so simply because of the general chaos, but also because it is too long and tiring and I felt strongly that many of the screens not dealing with "war", in which conception. In conclusion, I was very disappointed by a documentary that is not a documentary, a movie that is not a movie, a "something" whose only strong point is the extraordinary use of technology in image processing.
