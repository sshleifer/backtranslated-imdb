This movie's script is indistinguishable from others, especially The Core, another bad movie. It's pretty clear why Luke Perry doesn't get much work, but about the beloved Lt. Seeing Commander Worf (Michael Dorn) resigned to something like that is just sad. <br /> <br /> I really can't think of a plot twist that is not seen, coming a mile away. It's not exaggeration. <br /> <br /> Special effects are very poor, even according to TV standards. The lava flow at the start of the movie, which indicates the forthcoming global disaster, starts at a very amateur level. And that doesn't get any better from that point.
