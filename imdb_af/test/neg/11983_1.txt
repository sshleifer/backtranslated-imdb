Not too good a movie. Sure, it contains action, but the effects aren't as good for a '08 movie. Scottish effects are horrible. Acting is "meh" <br /> <br /> It's nothing like Far Cry except names and the basics of the story (genetically enhanced super soldiers go crazy). The super soldiers are very different, the mercenaries are different, the environment is completely different (tropical island in the game, island in North America in the movie). <br /> <br /> I loved Far crying. I loved the story and the setting. I hated the movie.
