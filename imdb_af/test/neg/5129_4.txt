SPOILERS, BEWARE !!! Flashdance is a fair movie, in my opinion. Some things confuse me about it (eg Jeanie asks Alex how long it took her to dance so well; Alex answers: "About 25 years," Alex is not supposed to be 18?) And some things set me up the height it (I loved the spins!). Overall, however, it irrigated me. When this film was made, I was not even born. I didn't really experience the eighties (I was born in 1985) and I have to wonder: sometimes Alex will just run a little or throw himself completely, not really dancing, just touching something, throwing her head back, and her arms wave. Was it as if it were dancing? If it was, I'm not sure I could have put it. The spins, the flip, the fluid movements were great, but some of them - the neighbor's toddler could have done better! Also, if Alex is a welder during the day, wouldn't she be tired of a hard day's work? If she doesn't work for almost a week, won't she be laid? Living in a warehouse - I can almost see it, but not quite. It doesn't seem right that she is a welder, a warehouse, and trying to get ballet. None of this really makes sense. I should not be too discreet about my own background, but please. Perhaps Jennifer Beals is too female for me to see her as a welding machine, I don't know. But either, they could have picked a better actress. The actors were good. I even said the romance. You make your own decision. But mine is - rent it once, don't see it again - it's not worth it.
