Will anyone explain why anyone wants to make a "British neo-noir" crime movie with an almost entirely American role? The accent that is spoken in this movie is bloody terrible! But completely in line with the performances, which are so wood, one fears to hit a match. <br /> <br /> Really, what kind of disgusting, moronic, cynical crud is it? Even neo-noir movies have a character that you feel or want to feel, even if they are miserable and doomed; they have at least some decentness for them, some feel that what they have done is wrong, or that a seemingly good plan has gone wrong, and that somehow they have been responsible for it . <br /> <br /> Not in this stinking stove. These characters are ashamed, betraying each other, themselves and the audience. <br /> <br /> Also note that their low lives - okay, nothing wrong with them - except they seem to be living a life of luxury. For a movie suspected of being desperate grandchildren, the lead role here is - still. It's so terribly boring and foamy, Doncha knows. So let's rip some people or maybe kill them and lie down in a luxury hotel. What an ambition! <br /> <br /> Throwing this whole mess to a bottom of marshy mug is: annoyingly uneven pacing; predictable "action" rows not; banal and incoherent set design; made-for-bad TV camera work and editing; forgetful count; and a whole lack of imagination or innovation in production and direction. <br /> <br /> Completely unbelievable, unlikely, and for less-dedicated movie watchers (or masochists) like me, completely unavailable. <br /> <br /> There are other nasty things I would like to say about this nasty movie, but they won't be pushing it here. That's enough to say, you can probably find something more useful to do with your time than watching this movie - virtually anything.
