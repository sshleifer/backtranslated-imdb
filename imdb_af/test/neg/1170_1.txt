The title tells it all - Ed Gein, the butcher of Plainfield. <br /> <br /> It's not a zappy action-filled slasher movie made for teens who are high on energy drinks. It will fit into an established genre, the kind that some people find entertaining, such as "Halloween" or "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre". <br /> <br /> It's dark, slow, filled with chopped bodies and silent. There are few cuts, no monster's point shots, no hard electronic score. I don't know who's going to do it. Ghouls, maybe. <br /> <br /> Among the credits we see still pictures of skulls, carcasses hanging, sheep draped over the backs of chairs, that kind of thing. And they are sufficiently upbeat that I can't help thinking that this movie would have been better for the Grand Guignol opening. <br /> <br /> Oh, that's not. The acting is uniformly horrible, as in a high school game. The writing does its best to sink under vulgarity. Ed Gein, who killed only two middle-aged women and perhaps his brother, chases a screaming, bloody young woman through the Weir forest, and she only wears a modern bra and bikini rather than underwear. Gein also decapitates a night watchman, which he never did in any historical sense. <br /> <br /> The direction? You can do a better job. In the first few minutes, the legislators discovered a deserted car with blood on the windshield. There is no body. The handsome young deputy sheriff turns to his boss and suggests looking for the victim, who can still live in the area. The sheriff, who is not missing any motivation, shouts at him: "Now you just forget it! I don't want you to be half-hooked!" It should just be disciplined a business idea. Why did the director hurt the sheriff so much? Characters of different kinds listen to radio programs or records that play old jazzy pop songs - for example, Louis Armstrong's "Is not Misbehaving". It is - what - rural WISCONSIN in the 1950s? And the characters insist on music calling on customers of the Cotton Club in Harlem in the 30's, or New York intellectuals like Woody Allen. Nope. The radio plays Kitty Kallen's "Wheel of Fortune" or Theresa Brewer or, just as likely, Lefty Frizell. Not that the dysfunction between the music and the events adds to our understanding of what goes on below the images. Someone involved in the production just likes old jazzy pop songs. This is all. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is just as much you can do with a low budget, but it can be light years ahead of this butchery. See "Ed Gein," with Steven Railsback for an example of a much more sophisticated way to deal with this ugly and disgusting love for empty bodies, and on a budget that hasn't exceeded much. <br /> <br /> These comments are all based on the first twenty minutes of the movie. It's about as far as I can get. If someone finds that this story is well executed and fascinating in any way, he should try to gain insight into his taste. It's under mine - and I consider myself a little warped.
