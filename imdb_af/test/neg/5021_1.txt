"Inuyasha" was terrible. This show was incredibly overhyped, but it's nothing but a boring bunch of anime clich√©s. The characters are annoying and lifeless. The story line is boring and endless. I think it might be something interesting if it has a better writing, but the show's authors seem to have more intentions in the show Inuyasha and his stupid friends. fight with a few monsters and then cry for his tragic love triangle with Kikyou and Kagome and many times the same thing. The writing is bare and silly and the animation is poor. The character design it's very ugly, I don't know why everyone likes it, everyone has the same face! : Big eyes, small nose, a line like the mouth and the typical anime hairstyles. I find "Inuyasha" incredibly boring and stupid. It must be one of the most overvalued animation programs ever made.
