Beautiful images, propaganda and history as toys. The ingredients of this film, well, interesting, but with many shadows. Political shadows. Jefferson is more than the hero of a mythical America. He is a silhouette of a vision of life and society, an extraordinary thinker, teacher of much of North America. In the movie only Superman. The delicate contour of ideas is shattered. The subtle birth of essential truth is forgotten. And Jefferson is a basic tool for creating a good image of American realities. The end, triumphant and fake, romance and heroic, is rifle suicide from a story that can be long with more wisdom. And the war against "Avatar" is another gray spot. For one who has heard nothing of Jefferson, film is a good start. For the other - disillusionment. It's like the precious side of a tailor. But the garment is fascinating about her and the clothes are just plain cloth. So, a sad experience. Slices of beauty and boring lakes, patriotic lessons and the beloved of expectation. A movie that must be impressive. And the axis of a story that can be wonderful.
