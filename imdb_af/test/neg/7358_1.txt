If you've seen the resentment, another mediocre ghost movie, then you need to know what to expect, just worse, much worse. This time instead of being in Japan with all English-speaking people, we are in Spain with all English speakers. Interestingly, not one shot of this movie really looks like Spain and could be completely filmed in a studio backyard. Oh, and a place with swings, because there is a good 5 minute footage of swings with no one on them, oooohhh, how funny. <br /> <br /> This one is imaginable in every way. The acting stomach and dad do not help to do things. Anna Paquin is the only person to deliver a decent performance in the film, but I hate Anna Paquin so you can introduce my own private show. <br /> <br /> There is, however, one good moment in the movie, when a villain tries to explain the intricate plot to Anna Paquin's character and she doesn't understand any of it and asks a lot of stupid questions and he faded: "You IDIOT, you didn't understand anything!" lol. Well, I understand to understand this movie, is a piece of garbage. 0 stars.
