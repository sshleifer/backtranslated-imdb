Many people in the movie enjoyed this movie, but it just made me feel misanthropic. If smug "intellectual" handling of their annoying sex lives, sound good to you, watch it. I got bored, but apparently I knew people that way. The assumption of the film was that, as with all societies or great civilizations, it was eventually doomed to failure. According to the female historian character, which benefits us, America shows signs of the decline (admittedly, it's more in detail than I am). The next part of the film is concerned about the turbulent, greasy and asinine behavior of her friends and colleagues, and the various miseries caused by their lethal behavior, with a vague attempt at humor. Many people like this movie where I watched it. I couldn't relate to that.
