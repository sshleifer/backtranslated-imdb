Many of the negative reviews focus on the historical accuracy of this movie. OK, it has had so much to do with the real NFL, as your average war movie has to do with a real war, or a Western has to deal with the true "old west". So, I think we should give them an artistic license. </p> <br /> <br /> The problem here is that the director (Clooney) thinks that making a screw comedy means a) doing stupid things, b) cup for the camera, and c) stupid scenes full of stride and stretched out too long. Screw ball comedies require a quick fit, not necessarily frenetic, but always move too fast. Drag, drag, and drag here. After watching this movie, it would appreciate how brilliant Mack Sennett was when pioneering the genre with his Keystone Cops. After 90 years, you would think directors have studied the old masters and learned a thing or two, perhaps even slightly improved. But no, it's like watching a car pioneer who built a Duesenberg, and almost a century later, he paid tribute to and improved by making a square-wheeled children's watch. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed several of Clooney's movies, I consider him a gifted actor. But very few actors can lead themselves; Clint Eastwood took a while to get the hang of it. Clooney is clearly at the bottom of a very steep slope. The film has become more visible in recent days. He is outside the frame, but when he is in the picture, he makes himself the center of attention. In the battle scenes, his concern is so stupid that you want someone to actually immerse him. <br /> <br /> If you make a screw comedy and want a romance, you have to develop chemistry between the man. and female leads. Clooney and Zellweger all have the chemistry of a few dumpsters sitting in a parking lot. No spark, no sizzle, not even a post-mortem jerk. Zellweger, who also showed nice good movies, had to trade her botox injections for acorns, which achieved a beautiful wood performance. She might just once have pulled out the "difficult broad in a man's world" action if she only tried to watch the guys out of testosterone once. She looked at the camera with half a smile and sank in her eye. But no, she nailed her jockstrap to the end. <br /> <br /> Of course, the biggest sin here is that the movie is simply not funny. Doing stupid things is not the same as slapstick. Dream things very inventive, such as the Stooges, or many athletics, such as Buster Keaton, can be hilarious. But otherwise it is boring and good, stupid. I think I have one good laugh from the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one. I saw it for free on cable, and still wanted my money back.
