This movie is really bad, and trying to create scientific explanations for zombies, always makes the credibility of the movie's history. There are so many things I can tell about the movie that I could almost write a book about how much the movie sucks. For example, there were like 50 people on the plane, they killed like 100, and they kept coming. The virus apparently has complications from the liver because everyone had yellow eyes. Also, the virus causes people like lions or something to roar and the virus does not just feed tissue, as it also gives superhuman power, not to mention that this virus disturbs people's hair. It is also important to note that if you shoot someone with a pistol (probably only on airplanes), the person is kicked back into the air. Remember, if you are escorting a prisoner on an airplane and you are releasing him, always look in the drawers and cupboards to the size of a bottle, you never know where the bastards will go. And if you can survive and survive a plane full of zombies on a mountain (happening all the time), after killing people, just walk away from the plane, watch the sunrise and joke about dating the flight attendant. :)
