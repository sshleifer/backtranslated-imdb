First, I must say I enjoyed the first Underworld movie. I was intrigued and curious to learn about Vampires and Lycans and so on. In this last part (hopefully) of the series I feel sorry for how pathetic the vampires are. At least in the first part you had the tight leather clothes ... now vampires look like beleaguered victims of poor pest control. They look and act like haughty, white, fine people. <br /> <br /> Some ideas were neat. The whole thing with human nobles was interesting. Sorry the play was uncomfortable. The slave thing was also feasible. <br /> <br /> Other things have struck me as pathetically. Spoilers now. Castle walls that can be jumped into a few steps? Enemies who do not attack during the day? Big bad old vampires who take ages to join and then run away from a live lycan leader after a minute or away? Werewolves that are close to their enemies? Lycans attacking weapons ... for what? They do not use axes and swords or weapons! A vampire leader so improperly manages to just about everyone against him? The romance is so convincing its sadness. <br /> <br /> So I don't recommend this movie unless you get it online or buy a very cheap movie ticket. The action is good to be OK. Certainly the weapons and weapons of the vampire are interesting. Otherwise, a very poor writing that is poorly composed and uses all sorts of immovable plot turns.
