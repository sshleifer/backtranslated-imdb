and I still don't know where the hell is this movie going? I mean, really, what is this movie about? Is it about Sean Connery's complete lack of Arabic? Is it going to show that if he could play the role of a Moroccan warrior, was he of course the role of Ramirez in Highlander? Why was Teddy Roosevelt even in this movie? Why was there so much sand used so little? Where was there so much table lapping? Why did Teddy ignore the Japanese man with whom he shot archery? Did he realize the man was Japanese? Why was there no credible excuse for Connery's accent? At least Jean Claude Van Damme has an excuse for his French accent, whether it is raised by French nuns in Hong Kong (Double Impact), raised on the Bayou in Louisiana (Universal Soldier), or a French mother and educated. in Indochina (I can't even remember the name of that movie)? Can anyone explain this?
