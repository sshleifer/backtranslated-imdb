the right plot ... <br /> <br /> A group of prostitutes after the Civil War are looking for alternative housing in FORT BOOM. Lacy Everett and a nearby family of call girls have been eating outdated days for days and planning to move into the former Fort McMillian. Locals warn the women to eat more of the dated sausage. Because there is a dirty pyromaniac in the area, and he refuses to move them to the property. When they finally arrive at their destination, they discover their stomach is full of gas to all the bad sausages. It's not long before they learn why their new home is called FORT BOOM.
