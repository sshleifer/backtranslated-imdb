After watching 'Still Life', a short film directed by Jon Knautz, I was excited about his film debut, Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer. "Still Life" perfectly captured the essence and feel of an episode of "The Twilight Zone" and I was eager to see what Knautz can do when adopting the horror comedy genre. The campus nature of the name and promotional material suggested something by "Evil Dead" or "Army of Darkness". A fun, gory, 80s style horror flick with lots of monsters. While this was what Knautz worked for, he failed to capture any of the fun or entertainment that these movies had. <br /> <br /> The problem with Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer is that it has no understanding at all. of what these horror comedies did, trying to excite it in the first place. Two-thirds of the current time is devoted mainly to the movie's hero, Jack Brooks, a plumber and college student, as he goes to class and tries to perform his uncontrollable anger. There is nowhere a monster in sight for most of the film, barely even a drop of blood or the slightest attempt at anything horror related. Even if "Evil Dead" or "Dead Alive" cut out gore amounts, they would still be entertaining. "Jack Brooks" is not. It's boring, boring, which is the worst thing a movie can be like. Jack Brooks himself is not that interesting, at least not enough to justify the amount of screen time he has given. Everyone who needs to know about him is only revealed for ten minutes in the movies, and from that time when he doesn't hit the pulp from a monster (and he rarely does), he is not worth watching. The movie goes nowhere, follows him on psychiatric sessions and classmates scuffles. <br /> <br /> Eventually things will pick up. Jack Brooks battles some monsters, some heads are smashed, some people are slaughtered, and then it's over. Just like that. Already in the team of about fifteen minutes. It's a good fifteen minutes. The monsters are all quite inventive (and it's completely in the camera) and there are some big gags (the best is a crushed zombie head), but after seventy minutes pure tedium just fifteen minutes just doesn't cut it. <br /> <br /> It's really all there is. I can talk about the play that was done fairly well (especially the horror icon Robert Englund in a non-traditional role) and how the creature prosthetics is a good blow to the days when movies didn't use CGI, but made it really doesn't matter. "Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer" is totally boring and while Jon Knautz obviously has the talent to create a good movie (again the last fifteen minutes is killer and "Still Life" was amazing, check it out), Jack Brooks "misses It has its successes (acting, make-up), but it does not change the fact that it is not very entertaining, the performance I found it had and had the director's attendance. What I followed was that a successor was in development and this time more focused on fighting monsters as opposed to "creating a hero." My advice: Skip this one and wait for the successor.
