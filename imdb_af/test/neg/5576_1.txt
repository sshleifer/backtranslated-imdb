I like to think I've seen everything. SS DOOMTROOPER. One about a family of saber tigers. One about a family of pteranodons. GET EATER. DEMON CHILD (a non-animated kid's rubber doll with horns glued to his head.) Several SASQUATCH flaps, none of them good. A few giant spider / insect flakes. Endless HELLRAISER follow-up. Endless LEPRAUCHAN sequels. 'EM, which is actually about an urban street parade recorded on someone's $ 199 video camera. And so on. I saw part of an STV the other night about people stranded on a desert island hut to death with a group of poorly animated totems. I even sat by DREAMCATCHER just as recently as last night. Well, I have to say I have been sitting in parts of it and have seen it in its terrible glory. But nothing compares to PREDATOR ISLAND, about a group of young people. caught on an island during a storm, forced to fight with aliens coming in a meteor. The meteorite seems to have come from a SUPERMAN cartoon from the 1940s. and writing is all equally bad. I sat it halfway through. Strength.
