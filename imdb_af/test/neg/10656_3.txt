The story line of a man's love for an innocent baby he finds with a deformed face and on the opposite side of the world a shallow self-centered "valley girl" who shares a date of birth with her and eventually a make a big difference in both living there. What a great and worthy story line. But in this, writing the screen and / or directing and / or editing is so poor that most of the joy is taken from the story. Linda Hamilton's character goes from wise mother to wicked witch and back faster than a speed bullet, and for what purpose? Conflict, conflict, conflict, at the drop of a hat. Katie (the California Girl) and her boyfriend, Katie's Mom and everyone, including the poor lady at the airport desk counter, Lin's adopted father, who is the most beautiful, considerate man who lives, and his wife and biological son, all in constant conflict. I really wanted to enjoy a heart-warming story, but the only thing that made me was when all the hatred and fights were over. There were too many unexplained or illogical events, many of which do not add to the story. My wife and I looked at each other and asked us how such a good role and what a wonderful story should be unearthed.
