"Shade" is trying hard to be another "Sting", replacing poker for horse racing as the way to bring down an enemy, but it fails. <br /> <br /> I watched the whole thing and could never understand why the young child wants to double his partner. Was it because his partner stole his girlfriend? Is there a woman in the world who is worth the trouble? If there is, it certainly wasn't this slap. She didn't have redeeming qualities at all, and really now, has she actually set up a special room so that a surgeon can remove the kidney from whom she has tried to fetch a bar? Dina Merrill makes a short appearance as a wealthy woman who houses all kinds of savings parties in her beautiful home. And then the players say things like, "I'll see you a thousand and raise you another five thousand." Give me a chance. You can't call ("see") and increase, you do one or the other. Any child playing nickels and dips at the kitchen table knows that; You will think grown men who played this game - or at least the knuckle heads that wrote the script - will also know. <br /> <br /> One of the other posters mentioned how no high-limit poker game would allow players to actually handle their own cards and I agree. You don't allow two of the best-known car cheats in a game where the buy-in is $ 250,000 and then let them trade. It's not poker; It's just to see which one better cheats. And I would like to know which person will buy in his own mind in a game where two of the best-known card games play and expect him to have a chance to win? And most of all, what Mafia boss will run such a game? Every time Melanie Griffith got on the screen, I was so flattered by the huge fluorescent red lips of her that I completely lost the story. To see her and Stallone together was more like a public service announcement for plastic surgery that went wrong as a love affair. Stallone mentioned that she was a grifter before she bought the restaurant she's now running, but we don't know what kind of grifter she was and we never see how she works with Stallone in their younger days. We should not wonder if we care so much. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx is the best character in the whole movie, but he is killed off the bat and we left with cardboard cuttings that all sound like they 'read their lines again from a teleprompter just outside camera . <br /> <br /> The end doesn't make sense either. The child gets his cut out of the game and just goes down the street with a briefcase full of money and his partner is nowhere to be seen? The Mafia doesn't look at every move he makes? Everyone else just shrugged and accept the loss of millions of dollars without recourse to anything? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Most of all, this movie makes a huge injustice for professional poker players around the world, and realizing that the only way to win is by palmering cards and playing with "juiced" covers. And why is it always their kings and aces palm trees? Sometimes you need a three or a nine to fill a straight or full house. <br /> <br /> The best parts of the whole movie are in the beginning and ending credits' everything in between is ridiculous.
