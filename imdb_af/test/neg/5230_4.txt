STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Miss the Market *** That A Little Inside ** Laughs Behind * The Wells <br /> <br /> Based on Another of Stephen King's long novels, It takes place in the sleepy, small New England town of Castle Rock (also the name of the film's production company!), where a new antique shop, the titular Essential Things, has been opened. The owner and owner, Leland Gaunt (Max Von Sydow) hides, you can say, a devilish secret. There is an item in his shop that everyone wants in the village. A small cash price is required before a much more sinister price is requested. As a suspicion, hatred and madness, the town is torn apart, it falls to police chief Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris) to restore order and save the town from a frightening end. <br /> <br /> I read the Essential Things novel earlier this year, and was eager to see the movie adaptation again to compare it (as it would be any game!) But it was removed on video and DVD and I couldn't find anywhere to rent it. So I was happy when I finally found it in a flea market while on a shopping trip. <br /> <br /> It is one of the cruel ironic that King novels are generally the best to read, but when they are adapted to screen nine times ten, they are complete junk, as is the case here. . The material that makes his books good doesn't translate a movie script, for some reason. And I suppose there's always the question: why am I bothering to read the book again instead? <br /> <br /> I appreciate that some are simply made too long (ie It, The Stand) in a full screen work with all the situations and characters included, but there is no reason why this one couldn't be included do not have. all the material from the book. As a result, many key characters from the book (ie Ace Merrill) are not included and we have a terrible character development which means we don't care about the characters involved, as they are so deeply stripped and Motivation - for example. , we have one character from the book, Danforth Keaton, who killed his wife in the end, but we did not show that he was not aware of the fact that he did not hate or hate her. no impact when this happens, unlike in the book where there is a lot of depth invested and it is really involved with you to find out what happened to the particular characters. All the material in the screenplay to fill in the cracks, if you like, is really stupid and wheaty and the typically goofy stuff included in King adjustments like this. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie's problems are that it deviates so far from the book, but there are also some horrific plays of a role that cannot, of course, be felt by the bold material they asked to run. In the 90's, many King's work began to hit the movie and was made only for TV and video. Rubbish like this must be why. **
