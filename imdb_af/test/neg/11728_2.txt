Overall forgotten movie, but an incredible soundtrack: I'll give it (soundtrack) a 9 out of 10. I have the CD and the guitar work (Nils Lofgren) is great! I saw the movie years ago and had to check IMDb to remember what it was all about. I obsessed to get the soundtrack and had to replace it since then. It ranges from blues / soul / ballad to a dose of gospel. All songs written, arranged, produced and performed by Nils Lofgren, who is the "other" chief guitarist to Steve Van Zandt in the E Street Band. This man can play! The choir is handled by Nils (he can't sing very well), Bonnie Sheridan (who is a good singer) and Tom Lepson.
