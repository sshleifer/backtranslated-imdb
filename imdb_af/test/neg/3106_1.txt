Yes that's right. If I asked my friends this question, "What's the worst movie you've ever seen?" They might answer something like Armageddon (can you drill the hole?), "Shriek", "Plan Nine From Outer Space", "The Medallion", "Scooby Doo" etc ... No - Don't get insulted by this think you've seen something in the same department of natural human fertilizer prevent this film from being in. As the worst movie you can think of, it's so bad it really pisses you. then you know nothing of my friend. <br /> <br /> Crazy Six ... I remember the day and a friend of mine went to the local video store to rent a movie. Both of us have been through most of the movies there, and on the "new movie" we see it staring at us. "Wow, there are some good actors here. Say something about mafia, just let it go and get out of here." It was without a doubt the worst movie bug in my movie-loving life. It was also the worst mistake for everyone else: movie lover or not. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is as nice as watching a glass of ice-cold water (or ice tea ....) until it reaches room temperature. If you watch this movie, you will dream an eternal dream of death, if death is just darker and nothing, and then you realize you're just staring at your TV monitor. Don't stare. You actually pay as much attention as possible to human beings. It's no joke. <br /> <br /> This movie is the perfection to make a bad movie. It's not the kind of bad you can see, show and laugh, it's the kind of movie that's so bad you actually have no chance of ever getting out of your memory. Unless you use electric shock therapy to clean the brain. .... ... (Hey! It may be something similar to how I remember my friend and I after watching it.) <br /> <br /> Best regards from my Albert Pyun. </ br /> <br /> -growth
