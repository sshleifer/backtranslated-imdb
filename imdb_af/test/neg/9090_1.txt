I was reading in a Stuff Magazine about some of the hottest, bloodiest films that Asia has to offer and I immediately jumped to Netflix to quench my thirst. Boy, what mistake did I make. This movie is one of the worst movies I've seen. First, no plot, which I expected to be the plot (see "Revenge") just happened in a series of events in an effort to spend their $ 14.89 special effect budget and waste the studio time. They had to keep their money and not lose their time and yours. <br /> <br /> When a large plot turn occurs, Tetsuo II: Body Hammer is given a new identity and I didn't buy it. A look back is given to answer our questions, but it seemed to me that I switched on Showtime at 3:47 and dropped Sure. The movie continues and spirals are out of control with cheesy graphics and special (Olympic) effects. <br /> <br /> Do I look bitter about this movie? Yes. Did I see Iron Man? No. Was there a plot? No. Was it so symbolic that I didn't understand? NO. Was there a Body Hammer? Beat the hell out of ME. So take my advice and stay away !!!!!! <br /> <br /> (I have to admit although I had so much fun writing it and laughing about this movie, if you want to laugh, watch it !!!)
