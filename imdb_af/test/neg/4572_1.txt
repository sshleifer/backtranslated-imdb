I wouldn't call myself a huge fan of the genre's ingenious silliness, so I might not be the best listener for this show. Although I am a critic, I have a feeling for what I personally like and don't like. This is the later. <br /> <br /> Lack of humor is a big turn-off when it comes to comedy, things can be parcels, cool and socialize for about 4 minutes and then you get bored, unless it's a badger a few years ago. animation is. (?) This is exactly the opposite, with a sturdy writing and all the voices handed over are just plain stupid and very boring to be subjected to. Unfortunately, as it had a huge market in front of itself and a lot of potential. <br /> <br /> A waste of time.
