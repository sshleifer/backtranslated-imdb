I read all the other comments this movie made to be an excellent movie. I saw nothing of the excellence that was said. I thought it was long and boring. I tried twice to see it. The first time I fell asleep and the second time I finished and abandoned it within six minutes of the end. I suppose it was mainly my great expectation of debt, but I don't think that would have ruined the movie for me. The movie was just soft. It had nothing spectacular or unique. The plot was not half-bad, the action sequences did not exist, the dialogue forced and the movie just went on forever. I would not recommend seeing this movie.
