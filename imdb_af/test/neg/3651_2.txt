The sound in this movie is a nightmare. This is the best I can say for this movie. Any chance of a good story is lost once these movies start. The performance of the movie sounds good. A playboy talking to the people around him. The plot is predictable and very boring. The wet T-Shirt game can be the worst scene I've ever watched and is almost worth looking into in a kind of Mystery Science type deal. The sound is sometimes difficult to hear and the main actor does not seem to know how to speak clearly. His accent makes him very difficult to understand. The only shining sport is the play by Penelope Ann Miller. Her role is underdeveloped, but she plays well. In short, don't waste your time.
