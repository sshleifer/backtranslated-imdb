The whole set-up of this spoken Disney family movie (ad-exec gets his teenage daughter a horse because she "wants more than anything else in the world") is just an excuse to film the big climax at the end. . All the other ingredients (the ad campaign for the stomach pill, Kurt Russell as a potential boyfriend for the youngster, Lloyd Bochner as a potential competitor for Dean Jones about the love of Diane Baker) are arranged near the end to simply ride the horse show. More than half of the picture is padding, and worse: it is messy and stupid. The child is the lean kind that cries on the couch with a dog in her arms and as usual she gets her way. * of ****
