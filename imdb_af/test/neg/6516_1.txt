If you've never read the book and never want to read it in the future, check out and watch the movie (6/10). It is a fine fantasy movie with well done CGI, beautiful acting, beautiful surroundings and an above average fantasy story. <br /> <br /> If you read the book like I do about 10 times or more and really like it, don't expect too much (or better: don't expect anything). The story is completely different from the original book. It can explain that the film is 1/10 of people about 40 or more (like me) and much better off people who have probably never read the book before and thus expect nothing. <br /> <br /> Most of the differences between film and book aren't really necessary and change the environment (in my opinion much worse): <br /> <br /> - The magic of the book works with rituals for classic magic effects. (Changing weather, creating illusions, changing animals, ...) In the movie, magic is more like "Jedi School for the Middle Ages" (TM) (wooden sticks instead of lights). That the devil looks like emperor palpatine (after part III) doesn't really make it better. <br /> <br /> - The mill in the book is not completely cut off from the world as in the movie. In the book, the story is located near Dresden, which once visited Krabat with his master and also visits some nearby towns for festivals. (This part can be changed to cut costs.) I also don't understand why in the movie the mill is located in the hills, while the nearby cemetery is in the high mountains. <br /> <br /> - The whole surround is the average course of the mills fantasy medieval style. Many mud everywhere, dirty faces, not an orderly kitchen, just very rough houses. The book never imagined such an environment. <br /> <br /> - In the book, the master Krabat tries to make his successor, but reject Krabat. Krabat is somewhere between admiration, distance and silent rejection. In the film, Krabat always rejects the master openly as a stubborn schoolboy. <br /> <br /> - The movie was introduced in 1647 instead of around 1720. This makes it impossible for the master to tell stories of his youth all around. 170x. OK, the stories are missing in the movie anyway. <br /> <br /> Also, some explanations in the book would have been useful and would not cost so many minutes: <br /> <br /> - In the book all the work done is effortless and works in the night is like normal work. This explanation is missing from the movie. Sometimes the boys swear and sometimes they are happy. <br /> <br /> - The book explains why only a few "companions" are trying to confront the master: If the master dies for any reason, the companions are free and keep their magical powers. If the master dies during the confrontation, everyone will lose their strength forever.
