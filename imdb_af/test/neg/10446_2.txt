Hey, a good idea to open a movie - show someone's home movie. Drama schools must be full of idiots! , there are their drama lessons hoping to become the next big thing in Hollywood when all you have to do is send a home movie to a studio. Hey I guess I'll send the video of my wedding and call it THE GREATEST ROMANCE NOW SEE YOU OR SEE A HONEYMOON ACCOUNT AND SEE THE LARGEST SEX. Oh, hold on, I'm not married and I've never been to honeymoon! Don't worry I'll send a video of someone's wedding / honeymoon <br /> <br /> !!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!! <br /> <br /> You think with an opening like SHARK HUNTER just can't improve you? As shocking it seems as if the home movie is the best directed, the best written and best part of the film, even though it is completely downward when the family goes to the sea (in fact, a foolish pool) in a three foot hunt where mom and dad is eaten by a CGI fin and their son Spencer swears revenge against the fin. Cut ahead until today and the French use an underwater research base for oil exploration. Only thing is - And it's so obvious that you can't see - it's not filmed under water !!! , the director made no attempt to even use the unconvincing technique to shoot the scene through a fish tank. The underwater research base is blown up by the shark (maybe it is rented by Greenpeace?) Everyone inside and Spencer is now a big man who is hired to hunt the shark killed by his parents and a lot of Frenchmen. What's up? No idea, because I decided to see something else <br /> <br /> No hard feelings like any of the role players and the crew read this and I hope Matt Codd will be a big fish in Hollywood. You think you know about sharks Matt? You didn't see anything
