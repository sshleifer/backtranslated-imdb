I officially threw in my own mouth, thanks to this movie. <br /> <br /> I was expecting the absolute worst with this movie, but I expected a heart-warming and enjoyable absolute worst. It's just awful. Totally terrible. Terrible as Nazis spreading the black plague. Let me explain: Ewoks speaks English. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> The villain looks like she has traveled from the future series of Power Rangers. I really want to get her off the ground and say, "Finally! After ten thousand years, I'm free! It's time to conquer the earth!" The putties ... I mean the big bad they are ... they grow a lot. Many of them look like an even lighter version of the Cryptkeeper. The Cryptkeeper was pretty cool, but these guys were not. <br /> <br /> The only merit for this movie was Paul Gleason. This movie could have been better if he went to the bad guys and said "If I have to go in here again, I'm a skull." It would have been even better if one of the Ewoks was played by Judd Nelson. He pronounced his words as he said. <br /> <br /> Also, that speedy little being is pretty bad. Word for that. <br /> <br /> No word for the movie. I want to give this movie a two. I want so much. There is a section I memorized. The path of this movie is on all sides busy with the inequality of horror and the tyranny of devastation. Blessed is nothing, for this movie is blowing.
