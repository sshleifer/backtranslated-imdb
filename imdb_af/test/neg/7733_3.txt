Given a chance to shine in California through a philanthropic entrepreneur, Brown and his wife, Linda (Young), live the high life of tax havens. a fortune they lose if the federal government changes the tax laws. <br /> <br /> Seven hundred thousand dollars in red, and with a boost, the yuppies without portfolio start large amounts of Colombian marching powder their hooters, until they find themselves with hungry monkeys on their backs. After a short clean-up, Linda's chef-induced miscarriage sees Lenny again caring like a pinch between top and bottom.
