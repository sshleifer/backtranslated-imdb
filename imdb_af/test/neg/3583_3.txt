The whole movie is half-finished. It could have been a much better movie, but it would have rewritten and required different actors. Compared to "Traffic" it was a wreck. I'm just glad I didn't have to pay it. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: <br /> <br /> What was the point that mad police are being arrested? Sharing the debt of drug dealers and making them feel better? Pu leaze! The parents were scum, driven by greed, and didn't even consider the damage they were doing; as pointed out by Ice-T. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
