I got this movie on DVD titled Evil Never Sleeps, giving it to Carrie Ann Moss cover, but she plays such a small character that I haven't really seen her in the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid I'm considering this one of the worst purchases I've ever made. The dialogue was styled and the delivery twist, I found that the play of the plot is disconnected. Graham's performance for me was from someone wondering if she'd left the guest home. <br /> <br /> All in all, my wife and I found this movie painful to watch, and it's not a valuable addition to me. collection, look at your danger, but spend 90 minutes with your fingernails pulled out would probably be a better way to spend your time.
