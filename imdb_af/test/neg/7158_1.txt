The theaters and drama included in the movie are fantastic, but the facts and the research are far from solid. When dr. Bovon is quoted as the documentary trying to establish a connection with Maria Magdalena from Mariamene, explains Dr. Bovon later that it should be used for literary purposes (that is, fables of that time) not for a historical figure. In fact, he says, he doesn't believe the Mariamene ossuary in Talpiot is Mary Magdalene. He further commented on his public letter that he was not informed that his words would be used for this documentary, but rather for information on Philip's Acts (a literary work in the 4th century). <br /> <br /> So What We Have Here A Director Who Took A Clip For A 4th Century Acts Of Philip Fantasy Using It Specifically To Support A 1st Century Ottoman Script. A very sad stretch and dr. Bovon calls the Jesus / Mary Magdalene connection as "science fiction" - as this documentary must be marked correctly.
