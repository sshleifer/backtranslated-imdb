To begin with, I have to admit that I have never been a big fan of Dutch film genre. Unfortunately De Dominee looked, but I did not think. It shares some common mistakes, such as having a plot that is too predictable and linear for my taste. <br /> <br /> But worse, the role players have their dialogues as if they were stage actors in a play. Unfortunately, it is also common in many Dutch films and at least for me, it makes it impossible to feel any kind of involvement with the main characters. <br /> <br /> The actor who plays Adri (I'm sorry, I forgot his name right now) is at least a decent performance, and that is one of the reasons I have not yet condemned this role . Another reason is the fact that it has at least a budget and the production looks professional. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the fact that the play is often articulated may not be so much of a problem if you don't speak Afrikaans, although I have noticed that the plot is not spectacular either. but at least it can be an acceptable movie to watch.
