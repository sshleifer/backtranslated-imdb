<br /> <br /> A few years ago I bought a movie called The Cellar. I heard it was supposed to be a big movie, but it turned out to be a flop and a B-Movie. <br /> <br /> The story is good, but there are no good effects in the movie. . (Maybe they didn't have enough money for it?). <br /> <br /> If you choose to watch this movie, you should see it three times. The first, only and last time !!!
