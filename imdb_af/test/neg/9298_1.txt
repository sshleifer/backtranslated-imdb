I love Ben Kingsley and Tea Leoni. However, this is easily the worst movie I've seen in 10 years, and I see myself part of the movies. A stinker. It's a bad idea for a movie, poorly executed. Nothing of this is funny, credible or interesting. I was looking for white, irony and real humor. Instead, it seemed as if most of the role-players were going astray to make Tea Leoni a favor. It's too bad, so acting talent was wasted on such folly. Don't bother. I have to wonder what opinion the creators of this movie have heard of them submitting to the idea of ​​Polish gangsters in Buffalo, NY, sending a contract killer to San Francisco to become a mortuary assistant while attending AA meetings. Bill Pullman has to read scripts before he agrees to be in a movie. Heart broken.
