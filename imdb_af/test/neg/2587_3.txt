Debra Winger's 1987 "Black Widow" is much better. <br /> <br /> It's like a lame version, and Jane Seymour usually does better. <br /> <br /> Chad Allen is pretty poor in this. Just play his usual role as a boring rebellious child. <br /> <br /> Maybe they're both of Dr. Quinn supposed to excite us. <br /> <br /> If it is, it will grab a copy of "Black Widow".
