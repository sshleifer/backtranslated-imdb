Congo is another multi-million dollar adjustment of Crichton's works. Like the Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Sphere, etc., the film raped the book of its true meaning and essence. I'll make it short and to the point. The scenery is beautiful. The actors, though, are the best they can do. The script? Try overloading hundreds of pages in an hour and half movie. You finally get a mess, but just a mess that counts and the Congo falls somewhere below it. There were a few stupid moments, like why did the killer gorilla decide to jump into the lava? And, surrounded by people surrounded by people, Amy can intimidate dozens of killer monkeys around her? What kind of common sense is this? This brings me to this. If there was an annoying character in every movie, Amy was one of them. You see Amy is this fucking little female monkey who can talk to a special backpack and armor tied to her. Neat idea, but it gets annoying after a while to hear her talking. Congo is worth seeing and not regrettable, but certainly not a memorable movie either.
