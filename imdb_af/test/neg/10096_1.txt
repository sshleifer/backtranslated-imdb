Worst movie ever seen. The worst acting too. I can't imagine a movie being worse than that. Nothing to see. No action. Hi (actors) should look for another job. I don't understand who was stupid enough to actually put money into this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for Eric Roberts. Must be difficult ... I can't imagine how HUUGUGE should be to justify the job! <br /> <br /> The ladies in the movie ... maybe they are better at XXX. <br /> <br /> As for the leading man ... who has a head start! He is better appointed and stays there! I can see that he is more successful in barking rather than acting. <br /> <br /> Overall Rating: Don't Rent ... DO NOT BUY!
