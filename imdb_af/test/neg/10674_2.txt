Well, some people can see a trashy rubber and PVC dressed bisexual vampire killer kicking the ass. If that's what you want and you wear a mantle, lay your teeth on points and think the name Lilith Silver is cool, you'll see a fine movie. <br /> <br /> If, like most people, an assassin dressed in shimmering, creaking rubber with BIG beats, thick makeup and bad patches lets you laugh, then this is one of the best comedies you'll ever have see. I laughed so hard, I almost cried out. Ridiculous acting, dialogue and plot help make it a better spoof than Dracula, Dead and Loving. It could be. <br /> <br /> It strives to be cool and goth, and everything that manages to do makes every scene hilarious. Even the cut lesbian scene is funny (how * did she find those boots fast? They were tied up here ... ...) <br /> <br /> Don't see if you want good movies. See it if you like horrible movies and want to laugh until you fall. It's not good, it's just bad.
