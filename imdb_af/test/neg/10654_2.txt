This movie is horrible, it was so hard to believe that Katie became a sad teenager with the power to save the pity, but the film did not show a convincing argument to prove it. And the rest of the plot made us no more than a cheap common sense ... <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous and the only thing we can draw from it is that it demonstrates how arrogant man can be. Katie must have inherited her arrogance from her mother, the most annoying character I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The play and scenery were OK, but the plot ruins everything, full of cheap clich√©s and hypocritical scenes. I don't expect to see this movie again in my life. Skip this one!
