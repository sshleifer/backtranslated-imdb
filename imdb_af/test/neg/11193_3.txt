First divide the story from the movie. The story of a second continuation of war in heaven is good, very good. Religious theme films are not the main choice for many people, but angels are in the war. I really loved the story, and some of the images set it up to pitch it like the field of angels on nails .... great images. However, the real movie was just poor, I can't find a reason for the main character - the priest-cum cop is not there at all. The main female too ... no reason to be there, the main characters dialogue was just empty, it had nothing, the story could have been well without them. Now, a couple of sterling performances had taken place, Walken, Stoltz and Mortensen pulled off some of the vineyards, although their scenes were mostly with the lifeless. <br /> <br /> Another thing I don't get from this movie is why it functions Native American rituals to purify the dark soul. The child who carries it is clear of native American origin, but apart from the end scenario there is nothing that is linked to the heritage. The plot about the dark soul itself hardly said it, odd because the dark soul is the manager for the whole assumption of the film. The back story of his original owner (the colonel) is briefly touched, but not enough to understand why it is his special soul. <br /> <br /> I can't find a justification for the movies In this movie, too, several of the plains around 'chimney rock'. I felt like they had a helicopter and wanted to use it most, as none of the shots had any relevance, and they didn't agree with the mood -> Horror. The movie falls more than in the sci-fi category if it does not make abomination. There was no real shock or terrifying scene, a little gore and blood, but no fear element. <br /> <br /> So, apart from 3 roles played, this movie is a great guy. Unfortunately, the dud factor weighs the good acting factor, just too many weekend actors.
