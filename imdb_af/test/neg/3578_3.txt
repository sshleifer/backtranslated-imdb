Good actors, good director, well-acted, well-directed but ... Where's the movie? Did they have a script or just improvised? At least it's a short-length movie (only 80 minutes, including credits). Nothing seems to happen in this movie, nothing at all. A few small time drug dealers caught in little time trouble, but you'll never get an idea of ​​what is happening, or even what they're talking about in some rows of the movie. Tones of "f ***" and "motherf *****", but nothing else ... <br /> <br /> For those who love Abel Ferrara's movies like The Funeral, R Christmas will be a great disappointment, as it was to me. What did he think about? Did he really think it was a good movie? And if he didn't, why did he do it?
