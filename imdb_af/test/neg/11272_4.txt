In this film there is a loose male (Bardem) who wants to get financing for his construction business, and marries a woman he doesn't love (the wide eyes of Maria de Medieros). He maintains his passionate relationship with his first and true love and is eventually caught up in his own romantic web. He never gives up his juggling until the three main characters come face to face. The movie is boring, with lots of free sex (well, both girls are really good), all the reactions in the movie are absurd, incoherent and of course too much stupid. None of the characters are credible, which makes the movie a little annoying. Anyway, the acting is surprisingly good for such a bad-looking movie, which makes it a bit interesting, but if you can, watch another movie!
