I just can't suggest any possible reasons why Madsen and Hopper wanted to be in this movie after reading the script. Perhaps they were cut off? Or are they so bad from money? The biggest problem with the movie is that it is boring. The talks between Madsen and Hopper's character are useless, just as the bored talk between two friends while they drink beer on a Saturday night. You never feel for any of the characters (although Madsen's psycho-killer is very sympathetic, comparing to the other characters). Hopper was always a good actor, and Madsen does a good job as the serial killer, otherwise the play is almost laughing. There are about three scenes in the whole movie where something actually happens, each lasting about three minutes. Although the "talk and think about murder and the nature of murderers" scenes would have been interesting if they were plays in a book. The whole concept would have been interesting for a novel, but a movie can not just have a story with so much inner thinking and so little action.
