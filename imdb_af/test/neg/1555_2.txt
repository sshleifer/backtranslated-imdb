First, let me make it clear that I'm a big fan of bad sci-fi, especially if it catches big monsters in the city. But this one is so wonderfully lame that I can't even find it if I'm bad. They don't seem to shave enough money out of the budget by skimming the props (the only prop we have to tell the size of the alien girl is an abundant novelty pen, available at Spencer's Gifts for about fifteen dollars). They also decided not to lay out for draft or plot. The monster looks good, in my opinion, but it doesn't have enough interaction with the background, meaning not enough destruction that most fans of the genre fit. The general rule of giant monster movies is: If you don't have many fake buildings to smash, you'll better have a fake monster to wrestle. This movie doesn't. I can't make my last complaint about the movie without giving the end, but enough to say the origin of the monster, and the method found to get rid of it just doesn't have to hold water. Not as good as most of these movies. Skip it.
