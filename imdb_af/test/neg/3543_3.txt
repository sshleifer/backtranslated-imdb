Nagscream is a TV movie, so it's right to be, especially since it's a supposed horror movie. This young girl is chased by dreams while coming to a small town where a woman was murdered one year earlier. She was surprised when everyone in town thought she looked exactly like the murdered girl. The townspeople were amazed when his dream entered into trance where she revealed accurate details of the murder and murderer, as police apparently misunderstood everything. If they think they are in danger of finding out, the killers (there are two) are planning to get rid of her before they get the right truth. By now you will probably fall asleep and why the movie makers created the 'mist-making' machine on full throttle in the dream sequence.
