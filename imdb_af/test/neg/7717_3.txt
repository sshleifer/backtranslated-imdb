It's not even that funny. A zombie infection overcame a small college campus and a government team of secret operate backing up some scientists to find the origin of the outbreak. The collection of zombie DNA damn is definitely not easy. Once you've been bitten, you're one of them. The whole university is totally infected by the running amok-walking dead. <br /> <br /> This sequel does not even release the terrible original HOUSE OF DEATH (2003). Senseless entertainment has already been achieved. Some smiles of female nudity added to a bunch of gore and explosive heads should remain a zombie freak. Consolidated members: Emmanuelle Vaugier, Victoria Pratt, Ed Quinn, Sid Haig and Nadine Velazquez. The "F" word holds together an unimaginable writing.
