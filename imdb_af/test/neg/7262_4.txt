A giant praying mantis is awakened from its sleep in the art scene and southward causes southeast. Boats, planes and trains meet their game with the flying creature. Before he unleashes his full wrath on NYC, the mantis meets his punishment in the hands of the armed forces in a New York tunnel. Of course, the special effects are rough according to today's standards, but for a ten-year-old boy in 1957 it was very memorable. <br /> <br /> The lead actors are William Hopper, Craig Stevens, Alix Talton and Pat Conway.
