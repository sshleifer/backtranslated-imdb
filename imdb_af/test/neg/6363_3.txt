I didn't particularly like Sliding Doors or Twice Upon a Yesterday, so I definitely didn't have this poor bisexual apology for those movies. An idea that was done to death (what would happen if ...?) And the writing is clumsy and unsuccessful, not to mention the obvious attempt to add sex / nudity simply to an R rating. and some scenes that just weren't needed, but were there to push the boundaries (I really don't need to urinate a child or see a fight with a diaphragm. Especially when they're absolutely not connected to or use in the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting was also very poor, the only actor I least satisfied was her daughter, the rest was two-dimensional and pretty incredible. watched, the room walked halfway through, I managed to complete it, but not without a quick forwarding of a part. <br /> <br /> Overall: Nothing new, it's a generic and boring movie The few pretty amusing moments are gone by stupid or stupid, it would be boring, even if not done before no. If it weren't such a rehash, I'd look it up five, but even for an Indian movie it was badly lacking, and as a rehash it also lost its originality: 3/10.
