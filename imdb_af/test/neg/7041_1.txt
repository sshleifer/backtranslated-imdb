I am an Indian resident in the United States. Why India continues, like a dumb animal, to imitate everything, is American outside me !! The main problem with the movie is not so much the relentless plot and stupid comedy. It is that this movie has a lot of sex, touching, dressing women like strumpets in the streets and a lot of cursing that doesn't belong anywhere. <br /> <br /> To the producers and directors of this movie, I have this message: You continue to weaken our country's strong family values ​​by making this kind of litter. You continue to make young women think it's good to have a feminist attitude and have no morals. You continue to make dance songs that belong to the lowest adult clubs and bars. I am ashamed to be an Indian after seeing such movies. <br /> <br /> In 2003, the United States government suggested that the best way to destroy Iran was to send 'mini skirts' there. It is not necessary to do this for India. We will destroy ourselves with it.
