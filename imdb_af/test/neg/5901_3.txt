When released, this movie caused a sensation. I watched it and was excited. Beautiful, usually young, naked women filmed in the stylish style we knew so well of director Hamilton's photography. His photos never become pornography and the same is true for this movie. Today I saw it again and was very disappointed. The soft core in extremely slow tempo scenes, everyone filmed with Vaseline on the lenses is actually all there is. There is no real story, the characters remain beautiful and beautifully filmed bodies, but they are not true beings with a soul. Actually nothing happens. This is as though Hamilton is photographing rather than still photographs using moving pictures. And it gets so boring after a while. I didn't even look at the whole thing the second time, because I got big. These are all the remnants of this masterpiece: these are very good sleeping pills. And you'll never get addicted! <br /> <br /> Back then 7 out of 10, now 3 out of 10
