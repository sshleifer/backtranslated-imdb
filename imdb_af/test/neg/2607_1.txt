Wow. After watching this movie, you will know why America's youth still fail intelligence and any traits to contribute to the well-being of society, except that they no longer operate to function. <br /> <br /> Jackass number Two stars some of the most imaginative people imaginable, who are at the heart of any talent or brain to make something of themselves (especially Bam Margera and Steve-O), and there was only option for fame to make a living entertaining people as stupid as they are there. A man who drinks horse sperm? Just flat disgusting. A man who puts a fishhook through his cheek and acts as a shark for bait? It's not humor, it's been proven that he institutionalized him. <br /> Overall, I walked out of the theater without hope for humanity.
