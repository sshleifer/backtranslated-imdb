This movie contains the worst acting performance of all time. Spilsbury has the energy to say the least. Energy is what Clayton Moore gave us in spades. I never once felt in this movie that Spilsbury was anxious for anything. Revenge, love, justice? Not in this man's portrayal. <br /> <br /> There is also no chemistry between Tonto and LR. If the plot doesn't force them to be friends, they don't get the impression they want to hang with each other. Plus, the sidekick has the more interesting personality. EWWW. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is predictable and boring. <br /> <br /> The story is surprisingly bad and if you are familiar with the Dukes of Hazzard, you can see how it is. I can't believe the director will vote. This insulted me as a viewer by explaining every plot line I just saw. <br /> <br /> Hey, at least the horses and places looked good, maybe that's what happens if you hire a movie maker to be your director. <br /> RATING-2 You may be able to watch this one to laugh or to demonstrate to a stranger who is a bad movie.
