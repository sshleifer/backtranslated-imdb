The strange thing about Galaxina is not that it is very bad, even if it is. The strange thing is that despite being very bad, it's not funny. Highly bad movies have their own brand of unintentional humor - the secret to their success, you can say. But Galaxina is quite unique - it's MST3K's worst nightmare, a bad movie in which the intentional * and * the unintentional humor become the same. <br /> <br /> It is easy enough to find out why the deliberate jokes fail - and the reasons are quite diverse. Sometimes it is a timing; Sometimes it is a good idea to work hard (the human restaurant * could be screaming, but it wasn't); Sometimes it felt like there was a bit of mixing in the cutting room, with the punchline ending on the floor; And sometimes the jokes are just bad jokes. Bad movies get their laughter from such unintentional snafus. It's harder to figure out why Galaxina doesn't laugh about it. Something is subtly wrong with the unintentional humor in this movie, just as something is wrong (not at all subtle) with the deliberate humor. It's a very bad movie whose worst is not the redeeming quality it usually is. It is absolutely unique in my experience.
