I saw most of John Waters' movies. With the exception of several of his very early ones not available, I actually saw just about all of them, so it's clear I'm a big fan and I'm sure I have a high tolerance for the brutal and relentless in his films. While over the top and disgusting, I worshiped FEMALE PROBLEM and POLYESTER - two monumental tributes to bad taste and excess that are seriously funny movies. So I'm definitely NOT squeaking and can offer most of Waters. In Pink Floamingos, however, he created a film so repulsive, so rude and so offensive that I couldn't even stand it. In his other films he made before he became more mainstream, they were funny. But here's the humor just not there, because it seems the intention is to shock the viewers and not entertain them in any way. I'm glad that after this film was made, Waters's sense of humor improved, as divine rotting dogs are stunned (as in this movie), but not the least entertaining. My advice is to skip this movie and just pretend that it never happened and then watch its infinitely better movies of the 70's and 80's.
