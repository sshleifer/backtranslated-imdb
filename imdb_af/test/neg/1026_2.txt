Although there is very little plot and whatever exists, it is just improvisation. It was still a good start to a new director without previous financial backing and also a smart move from Andy Warhol to make his sympathetic productions more marketable and viewable. Anyway, this story of a street vendor relies too much on the fact that Joe's belly is naked (almost all the time!). And the creative use of a flashy edit really works after the hundredth time and the shutdown of the dialogue thing gets very annoying. It would have been much more entertaining or even dramatic if they made a diary of the daily real male prostitute or hustler, instead of making the actors some nonsense plot and dialogue of their own.
