The 2002 version of The Time Machine is just the latest in a series of terribly disappointing Hollywood remakes that fall flat on their faces, despite exuberant special effects. <br /> <br /> What a mean, uninspiring, mere story without imagination. Why so rewrite such a wonderful sci-fi classic? Is today's movie audiences too hip for the H.G. Wells writes largely as it is? The George Pal version of 1960 told a much more pleasant story, even with some low-budget effects, the beach party Eloi and Morlocks that look like steroids like Smurfen. <br /> <br /> The 2002 version must have HG Wells turned into its grave: <br /> <br /> 1. The idea that the timekeeper is motivated by the desire to change the past and get caught in ' a time paradox is an old scientific cliché. It totally detracts from the love affair with Mara (what happened to Weena?!) That made the 1960 version so engaging. It shows up an unfortunate and distracting tone that makes the whole movie dour. If Guy Pearce's character was so brilliant, would he or his friend Einstein realize the time paradox dilemma? It doesn't have him 800,000 years in the future? Of a Morlock no less, Doh !! What's wrong with time travel just for fun and adventure and curiosity - as embodied in the 1960s? <br /> <br /> 2. Once you've seen the first movie, you'll realize what Pearce was doing when you first saw it. The George Pal movie carefully explains the whole strange idea of ​​'travel' although a 4th dimension. <br /> <br /> 3. The director goes out of his way to look Pearce's character geeky, a worn out old stereotype scientist. In the 1960s, Rod Taylor was also a bit nerdy (at least around Weena), but struggled to be face, playful and beautiful. <br /> <br /> 4. Among the key themes of the 60's version - abandoned in remake - is the idea that endless war leads to the bifurcation of humanity. The blowing up of the Moon to destroy humanity is useless - and does not do much for science literacy. For over 4 billion years, the Moon has suffered significantly more powerful asteroid impacts, which would make any nuclear device look like a cracker. Yes, science fiction needs artistic license, but it's just stupid and meaningless. <br /> <br /> 5. The destruction of the time machine is also stupid. Apparently, our time traveler found out the neutron bomb to insist on this thing. Pearce never comes back to the 1800s to tell his story to his incredible friends, an important part of the Wells story with the irony that goes on a journey in the distant future and back in a week. <br /> <br /> 6. Walking around Morlocks completely ruins H.G. Wells' wonderful, haunting portrayal of them as shadow creatures of the night. Losing a real movie event. Wells also portrayed the Eloi as weakened and childish. These guys in the movie looked like they could accept Morlocks if they weren't so big babies. <br /> <br /> 7. Which one smart Morlock ?? kind of bleached from Star Wars Evil Emperor - had potential but is so lame and rude, he tells Pearce to take his machine and go home? Boy, what a dramatic highlight! In the book, the Morlocks steals the machine because they are so fascinated and fighting to keep it. <br /> <br /> 8. The goofball hologram at the N.Y. Public Library is too much. It highlights the idea of ​​human cannibalism. the 1960 version simply had the "talking rings" that gave a chillingly gloomy eulogy to man. The remote evolution is serious. <br /> <br /> The sad, amazing effects in this movie can never make for a tired, confronted bunch of a screenplay. Save the cost of a ticket and popcorn and rent the DVD when it comes out (no doubt at all), at least you can quickly think of the dull parts, just like our time traveler.
