There is no doubt that this movie is foolish and indecent, but tells the truth it is quite entertaining (if you are first looking and trying to analyze nothing). About all the movies you have a lot of good ideas, but poorly written. <br /> <br /> The story of the two losers, waking up to find out they can't remember what happened the previous day. Just to find out later they are being pursued by angry twin-girl friends, strangers, transsexual stripper, alien nerds and some gang members. <br /> <br /> Isn't it like the Bourne Identity? Yes, I know - how can I compare the two movies, but what the hell? They both have no memories; people were after them and so on. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is stupid and just for the viewer who likes silly movie. <br /> <br /> Reason to watch: · Many young talented actors, · Very stupid (it's yourself a stupid movie, why not make it extremely) <br /> <br /> Reason for: · If you want to analyze, forget it. · Talented young actors become bad. · Good plod gets very bad. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10 (Degree: E +) <br /> <br /> ------------ ----------- - ---------- ---------- ------ --- --------- ---- <br /> <br / > 'Dude Where's my car' waiting, what do you expect from Ashton Kutcher's movie. I think almost everybody has the same answer for this man - a very silly movie. Apart from 'That 70s' Shows, this guy really has nothing to offer his fan. (He has to thank the series for his reputation). "Dude Where's my car," is one of his trademark "turbulence". Somehow, his movie is even worse than Adam Sandler's movies, (you can imagine). The movie is really nonsensical, no story line and nothing. Mara Sokoloff, Jennifer Garner, Alison Sweeney and S.W. Scoot didn't have to waste their talent on this garbage. They even performed with 'Seriously, Dude Where's My Car'. It shows how film companies die to make money rather than quality. <br /> <br /> Max: 4/10 <br /> <br /> Recommendation: Borrow it from your friends or just forget it
