I'm a big battle. As a story that is surrealistic, this movie could have been very good (as big as it is seen by some here), but mixed with the acting (director and family who play major roles because of financial reasons I think). .. although these actions call it not just a piece of that word, it gives it a new meaning! A completely new meaning! <br /> <br /> If you are in surreal movies (there are some I actually like, for example, see the Japanese Alien Circus), you can think about the mistakes (see above) and enjoy it more. After all, there are good ideas! Many great metaphors and ambiguous scenes, but while you (almost all of us) see all of us, you can't stop laughing ... not the director's intention! Again, everyone has their own choice, as one can see with the high rating of this movie, but I can only recommend the movie if you are aware of the work Alejandro Jodorowsky has done and / or a fan of is !
