I don't get it. I just can't get it. "Barney and Friends" has been lambasted by millions over the years, and I will admit that I was one of those lambasters. Any child viewing this show does not realize that what they are looking at is just a piece of trash. Barney is very annoying, and very selfish. Add Baby Bop, and it gets worse. Add B.J. Then, you have a very creepy television nightmare. Then you get the kids. They're old enough to know what Barney is trying to teach them! What are they doing in the first place? It will be funny if Barney and his friends appear on the Jerry Springer show. It would definitely be one of the wildest moments in television history! More importantly, this show marked the beginning of the end of public television as we knew it, seeing less and less of the more informative and interesting public television programs broadcast in the 1970s and 1980s. What a big difference is a selfish son of a gun. When this display leaves PBS, a great sigh of relief will be felt by millions, but a great dive will be made in the annals of television history. A message to Barney himself: you shouldn't realize it, but your days are numbers. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, there are other choices. Better choices.
