This movie started out as a pretty nice movie, but it never really kicked off, but it became predictable and even a bit stupid. Some scenes were fairly well made, the photography and cuts used in combination with sounds made it a little more interesting to watch, but as the story was rather slow, the interest could not be kept alive. And more importantly, it's not scary at all! It is supposed to be a horror movie, but there wasn't a single scene that was close to frightening or even exciting. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the actors were not so good either, no colorful characters. You will remember for the rest of your days. <br /> <br /> Overall a viewable movie, but it doesn't add anything and as soon as you're done watching it, it takes a long time for it to be forgotten. <br /> <br /> The reason I watched it was because I read some reviews that gave it top scores, but I disagree and I'll rate it 4 out of 10. If you want another Japanese horror, I suggest you look at Ju-On! <br /> <br />
