I like science fiction movies and even low-rated, made for TV, bargain, movies that I still find interesting. Well, I found this one in a bargain and brought it as a selection after a movie night with a group of friends. <br /> <br /> I was literally * emabrrassed * who brought this movie. /> <br /> From the beginning, the play is bad, the story is vague and the plot is almost non-existent. All these things rightly lead to what the movie really was: a soft core porn movie. <br /> <br /> The movie started with a female prison where the inmates are all sexy women working in some kind of mine. First idea that this movie is NOT serious: attractive women in prison are forced to do physical work. Yes, right! Whatever. : P Once the "plot" continued, it was overshadowed by pointless scenes of people who had sex. Halfway through the movie my friends and I stopped watching, it was so stupid. The next day I thought I'd give the movie another chance and see the rest. I watched another 15 minutes and got up again. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a decent, scientific fiction or even a sci-fi monster movie, don't look deadly! If you want to see a low budget, soft core porn that is light on plot, see Lethal Target.
