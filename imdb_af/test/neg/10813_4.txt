I totally agree. This is 'Pitch Black underground' and a good poem plot. The best scenes I thought were the divers exploring the caves, walking through impossible underground passages, some of them being heartbreaking. The scenery was wonderful. If they gave away the sturdy "strange" toothy CGI badboys, the movie would have been much better. All they had to do was never show any monsters, but everyone wonders and follows Jack's descent into madness, and that might have been a top-speed shock-style thriller, perhaps award. The acting is not bad. But the rubber bats only reduce it to standard rate.
