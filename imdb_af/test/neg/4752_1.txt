The production value of AvP2 can be described by one adjective: AWFUL <br /> <br /> The writing is ridiculous, even in the fictional area of ​​AvP: What are the face shields good on on the Predator's ship? Why does the Predator clear all the signs of its influence, and if it wastes precious time with the exchange and even offers the body of an insignificant human police officer? Why is the Predator alone? Why does the Predator just rest on himself on earth, but on his home planet? Why does the Predator make his work so uncomfortable for himself by hunting the Aliens rather than bombarding the entire countryside as people eventually do? Why let the Predator lose more and more of his few weapons than to collect them to keep them together after using one. In the end, he even puts out his armor before he handles the Predalin in his hand. What a bad plagiarism of the first predators ends between Arny and the Predator. The Predator's gestures are so exaggerated that he moves more like a Japanese sumo than as highly skilled extraterrestrial safari hunter. As one can see right away, the whole story is a mess. But it gets worse because this refurbished job is filled with boring patchwork of senseless interludes such as a long pizza ordering section or some detailed information about the two brothers' criminal past (Dallas & Ricky). The Sheriff is, of course, the friend of these two criminals whom he regularly sits behind bars. (not convincing and absolutely unnecessary for the plot). <br /> <br /> In addition, the role players are horrible. Compared to the high-class directors and actors of the former Aliens or Predator movies, AvP2 is an embarrassingly bad piece of crap. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the action of the movie is really poor. There isn't a single action action field in which the audience can see the whole set. Each battle is filmed in short and shaky outbursts with almost complete darkness. This leads to an atrocious experience for the audience, as one can usually see nothing but a dark shaky screen. <br /> <br /> I suggest that the two ruling brothers buy Strause a steady camera and get a lesson in modern CG so that the next film shows visible action by visible figures and may not have their bad governance hide in such a way. <br /> <br /> I would recommend someone (even the hard AvP fans die) to watch this movie: prefer the first or the original Aliens or the original Predator movies, but avoid yourself disappointing with your precious time at this failure to waste.
