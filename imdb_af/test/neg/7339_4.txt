I love the book. It's full of passion, romance, excitement ... and the movie goes with two spunky stars with it. Kylie Minogue was already a big star in Australia, where she played in the neighbors and released her first single. The decision to throw her in The Delinquents was certainly a marketing suit. It didn't pay for me. <br /> <br /> Kylie might have been great in neighbors, but she was too sweet and innocent to play the demanding Lola ... and she wasn't Asian. descent like Lola was. Charlie Schlatter was an excellent Brownie, but there was no chemistry between him and Kylie. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie was boring. It dragged, it lacked the passion of the book, it was strong on Kylie and in general, was totally disappointing.
