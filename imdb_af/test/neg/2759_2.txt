Times I look back to high school and it amazes me that I never went lower than Marvin did in this BAD movie. <br /> <br /> Poor Marv is the main character that gets worse and worse. In spite of his intelligence, he manages bulls, mines, supports his cowardly Easter, and many more goof-ups, including a daring cage we say aren't going to completely plan. Of course, the viewer does not feel empathy with anyone in this movie, so all this disastrous gloom is jumping off like harmful zeta rays. Recommended for the days you feel, pop this movie in and you'll smile and say, "I'm so happy I'm not Marv!"
