University Professor Justin Thorne (Jimmy Smits) made it. A good, sophisticated teacher, with a loving wife and two lovely children. He plays the saxophone, owns an expensive car and his students love him and respect him. But when temptation calls, he gives a fool in the form of one of his shiny, beautiful, sexy, willing students, Jennifer Carter (Naomi Watts). The next day, he was charged with her rape, and his perfect life could be forever destroyed. <br /> <br /> When we see an American actor in the Australian movie, we know we're not a masterpiece. But even with low expectations, "gross misconduct" is a big flop. Based on a play with a fairly impressive title and then adapted to a fairly pleasant book, it fails to engage, convince or even distract the audience at a very fundamental level. The writing is uncomfortable and unconvincing; the acting is usually not much better. Watts gives an acceptable performance that shows her emotionality for the first time on the screen, but she's the only good thing about the movie, which almost looks like it can't wait to be over. <br /> <br /> However, the direction is not terrible or distracting, but it is only painfully mediocre. Apart from the aforementioned Naomi Watts, who could be forgiven, as it was early in her career, the play is in the course of the movie and is getting worse. The usually reliable Jimmy Smits doesn't seem to try this one and who can really blame him? However, all these small failures only add to the movie's eventual fatal error, which is that the focus is in the wrong place at the right place. Any empathy for the characters or interest in the rash is lost in a sea of ​​what is basically soft core entertainment. Eventually audiences will be bored, tired and wish they have done something else with their ninety minutes. Unless you just want to see Naomi bald 4 or 5 times, you can definitely afford to miss this nonevent movie.
