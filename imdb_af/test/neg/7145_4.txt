There is nothing new in this movie. Nothing you haven't thought of yet, nothing you haven't heard yet. The story of a gay man cruelly murdered in a small town, and the reaction of people can be broken in many ways, and this movie has chosen the most demagogic and sleeping one. One of the biggest mistakes in this movie is that it is not a movie or documentary. The director used the transcriptions of the original interviews and made the actors play as if it were a movie. The result is strange. And finally, I read in previous comments that people who do not like this movie are anti-gay. I'm pretty sure these comments come from people who consider themselves tolerant, but don't tolerate other people not holding this movie. It's a funny world.
