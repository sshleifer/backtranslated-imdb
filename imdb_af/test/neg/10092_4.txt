Wow, I was really disappointed. I didn't really plan to see this movie in the theater, and I wish I liked the plan. It really should be a TV movie. I was so excited to see it, because I'm a big fan of Fairuza Balk, but this movie didn't do her right. Infact I'm a little disappointed with the acting everywhere. What a horrible cover of Fairuza Balk's tattoos bothered me every time I saw her shoulder. <br /> <br /> There was no flow to the movie, it was very difficult to get into. One scene we get angry, accumulates, we want blood, the expectation rises, just then the director takes us to another scene to show the love between Annie and Bobby. It would have been nicer to follow if it was refurbished in three part-time Sunday paper cartoon. <br /> <br /> There was also little logic behind the characters chosen to play certain parts. The gangster leaders were scary guys, not very credible. Matt Dillon head of a mobster organization? Come on, give me a break. There was no intimidation there. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack. Wow. I think this is one of the worst musical scores I've ever heard. What terrible guitar solos, my god. The sound of my teeth grinding was more pleasant to my friends, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there's a positive comment I'd like to make about the movie. The settings are well done. I like the colors, a good job that takes over that period.
