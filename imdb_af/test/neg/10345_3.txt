The idea behind Dead Silence is wonderful: zombie outbreak takes place during a muscular paranoia radio talk. There was so much for this movie. Unfortunately, even though the zombies made their appearance, they were all lost. <br /> <br /> The movie is ridiculous and only those with a passion for a cheesy, b-flick horror will enjoy it. The zombies were so stupid! They ran around to hit their arms. They looked like a lot of people doing a haunted house for basic students. <br /> <br /> I know it's a short review, but I don't just see the need to invest a lot in it. It's a silly movie. You're warned.
