First of all, I think the decisive and acting was excellent. The problem is the story. There is basically no story here to tell and therefore basically no movie here. Larry McMurtry did Lonesome Dove and I can't make the original guilty, though it probably doesn't need persecutors. He has Hud with Paul Newman, which is one of my favorite movies. Mellencamp is supposed to be a country singer, but the only song I hear is an old Buck Owens song. The movie makes a big difference from chicken farming. Mellencamp's character has a good wife, and it is quite stupid to leave her. The incident with driving in the slide is completely stupid. Maybe people do it for fun in some parts of the country, but I've never heard of it.
