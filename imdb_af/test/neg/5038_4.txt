Not only is The Great Rock N Roll Swindle inaccurate, but when it comes to it, it's not interesting or even entertaining. Malcolm McLaren apparently wasted the majority of the Sex Pistols earnings on the wastage of the movie, making it so much more offensive. The intention was to create a monument to McLaren's "genius" from the beginning, which gets full credit today for creating punk music, creating the Sex Pistols, and sometimes even writing the songs. Viewers follow McLaren to various institutions, telling his story to his sidekick, a female dwarf, and simply getting credit for one thing after another. One particularly annoying scene has McLaren in a deserted aircraft hangar, waiting for a plane, rushed by reporters and given them their "big story". The most entertaining elements of the movie are the animated short pieces, but even this series of McLaren's remaining self-interest. <br /> <br /> Even as a farce, this movie doesn't work. Few of them are entertaining, except for Steve Jones, who is surprisingly decent as a pseudo-detective type of person. Twenty years later, Julien Tempel, who wrote and arranged this role, also directed the Sex Pistols documentary "The Filth and the Fury". While that movie is much better and more interesting than "Swindle", it's still full of Temple's "artistic thriving" that just doesn't work, like keeping members in the shade, as if they were some kind of crime witness trying to get away. pitch. their identity. An interesting little trivia: Film critic Roger Ebert was one of the original screenwriters for the movie "Who Killed Bambi?", Which eventually became Swindle.
