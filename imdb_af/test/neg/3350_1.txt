I received a copy of this friend's movie for my 21st birthday, which he obviously got 99p from a bargain. <br /> <br /> I've never been so frustrated when I watched a movie - it was boring, Adam West was (literally) wasted, and I can't recall one thing. My lack of enjoyment grew to such an extent that the second rolled the credits, we hit the cassette and hung the tape around the living room. Just for a good measure, we set the lid on.
