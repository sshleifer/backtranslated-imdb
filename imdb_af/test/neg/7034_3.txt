I actually saw this movie at a theater. Then I worked shifts and went there during a matinee on a hot summer day when I couldn't sleep. The cinema was air-conditioned. <br /> <br /> It was an early multi-screen complex and I somehow got in the wrong place. I wanted to mean something else. But as it happened, there would be no sleep. Shortly after the wrong movie started, I was also confused by a group of female cleaners who came in and used it as their social club. I was the only other person there, and that is some of the film's appeal that they usually expected the place to be empty and asked me if I had their presence in mind. I didn't. <br /> <br /> Within about half an hour, the cleaners' conversation became more interesting than the entertainment I paid for. <br /> <br /> This movie came out of the screen with the cheese of very old Mayonnaise. The kind that is a bit dark, hairy, grows tightly on the surface. I especially remember my senses being attacked by naughty chords of music that blow out with very little warning and even less meaning. The cleaners gave a predictive indication by placing their fingers in their ears. <br /> <br /> It was about some city birds sitting in the sticks under a drawer a backwood, making them straight, but at the same time learning a moral lesson or two themselves. As you do. A kind of 'exploration'. There was a sentimental smugness over the whole production. In particular, the leading actress had an annoying habit of staring at a kind of intense, compassionate every time, as if she were the patron saint of thick. <br /> <br /> At one point, I believe she wrote a book. <br /> <br /> Long before the end I was fascinated by one of the cleaners' silence and breathing tails of sexual impropriety. <br /> <br /> One suspects that there are some who sit quietly for a few hours and don't have to think, forming a meditation. The best thing I can say is that I don't want to share their salad. <br /> <br /> I have never advertised this movie shown on television, which surprised me. It's just the kind of porridge that is selected in the afternoon to punish the unemployed because they don't work. <br /> <br /> If you ever work shifts, you should enter the right theater. Or hope for some cleaning ladies.
