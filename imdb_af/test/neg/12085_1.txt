When I heard the male head say, "This is madness!" once again I would have smeared. The movie is one big cliche, with a false "under-heeled". Not one man in this movie has one of the quality; reminds me of Soviet-era films with strong political-oriented messages. I couldn't even understand why there was an attraction between the leads, and I couldn't wait for the end either.
