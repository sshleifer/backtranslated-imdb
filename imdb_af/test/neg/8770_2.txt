... not to waste your time, look at this nullity project. I deleted my comments twice, for reasons I still understood, except the suspicion that someone involved in "Gone" was not satisfied with what I had to say. So, this time I have denounced the things with an excerpt of my original comment that in no way can be taken as a personal attack on anyone or unfair comments: <br /> <br /> "Gone" is the kind of train wreck that gives the words new meaning. Horrible, silent dialogue, a text that looks just as clear as a fish from the water, acting the most self-centered community theater divas, cinematography inspired by the "Survivor" school of swooping crane shoots, followed by static nostril exploring close ups, terrible ADR work, special visual effects that are not pedestrian music that completely fails to maintain any mood or emotion, terrible editing with completely useless freezing and fading, no artistic talking - the litany of bad just go on and on ... I really got cheated out of the time it made me progress most of it was better spent staring at a wall ... Under no circumstances should someone unhappy with this subject read this movie itself, because long before it is over, they will wish they were "tucked away" before making the mistake. "<br /> <br /> Case closed. Amen.
