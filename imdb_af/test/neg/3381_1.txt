This "spacecraft" was kind of stupid. I think it was supposed to be an unexpected end, but IMHO it was just a big fall. Joseph Campanella and the rest of the earthquake actors do a good job in this one; their performances are not justified with such a stupid end. How this end can ever be done by the manufacturers of any kind of review is beyond me. The other comment here is not correct, the tongue in the cheek vignettes only came in during the second season. This thing had to be taken seriously! The producers and writers could have been a little more creative with the end to doing the rest of the episode justice.
