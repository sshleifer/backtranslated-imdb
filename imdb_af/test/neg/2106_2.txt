Truly, really terrible. I don't even know where to start. It's a perfect example of a movie that doesn't know what to do with itself. I'm not sure I can even assign a category to myself, except that I'm quite sure it's a slap in the face of everyone, every place. Even the unborn. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I thought I was watching a parody or some sort of farce. Sometimes, just a bad B movie. But I held onto the porn, which I fear is almost (but not quite). <br /> <br /> Some one advised to go to the end. I would definitely have that emotion second. The last five minutes are intense and definitely contain some of the best movies you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> Ed Wood will be proud.
