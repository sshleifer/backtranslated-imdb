Uh, it's not really as good as the other Dragonballs. The villains are actually rip-offs from other Z villains like Cell, Frieza, and even Majin Buu. With Baby is Frieza's clone, Super 17 is Cell's clone, and the Shadow Dragons are Buu's clone (s). The story is also very bad as it is about Goku shrinking. Shrink !! It goes with him to look like the size of an eight year old just to let it go. Let's not forget how bad the characters are. Gohan can no longer go mysteriously and is even weaker than Pan. (It's sad that I know). When she spoke of Pan she was so cute at the end of Z, she lost all that sweetness and became an annoying, shiny girl, whose only purpose in this series is to get in the way. Trenches don't even have a purpose in the series and Trunks doesn't ... and I don't know what to say about Trunks. GT is just an attempt to milk the popular Dragonball franchise. If you really like Dragonball, avoid this series. It doesn't even feel like Dragonball. I will be fair, however, as the end is really good and is actually pretty sad (at least for me) and the theme songs are both termination and opening better (Japanese, not American). Maybe it was better than Toriyama San worked on it.
