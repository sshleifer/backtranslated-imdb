OK, last night I saw the world premiere of Paul Schrader's Exorcist: The start of the International Festival of the Film Festival in Brussels. <br /> <br /> The director was there and so were most of the stars (except Skarsgard). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie succumbed. It was a big disappointment to me because I was a big fan of both Shrader and Friedkin's original 1973 film. <br /> <br /> What was wrong with that? Most of it actually. The FX (you'd think the Matrix and LOTR digital revolution never happened: it was so poorly rendered!), The editing (no real pace or rhythm), the acting (Skarsgard could sometimes convince). The script was an IMO, designed to explain the African scenes in the original film. So the movie had the feel of an essay scene, but it didn't matter. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked was Vittorio Storaro's cinematography, although I saw him better (Apocalypse Now). /> <br /> All the time I thought it was just a rough cut, a job was going on. And that, given the (familiar) circumstances, is probably what it is. But it doesn't change the obvious problems with the script. <br /> <br /> I had the chance to meet Schrader (very briefly), but I didn't have to tell him what I thought of the movie and I was so nervous (this is the man who written for taxi driver for Christ !!) that I forgot to ask him to draw my copy of his taxi driver's letter ...
