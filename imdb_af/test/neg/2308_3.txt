I remember when "The Love Machine" was released for the first time in the theater. I was just 13 years old, too young to see the escaping movie release, but not too old to take my mother's newspaper copy of the Jacqueline Susann novel after school and watch the "naughty bits" with my schoolmates. br /> <br /> Although I'm not sure what my problem was at such an early age, I was very much in the book. I bought an "ankh" ring, just like on the newspaper, and I remember the advertisements for the perfume, "Xanadu" which was crucified and unclear in the film. Despite such an interest, I didn't see the movie until years later. I had to leave things as they were. <br /> <br /> The Love Machine is the worst of the bad movies adapted from Susann's novels. It makes it most beautiful to look at. His mistakes are many: from his hopscotching script jumping from one incident to another with a jumper; his dated, horny (brass instruments, I mean) music score from ersatz Bacharach; the flat, first action; The Boring Sexuality - I have never seen a bathrobe that appeared so prominent in a movie. It's like a fetish! When sex, nudity or something mystery is asked, someone appears in a blue cloak! Very strange, this; And surely, the circus train of terrible 70's fashions that is endless show. Poor Dyan Cannon's performance (which in any case was not well shaken, but heads over the rest of the cast) is consistently undermined by the jaw she has gained to wear. The main responsibility of the film is, however, the sticks, rocky John Philip Law as (appropriately) Robin Stone, the girl's object (and one about the top-blazing male photographer's) love. <br /> <br /> The law is just awful and performing as if pulled down the street, rushed the pages of the script and said it was reading cold on the spot. Just lifeless! Not only that, but he appears in desperate need of blood transfusion or something. He looks foolish and sickly and is a few pounds smaller than most of his female costs. Robin Stone must be hungry, not a hanky. <br /> <br /> For everyone who finds the movie hard (it's pretty slower according to today's standards), I ask you to hold on to the climatic "battle scene". Here, Mrs. Cannon, who balances her previously starchy hair, eventually leaves her starchy acting style and lets her go with her contagious laughs and puts an unforgettable freedom in place for everything that would be a highlight. Try to rival the "Valley of the Dolls" infamous wedge-down-the-toilet scene, "The Love Machine" eventually makes something right. <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Susann's unique brand of garbage is greatly missed. Perhaps somebody out there has the rights to Rona Barrett's "The Lovomaniacs" and will revive the genre.
