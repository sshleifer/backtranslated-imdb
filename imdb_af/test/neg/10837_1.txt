Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. Pathetic in almost every respect. <br /> <br /> I threw the DVD straight into the bin - I didn't even think it was fair to give it to the local savings. <br /> <br /> The effects are out of joke. The dam control room looks like cardboard. <br /> <br /> The water looks out of scale with the backgrounds. There is nothing else. <br /> <br /> Then there's a short plot - about as much depth as a Scooby Doo cartoon. <br /> <br /> I couldn't wait for them all to drown.
