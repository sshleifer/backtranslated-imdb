I live in Rome where the Turkish director of this movie lives and works. From my Italian friends I heard very good things about his films ... so after seeing the preview, I really wanted to see Cuore Sacro. I'm very disappointed, one of the most pompous, pseudo-religious, highly unlikely and naive films. I love movie, but this one is really heavy and bad. The main character is really crazy and needs to be locked in a madhouse. I am convinced of the negative character of a aunt who runs a garbage dealer who just wants to make money ... and I consider myself an anti-capitalist ... so bad !!!
