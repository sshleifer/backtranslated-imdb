One would think that since this movie has a bad rep that I would exaggerate when I say I hated this movie. But I'm serious, this movie was just as stupid and so unfriendly and such a waste of time. I mean The first 30, I had a big headache and the smile I had on my face (it was mostly right to laugh) was off. When this film was over, I was so happy and because I had good expectations that it would be funny I was very disappointed. The acting is not fun, the comedy moments are lame and unfunny. Anything is good about this because I laughed like two parts. Generally, it's so boring and I can't tell you how terrible it is, I think it can be used as a suicide technique. I think I don't think for some its even watchable.So my last words about this, avoid at all costs.
