This charming and sloppy spy melodrama with two buffoon-like (one idealistic, one drug-addicted) California child-care secret to the KGB, never seems to get enough steam to retain any tension and tension before killing a very slow death over two hours . John Schlesinger's finished product gives the impression that he slept in his director's seat most of the time, while the movie loads and the actors sleep, except for the highly annoying about Sean Penn's best performance. <br /> <br /> Childhood boys and friends Chris (Tim Hutton) and Daulton (Penn) plan to sell secrets to the KGB when Chris provides a job that gives him access to top secret government material. Disillusioned by what he sees as the Americans in foreign affairs, the idealistic Chris and drug star Daulton make contact with the Russians and begin to bury their classified material. When Chris decides he wants to, things start to unravel. <br /> <br /> The eighties were not good at distinguishing John Schlesinger's director. In the sixties and seventies, he had a series of critically acclaimed films in both England and America, but then Honky Tonk Freeway came in 1981 and it was the beginning of the end. The Falcon and the Snowman make more or less a lid on it. The tensions of the Marathon man and the quality performances (Hoffman Voight, Christie, Jackson, Finch, Olivier) ripped him off the past. Falcon usually goes in those circles. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, Sean Penn is so stupid that you encourage yourself to do more to his martyrs. Tim Hutton is controlled by his limited actors and most of his scenes show a need for more rehearsal time. Lori Singer as Hutton's friend plays most of the way with the content of Schlesinger to film her vapid expressions. When she does emote, you understand why. Only David Suchet as the KGB handler with a pervasive, apparent presence and restraint, frees him well.
