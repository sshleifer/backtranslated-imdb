Although my exposure to world cultures is limited, I try. It was a movie I tried and hated. Worst of all, after hearing so many people disregarding the typical Hollywood fare and its stereotypical caricatures, I saw characters shameful because "Eastenders" are so realistically affected. <br /> <br /> Clint wants to live out of the drug and to do this he strives for a waiter. Aim high, I always say. Brad Dorif, or a fax photo of him, or maybe a curly wig on a stick, it was hard to tell, offered to hire Clint if he got some shoes. <br /> <br /> Clint, and a great entourage, are wandering across England to get him shoes. Eventually they end up at a suburban home. Who is not clear. Mom helps a girl to shoot. Oh, now there's a realism for you! Mrs. Brady may have been a ridiculous stereotype of American housewives, but she never helped Marsha get an ear. Good God! Dad comes home and sings some Elvis songs and chases the kids away. Why didn't Clint borrow money and buy shoes from a second-hand store? Why didn't he go to church and ask a friendly nun for help? Why didn't he hang out in front of a shoe store and pan trade? I just don't know! None of these things were under him. Willing groups, such as Goodwill and the Salvation Army, have shops to help people. I know people working there! If someone arrives with no money and needs shoes, the staff will give the shoes to the person. Maybe not Prada or Gucci, but a form of foot covering. Not many of these groups give cell phones to the underprivileged, but shoes are usually not a problem. What a stupid concept. The world, or at least the western part of it, is simply not so cruel. In England, it may be from "The Queen's Royal Charity", rather than Goodwill, but people who need shoes get them. <br /> <br /> Apart from the search for shoes, there was no observable plot to get in the way of the action. Not that it made the movie faster or more portable, you think. In spite of a few times looking at the dressing gown, I didn't watch the 20-hour extended version. It looked the same. <br /> <br /> Did Clint get his shoes? Did Brad Dourif's cardboard cutout rent him at the restaurant? <br /> <br /> [spoiler] Yes, yes and yes. <br /> <br /> Regarding the fate of this particular movie, I decided to end it all. I took my S&W .45 and shot a half-inch hole through the cassette. Blammo! (I made it sure to return it first.) I put it back in the tire sleeve, returned it to the rental shop, and unbelievably no one ever wondered about it !!! It means, of course, that no one else has rented it for at least the remaining three years I lived in that city. Others knew something I didn't do. Live and learn. <br /> <br /> VAT, if you hire something you've never seen before and someone actually has a bullet through it, take it as a sign. And if you work at the Kroger video section, I don't estimate. <br /> <br /> Footnote: These classics have not yet seen the light of day on DVD, because we need to be forever grateful for the digital gods.
