This movie was a great disappointment. The plot sounds good, about a half-human half-leopard in Africa that is the subject of a documentary by young American adults. When many of the crew members are found dead, the 2 survivors are questioned. I wouldn't even call it a horror movie, as most of the movie is actually about the (miss) adventures of the aforementioned narcissistic 20-somethings, which include sex and smoking animals to grow high (isn't that entertaining it sounds - trust me). You rarely get the creature, and the lead actor (who is also the director, writer author, editor and producer!) Is incredibly annoying. <br /> <br /> In the end I was so bad of the never-ending dialogue I quickly sent to the end. I guessed the end in less than 10 minutes in the movie ... and I'm right. So, this terrible movie is also completely predictable - as if it wasn't bad enough. Moral of the story: avoid movies that acted, directed, edited, produced and written by the same nobody. And avoid this movie unless it is held in rifle.
