I have seen a lot - possibly too much straight-to-video, no budget clash movies and have a taste for "good" or those who are less sucky, as ridiculous as it sounds, hahaha. DR. CHOPPER, is what I refer to as ... absolute crap. Nothing about it is nice - the acting sucks, the characters suck, the murderer sucks, the gore is minimal ... and sucks. It's about a group of colleagues going to a newly discovered family cabin owned by one of the kids' parents. It is meant to be a relaxing retreat, but little know they are a deadly sick, former plastic surgeon, along with his two female assistants, looking for useful tissue to rescue the doctor. His name is dr. Chopper, as he is riding on a motorcycle and, of course, heels. It's just a terrible movie, not worth somebody's time. Enough said.
