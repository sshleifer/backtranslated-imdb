I made this movie for fifty cents to go out of business sales. I want my fifty cents back. Bad acting, poor writing, lousy direction, historically inaccurate, even the sound of the movie is terrible. It is not the subject of offense. I am one of the many who find tracking movies and real crime films very interesting. The subject could be treated more seriously, with much more attention to detail and accuracy, and the lack of respect shown to the victims and their devastated friends and family is enough to puzzle anyone. Little or no attention was given to what someone might have done to perform the bizarre behavior that Ed Gein displayed to act upon these terrible crimes. <br /> <br /> Save your time and common sense. Don't watch this horrible movie. If you bought it, you have my sympathy. However, this is not a total waste ... you can throw the disc and use the plastic container!
