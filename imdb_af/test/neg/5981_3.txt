What a waste of a good role. Blessed, I want to clear it up, because it looks like a good stoner comedy with pretty well-known actors. What it seems to be was a senseless collection of boring intricate stories about various characters with minimal connectivity. Characters that start to look like decent people, but don't end up with a single nice or interesting feature among them. To call it a comedy was also a piece. The only thing that made me do was Jack Black's song. It was basically Tenacious D. I was waiting for something big, but eventually nothing more than 97 minutes of my life messed up. .
