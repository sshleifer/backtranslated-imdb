I'm not so old that I can't remember laughing Bobcat Goldthwait a few times. But some in all his years of drug abuse, he lost his sense of humor and his brain cells. <br /> <br /> From the moment this movie opens, you can't have any sympathy or empathy for the female head. Also, you will find nothing but funny after hearing the opening style. Of course, Goldthwait hates himself so much that he has to break down to feel better - even if it's his own imaginary characters he breaks down. <br /> <br /> If you've ever seen the Shown Shakes, you know how fit Bobcat was 15 years ago. This movie is worse. It wasn't accidentally funny. It is sad, pathetic and a total waste of time. May Goldthwaits's hands be paralyzed so he can't write another script. Stop his tongue so he can't dictate another unfunny scene. He is sad and pathetic and has to make way for a new talent who dies in Hollywood
