Every movie I got, because Leonard Maltin praised it on the air, blew bits! Every single one! When will I ever learn? <br /> <br /> Evie is a cute old bag that doesn't think she's dying of breast cancer to get her way! Laura is an impenetrable Medusa filled with the Holy Spirit (and her husband's protégé)! Caught among these harps is Medusa's stupid-as-a-rock boy being pushed by The Old Bag. When I said, when will I ever learn? <br /> <br /> I was temporarily removed from my malaise when The Old Bag stuck her head in a sink, but unfortunately she didn't die. I was temporarily removed from my malaise when Medusa crashed, but unfortunately she didn't die. It must be a capital offense to torture audiences like this! <br /> <br /> Without kicking Harry Potter, Rupert Grint is just a few big blue eyes sticking out of his sockets. Julie Walters' art of chewing (especially the scene when she plays' God ') is even more shameless than her character. <br /> <br /> At least this Harold pops a bimbo instead of Maude. For that I am very grateful. And if you have this Mr. Read Maltin, you owe me $ 3.99!
