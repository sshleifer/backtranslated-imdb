If Jacqueline McKenzie and John Lynch were not as talented actors, this movie would probably be even worse than it really was. The story of two mentally disturbed people who fall in love and have a baby is an interesting one, and worth exploring. On the downside, the plot is becoming increasingly over the top, as the story progresses, and the music choices are becoming increasingly bizarre, so at the end I laughed at my knowledge that the director is planning to cry.
