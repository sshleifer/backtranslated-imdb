Not to be confused with the 1943 George Zucco movie "The Mad Ghoul," "The Mad Monster" is a film that Zucco appeared the previous year. In this reasonable paint-by-number affair, Zucco makes a way to turn his dull, handcrafted man, Petro, into a wolf / male hybrid through wolf's blood injections and then doesn't waste time sending the transformed doofus to death to make. former colleagues mocking his experiments. It's a very simple plot, really, and an extremely low-budget production. Glenn Strange, who plays the man / wolf here, will soon become better acquainted with the Franky monster in films such as "House of Frankenstein" (1944) and "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948). The makeup work on him here is pretty lame, and only manages to look like a hippie with bad teeth (like the one in 1957's "Teenage Monster"). The sets in this movie are also quite inconsistent, and the unbundling is sudden and unconvincing. I gave the movie a very generous 4 stars, partly because I have a lasting love for 1940's horror movies, but the truth to tell, most objective viewers will probably consider it laughable, and I think it is. It's certainly not a well-made universal thing or masterpiece of Val Lewton, that's for sure! Still, Zucco is always fun to watch, even in fearless piffs like this. If you can save 72 minutes of your life, I think you might be worse than "The Mad Monster" (not too much worse, of course!). Oh ... another thing. This DVD is from Alpha Video, and you know what it means: fuzzy images, lousy sound (indeed, the worst sound of any Alpha Video DVD I've received so far) and no extras. You have been warned!
