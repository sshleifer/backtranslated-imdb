Andrew Gurland's "Cheats" is his fictitious "true story" of four high school friends who have ways to cheat on tests. The quartet is: superior school trial Trevor Fehrman (like Handsome Davis), his equally good colleague Matthew Lawrence (as Victor), their chubby school hearing Chum Elden Henson (as Sammy) and crooked geekster Martin Starr (as Applebee). The adults include high-team North Point principal Mary Tyler Moore (such as Stark) and porn-loving father Griffin Dunne (like Davis). The highlight begins with Mr. Fehrman and Mr. Lawrence who allegedly urinates on a teacher's grade book. Put this one at the bottom of the pile; And, thank you, it's not on someone's permanent record. <br /> <br /> *** Cheats (2002) Andrew Gurland ~ Trevor Fehrman, Matthew Lawrence, Elden Henson
