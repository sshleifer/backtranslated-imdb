This movie is perfect for more than the cute zombie lovers. It's a movie you can laugh from the play to the horrible zombie action. That said, I gave it a 4 out of 10 for effort cos horror is a hard genre to make. go down the list, the bad points of this movie were as follows. <br /> <br /> #Bad make up # terrible sound and sound effects # very bad continuity #cheesy dialogue # one song played by the whole movie #stein couldn Don't act and I think one of the worst I saw has. # horrible end #racist moment and steal Simpson's character named <br /> <br /> the good points # good costume # police officers had the best acting operator # The actors with fewer lines or small roles look better. Good effort with gore. <br /> <br /> I don't want bad mouth the movie, it's funny to watch cos of these bad points and I think that's what makes this movie OK. If it was better, I don't think it will be made any difference, but it won't be interesting to see a remake with the same casting, as I believe it has improved over the last 7 years.
