Personally, I didn't really get much of the bill to see with his own eyes. I noticed a lot of highly rated reviews here for the movie, and I'm so surprised. Maybe I missed something that other reviewers felt "moved", but I found the movie very boring and basically useless. <br /> <br /> The "action" of the movie is a bunch of autopsy material made in an "art house style - very extreme close-ups, strange editing, etc ... and with no sound or dialogue. <br /> <br /> I think the act of seeing one's own eyes can be regarded as a study of human anatomy, or perhaps (if you really want to dig a little) a kind of comment on the fragility of mankind or whatever - but I personally found it to be a lot of semi-interesting but ultimately dull autopsy footage, and if that is your thing, it will be a winner for you Like me - I've seen more interesting ER recordings, not a "bad" movie, because it's not really a "movie" in any traditional sense - I just didn't find anything about it - 4/10.
