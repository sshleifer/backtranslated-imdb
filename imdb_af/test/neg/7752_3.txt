Albert Pyun presents his vision of the lost city of Atlantis - and it is a vision so cramped with claustrophobic institutions, strange costumes and noisy, "strange" little characters that one thing is certain: you want to get the hell out of there so possible (unfortunately it will take about 80 minutes). The Alice in Wonderland-type story is winding and uninteresting, and there was probably no actress in the world who could change it into a good movie, although Kathy made Ireland an enticing (annoying voice and all) attempt.
