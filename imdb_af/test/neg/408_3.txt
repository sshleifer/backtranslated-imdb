Angels and Demons: 3 out of 10: Clearly there's something bad about Ron Howard. I don't know exactly, but something went very wrong. <br /> <br /> Howard has always been a decent workman director. While never being neglected for an artistic savant, both Cinderella Man and Apollo were 13 excellent films. Parenting was pretty good and even Angels and Demons prequel / sequel. The Da Vinci code was a fun skirt. In addition, none of his films is completely awful. (Note, I also didn't see the Grinch Stolen Christmas or his latest movie Heidi Montag Say No to Plastic.) What more Howard managed to maintain this quality is such conceivable genres as star-driven Oscar bait (a beautiful thought), star-driven costume drama (Far and Away), star-driven revenge fantasy (Ransom) and comedy about prostitution and mermaids (Night Shift, Splash). <br /> <br /> In the middle, Angels and Demons is a poorly-directed and shooting movie. Screens are too dark, camera angles are wrong, the actors block each other's shots and the whole thing is often out of focus. Then the telling of an already confusing story is even more obscured. <br /> <br /> Dan Brown gets a lot of picks, but I found the Da Vinci Code a nice readable skirt (so sue me). The movie version of the Da Vinci code remains the same, where they go to the next sphere of the book and adds an attractive cast and attractive location shooter. <br /> <br /> Angels and demons, however, occur in the claustrophobic constraints of Vatican City and since Howard is not allowed to film in many of the right places, we end up with a lot of running around for a CGI back party . The whole movie is as if Rick Steves made a special Vatican City and instead of visiting the Holy City and showing his camera, Rick Lego bricks had to be used and a second-hand art book with all the tits deleted. <br /> <br /> While the Da Vinci code I still think is an intriguing central mystery (again suing me), the devils and angels story consist of a plot of the Illuminati (role eyes now) to destroy the Vatican. Their idea was to take positions in schools for the deaf around the world and rape every student in the ass. Oops me bad; apparently the Vatican doesn't need any help on that one. <br /> <br /> In any case, they plan to infiltrate Europe's Big Hadron Collider, kill the main priest and steal three vials of Anti-matter. It asks more than a few questions. Can the Hadron Collider create anti-matter? Can you capture the anti-case as soon as it is created? Why does the EU collect it? (Maybe they fear a Godzilla attack?). Why does the head of Anti-matter gather a Vatican priest? Now if they get the anti-case, will they use the incredible destructive power to take over the world? no, but not joke; Unfortunately, the Illuminati hasn't yet understood that Pinky and Brain level of sophistication. Instead, the current pope is just dead and it is concave time. The best seed cardinals for the last four Pope tournament are all kidnapped and the Illuminati killed one by one Seven Style. They are good sport, but clues remain with every murder like a Latin theme puzzle. Oh, and the last kidnapped cardinal has the anti-case and if he is not found in time, Rick Steves must go straight to Venice next year to see decent frescoes. If only a Latin theme was Batman to save the day ??? Okay, the story is really awful and it is badly told, but maybe it's one of those movies that are saved by great performances. A true character study? (Okay, you know where it's going). Tom Hanks gives an incredible wood performance and just looks terrible (he's too old to play the character for about twenty years.) His love interest Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer has zero chemistry with Hanks or the screen. Ewan Macgregor plays the Easter's personal assistant / cabana boy as an Irish man who seems to be breaking into a musical number at any moment, as nobody steals his Lucky Charms. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Stellan Skarsg√•rd puts a good turn as head of Vatican Security and, as far as is known, no deaf children were raped while making this movie that made it to his Vatican critics place in at least one area.
