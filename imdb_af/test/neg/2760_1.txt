I was forced to read this juicy "love story" between a German 24-year-old POW and a 12-year-old Jew. It has written "political correctness" everywhere. Its kind of like the movie "Spirit" in which a horse wants to be free, but those "evil" Americans won't leave it because they need it. Well, I have good news that the Americans are angry with the German soldier and his summer book. Why !!! Horses given to us by God and if the Americans need a horse can be used well. In the same sense, the Germans tried to kill Americans, but this book / movie makes it good! The casting is absolutely horrible !!!!!!!!!!!! The girl is Hispanic the mother is white, the father is probubly of mostly white descent and the little sister is "shirley templish." The acting is also bad, the serious parts are comedy! Concluson Bad movie, bad book, but both have different ends, don't read or see one!
