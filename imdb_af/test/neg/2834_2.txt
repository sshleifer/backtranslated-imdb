I love Brian Yuzna's other work, even rough stuff like 'Necronomicon', but 'Nakomie' was too much, even for me. My main complaint is that it is unnecessarily exploiting Jillian McWhirter's nudity. I'm not a prude, but this naked scene just dragged on and off ... just to culminate (almost every time) in a tawdry * wink, nudge * insinuation of sexual violence. The scene where she tries to put on a coat after a few minutes is a good example. Arnold Vosloo's "performance" is quite agitated, but even Jeffrey Coombs could not save this festering hope of a movie. The strangers are boring, the uniform dull lighting juice your interest, and the plot is absolutely predictable. The only highlights for me were a brief overview of the strangers' true form (very nice model) and the scene where Vosloo finds his wife in the closet was also good. But you're warned.
