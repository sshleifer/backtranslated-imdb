You have to see it. I couldn't stop laughing at the stupidities I saw in this movie, even after the event. There may be a million individual errors and stupidity in this movie. The acting is bad. The story is so predictable and flat. The effects are like 50 years old. The alleged thriller is nowhere. You will not enjoy the movie, but you will laugh at it and enjoy laughing afterwards. We had a good time after the movie. Really. My friend and I talked the whole 40 minute bus journey home to this movie as we saw the next Oscar winner. Unfortunately, we talked about all the bad things we just saw.
