I got it in The Horror Six-Pack from Echo Bridge Home Entertainment. This one is not the worst movie ever made, but it still sucks. In fact, this movie sucks so hard, I don't know how to write this review, especially since 1. I knocked it out of the DVD player because I couldn't even see a second and 2. Hurricane friggin 'I come and God knows how long it will take me to do this review. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a scientist and his wife. The scientist receives a valuable artefact and investigates it as this so-called Urban Legend known as the Skeleton Man kills him, and later on his wife. Then ... <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but there's really not much else I can say about this POS, except, please. I'm currently using the disc as a coaster, and if you see it, you might want to do the same. Casper Van Dien and Michael Rooker need cash ... BADLY! <br /> <br /> PS. I'd pretty much review the movies in the boxset and can do a new review on Ghoulies IV.
