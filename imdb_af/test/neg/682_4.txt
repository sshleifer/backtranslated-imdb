After watching the movie, I feel the father and mother are both reasonable people, though not perfect at all. On the contrary, I don't like the writer and his two sisters. <br /> <br /> Is a person's journal an accurate portrait of herself? No. Most of the time people only write problems in her journal because she wants to solve the problem. Such a magazine is always a more negative side of a person. In this movie, the author reviews his mother's life through her magazine. Not a wise choice. <br /> <br /> The author's older sister is so ugly, external and internal. First, she said her father's second marriage was "not fair" for her mother. Then she said she didn't like her mother. So, she doesn't love both father and mother. I doubt she loves someone in the world. Her face is so ugly, just a reflection of her heart. Through the film, I feel the author and his sisters are lacking in love and respect for their parents. However, I feel the father is mother, loves their children, even the author tries to portray them as a cold, deceitful person.
