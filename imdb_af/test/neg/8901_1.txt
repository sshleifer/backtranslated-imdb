If this movie won the Lumiere Best French Language Film Award, what kind of garbage will be out of France these days? <br /> <br /> The subject is an important one - how the African economies are held as economic hostages by the international organizations they need to help, namely the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. About 40% of government budgets from various African countries are going to pay Western debt while their people suffer from illness, dehydration, and illiteracy. <br /> <br /> ... but the subject was dealt with in the driest way that can be devised by the drier than the Sahara, which surrounds the country of Mali where this film takes place. More monotone and action-defect than any documentary I've ever seen (and I'm a fan of the genre), comes a witness to the others ahead in this "film" "trial" captured by the world condemns Bank and IMF. Some critics may put the colorful visuals in the film, but they were off-guard and had no complementary soundtrack when they were on the screen. They should be better in a coffee table book than in this movie. <br /> <br /> Even the characters in the movie say something like "This trial is boring" and "When will it be over?" Everyone in the theater laughed. Were those people on the screen reading our thoughts? <br /> <br /> Danny Glover had a short look in this movie. It's a television movie in "Bamako" and it was in Morocco or Mali. It was also more ridiculous than any spaghetti western I've ever tried to avoid. The only saving part of these five wasted minutes was where a Caucasian bad man accidentally carries an African woman who wears a baby and shows no remorse whatsoever. Perhaps it was to symbolize the insensitivity of the World Bank and how it continually killed the Afrikaners. <br /> <br /> And one last technical farewell shot, the captions were difficult to read with so many light colors on the screen and not enough black sketch to the captions themselves. <br /> <br /> I've summed up the movie for you. Don't be fooled by the hype. No need to watch this movie. You will never get these two hours back in your life.
