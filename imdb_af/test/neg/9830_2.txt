If you ever want to know more about taxi drivers, then this is a great movie to watch, just for information. I can only hear it: 'Wait, wait a minute! Why not follow a taxi driver all day! Cabbies are funny, and so are the people they meet, and they only talk to each other for a few minutes, so the other actors must be cheap! Harry, you take care of the production, Joan, you have stuff, Brian, you go on a few plays and we'll all meet tomorrow tomorrow to start filming! "<br /> <br /> The first 90% of the movie could not have been worse if that thing happened. At least with no planning whatsoever, there is always the element of surprise that can be found. Jim Carrey's movies have added stuff as they go, and they always do well at the cashiers, the problem here is that the first 90% are pretty well written, and it is hard to beat, and Paul Dillon plays the taxi driver in Chicago. All day working, we see pretty much what he sees, people come in and out of his car and drive around town, he speaks a few seconds for those people and then we get even more people. <br /> <br / > I will admit, there were a few funny pieces here and there. A religious family is trying to talk to the taxi driver to go with them, he takes a pregnant woman and her husband to hospital, breaks A rich businessman from his girlfriend, a poor girlfriend from her boyfriend and a victim victim, I think the morale of d The movie is that a cabin driver is more than a cabin driver and has a greater sphere of influence over the lives of his passengers than you originally imagined. For some, he is just a way of coming from here, but for others, she helps many ordinary words towards their lives. <br /> <br /> The last passenger of the day is used to make sense of the rest of the movie, and to a small extent it succeeds. It had a bit of deathbed remorse, which sucks the good majority of the movie and then eventually tries to make it all better in just one or two changes. I wasn't too impressed with the movie as a whole, but there were a few pieces that were worth looking at again. As for the actors, Paul Dillon is. John Cusack, Gillian Anderson and Julianne Moore are all here in about 30 seconds, but don't look for any of them, or you'll be disappointed. I will give the other people that it is not your usual movie they produced here, but it was not a very good one either. There just wasn't enough material to hold you for an hour and a half. It was a decent effort, but it didn't look like it.
