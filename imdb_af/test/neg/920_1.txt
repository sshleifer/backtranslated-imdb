It's absolutely terrible. It's everywhere and nowhere and has no point. I've never understood what's good about Jeff Garlin or Sarah Silverman. Bonnie Hunt is so above this track, she had to be personal friends with people involved, because there was no way she'd read any part of this so-called "script" and thought. "Yes, I want to do it!" Most movies can find at least one or two things that are redeemable or funny. There are NEWS in this. This is extremely stupid. There is really no other word to describe it. This is probably the biggest waste of money on film I've seen for a long time. Save it at all costs, you'll be glad you did.
