'Tycus' is almost as bad as a science fiction movie can go. <br /> <br /> I can't get anything good about this movie. The premises are completely wrong. A comet is planning to hit the Moon and cause catastrophic damage to Earth, but no one believes the scientist is predicting it. " An entire underground city, plus a nuclear weapons pilot, is being built in the California mountains without anyone noticing it. When the comet comes near the Earth, it makes the news to the TV and newspapers scarcely a day before the event. And so on, and so on ... <br /> <br /> No kind of emotion puts it on the screen either. Is the genius discovering the comet and building the underground city a savior of man or animal? The director or Dennis Hooper who plays the role did not decide whether the movie was done and actually did not matter because the acting and directing were so confusing that you ended up wondering what the film was trying to say. The special effects are so inexpensive that it can not only be convincing in the era of computer effects, but even in the 50's, four decades before the film could not be convincing. <br /> <br /> A total waste of time.
