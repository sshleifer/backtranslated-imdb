Hilariously inept - like "She Wore A Yellow Ribbon" created by five-year-olds. <br /> <br /> Launching Spoilers: Despite its title and high physique, "Slaughter Trail" is indeed a musical with Injun battles instead of dance numbers. <br /> <br /> If you've ever wondered what Ed Wood might have done with a B movie budget, this movie should answer your question. Some decisions may only be bad in retrospect, such as the filming of the transient Cinecolor process, which led the face to change its face within the same shot. But there were definitely some bad attacks on the movie's main set, a cavalry fort that is partly a Norman castle. Terry Gilkyson, who later became The Bare Necessities for Disney's "The Jungle Book", offers a full-fledged diner score that would have been great for a cartoon, but which suits Western action like a fuzzy slipper in solid band. One song tells how "hooves pound, and their melody sounds, like the main cattle serenade" ... during a dead-serious scene of a cavalry patrol. Other songs literally tell the story shot by shots, introduce characters, describing their moods and gestures - as they happen on the screen - and even stop advertising the Cinecolor process (!) <br /> <br / > The script sends disgusting Navajos on the war road to avenge the death of two of their band by a ban on trio. By the end of the movie, it looks like a hundred Navajos and cavalry have bitten the dust (thanks to repeated footage of the same characters dying over and over.) But the head is happy to see the bad lions trio killed. As the singer is helpful to those of us who do not pay attention, the Navajos drive away, their battle is turned off. The cavalry captain, surrounded by the bodies of his fallen comrades, watches with genuine appreciation. <br /> <br /> The direction can be described most charitively as wood, or more to the point, Woods. Navajos is shot in pairs from their horses - never just one. Almost every red man on foot dies by throwing and chewing his hands in the air. The movie also uses the most cautious stunt people in Hollywood, who crawled before falling off a one-story roof (and still don't stop landing) or turn to look behind them as they "die" in a rocky slope. slipping. br /> <br /> The star is Brian Donlevy, who surely deserves an Oscar not to blush. After the endless final battle scene, "climax" is hardly the word - he scans a list of the dozens of troops killed and shoulders, "It could have been a lot worse." Trooper Andy Devine gets to sing and assassin / killer Gig Young laughs at Andy's assassination ... which protrudes a character held by masked bandits to eradicate Gig: "I want to know what laughs!" <br /> <br /> And so no one just forgets what a nasty piece of work Howard Hughes can be, remember it as head of RKO, Hughes was first in line to blacklist original star Howard Da Silva when HUAC condemned him has. It will take Hughes another six years to run the one-time celebrated studio in the ground, but it didn't help when he insisted that Da Silva replace every scene for this movie, with Donlevy replacing it. <br /> <br /> It was almost a decade before Da Silva could work in Hollywood again. But everything he had considered, to get Hughes a thank-you letter, didn't have to get rid of the "Slaw path".
