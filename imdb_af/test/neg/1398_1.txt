This is the most regrettable excuse for a comedy show I've ever seen. I am ashamed that this man has given his own performance. It smells of complete and absolute despair on the side of the comedy center, and tries to fill the void of the talented and incomparable Dave Chapelle. He's a tip out of Ned's comedy gold pocket: Isn't a punchline funny? Should this give the extra pressure in hilariousness? F *** ING YELL IT WITHIN YOUR LOW. Simple, no? And as an added bonus .... half your jokes end with ... THERE'S YOU RE-TAH-DED !! or DUH-DU-DUUUUHHHH! Oh man. So funny. Beaner ... hilarious. Wetback .... stop the laugh ever? <br /> <br /> To illustrate my point in a more cerebral way, I will call an example. Mencia jokes about how "delayed" it is to rebuild New Orleans, because it is so close to the water. Genie. The distinction between a large comedian and a hack has never been so clearly drawn. While a good comedian will find hidden humor in the tragedy, find subtle ways to weave a joke into something we can all laugh at and get into the heart. Ned is obvious. Move the city. Great. Wait, is it funny? Ned does not have the intellectual ability to find the deepest meaning of things. The hurricane did not flood the city. The livestock project was underfunded and in serious need of federal dollars ... and look! They broke. I think it's God's way of telling us that we shouldn't be there. After all, he has a place in the congress. What a fool. <br /> <br /> Chapelle was a master to make a brave breed of comic twist on his head. He was effortless on it, and we laughed at all points with him. While Mencia talks about black people who can't swim, * Chapelle took it 300 meters further with the black and blind white super-midsist. You don't have to be. You must be original. <br /> <br /> Mencia and its legions fans are like those who are a gay man, who are all too emphatically laughing at gay jokes, and think it somehow masks his own uncertainty. Except, of course, with Ned, he laughs too emphatically at the "delays". Du-du-duuuuh.
