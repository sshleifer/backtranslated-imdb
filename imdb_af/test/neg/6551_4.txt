Another of the thin stories along with most forgotten music numbers. Powell and O'Keefe as fighters are quite forgetful. However, there are two shining moments. Hubert Castle is the most amazing hit you will ever see - his drunk on the wire must be the spectacular piece of balance ever recorded on film. He must be seen to be believed. The other is Sophie Tucker to make a turn near the end of the movie. Her magnetism, her professionalism, her sheer talent to be herself - well, charisma is not taught - you have it or you do. A wonderful lesson for all will-cabaret artists. A sad note: W.C. Fields in his last movie cameo are completely forgotten.
