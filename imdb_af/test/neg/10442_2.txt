Now from all the shark movies I've seen, take this one! The plot of the movie was good, but the excitement factor followed. Antonio Sobato, Jr. does an excellent role as a boy looking for the shark his father killed. A megaldon is one of the biggest sharks of all and also the most dangerous. The view of the shark was frightening in some respects, but the effects were faded, and the scenes were slightly weak in some places. With the mini-sub weapons there, there will be a whole school of sharks out there. It was wonderful that the boy would get the exact revenge on that monstrosity, even if it would cost him his life. As they say revenge has it, but was it worth it? That answer could go on and on, and this movie was a great fall. The start was good, and in the end it went like the Titanic. 1 out of 5 stars!
