Eddie Fischer was simply bad. Perhaps the worst scene came early in the movie when he was concentrated in a spontaneous song and dance number around a piano and some conveniently placed employees. The song was completely silly. I think I can offer some lines drunk on a sheet of paper that surpasses it and will probably win a Grammy. Then, as if the writers couldn't get a better way to escape the ridicule of the scene, Fischer says something with the result: "Don't tell (insert the man's name). He doesn't like music" and smile. I can't describe how bad it is, I felt a bit embarrassed. And those old Debbie Reynolds work together and who is always on her attack is also so annoying. I can't even imagine somebody pretending to waste some time on him. The jokes were delivered without any kind of chemistry between characters the movie made. At least the baby has cute hair. The two stars are for Reynolds, who were like a swan among ugly ducklings. <br /> <br /> See Bachelor Mother instead.
