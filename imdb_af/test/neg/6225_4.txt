Relentlessly like one of those hard action movies. The whole cast seems to be on speed. I didn't have the director's intention, if any. I wonder if she ever saw a Stanley Donen, Vincent Minnelli or even a George Sidney musical. Structure, please! It is a hell of a mess and I loved Abba. The costumes are unobstructed photography - budding to the actors but love the places.) The one thing that makes the whole thing tolerable is the view of Meryl Streep who makes herself foolish. No chemistry with her friends (Christine Baranski and Julie Walters) think of Streep with Lily Tomlyn in the Altman movie and you will understand what I was hoping for. I was particularly embarrassed by Pierce Brosnam and Colin Firth. The audience, however, looked like it was, it's probably just me.
