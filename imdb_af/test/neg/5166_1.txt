A totally pathetic effort to film about the sacrifices of Australian soldiers during the New Guinea campaign. Total waste of money, even if you just watch it on DVD. Fortunately, the video store provided a free weekly rental with the DVD, otherwise it would be a total waste of money. Probably made by arty types and full of symbolism that look like today's Chardonay socialists. Honestly, this movie is an insult to the remembrance of the brave cask that never returned. Someone please provide the money to make a decent movie, at least equal to Private Ryan. Hopefully the RSL will place as much distance between him and this film as possible. The story has to be told from all sides of the Australians, the locals and the Japanese. Although the latter is telling the truth about anything that happened during the Second World War, it is highly unlikely. Basically his rubbish, don't see it, don't buy it. Run away
