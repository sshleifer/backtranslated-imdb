Last night I sat to see that this movie is being played in Greek television because of the upcoming Olympic Games offered by my city. Knowing that this is an American movie, I have already expected to focus more on the American athletics story. And I was really ready for it. But what I saw was ... too much! I mean, if a movie has such a title ("First Olympic Games: Athens 1896"), even of American origin, you wouldn't expect it to be so propaganda. at the same time, ignorant of other countries' athletes and efforts. The American athletes have all the gifts of nature (strength, smartness, generosity, friendliness, politeness ...), as opposed to their sin-athletes in the Games that apparently can't even speak, speak their thoughts or express feelings. The number of times the American anthem is played during the film must be an everyday record in filmography. Mevalomania at its best! It even uses fictitious facts that ridicule the Greek nation, such as Greek citizens who serve foreign Marathon athletes with wine to help the domestic to win the race. So much for the Olympic spirit. Think about it. and a bad point for a movie whose title is also Greek is something that doesn't make me happy at all according to what I've seen, I can't give it more than 4 out of 10 (it's actually generous).
