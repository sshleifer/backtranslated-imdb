Like his close contemporaries "The Great Race" and "Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines", I always associate this movie with my childhood, especially on New Year. On New Year's Day we want to visit my grandmother and after lunch, while the adults have spoken, the kids will watch TV where ever one of these three crazy racing movies will be. <br /> <br /> For that reason alone, I really wanted to mark "Monte Carlo Or Bust", but I fear I can't, the child is not the man on this occasion. What I mean, I can clearly see his mistakes and while sometimes being dismissed to smile, I really wanted all the participants to come to the end of the race long before they actually do. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is dated by the stereotyping of nationalities and women as the weaker generation, and I have not paid much attention to one or two stray, albeit mildly, vulgarities that sometimes turned up. More than that, although the movie, despite its disaster, the movie doesn't sell enough. Tony Curtis, in a trial run for his "Yank Abroad", turns into the TV series "The Persuaders" seems too old to play the young man. Terry Thomas just isn't scary enough. Eric Sykes is incredible as a dirty thought Lothario while Gert Frobe is an exaggerated Teuton, is just strange to do camp comedy if you remember he is Bond's best villain Goldfinger. If the English is the best, Susan Hampshire is anyway a "shiny little thing", which is doing well like a sturdy flap and although it is tied to Pete and Dud's writing, it offers the most entertainment as stiff upper lip armies, although even the "Carry On" team did so much better in "Carry On Up The Khyber Pass". <br /> <br /> Director Annakin tries everything to call the "Golden Silents", with slapstick lashings, wrong IDs, fast camera shots, dramatic stunts and some light romance, but there is no real tension for such a famous race and anyway the race at the end seems like another swizz. <br /> <br /> Actually, I would have given it another point if they held onto the alternative title "Those Magnificent Men in Their Jaunty Jalopies", but in fact the animated series "Wacky Races" has made it so much better done.
