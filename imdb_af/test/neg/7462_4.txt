Slow, strange movie dragging and plods (I mean really PLODS) along with its disappointing climax. You might expect a kind of punchline at the end, but there's nothing. Both Milland and Snodgress are uncomfortable; In fact, the film's strangeness can actually be the only thing it's about. The overall atmospheric score has some absurd parts (such as the music played during the first appearance of a monkey), and there is a really horrible fantasy scene that includes a gorilla. (**)
