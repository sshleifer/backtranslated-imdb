The original review I planned for this movie might be a bit too hard, so I'll predict the good thing: Sleepy Hollow is a perfectly acceptable beer and pizza or sleeping movie, the kind you watch with " a good group of people when the mood is light and nobody really focuses on the movie. The visual elements are beautiful and so nice, in parts. But horror, my friends, it's not. I made the mistake of checking if it expected anything on the side with all the lights off. If this is your intention, send me a personal message and I will provide you with a list of alternative recommendations. (This is a serious offer, incidentally. True horror fans deserve better.) Now my complaints, complete with SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS. Why even bother making a movie based on a classic story if you don't even try to stay true to the original sense, feel, tone or theme? Listen carefully between the lines of poorly written dialogue and you will hear the slow shit of Washington Irving rolling over in his grave. I'll even accept the Big City Detective bit, but ... Ricci's bedding-hexes bed around? Come on. Not only is it as vague as in "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow", but it's historical BUNK. I don't care what neo-pagan ax you have to grind, but in the 18th century "witchcraft" meant to sell your soul to the devil in exchange for diabolic forces; This all-fluffy white-witch goddess worship "an 'it-harm-none" approach to witchcraft dates back to the British invasion. (Parties interested in real old-school pagan practices refer to James Frazer's "The Golden Bough", if you don't believe me.) It creates such an indomitable element that is cast in the context of the movie that the framework of the sleepy hollow legend is shattered. So we totally end up with a completely different story. If it was Burton's idea, I wish he'd warned us beforehand. I also wish he would get a better story than the hereafter pedestrian. And he can also completely drop the Irving pretensions. And anyway, the movie isn't scary. Not once. Not at all. The twisted tree came close, but was more than opposed by the laughter effect of the Hessian's farce-comedy bellow. And finally, yes, I wanted Christina Ricci also for Christmas, but God never meant her to be a blonde.
