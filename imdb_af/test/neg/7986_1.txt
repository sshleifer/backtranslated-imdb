Thomas Edison has made many great inventions, but WTF is! I'm sorry, but this movie is just awful. The plot is that this elephant goes to a certain point and is uprooted. Good The image quality looks like someone used it for toilet paper. I thought the early Charlie Chaplin movies were horrible. Okay, Thomas Edison, could have been an inventor, but why did he make this movie. He could have fed a baby, and it would have been better. People can say I'm heavy at times, but if you'd like to enjoy something like this I said Edison could have made the light bulb, but why did he make this special movie. Well, I can feel like a full hole, but watch it on Youtube. Then you will see this abomination. I still can't believe this movie, it's totally awful. All in all, the worst short film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10
