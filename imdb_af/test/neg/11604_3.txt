Alfred Hitchcock made this crime story in 1941, but his heart didn't seem to be in it. Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery are the couple who discover that they were never legally married and have spent the film returning to true love. It doesn't have much reputation and it's easy to see why. The jokes are known for better movies, but they didn't lie here. And the lead is uncharismatic. Lombard's performance is cleaved and starchy and it is double sad to think she died just a year later. Robert Montgomery seems to know he's in a saw's case and tries his damn to make his wallet out of it without much success. The best performance comes from Gene Raymond as "the other man" (he has a beautiful drunk scene). This is one of the few very bad Hitchcock movies.
