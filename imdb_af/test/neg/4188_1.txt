My spoiler is in my pants because I think about this movie made me so angry. I cut myself. <br /> <br /> After watching it, you're staring at the TV series in confusion and horror. Then there is a soft tap on your shoulder and a voice shouts: "You will die seven days." You turn around and one of your best friends is there with a look of absolute hatred for the one who presented this movie when you were in Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> I won't lie: it's the worst movie on the face of the earth. I saw it with 5 of my friends, all 18-year-old guys, and that was our reaction: -And a person actually started crying and knocking himself. One person shouted and went out. A person got up and knocked out the front door more than an hour later. One person just became black (this one was me). One person started chatting incoherently, as if he had both cerebral palsy and Touretts syndrome. One person went into a kind of catatonic trance and didn't react to our voices for more than twenty minutes <br /> <br /> The movie is really that bad. There is one part where the delayed cameraman is actually going to travel (while the camera is being held), but the producers decided to leave it. You can hear him seriously and swear when he hits the ground. There is only one special effect, and it is special that a delayed child trying to solve a Rubix cube is special: the camera turns so that the screen action (action, n. A few dumbass in a lost wheat field for 80 freaking minutes). <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances should this be watched, and the film itself warns you of this fact. Do you know what the tagline is on the back? "Some warnings should not be ignored." I honestly think the release of this film to the public is a sick practical joke on the producer's part. However, it doesn't mean you have to pass it on, if you see it at the movie shop - it will put on the shelf for some other bad sucker to see. Rather buy each copy of it, then you can take your hands and send it to people you hate.
