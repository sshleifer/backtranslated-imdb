Yes, absolutely terrible, and it comes from someone who loves bad movies - but there is a limit. I enjoy all kinds of horror / suspense movies, and have seen a wonderful work by European filmmakers. Broceliands are unfortunately not among those wonderful pieces of movies. The camera work is worse than amateurish. Not the fashionable, shaky MTV "cameraman needs to work on Ritalin type camera, so many movie makers use to camouflage their lack of talent. It's just bad frame composition and terrible image composition. The acting is over if it's not quite two-dimensional. The dialogues are stilted and unnatural - even more so than your usual walk-of-the-mill horror / suspense movie that becomes pseudo-mysticism. I think most of me were the most horrible choreographed fight scenes at the end of the movie. It was bad that it was ridiculous. I've seen what a small budget can do, and it can do wonders. It was just bad movies. Very, very sad.
