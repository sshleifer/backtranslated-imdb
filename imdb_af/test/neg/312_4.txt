On Halloween, a town is being terrorized by a madman with a big pumpkin for a head. Bad actions have particularly compromised local talent and lower special special effects. B-movie queen Linnea Quigley looks embarrassed to be part of this one and even her considerable charm that has helped so much of her other films cannot help this one. Pass this cheesy flick if you are looking for a good Halloween horror movie and hire "Night of the Demons" which also stares me. Quigley dies.
