Ben, (Rupert Grint), is a very unhappy adolescent, the son of his unhappy parents. His father, (Nicholas Farrell), is a minister and his mother, Laura Linney, is ... well, let's just say she's a somewhat hypocritical soldier in the army of Jesus. It's only when he works for a summer as an assistant to a well-known, eccentric, one-time, famous and now-forgotten actress, Evie Walton, (Julie Walters), that he finally finds himself in the "Harold and Maude" fashion. Of course, Evie is very unhappy and it is only when these two sad bags find each other that they can put their mutual misery aside and hit the road to happiness. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's wheat and sentimental and very predictable, but it has a tough side to it, and Walters, who can sleep as she wants, is excellent. It's when she puts the madness on one side and finds the pathos in the character (like hitting the bottle and throwing it in the sink), that she's the best. The problem is that she's the only interesting character in the movie (and that's not because of the writing that no one favors). Gravel, on the other hand, is not only unhappy; He is also a drill, while Linney's dotted bitch is completely one-dimensional. (Yet she has the English accent of the pat). The best that can be said is that it is generously pleasing - with the emphasis on lights.
