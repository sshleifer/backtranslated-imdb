It's absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen. I hope the real family and other characters have portrayed, lawyers have challenged hell from VH1 to portray it. The acting is terrible, the writing is worse and the portrayal of characters is frightening. It's supposed to be a drama, but it was a comedy for me, you have no choice but to laugh at the bad acting. I usually like Flex Alexander, but this time he missed the point completely. <br /> <br /> You might argue that he took this role for some himself because it was so terrible. If you really want a dramatic movie for the night, DO NOT CHOOSE THIS. But if you're in for a couple, laugh at bad acting and writing silly, agree. Other than that, don't waste your time.
