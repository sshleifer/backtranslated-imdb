You know, I have no idea how everyone's teenage life was, but it doesn't reflect the people I knew and sat with me alone. And just in case you are wondering .. NO .. we weren't pristine / clean cut / pat boone type teenagers. (If ever there was one !!!!) <br /> <br /> Look, I'm not saying a teenager is easy. The better, actually, the BEST teenage movie of this time is "Fast Times at Ridgemont High". Now the kids I knew were as realistic as it was then (and maybe now). <br /> <br /> It was a crap. It was a low rent version of Fast Times and even then it didn't do much to me. It had a few moments, but not enough for me to recommend it, or even claim: "That's how it was for teenagers in 1982." I couldn't relate. The head girl (girls) didn't do anything to me and if they really wanted to keep their virginity, they wouldn't have had this movie in this case. Pure shit and a poor staple food left in the early 80s as a time capsule theater for teenagers / young adults.
