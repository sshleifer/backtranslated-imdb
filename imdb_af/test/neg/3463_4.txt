Tutors are a suitable title, but a learning belt will be more useful to flipping yourself after buying a ticket to watch this damaging attempt at entertainment. Clooney's attempt at self-indulgence comes with a silent cloud, as his attitude implies that he is nothing else. Perhaps with another actor playing the Clooney role, the movie might be nice. Sorry George, I doubt any Oscar will nod this time around. George Clooney is definitely a fish out of the water when it comes to comedy (unless you refer to his politics). Anyway, just the most fierce Clooney fans will enjoy watching Leatherheads, everybody will long for the quiet picture.
