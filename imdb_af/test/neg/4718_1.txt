In this terrible effort on a Blair Witch bulletin, a lot of people are going to Africa to investigate a creature called the Half Caste. It's pretty clear that there was no writing to talk about, and everything was improvised. It can work if you have good actors who didn't do this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie tries to gain originality by exploring a more dark myth and exotic culture. As a result, there are many scenes in the forest where characters eat "impressive African stuff" like elephant dung. There are also some good footage of lions eating (from a National Geographic perspective), but there is not a single scare in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> If you saw Cannibal Holocaust or the Blair Witch Project, this movie will not have any surprises for you, and you can probably see better lion picture material on the Discovery Channel. <br /> <br /> Definitely a Half-Away effort. <br /> <br /> A note to the filmmakers: guys, we all do a favor and next time save the "How Did I Have My African Vacation" home movie for your family and good friends. No one else wants to see it.
