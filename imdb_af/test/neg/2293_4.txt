A Swedish plow film? Is the world insane? <br /> <br /> Probably not, but it's still not a common sight in these days with Swedish gore flicks. The b-movie business in Sweden today seems to have trouble. the golden days of "Space Invasion i lappland". And this movie on its own seems a bit of a problem: it's just too much talk in it, but it drives quite a bit amusing for the good FX, which is great for a b-movie. However, the writing and most of the acting is pretty bad, but it doesn't really matter, it's supposed to be a movie and nothing more, that's where it's somehow wrong go. There is simply not enough blood to fill the void. <br /> <br /> Every person who knows Gert Fylking will have a good laugh about his role as a sgt. though. I almost laughed at my ass. It's really so hilariously bathed. <br /> <br /> Apart from the good parts I've listed, there's really nothing else to recommend here unless you're starving for Swedish B-movies. <br /> <br /> 4/10
