Cheap, deliciously bad cheese from the 80's, the decade of cheese. I saw this one uncut and un-MST3K for the first time, and it was pretty funny even without the comment. The plot (as it is) revolves around a post-apocalyptic world in which the AI ​​robots have become rebellious (sound familiar?) And have destroyed everything, and ruined a world with the air so bad that no one can breathe it. The few people left serve as slaves to the mysterious Dark One, which is part of the computer and part organic. The 'air slaves' work to produce energy because it is in exchange for breathable air. The Dark One has beaten the strongest of the air slaves to death every time, so no one as a leader in a revolt against the Dark One will rise. <br /> <br /> Well, that's the so-called serious thing. On the stupid stuff, like the ridiculous quasi-futuristic clothes that all sport, including car seat clothing, fur carriers, cloths, and spangly stuff and feather boots (mostly worn by the Dark One's henchwoman, a chick with an unrecognizable and almost unacceptable accent ). Whether the woodworking and stylized lines played by all the so-called 'actors', whose dialogue is high on pretense and low sense. Or the dime shop special fx, including pink socks glued to teeth for 'deadly' sewer hoses, a bomb made from a piano wire and a tin can, and a terrible 'mutant' with Halloween rubber masks. <br /> <A group of airbags follows their leader, a mysterious wanderer who adapted to the air outside, to go to the energy plant to destroy the Dark One. The man's name is Neo, which explains where the Wachowski brothers got the idea for the Matrix. They meet a group of Amazons along the way, with the compulsory battle scene in which the woman is spent (of course). Somebody else ever noticed that in every Amazon movie or t. show ever produced, these so-called wonderful warriors always get their buttocks kicked by men or women? Amazons are just pansies, I think. <br /> <br /> This group of determined fighters make their way through Central Park ... errr ... the devastated lands outside the last standing city (great way to save money on the rugged paintings of a destroyed New York City anyway and ride in the sewers leading to the power station where the Dark One and his go-go girl henchwoman Valeria hang out. Here, they are blaming such turbulent animals as the sock puppet worms, a huge spider that no one sees, and the goofy crayfish that is one of the Dark One's personal watches. <br /> <br /> The final revelation is pretty sad. One of the slaves, a girl's father was taken by the Dark One because he made a way for people to breathe the dirty air. She saw her father digested by the Dark One's true form. It entails eating through a giant avocado until only his head protrudes. The three remaining adventurers destroy the Dark One by eliminating a few switches, and the robotic holocaust does not die with a bang, but with a sniff. The two people swap incredible wood last lines, and that's it. The end.
