It's by far the worst movie I've ever seen. What they thought. Stop preaching with me! That's why we all look at Walker Texas Ranger and don't give it to our friends. Terrible acting and a very fake plot. As the film unfolds, the story stops and the actors begin to preach to the audience. The director somehow believed the two in common. It looks like crap! When I see the title at my local blockbuster, it looks interesting. They had to be warned and said it was religious rather than the false advertisement of an action / adventure. The first time in a long time I stopped a movie and it couldn't tolerate it.
