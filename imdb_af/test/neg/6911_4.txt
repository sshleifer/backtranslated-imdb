There seems to be a whole subgenre of cheap, tired old sex "comedies" out there, who say the same old stuff about middle-class couples. Kind of friends, but with more soft porn and no white. This film is no exception - it had known situations so much that I died in Deja Vu. People were sitting on banks, washing up on sex and relationships? Cheque. Monogamy versus falsehood with a woman / man who will never see any other woman / husband in reality? Cheque. PORN THE BATHS !!!! 111? Cheque. Some guy / girl in what is the only reason why you look at this garbage? Cheque. The lesson seems to be - when in doubt, make a tired old sex "comedy" about people no one cares about, to make a statement that everyone has heard three thousand times before. It will make your movie. It won't even put some sitcom in a bad wig!
