As a big fan of most modern fantasy movies, I really see it. I wasn't familiar with the character, although I heard the general stories of the style of the comic and good reviews of the movie, I thought I was a real surprise. From the moment the main character starts talking in his forced crying voice, I could immediately announce that I will not enjoy this movie. I found the story poor and predictable, the acting poor, the effects were very good for a small budget movie, but did nothing for the overall plot. <br /> <br /> Perhaps as a fan of the Comics you can find something. more of this, otherwise I suggest that you skip it and not waste your movie money on this boring adventure.
