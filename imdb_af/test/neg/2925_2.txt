The 33 percent of the nations still supporting what Bush will still support will do well to see this movie, which shows the aftermath of the French Revolution and the 1794 terror, which looks remarkably similar to the post-9 / 11 socio-political landscape. Maybe then they can stop worrying about the face and they must take action. It is really a pity that when a politician destroys the country, those who voted for him are not denied the right to vote again. They clearly showed they had no sense of character. <br /> <br /> What really stands out in this movie is the ambiguity of a character as hopeless doctrine such as Robespierre; A haunted empty man, with a simplistic reductive ideology, cannot help him to highlight the boundaries between security and totalitarianism. Execution and murder. Self-defense and patriotism. His legalistic laughter tests exacerbated the hopeless situation he helped create. Sounds like any cricket-like, privileged, delayed Yale cheerleaders you know? <br /> <br /> Wojciech Pszoniak blows the messy Deparidieu off the screen. Just as sympathetic as Robespierres's fate, it's reassuring to know that shortly after the movie ends, its jaw will fire and be sent to the guillotine.
