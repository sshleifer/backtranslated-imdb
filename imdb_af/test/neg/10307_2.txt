I love this show. I watched every episode last year. I bought the DVDs. And I agree to look tonight and I see for some reason that you reconsidered this great show. And you took what made it work and ruined it. You took one of the best aspects of the show that the 4 friends were. Sam, Sully, Lizzy and Piper. I also love the other characters, but they are good at little dead like Derek, Darcy and even Sully. It's as if the performance of his family has been lost and everyone is trying hard to fill it out. This is overdose. While things are funny in small deaf people when exposed to it, it goes from funny to annoying. I was looking for the return of this show. So bring back the charm. Even if you couldn't fit Piper into the show, bring back at least Lizzy. But I loved those girls. They brought the fun. The show is about Sam trying to live his business life and also handle his personal life and friends. It was the charm. And the big dog. <br /> <br /> I hope the network (FOX) has forced the authors to do so and the authors did not willingly do it. I will give the show a few episodes before I give up, but tonight's episodes were bad. Tonight I made a big deal of the show that had returned tonight and had people over and I felt like a fool because no one laughed except 2-3 times. I apologized and told me I didn't know what had happened. And about 10 minutes into the episode, I realized they weren't going to show Piper or Lizzy and it was no longer a TV comedy.
