Mexican Werewolf in Texas is in the small border town of Furlough where Anna (Erika Fay) lives, her best friend is Rosie (Martine Hughes). She has a Mexican boyfriend, Miguel (Gabriel Gutierrez), who is determined to keep an animal off. It terrorized the town, killed cattle and several residents, including some of their friends. Local Mexican legends speak of the Chupacabra, an evil being of myth and legend. Erm, I'm struggling now because not so much else happens. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Scott Maginnis I will not be beating here and say simply that Mexican Werewolf in Texas is terrible, period. The writing only mentions the word Werewolf once and the rest of the time it is referred to a Chupacabra, and I suspect it was not really considered a Werewolf movie. The 'Werewolf' creature looks mostly hairless and more like an evil dog. There is no reference to someone who changes during the full moon. It is actually an attack during the day, there is no transformation scene and at the end when it is murdered, it does not change in anyone either. To be honest, apart from the title, there is nothing here to indicate a Werewolf movie and even the title is just a rip-off of the most popular American Werewolf in London (1981). This is the kind of homemade crap I personally think of killing the horror genre, how long has it been since a really low budget horror classic like Dawn of the Dead (1978), The Evil Dead (1981), Halloween (1978) or Friday the 13th (1980), all made on shoe strip budgets, maybe The Blair Witch Project (1999), but it's been the last few years. And like a Mexican Werewolf in Texas, there's no chance of ever being considered a classic. The character is terrible and things just happen to them, the dialogue is dirty, the pacing is awful, the story sucks and almost sent me to sleep. As a whole, this movie is just a little, I'm sorry, but I don't know how to describe it differently. <br /> <br /> Director Maginnis does nothing to see it, there are the annoying hand-held camera-type cinematography that can easily give someone a headache and quickly "shine" and you will miss something that just doesn't irritate and irritate equally. It is not scary, there is no nudity, there is no tension or atmosphere and the special effects are terrible. The monster looks really poor and it's not surprising. Maginnis keeps it in the shade or cuts its scenes so fast you never look carefully. There is virtually no color on the photo either, it is either almost pitch black or over saturated desert sandals that also hurt the thing. The gore consists of a few fake guts (shiny and you will miss them!), Some bloody wounds and a cut off, big deal. <br /> <br /> With a so-called budget of about $ 300,000, I admit that the budget was low, but I just refuse to assume that making such a junk movie is a very low budget horror flicks that go their easy budgets. The whole thing has the look of a home movie, it has no style and is completely vague and dull to look at. The play also sucks although you probably already knew it. <br /> <br /> Mexican Werewolf in Texas will probably hire / buy / watch a few people, as they may accidentally think it is a sequel to John Landis's classic that is definitely not and it's not once a proper werewolf movie. Don't be fooled, it's terrible and I'm tired of wasting time / money on the homemade amateur crap like this.
