Wow! After the first five minutes to watch this "movie", I was very inclined to place a bullet in my brain and end my life. It's really hard to describe what this movie is about. I honestly don't know what kind of person would even fund a piece of mining. The movie looks as if it's shot on video or 16mm. I don't normally have a problem with SOV movies, barely 16mm movies, but it was just as terrible. And where did they find these "actresses"? I saw some bad plays, but it took the cake. Look at the first 5 minutes and you'll see what I mean. BCI Entertainment should be boycotted for the distribution of this godly muddy sludge. It must be the worst movie I ever had the displeasure to watch. I want to go back 74 minutes! If you can sit for the first 5 minutes, without shooting your TV or committing mass murder, give a shot. After all, what did you lose?
