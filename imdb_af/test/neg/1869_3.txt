Busty beauty Stacie Randall plays PVC-clad, bad-ass bitch Alexandra, Faust's faithful acolyte, an evil entity trapped in hell. Determining to free her master, the malicious minx breaks into a warehouse to steal a magical gem necessary for her success. but while he is exercising a satanic ritual to call upon Faust, the foolish mare accidentally enters the pentagram that she has drawn on the floor, resulting in the loss of the jewel and the release of two diminutive, troll-like creatures called Lite Dark. /> <br /> Now, Alexandra needs to find a replacement jewel that won't be easy: the only other stone that will do the trick is around the neck of her former lover, police detective Jonathan Graves (Peter Liapis). who is investigating the warehouse robbery and who just knows what evil Alexandra is capable of. Meanwhile, the wise crossing half-pins Lite and Dark come in all sorts of difficult trouble as they try to find a way back. <br /> <br /> In the filmed movie world of Jim Wynorski, all women have Babies with big breasts with the fashion sense of a cheap hooker. Ghoulies IV is no exception: every woman in this movie, whether she is a police chief, an antiquarian or a spiritual patient in an asylum? Is hot, warm, warm and does not carry much, and this is the fact. This makes this otherwise completely uncompromising piece of STV shit only portable. <br /> <br /> But be warned, though the presence of half-necks, quality crumbs makes the road a little easier, there is still a lot about this movie. to justify being marked as an ordeal: the acting is wood and the dialogue is painful; The black humor (as the DVD blurb describes it) is about as funny as a knee to the knuckers, with Lite and Dark's comic mocker especially special. and the special effects are cellar, consisting of rubbery creatures and visual effects that would have been dated ten years earlier. <br /> <br /> 3/10 only for the high bimbo quotient.
