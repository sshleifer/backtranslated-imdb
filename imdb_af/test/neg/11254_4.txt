Winner of Shamballa shows what happens when creators of Anime do not understand what their fans want. As a fan I didn't want a 1920's Evil Nazi movie. What I wanted to see is a real final jump between Ed and Dante, because we really don't know what happened to her. I also wanted Ed to return to his world sooner and stay there, to finally get a chance to be normal. You know, make a family with a blonde mechanical, that kind of thing. No, instead I have a complicated plot of Nazi mystics, Fritz Lang and about ten minutes Al, a joke of a Cameo by Roy Mustang and just one Armstrong joke, one short joke and no Winry slave Ed with a wrench. Above all, it didn't feel like Fullmetal Alchemist.
