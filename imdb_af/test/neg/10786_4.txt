Jeremy Irons and Forrest Whitaker are good actors. But this movie is badly written. First of all, during the hijacking scene, Irons is sitting in his chair too comfortably ... he seems to be reading something, and also calm! Maybe the director took the play in between? The violence at the hijacking was also a great deviation. Slow-mo, flying bullets - how his wife and daughter are killed are just not that interesting and the tension is lost. His grief then wasted another 10 minutes. Then he decided to "get revenge" and talk to all his journalist friends and ambassadors (he is a journalist for the stuffy Economist cloth) and watch, they actually give him tips on where to get the bad guys! How do they know? But what really made me turn the movie halfway through when Irons finds his way to a warehouse where bad things hang out - BUT NOT THE BATHROOMS WOMEN WAS - and anyway throw away. so he is just a killer. he got away and well ... I ended it. I mean, I couldn't figure out how his friends knew anything, and I also thought he was arrested by the remaining 2 guys who were the original hijackers. Instead, he goes to their friends, I think, or someone who hangs in warehouses and leaves automatic weapons. The tension was just quite conventional and the dialogue was lame ("it's OK boy, crying help," he says to his son. Son says "no it does" and the father says, "You are right. Ions take questionable roles - like that one dragon movie he did. He was excellent in Brideshead Revisited, which is a completely different animal than this lukewarm thriller.
