I saw tons of trash, in every language, on every subject and every trend of movies. From every period, every director and any kind of budget available. It said I really should declare: <br /> <br /> It's one of the three worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's painfully bad. It's pompous. It's grim. This is incomprehensible. This is irritating. It's a very bad mess. It's a piece of your-know-what. <br /> <br /> And, more importantly, it doesn't have a point. And even if it had one, the characters are so unreal and annoying that it is impossible to ignore the lack of solidarity of the whole thing. <br /> <br /> It's just strange to be strange. <br /> <br /> I actually felt sick looking at this trash. The theater I saw it (Lincoln Center in New York) was full when it started. By the end, half of the audience went out. There was a Q&A at the end programmed, but no one stayed. With the exception of about two sick people, everyone else ran for the door, including himself. <br /> <br /> Save 2 hours of your life. This is probably one of the worst things ever done. <br /> <br /> If there is a movie in hell, this movie will be 24/7 forever ...
