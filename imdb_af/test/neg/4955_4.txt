If there's one thing I've learned to watch George Romero's Creepshow, stumbling on a mysterious old crate that someone's obviously made a lot of effort to hide, just leave it: there's probably something dirty inside. /> <br /> Obviously, Professor Gordon Crowley, Robert Englund's character in "Jack Brooks, Monster Slayer" is not a Romero fan, because he breaks open the old wooden closet he buried in his garden. just to discover? Surprise, surprise? An old demon who owns his body (initially causing him to eat a lot and vomit). <br /> <br /> When the devil finally runs out of Crowley's body during the chemistry class and begins to brighten up the students in flesh-tearing animals, it is plumber Jack Brooks (Trevor Matthews) to try the foul creatures just stop armed with a length of pipe and fueled by a lifelong hatred of everything that is monstrous! <br /> <br /> The DVD packaging for Jon Knautz's low-budget monster movie promises hell of a fun ride, which can be cute excitement and stuff of the kind you can expect from your average 80s creature (toothy critters, rubber samples, horrible gore and absolutely no CGI!) and for the last 15 minutes, this is exactly what viewers get: non-stop splatter effects; a silly, tentative Jabba-style devil thing; <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the rest of the movie's hard time? a massive 70 minutes or so? mostly fed by Jack when he deals with his boring, everyday business: plumbing, visiting her shrink, going to chemistry class and upset his girlfriend. If you think you might enjoy a movie that mainly focuses on dealing with trauma and rage management in childhood, and buy extra kettle valves from a hardware store and the chemical properties of sodium, then this is the movie for you; but if it's a massive dose of monster abuse, I'm going elsewhere!
