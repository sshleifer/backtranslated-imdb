The title doesn't make much sense to me. I'm not sure which door in the movie shouldn't be opened. <br /> <br /> The movie begins unexpectedly, with a conversation between a man and a woman in a room that looks like a richly furnished train car, with the sound of the train traveling. In fact, the man's house is a train car, and he has a cassette train sound. The woman leaves and calls a young woman. The young woman tells her boyfriend, a doctor, that she told her grandmother is sick, and she must return to her hometown. She's not thirteen years there. <br /> <br /> Flash back to thirteen years ago. A Shadowy figure goes into a house. He caresses a sleeping young girl, then goes into another room and stabs the girl's mother. The girl wakes up and comes into her mother's room and finds her dead with a knife in her. She screamed, and an arm came out of nowhere and slammed a hand over her mouth. She looked up in fear. The early scene in the film of the murderer screamed her and the girl's appearance is one of the few effective shots in the movie. <br /> <br /> It's not much in the visual department. Sometimes there is a little strange use of sound, and there is a little strange lighting in a loft scene where many glass plates are red and blue. <br /> <br /> Back to the current day. The young woman comes in her grandmother's house. An old doctor is there who she doesn't trust, along with the man of the openingstone "Judge" and Kearn, the town's museum operator. She does not trust any of them, and it is true that they do not inspire confidence. She is quite cramped throughout the movie. She wants to check her grandmother in a hospital. The men in town want her home, and the museum operator wants things in it (his museum is already full of grandma's stuff). Inexplicably, the woman wants to keep the house. <br /> <br /> The young woman begins to receive calls from a man talking in a sinister whisper. He makes various threats and wants her to do things to raise him. Such scenes often repeat. Unfortunately, there are so few characters in the movie that the possibilities of who it can be are limited. Even worse, we see right from the start who makes the calls. So, while the young woman does not know (although the caller occasionally falls into his normal voice), the audience always knows: no tension. Every call calls her more and more. <br /> <br /> The end was unexpected to me, so maybe points aren't going to go with the obvious, but I'm not sure I've looked after it.
