I'm really sad that it's the first bad review I've ever made for a movie. EVER.I can watch this movie, and it's the second movie in all the movies I've just seen. ..afgradeer. The first is open water, which just had nothing. The next karate child didn't mention Daniel (make me right if I'm wrong, please), and the end line came as a shock. It was like, "If you have to fight ... win." then it showed the bird was flying around and playing the pan flute, and I was like, o. Well, so it will take a while for this next part. AND AND THE CREDITS HAVE THE SCREEN. <br /> <br /> GEEZ MAN !! Hopefully I will never have to revisit a movie in a bad way again, I apologize for those who love the next karate child, really, really ...
