Back in the 1960s, those of us who were bad movies thought "Plan Nine From Outer Space" was the worst movie ever made, and it will stay forever. To put things in perspective, however, we also thought that $ 3,000 would pay for a new car. <br /> <br /> As we got older, our innocence was gradually stripped away because we were exposed to films like "Hercules in New York" and "Overdrawn at the Memory Bank", which completely redefined the "bad movie" genre has. In this context last night, my son and I, "Alien From L.A." seen, the envelope printed just a generation ago to an utterly unimaginable. To call this movie "bad" (or miserable or irreparable) fails to do it right, just like any other English language label. Even if there were words to accurately describe this film, it would be no consequence, as they would be banned in civilized society. <br /> <br /> The title titled Alien is played by Kathy Ireland, who apparently took some time for modeling Sports Illustrated swimwear to kick off her film career. Her cast may seem a kind of recommendation until you actually see the movie. The makeup artists have earned their money by making Kathy look so uncomfortable that you don't want to touch her with the distant point of a broomstick. To put it unclear, in this movie she has a face that will freeze Medusa. Even worse than her appearance was her voice, which was so bad that I didn't initially get it as a human being. Throughout the movie I asked myself for a chalkboard to drag my nails over to cover the screaming compulsion of her dialogue. At the end of the movie Kathy finally gets a makeover and finds herself in her beloved swimsuit. I suggested to my son that the movie would have been better if she put her in the swimsuit at the beginning of the movie, so we would at least have something to watch. My son remarkably pointed out that if they had removed the swimsuit and packed it in her mouth, it would have greatly improved the recording at two points. I am looking for the sheer luster of his observation. If in doubt, compare this craving for "Barbarella", in which a skilled filmmaker demonstrates how to exploit the assets of an exquisite beautiful lady in the fantasy genre. <br /> <br /> Of the plot itself, there is little to comment as there was so little in evidence. It is said that if millions of monkeys are typed continuously for millions of years, "Hamlet" will eventually be. Through the elimination process, they will have something to do with this script for the rest of the time. Imagine a modern-day Alice falling into a hole and dropping 500 feet on a rock table, after which she got up, stomped herself and started looking for her long-lost father in Atlantis's empire. Once in Atlantis she spends most of her time treading, fighting or climbing stairs and ladders and basically trying to stay out of the hands of a general who has no soldiers to do his offer, and who would Tiny Tim look. macho. This summary, as abbreviated as it appears, is probably longer than the shooting head. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, as you wake up in the production values ​​and everything you can of the sets and costumes through the smoke and haze, you realize it's a movie you're actually on the screen can see where all $ 20 of the budget goes. <br /> <br /> The thought kept by my mind was that filmmakers should not be given access to drugs and alcohol while shooting a movie, or perhaps before, if it results in results like "Alien from LA, "but in fairness I must admit that I do not know if they were actually involved in drug abuse, or were simply brain dead at the start of the project.
