A special unit of four police detectives gives up their own unique way in the 1950s Los Angeles. Nick Nolte plays Max Hoover, the unit's chief officer and his partners are played by Michael Madsen, Chazz Palminteri and Chris Penn. Also included are Melanie Griffith, Jennifer Connelly and John Malkovich. Totally an impressive list of names. Unfortunately, this is the only thing that is quite remote from this movie. <br /> <br /> Our story begins when the young Allison Pond, played by Connelly, is currently being developed in a remote area of ​​the village. Our group of four detectives is called in and it is immediately clear that Nolte's Max Hoover will take a lot of personal interest in this case. We will soon find out that Allison, in addition to Hoover, knew very well also some fairly important military and government types that might have had reason to have her death. But who was exactly involved and why exactly would they want this seemingly harmless woman dead? Hoover and crew set out to find out. Sounds like an interesting prospect, but unfortunately it doesn't go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Despite the impressive range of names, the acting here leaves much to be desired. Nolte is too much, Madsen looks incredibly bored, Palminteri and Malkovich come from caricature, Penn has almost nothing to do and Griffith is boring as it can be. By far the best performance is Connelly's in too short a lead. The dialogue throughout the film is forced and timber. The feeling of drama you would expect from such a mystery is completely lacking. Nothing dramatic really happens. In fact, nothing looks at all for the bulk of the picture. Instead, we just hit a rather ridiculous and incredibly disappointing climax. When the "mystery" is resolved, you can find yourself: "Oh, come on, is that all there is?" But it gets worse when the mystery is resolved, we get a completely ridiculous and utterly incredible action. And even then, we are further suffering than another terrible, poorly disabled, completely unnecessary scene at the end. And then it is mercifully over. And not a moment too soon.
