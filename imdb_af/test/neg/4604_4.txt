In Los Angeles, Alcoholic and Hank Chinaski (Matt Dillon) performs a wide range of non-qualified features just to get enough money to drink and play in horse racing. His primary and only goal is to write and have sex with dirty women. <br /> <br /> "Factotum" is an uninteresting, senseless and extremely boring movie about an irresponsible drunkman who works a few days or weeks just to get enough money to buy spirits and gambling right away dismissed for his reckless behavior. In line with IMDb, this character would be the fictional alter ego of author Charles Bukowski. Based on this story, I will definitely never read any of his novels. Honestly, if the viewer likes this theme of alcoholic couples, look better at the touching and heartbreaking Hector Babenco's Ironweed or Marco Ferreri's "Story di Ordinaria Follia" based on the life of the same author. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Factotum ?? Sem Destino" ("Factotum ?? Without Destiny")
