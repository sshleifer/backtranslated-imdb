Don't be fooled by the plot outline as described on the cover (at least the Swedish version). The story about this looks quite interesting, with speculative tips. Nothing can come out of the truth. This is the absolute most sad movie experience I have ever had ... It is simple and really HOLIDAY and should not be sold or rented to anyone. If you still think the plot looks intriguing, reflect on this: phones can move, run and kill people like any other electrical device. It can throw things at you, haunt you and run you. Please don't watch this movie, it's a shame for the horror genre ...
