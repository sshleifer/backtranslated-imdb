If you want to waste a small portion of your life, sit in front of this predictable zombie movie. It fails at the first post by not being anxious or funny. It's a dull gray movie I guess, went straight to the video. Hammy and tongue in cheek make an acid taste in the mouth. If you watch a poor but still viewable, recent zombie movie, the diary wants to look at the dead. Poor special effects, school level writing. Zombie movies work if they have a moral point or even a political point. This movie has nothing, there is no worthy point that zombification underlines. It's as exciting and convincing as a Republican convention. It is a pity that the Republican Convention would be a better example of a Zombie movie.
