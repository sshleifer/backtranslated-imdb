Unfortunate disaster mash has a team of scoundrels over the reverse S.S. Poseidon comes, hoping to plunder it before it goes well. Irwin Allen's successor to his 1972 chariot, The Poseidon Adventure, arrived in the theaters. Seven years later! Don't mind that nobody cares anymore, why do we give such a clumsy production, filled with dull characters and mystical actors, just to get hold of the memory of your greatest hit? One might feel sorry for Michael Caine, Sally Field, Peter Boyle, Jack Warden, Karl Malden and Shirley Jones, but this is not for their lost sea expressions. There is a moment when sensual Jones is tempted to take treasure for herself and she starts scolding her bags that are an unintentional hoot. The film was a career for all concerned, especially Allen, who never really recovered from it. * of ****
