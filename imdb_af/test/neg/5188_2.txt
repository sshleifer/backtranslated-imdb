on this evil of mediocrity? You're so much better than that. <br /> <br /> Simply put, Frostbite is worthless. Bad acting (and I use the term loosely), minimalist "plot," sophomoric humor and lackluster snowboarding. There is not even an adequate display of female pulchritude to spark the fiery interest of socially unknown but red-blooded males. <br /> <br /> Top Gun had spectacular flight sequence to move on. Thunder days had a heartbreaking race action. Even Point Break had parachutes to his credit. Frostbite doesn't have any of these. It is not worth your time, my time, the time of Traci Lords, Carmen Nicole's time, or the time of anyone involved in the destruction of celluloid that would have been perfectly usable on something worthwhile if it has not been wasted on this recycling center feed. <br /> <br /> The world will be a better place if we forget that Frostbite ever existed.
