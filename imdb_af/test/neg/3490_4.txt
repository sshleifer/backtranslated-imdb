I remember remembering this movie when I was a kid. I remember it terrified me and it stayed with me for years. I spent a few years finding it online ... didn't remember the title, just the storyline. After searching and searching, I got a VHS sold on E-Bay. I was excited and when it finally arrived, I jammed it into the video recorder and couldn't help but feel a bit nostalgic. Needless to say, I was slightly disappointed. It wasn't the movie I remember watching as a child. It was sometimes boring and I found Beryl Reid's incessant lightning extremely irritating. Both performances by Reid and Flora Robson were good overall, but the movie wasn't scary. I think any movie is worth watching to form your own opinion, but sometimes, well ......
