Honestly, one of the worst written, directed and educated movies I've ever seen. Looks like a TV movie. And a bad one about it. I can't believe people are still appointing Danny Huston after seeing him in this movie, or they still allow John Sayles to make movies. My husband and I watched this movie on TV one night and got so bored, we cleaned the house while it was on. . . and this still bored us! It made me think that critics were so gullible with Sayles' previous films, such as Lone Star, which were chased away in time, but eventually didn't add up much. Spend your time on something better. Anything.
