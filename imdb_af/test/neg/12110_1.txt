The director of this movie is a well-known French TV presenter, Patrick Sebastien. He likes music and humor for rednecks, and his incredible movie is absolutely in his image. This is the story of a young delayed person, called "Zep" (sic). A night he sees his sexual relationship with his sister, and decides to do the same thing: he rapes the girl he loves! Zep is placed in an asylum, and his unhappy friend in a clinic. One man will find them. One man will reunite them. This man is a psychologist. This man looks like a hell's angel. This guy is ... Patrick Sebastien! With an excessive use of clich√©s, we will see how the Absolute Love can break all the misunderstandings and how a humanist doctor can force a victim to fall in love with her rapist. We will also learn how to use sandwiches to seduce a girl. Not only does Patrick Sebastien think he can do better than one century of psychiatry, but he also tells us a stupid ideology. With the character of the father's girlfriend, a boss who wants to take away his girlfriend's weakness. Upsetting. But it is very enjoyable to laugh at Zep (mentally disabled people are not funny except in this movie.)
