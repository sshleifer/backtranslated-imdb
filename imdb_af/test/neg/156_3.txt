Jack Bender's "The Tempest" is an adaptation of Shakespeare's play "The Tempest". Bender transports the plot of medieval Italy to Mississippi during the American civil war. He involves the slavery problem and the role of revenge in the war. <br /> <br /> Prospero, the name Gideon Prosper, is not the Duke of Milan, but a landowner in Mississippi. He learns voodoo magic from the female slave Mambo Azaleigh. He saved her son Ariel, who therefore accompanied him in his exile. The island is not on the sea, but in a swamp near the banks of the Mississippi. There lives an Alligator hunter, a so-called "Gator-Man", who later tried to rape Propero's daughter Miranda. At the time of the civil war, Ariel wants to join the Union troops to help fight slavery. Prospero does not care about the war. He is only interested in his personal revenge on his brother Antony. When Antony and his bookkeeper Willi Gonzo (Gonzalo) try to cross the river, Prospero raises a storm. Union soldier Frederick gets lost in the swamp and eventually comes to the island. He and Miranda fall in love with each other, but Prospero won't accept it. Meanwhile, Ariel in Prospero has turned into a raven, and finds that Antony has alliance with the Union, but plans to betray them. Antony and Gonzo meet Gator Man in the swamp and conspiracy with Prospero against him. They kidnap Miranda and Ariel, but Prospero freezes them and helps the Union to defeat the southern army. In the end, Ariel is free, Frederick and Miranda must marry. Prospero returns to the plantation and Gator Man returns the island. <br /> <br /> Peter Fonda represents Gideon Prosper vigorously and convincingly while Antony's character stays flat. It was not a bad idea to run the Tempest in the background of the civil war, but perhaps the director was too much in danger. In some parts the story seems to be built up or comic. For example, Gator Man appears only without any explanation. That it needs a kidnapping to bring Prospero into his mind and that he loses confidence in his power shows that Bender Propero made more man, but only made him a poor old man without his magic. Prospero's original authority and wisdom are not made clear. <br /> <br /> ------------- End of Part 1 --------------- ---------- ---
