Douglas Sirk's earlier "women's picture" weeps for Universal, based on a prehistoric, dogmatic, didactic novel by the unbearable Lloyd C. Douglas (author of that other beloved piece of crap, * The Robe *). Rock Hudson, in the role that starred in the stars, plays Bob Merrick, a drunk playmaker who earns millions, who is more interested in driving skirts and races than completing his medical degree. In the first scene he wrecked his boat on a wonderful photographed lake. The accident nearly killed Merrick and therefore he requires a fairly mysterious "resuscitator machine" to keep him alive. . . Meanwhile, dr. Phillips, beloved surgeon, died from a heart condition throughout the village. As the local hospital can only maintain one resitator at one time, Phillips dies so the loop may live. When Merrick learns about this, he tries to apologize to Phillips' relatives, especially to the widow (Jane Wyman, dressed and clothed in matron), but everyone and everyone who knows the surgeon spits at Merrick like a buyer. One hospital staff doctor even called it a total waste that the playboy lived in place of the Christian surgeon. Hippocrates may have had something to say about it! <br /> <br /> These early scenes are where you will find the typical circus iconoclasm: the director rubs our faces so much in the unpleasantness of middle-class, middle-century America, one finds himself furious for the capricious playboy around the herd to place under the roots of these moral hypocrites. But unfortunately, no: the recoverable plot of the novel must continue, and Merrick soon finds himself overturned by God, in the prospect of pipe-puffing Otto Kruger, an artist who claims that Phillips made him a better man and even better has. painting. (Why don't we see this wonderful art?) We learn that the unbearably omnipresent Dr Phillips often refuses the payment of medical services (though those who are precisely qualified for these "wonderful releases" are never made clear). It is supposed to offer our hero a whole new outlook on life and an example of personal behavior. Kruger even tries to make it sound incredibly exciting: "Once you start this thing, there's no way out! It's an obsession ... a MAGICITY obsession!" So Merrick tries it through AGAIN with the widow's apology, but he somehow gets hit by a car. She lost sight of her. Apparently Merrick will have a few more stations from the cross before he can settle a decent fellow. <br /> <br /> But Sirk continues to sneak in his knees while the movie is growing. preachy. The obvious bit should be the presence of Agnes Moorehead as the chief hospital nurse and Wyman's friend and uncontrolled lesbian lover. Note the disappointment on Moorehead's face when Merrick, eventually as a doctor, is released, shows Wyman's life near the end. Hudson's own homosexuality, an open secret in Hollywood back then, is also used for a great ironic effect. He and Wyman - dowdy and fifteen years older - generate absolutely zero erotic heat in their scenes, which is casually purposeful, presumably because any more scenes between the stars would expose this whole business hopelessly. (One thing we feel certain about: if Rock Hudson was occupied by anything, it was definitely not Jane Wyman.) This is a chronic case of * Tea and Sympathy *. Sirk apparently enjoyed simplifying everyone's noses by making this gay actor - attractive to the innocent ladies of the era - cool by these beautifully colored "women's photos". In fact, the director worked with Hudson 6 or 7 more times, to do the best in following this movie, * All That Heaven Allows *, which teamed up with Wyman again, but also joined with a realistic plot. In * Obsession * we need to stand out from God / Kruger to look favorably from a viewing window to Merrick and his medical team as they prepare to save Wyman's life, along with a musical score of swelling voices from a cheese Hollywood. choir. <br /> <br /> But to see why Sirk is considered an author, look at the scene in which Wyman explains to her big daughter that she can actually tell the difference of night and day. The whole frame is obscured, here: the daughter is barely visible, and Wyman's face is fine silhouette at a light light. She says she hates the night because "I know Dawn will never come again". A great, cold moment that earns a much better movie than * Beautiful Obsession *. <br /> <br /> 4 stars out of 10.
