The one line summary is actually the punch line of a very old joke that starts "what's a Jewish porn movie?" <br /> <br /> While this movie has its interesting moments, it was moving too slowly and didn't do enough to explain to those of us in the audience who are unfamiliar with the orthodox Jewish habit, exactly what is going on and why ? How many people who came across this movie would know that the bath in which the female characters were in was actually called a "Mikveh", which is a ritual bath used to cleanse spiritual impurity? The same question can be asked why the bride walked around the groom a thousand times, while her face was covered just before the marriage promises. These two examples are but two of a large number of such moments that remained completely inexplicable to the uninitiated audience. <br /> <br /> This movie has its touch moments with expressions of great love and emotions. The characters are very authentically presented to the number of clothes an ultra-orthodox Jewish man has to wear, as well as the religious rituals that he has to wake up in the morning to start his day. The attitudes of orthodox Judaism toward women in general and especially women are both intriguing and sometimes virgin. This is another reason why more explanation is needed if this story is to be understood in context. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to people who are familiar with orthodox Jewish tradition and ritual as well as those who may be interested in getting a brief look at how the lives of people who practice this way of life are . <br /> <br /> The story itself about two sisters who rebel in their own way against the "system" is of moderate interest at best.
