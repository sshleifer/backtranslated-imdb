Plot: <br /> <br /> - An eBay Chair <br /> <br /> - Random People <br /> <br /> - Random People ("Dude, that's right." "I is feeling it. "" Let's get married now! ") <br /> <br /> - If you are a" hippie ", you will love this movie. (You have to be tall or drunk, otherwise you will question your life.) <br /> <br /> This movie is clearly not thought from the beginning to the end, and the other comments are probably the crew members reviews. If it wasn't aimed at my demographic, I didn't know what it was aiming for. I found the plot boring every day. It's something I would do, and trust me it's not worth filming. Going on a road trip and filming half the silence doesn't make a movie!
