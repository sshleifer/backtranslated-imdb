One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Quite ridiculous. The story is bad. The animations are completely childish and displaced. The physics of the holograms is hilarious of how much they are completely wrong. OMG, I even want to believe this movie has a Disney label on it. Bah. The actresses are somewhat beautiful, but there are so many great movies with amazing actresses that are much more valuable to watch than this one. Final comment, bad movie. Don't bother to see it. If you are looking for movies to see with your kids, look at other alternatives like Ratattuile, Monster Inc or an enchanted story (in theaters). Seriously.
