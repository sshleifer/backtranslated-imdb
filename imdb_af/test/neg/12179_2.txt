The secret service agent, Jay Killion (Charles Bronson), was named to protect the President-elect's new First Lady (Jill Ireland). She is a very difficult woman and Killion has his hands full. She is the victim of numerous murder attempts, all of which are directed by the president's head of state, who wants the First Lady dead. This movie insults your intelligence with not only the story line but also the lack of realistic places. For example, in the scene depicting the Inaugural Parade, the First Lady is in a Rolls Royce convertible with Agent Killion and without the President. We also know what Washington, DC reflects in January, and not only are all "topcoats less". You can even see palm trees in the 70 degrees and sunny weather! (It's clearly filmed in Hollywood, not Washington, DC). This movie is a joke. It's not worth your time.
