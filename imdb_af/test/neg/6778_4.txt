This movie describes a truly horrific event, to be sure. But this is down to poor performances by all role players. It is impossible to feel the emotion of almost any character, because all the emotional scenes look like parodies of themselves. For example, a character is shot at the beginning of the movie, and you get the click desperately: "Will I make it, Sergeant?", "Yes, it's not nothing", but it plays like a sketch of A Wayans Brothers movie (I don't know if they haven't made the War Movie yet) or something that played with Leslie Nielsen. <br /> <br /> The sergeant played by Sean Penn reminds me of Al Bundy of Married With Children, while Fox is the biggest self-suppressing good clich√©, you can imagine. Thanks, he curses and smokes out there. <br /> <br /> His emotional "NOOOO !!!" is definitely more suited to comedies such as Back to the Future as so-called serious movies like this. <br /> <br /> To their credit, some of the "main" scenes ... (without giving away too much, where they actually do pretty horrible acts ... ... done well and make us the subject matter seriously. But that's despite, not thanks to the acting.
