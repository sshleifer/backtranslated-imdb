I'm just excited when the movie starts (because I've seen Juliette Lewis's name on the screen). The writing was very complicated, but if the film continued, it became understandable. I concentrated it well, but the result was disappointing. sexually unnecessarily used on the film, and it seems to me that the director ignores those who are prone to opposite sex. According to me, the well-prepared writing cannot be embodied. Looking at the movie, the film promises something in the beginning or I expected too much ... and finally the end ... the end is so much mediocre that I wouldn't expect. The main character Cassandra wants to convey about baby and how a baby can change a life, in my opinion the scene is the real disaster for the film. All the characters are funny and acted beautifully. But just a movie can't save a movie.
