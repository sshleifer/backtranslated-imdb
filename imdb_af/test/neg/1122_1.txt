When I found out there was a Christmas holiday 2, I couldn't wait to buy the DVD. I sent out my money and watched it as soon as it came through the mailbox. I love all the national lampoons movies chasing Chevy in it, and I bet he was happy he wasn't in this one! I couldn't believe how bad it was, you would think it was impossible not to laugh at a national lampoon movie, but believe me it is! . This movie probably looks like a good idea on paper with cousin Eddie as the main character. Early in the nerves, he became completely unfriendly in the middle of the film and by the end of the film I went brain-dead and couldn't remember what happened! .
