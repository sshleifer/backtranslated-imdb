I watched Milos Forman's movies as I saw "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "Amadeus" (two great masterpieces), but when I saw "Hair" I wondered if it was the same Milos Forman. This movie is boring and uninteresting to say the least. OK, the music is pretty good, but on the screen it looks like a lot of stunned people to dance (wait a while ... that's what it really is!). In fact, the only interesting part, and the only part where Milos's talent emerges, is the last 15 minutes or so, (SPOILER !!) since when Berger accepted Claude's place as a soldier at the Vietnam War. That 15-minute move and well-aimed, but it's a pity that we have to endure so much material before. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe it's one of those movies you should be "on the subject" to enjoy (the subject is marijuana, acid and other drugs that glorify the movie). I'm not like that ...
