Born is definitely someone's attempt at originality, but what we have here is art in its most morbid, grotesque form, therefore Begotten respects me, but to be realistic doesn't matter what this abomination is about, but for the record ... <br /> <br /> In the utmost in disjointed horror we begin in an unknown time, in an unfamiliar place. To the right of the bat, we were born into the psychotic nightmare that was born, a god is apparently depressed, mutilated himself with a razor, I mean, try really like hell to end it all, it takes a while ?) After this ultra-morbid introduction something happens, something rises from the body, say hello to Mother Earth. What is she doing? Well, she gives birth to a thing. The thing would probably have preferred to stay in the womb, but it is life. Begotten's psychotic nightmare empire welcomes the thing the only way it knows. The thing, along with Mother Earth, is mutilated by unknown, hoods, attackers, with the evil intent available only clarity. From this point on, things are dragging as they have never dragged. Interesting, grim images, with a perfectly decent soundtrack, are the highlights of the rest. Not to give the impression that I do not recommend this evil, because I do, but only once, and only for people who appreciate the dark side. <br /> <br /> It may appear from my description I don't get 'budgeted'. Trust me, I get it, and yes, Begotten is art if I've ever seen it. Everything in this movie, no matter how unrelated, is significant. This is perhaps the only thing that makes born art. Having said that, most of us need some form of entertainment value, and it comes from someone who enjoyed The Chooper. Probably the most intriguing first five minutes, I've seen in a movie, but let's be realistic, the next 7 hours and 55 minutes will be one in a coma, that is, unless it's just meant for some kind of psychedelic purposes, in that case, never mind. But how would one judge such a unique boring masterpiece? Depending on how much your attention team can take, it should be 1 or 10, any other number just won't make a statement. It hurts to do that, but in terms of entertainment, Begotten is just not. 1/1
