By Jove, what an unholy mess! Revenge, shaky love, mechanical games, like battles, incessant and completely unnecessary violence, a primitive "music" teeming with the devastating victims, great "surprises" (which are generally considered "revealing" as the newsletter of the National Enquirer). Add some clumsy camera movements as if you're stylish and creative and you've already impressed the crowd. This film's totally undeserved popularity strongly suggests that the very low pop subculture has not only succeeded in reaching over the past decade, but also as a dominant taste in an impotent audience. (For deeper insight into human suffering under mental illness, without a cute residue from Oldboy, I recommend an older Dutch / French movie, "The Vanishing".) <br /> <br /> Don't believe There is absolutely nothing to say about this movie. In fact, there is. The (well-known) scene in which the hero (is really a "hero", an old father who sleeps with his daughter and tries to get forgetfulness rather than salvation?) Eats a live octopus benefits much from the lively presence of the best actor in the entire cast: the octopus itself. Sorry, the poor animal that was eaten could not survive its one and only act to get another worthless diploma for the best actor at the Cannes Festival. <br /> <br /> Which feast, incidentally, between Moore's propaganda nonsense and this image of worthless as somewhat exotic weirdness, has become a feast of flight and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Sic transit gloria mundi!
