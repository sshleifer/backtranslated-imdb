I made a big mistake to see this movie. It's the lottery to watch movies I think. After five minutes you just knew it was going to be a clunker, and I struggled very hard to stay in my seat - the guy "lost two hours of your life" kind of feeling. <br /> <br /> The fundamental problem is that, without mentioning the entire "historical accuracy" thread of the reviews, the writing is painful, painful, bad. <br /> <br /> The first thirty minutes could be spread up to an hour for an assuming, real, plot development. Instead, it cut down from one unnatural "dramatic" event to the next. Letting the girl cry at the beginning of the movie doesn't make sense, because the audience doesn't have an emotional attachment at this stage. And the whole run at the end in the sunset through the long grass field, what was the hell of it? <br /> <br /> Not even the excellent Ed Harris could save this one. You can almost feel his pain on some of the lines he had to explain. The incredibly horrible one was for the apparent reason, he stared at the girl while she was working in his apartment copies, she looked up, it was all a bit lazy romantic kind - a lighting (or I dream), and he said , with authority in his voice, <br /> <br /> "WASH ME." <br /> <br /> And she got up and washed him with a sponge. "Was my" WTF? It's hilarious. <br /> <br /> Then there was the music. The long extended session when it only led Beethoven and threw the 9th Symphony out of the surrounding sound into the theater and waited for the choir to wait and stand still for what looked like forever. And then, finally, start in enormous sound. It was wonderful and wonderful and I dare say so. It brought tears to my eyes. <br /> <br /> That's where the movie picked up two stars. The only part of the movie where Beethoven had to say exactly what he wanted to say. <br /> <br /> And I believed him.
