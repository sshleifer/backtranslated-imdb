I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, and I spent a few (fantastic) university weeks in Barcelona myself. The premise is right on cue - a confused and disorderly young individual enters a world of equally confused and disturbed young individuals. But the director's poor swats on symbolism, philosophy, and social commentary were completely out of the question, and that left us, the audience, confused. Bravo. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if this movie was presented as a European "American Pie" prank, then I can turn off my brain and go for the ride. But straight from the bat, the director piques our deeper senses into the symbolism of the twisted highways and the dichotomy of the "inner self" towards the "public self" (one of the "mother tongue" vs the "secondary language"). out. . Furthermore, it boldly dives into the subject of racial / national stereotyping. Until an interesting start, oh? <br /> <br /> WRONG. That's the way it goes. These interesting topics are no longer mentioned, except at the confronted epilogue-type end which seems to be the director's slanderous way of getting over the subject again. It reminded me of a winding speech going nowhere, but the speaker ended up saying, "Finally, I hope you see how it relates to my original thought!" <br /> <br /> Also, as other reviewers pointed out, the cynical jab itself is decaying. If the point is to ridicule the use of national stereotypes, why did the director propose a carnival of prejudice to a cock-speaking, beer-swilling English brat? Why did the director portray the American as a neanderthal (literally baking his chest and at one point making ape sounds) while the Europeans graciously tolerated him? Why is the British girl sinking to pull out villages (Frenchmen "frogs" and French speaking) while everyone else is above all? The answer is that it is not a deep or thorough film. It's just an Anglophobe's retort for the Anglophiles. But it is really no different from the prejudice trying to mock it! Now there's a funny irony to consider. <br /> <br /> Okay, philosophy, artistic and socio-political commentary, I was still very bored by this movie. There was a very funny gag that deceived one of the girls' boyfriends, but besides, I was barely entertained. The only reason I watched it to the end is that I want to brush my French and Spanish. (You see, our monolingual Americans can be stupid, but we try.)
