Tommy Lee Jones was the best Woodroe and nobody could play Woodroe F. Call better than he did. Not only was he the first and the best, he was the only person who could portray his sadness and confusion. It was a bad run and I am surprised that I even showed it. I can even begin to regret having made Woodroe. I understand he will be old by that time, but everyone knows he will never drop it. The first movie was the best and the only one I will ever see. I hope God no longer plans directors to continue or regain the wonderful classics without Tommy or Duval. Without them, the movies are useless waste of time and money for everyone, including the director. If you plan to make another LONESOME DOVE MOVIE of any kind, take mine and billions of others, don't waste time. To continue the movies, just cut the first one into the ground. Thank you.
