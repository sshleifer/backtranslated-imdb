In fact, it was terrible. The head chick in the topless was, of course, asleep with the director. It's shot in a warehouse that's probably owned by family or friends. They also decided not to act with a story. Certainly, these are ways to save costs, but are they smart ways to keep costs? No, they are not. At least they could have found a middle school student in a "creative writing" course. Those kids could at least have a lesson on story structure. At least they could have read 3 acts, but of course that wasn't a priority either. It was an embarrassment to look at these jerks in funny clothes that were sturdy by the 1980's. The fact that none of these actors committed suicide in humiliation is probably evidence of the limited distribution that this film has received. If the actors had actually seen the final result of their hard work, there would have been a line waiting to wait for the Brooklyn Bridge. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie 10/10 stars but it's just earned 1 for not released at all. This movie must be shown to film students everywhere. It's better than 90% of student movies I've seen and wow this movie is a piece of shiiiit.
