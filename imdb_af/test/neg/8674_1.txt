I'm not Jane Austen puris, but why make such a movie if you have nothing to say. <br /> <br /> Billie Piper was so wrong for the part it was difficult to know where to start-wrong personality, modern makeup, totally wrong hair (there's no way a young lady of her age in public with her hair being detached and so unbearable), she did not seem particularly gentle or created by the family and I did not seem to understand why everyone thought of her as particularly sacred or similar. <br /> <br /> The picnic (replaced by the ball) was so low-budget. It was embarrassing to see and miss the Portsmouth department completely. Destroy the tip of the piece (as well as the performance of scenes that could add an eager contrast point to the oh-so-claustrophobic pink lounge.) <br /> <br /> To those responsible: If you're not the imagination (Even the budget doesn't matter as much as the imagination) to do something meaningful with an adjustment, don't pretend to be <br /> <br /> About 10% Mansfield Park and 90% Nothing. <br /> <br /> PS Edmund was very good.
