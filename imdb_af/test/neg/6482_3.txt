Role reversal remake of 1942's "The Major and the Minor" reinforced Jerry Lewis in the part originally played by Ginger Rogers, but unfortunately this anemic outing misses much more than just Ginger. Lewis tries to pass for a child when he enters a train; He is successful, but the deception leads to a series of comic and romantic confusion. Sidney Sheldon adapted the script, which played in musical moments for Dean Martin (another in his second banana stable) and a jewel robbery subplot (which is bad). Diana Lynn, who played the wily teenager in the original movie, plays Lewis's love interest here. She is cute; Jerry is not. * 1/2 of ****
