I can't believe I've actually been through the whole movie! It was absolutely horrible, and totally unrelenting, and yet I sat there thinking it had to get better. It didn't, and I wasted 2 hours of my life. Will Smith is much better at action movies - I love him, the robot, the enemy of the state and the Independence Day - and I don't think he can really be expected to perform a whole movie as the romantic lead in the way Cary Grant can. Then again, the writing was unbearably terrible, and the dialogue was so cheesy. <br /> <br /> I didn't like everyone except Albert's character, and even what I found was done with a heavy hand. If you want to watch a modern, fun romantic comedy, watch a 10-day-old guy or Harry meet Sally. The 40-year-old Virgin left me with a smile on my face. I even chose music and lyrics above - and yes, I know it's cute, but at least it didn't take itself seriously and was sweet. I also neglected the main female lead - and was not convinced of the chemistry between her and Will Smith's character. <br /> <br /> In my whole I think there were two scenes I liked (and certainly not the end, which was misleading and unconvincing!) - Hitch called Sarah when she didn't give him her , was pretty sweet, and - no, sorry, that's the only thing I liked about the whole movie. Don't waste your time.
