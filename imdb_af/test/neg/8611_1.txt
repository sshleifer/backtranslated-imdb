This movie is really bad. The hero can't play. You see too much that he has learned that she is moving heartily. And believe me, he runs a lot. Nothing happens for 45 minutes. He just walks to places and climbs out. As if the story was so short that it had to be expanded by adding useless and boring look-like-a-suspensions scenes. <br /> <br /> Dialogues are very poor. I counted a whole bunch of "hello's" and little "hanging on" on the 1st part. <br /> <br /> Blood is orange like the Mercurochrome that you put on the child's blisters. And scenes don't follow themselves. A bloody neck on a scene, a clean neck on the next. <br /> <br /> The story could improve. Yes, I mean what hell is the story? <br /> <br /> Martial Arts? Where? Is this martial arts? See how hesitant and slow is the move !!!!! If you give a kick and get a punch, martial arts are called, then I'm Bruce Lee !!!! <br /> <br /> The only good point I have found is on scenes: they don't play with zoom and fast switching tones that give your headache in most action movies. <br /> <br /> There are many low budget films that are great. That one was just making money. Nothing else.
