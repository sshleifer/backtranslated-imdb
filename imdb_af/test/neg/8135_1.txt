I walked in Heart of Gold and thought I was going to watch a documentary about Neil Young. Instead, I pay tribute to the arrogance of outdated baby boomers who have lost their fringe and forgot their roots. Highly acclaimed by aging baby peasant critics, directed and executed by more aging baby boomer artists, Heart Of Gold is a drill party from start to finish, which is if you can read through the entire 2 hour movie. Neil Young and the crew have long lost their rand and want the rest of us to be with them on a padded mediocre belt. What happened to the guitar guitar of his earlier solo efforts? I think all his fuzz boxes have been eradicated and his exaggerated vacuum tubes exploded in the hot air of his generation. As for Demme, is it the daring director of Something Wild & Melvin And Howard? A student filmmaker could have made a more daring movie than this poorly visualized surface performance film. Don't waste your $$ on Heart Of Gold and go straight to The Last Waltz and Gimmie Shelter. And if you really want to dig into the personality of a rock and roll icon, you screw a copy of Chuck Berry: Hail Hail Rock And Roll, which is out of print. And baby boomers, don't worry about how this review is loaded by someone younger. I am also one of those baby boomers who listened to Cinnamon Girl on acid and danced in the streets to the Stones Street Fighting Man. Go back and see Don't look back or Gimmie Shelter and then come back and tell me that Heart of Gold has any value as a document.
