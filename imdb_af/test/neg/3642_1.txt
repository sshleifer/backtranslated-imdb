When I first looked at Zoey101 with my sister, we thought it was a piece of garbage. Nobody is rich and lives at a Pacific Ocean dormitory. In the show, Zoey is a very popular rich girl who always goes to her for advice. Zoey is always the one with the good idea and everyone agrees with her, no matter how stupid her idea is. She is always perfect in everything, including her perfect figure. And she's such a dietary freak that she talks about carbohydrates because she knows what they are. When she sees her friends eating chocolate, they confiscate it. And another thing that comes to my mind is that she always chews a spearmint every time you look at her. And everyone wants something to happen to her, for example in one episode that Logan man offers $ 4,000 to encourage her and her friends for everything he does in his pathetic life. And her friend Nicole is an exaggerated fear that screams a lot. And Lola dresses like a Hoochie Houdini lady. 80's mentioned that they wanted bushes back there. Maybe they should also chase the hair. This show sends a bad message to kids everywhere to make them think that if they do not have the latest I-Pods and designer clothes, they will hate themselves. <br /> <br /> This show is a big thumb. <br /> <br /> We hate your Jamie Lynn, <br /> <br /> Best Regards Ryan, and Kara L
