Well, you know ... Rutger Hauer and Robert Patrick are both very good actors. But WTF with this movie? The story was lame and the writing was just awful. The poor actors didn't have the material to work with! <br /> <br /> The DVD cover invited you to a flight action. You'll expect something like Top Gun. Great disappointment! The flight action in this movie is so cheap that it drops you. The aerial photographs are clearly taken from documentaries and other sources not made for this movie. And they didn't even care about the points or the fighting models. If it is taken for granted, the audience will not see it. <br /> <br /> As I said, the story was lame. With a little effort from the writer and director it could have been very interesting. In short, it looks like a B-movie was made in the 70's. <br /> <br /> I feel very sorry for these actors sitting here. They must be ashamed.
