I have a friend who works at blockbuster and he gets a free 5 week free movie rental, so one day when we shed the passages for something interesting, I stumbled across 18 Kung Fu Weapons and just judged at the box. It was nice wack, but we were tempted and hired. After all, it was free ..... and thank you, it was .... it is by far the WORST movie I've ever seen. the budget had to be a pick and a piece of string. The plot was ridiculous. The only mention of the 18 weapons is that there is a book that teaches the ways of the 18 weapons that a bad man is undergoing. and that's it! there is not even any weapon fighting in this movie ... it and the action ranges are just flat out BAD .... 9 times out of 10 the other man's kicks and kicks come across a foot away from the landing on the other man's, and there are many times when the movie will overshoot frames (a result of ridiculously poor editing) .... the dubbing is just as fussy and it is hardly even understandable .... and we will not even come into the scene. .. the end will definitely let you say "wtf ??" but to be honest, I have to mention that the fighting techniques used by the actors were somewhat decent and the old man was a crazy bunch .... but that's about ... Luckily I didn't have to pay for this movie, but I think carefully now I know exactly how bad a movie can actually be.
