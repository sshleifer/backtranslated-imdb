It's a quick movie worth finding and seeing. <br /> <br /> It really addresses all the everyday choices we all make every day and (like an HG Welles story, I can't quite remember) to want to get back. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that this is a SHORT (very short). It starts slowly but just as you start thinking, it has become boring = scared = it's over. And believe me, the punch line is one you will remember. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if the producers will make it available to buy - or available on the web, but in any way 'Be happy, you've taken the time to get a copy in hand to get. Of that I am sure.
