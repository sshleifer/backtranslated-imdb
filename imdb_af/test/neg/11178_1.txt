The most disturbing thing about this movie is not that it was a powerhouse (the CPUSA was never such a spying threat as the movie is). The disturbing aspect is the way it erases the wholly indifferent tactics of the FBI and the UnAmerican Activities Committee. Secret informants, gossip became accusations, unsecured searches - these are the kinds of things secret police officers like the KGB did, and presumably, fighting the good patriotic Americans. Yet the FBI did them and didn't look at them. This is the only realistic part of this movie, and they do not pity it at all. Add to this the undermining of the constitution by calling on Communists only to the Bill of Rights. The film also makes dull veil accusations that the black civil rights movement was communist inspired, another pack of lies. It is extremely difficult today to excuse so far-reaching propaganda, even to understand the paranoia of times, when one realizes how harmful it is to real people.
