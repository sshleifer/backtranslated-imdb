Reba is a very stupid performance. You can pretty much predict everything that is going to happen. Barbra Jean is not too stupid. It's like she's not even a character. A show like this should have at least someone who looks like a real person. I think Barbra Jean represents a delayed person. Keira or whatever her name is, Reba, Brock, they're all stupid! Keira is like the smartest person on the show, and she's still stupid. Everyone is blunt! That's my opinion of Reba. Having said everything I can say about this performance, I will only record the following few lines of text by saying what I am currently saying and doing until there are 10 lines. There. Reba gets 2/10.
