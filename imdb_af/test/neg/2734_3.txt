The writer apparently "borrowed" wholesale (ahem ahem, hoefief) from a certain other film using a self-propelled manned drilling machine. Scene per scene, the two movies were almost identical. Just enough of the serial numbers were submitted in this one to prevent a copyright infringement process. <br /> <br /> Unlike this, I have to say that I found it somewhat entertaining, as I enjoy deeper underground -Aarth genre of movies. It's a bit stupid, as far as science goes, but if you are prepared to really make your eyes hard and pretend, you have not seen the scientific gaffe here and there and this movie is everywhere hardly feasible. Much better than "Supernova" which was another movie that Luke Perry had a leading role. It was so stupid, stupid, stupid that nothing could save it. A note to filmmakers: Use someone who knows something about the subject that the movie is about. It will be a very small part of the movie budget, but it will have a huge impact on the way you prevent your audience from repelling you to do stupid science. <br /> <br /> Production values: almost sensible. I saw much worse in my time. <br /> <br /> A new thought for disaster films: instead of always having a happy ending where the world is being saved, some of which where things are a little bit more realistic, sometimes even the best efforts eventually come to failure. Especially when the problem to be solved is primarily caused by sheer stupidity. Folly-caused disaster films with glowing, heart-warming ends, similar to stupidity, explain stupidity by saying: "No matter how terribly a problem is caused by braindead stupidity, it can be fixed." This is certainly not the case. A self-inflicted disaster movie with an unfortunate end would serve better as a warning story of "Don't be so fucking stupid in the first place." Do you have to watch this movie? If you're bored and you've seen everyone else in the scifi department at your local video rental store, sure why. But avoid "Supernova" because I can assure you that you are not so bored. It was definitely not one of Luke Perry's better movies. This one is better. It doesn't say much, but it's better. <br /> <br /> One dead need to be a deep underground genre movie. One dead person needs to get rid of restlessness coming from the script of another particular movie from the same genre.
