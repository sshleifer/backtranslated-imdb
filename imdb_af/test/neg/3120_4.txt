Pretentious clap ladder, the update of Herman Melville (!), About a young man's vague outrageous relationship with his aristocratic mother who is transferred to his lost sister educated by gypsies. Or something like that ?? Not that anyone really cares about unraveling his multilayer plot with pornographic sex scenes, pseudo-symbolic images (the brothers and sisters swimming in blood of the blood) and other bizarre touches (a gypsy child repeatedly insults passers-by in the street until she is killed anonymously, the deafening music of a rock group used in the demolition of old buildings). Considering the source material and the presence of Catherine Deneuve (who will at least bathe in the nude), I expected a lot from this. apparently there is an even longer TV version of POLA X out there?
