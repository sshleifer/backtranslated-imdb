Sure, it's hard to be gay, especially in the south. We'll get it. About ... and again. <br /> <br /> What stood out was that filmmakers focused almost entirely on the more "extreme" characters in this small town gay; the draw queen, the sly sleaze of a closed bar, and a cruelly murdered man because he was gay but had nothing to do with one of the bars that was the focus of this movie. <br /> <br /> There were cuts of interviews from other people, people who might be able to handle viewers better. But they are glossy, almost skipped, perhaps in a glance at the background. <br /> <br /> It would have been interesting for me to hear the experiences of the more common gay men and women. which was either enriched or otherwise through the experiences of a small village gay bar and / or the absence of that community.
