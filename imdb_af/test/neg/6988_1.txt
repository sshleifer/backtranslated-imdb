I watched this movie on and off as it started playing about an hour ago, and I have to say, it's an hour of my life that I wasted and won't be returning. The play is shit and the scripts must look at a serious look, and whoever wrote it must be slapped. Maybe the TV will explode and let me sit out of my misery. The only good thing about this movie is that it has good good candy for guys and girls. , what I want to do, with regard to the movie, the special effects like Sh * t, Dante? Who thinks a man wearing an empty leather pants and half a leather jacket is scary, he looks more feminine than most women in this movie. Dante's voice is pathetic, no one finds it threatening or frightening. .TV, I ask you to blow up !!!!!!!!!!
