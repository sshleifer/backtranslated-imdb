It claims to be the life of Paul, the apostle. It opens up with him involved in a patchwork wrestling match with a priest. The Pharisees mentioned this because they secreted themselves from Hellenism forced by their pagan rulers on the Jews. The point is that Saul was never involved in the Greco-Roman struggle. PERIOD. <br /> <br /> Then we have the two men (Saul and the Priest, Reuben - a completely out-of-biblical fictional character) rinsed in the nude in a Roman style bathroom. Again, the Torah, which Saul held religiously, condemned in the strongest possible terms to another man's nakedness. <br /> <br /> Reuben is shown as the one who pushes Saul to destroy the church. Again, the text of Scripture does not matter, because they are PAUL saying that he was wasting the church and blowing out threats and slaughter against the church. <br /> <br /> The movie shows that Barnabas "sprinkles" Paul - not to let him dip, when the scripture says it was Ananias who did it. <br /> <br /> They don't speak of Mark or she is returning, so the writers of the scripture are forced to Paul and Barnabas argue about Paul's desire to preach in Rome as the basis of their separation. <br /> <br /> No Silas on Paul's Second and Third Missions; No Timothy ... EVER. No Titus; No Apollos ... No, no, no !!! James is said to have known Jesus for a long time, rather than saying, as the scripture does, that he is Jesus' brother. <br /> <br /> Why not just the movie "Frank, the Fictional Apostle?!?" It will at least be closer to the Scripture text.
