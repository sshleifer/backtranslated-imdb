The man with the screaming brain is a story of greed, betrayal and revenge in the small Bulgarian town. William Cole, rich industrialist, winds up with a part of his brain, replaced by that of a Russian taxi driver Yegor. The two couldn't be different, but they shared one thing - both were murdered by the same woman. Brown Campbell returns to the B-horror movie genre that gave him the status of the cult. This time it is not an unlikely partnership to find its common nation. <br /> <br /> Just before the screen, but behind the lens. Unfortunately for this time, the laugh does not deliver and Campbell has to resort to what he does best to fill the gap in this film. <br /> <br /> As a fan of Campbell, who has the movies, books and action figures, I was hoping for another hit to add to my collection. Although I am after the purchase of this film before the purchase, I am glad I did not have the "pleasure" to add it. <br /> <br /> The movie goes first in the story, which looks like innocent fun at first sight, but apparently dull out of it. What a sad thing to say because it was written by Mr Campbell himself. The comedy never really saves, it just makes us scratch our heads. Campbell seems to have run out of funny things to give the audience we've already seen ... he's fighting himself. <br /> <br /> Ted Raimi, brother of Evil Dead director Sam Raimi, is undoubtedly the highlight of the movie. He brings a freshness and an entertaining time when the movie really needs it. It helps if you are a fan and followed these stunts from Evil Dead to Xena, so I forced myself to keep this movie. <br /> <br /> Campbell's experience as director, of deriving episodes from the TV series Hercules is clear. Campbell makes the movie work well enough, even with the low budget. In the end there are not so many things that will happen as you would like, but Campbell fans will stick to it, no matter what unlucky for this fan ... I won't.
