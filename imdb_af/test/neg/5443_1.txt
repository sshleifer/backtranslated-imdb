As a keen filmmaker I felt like I had my favorite movies in the position, but I just got it fair to arrange my most hated movies. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid I can't really say anything positive about this. Movie. It's actually one of only two movies I've ever come across. In fairness I went back and looked at the movie again to give it another chance and just sat there to wish I was staying away. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that the movie has a very decent throw and crew ... but then even the brightest stars in Hollywood can't bring a dead duck from a screenplay. <br /> <br /> Stay away ... Save yourself from this real ugly movie 1/10
