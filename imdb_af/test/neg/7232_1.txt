A carnivorous octopus, where will that old Boaz (who ..?) Davidson still get inspiration? Anyway, even for the low, low standards of both the giant marine animals that kill human genre and me, this one is just above the terrible. The octopus is one of the funniest, funniest, worst monsters I've ever seen. I think he just ended up in the (ahum) East River because Sea World got sick. The actors can be seen helping the octopus to choke them. Evil idiots, so he will never learn! You want all the other giants. killer octopuses (that's the right plural, too way) to laugh at him? Meanies. <br /> <br /> To stop the octopus, wind, razors that are difficult to handle, as well as special seafarer Nick Hartfield and his partner, who will retire in one week, are first eaten by the octopus. Hope, octopus won the battle! A few more and he will develop (the scars remain in my mind). Of course no one tries to help him. Not a damn thing (doesn't he have a gun or something?) But no, it also doesn't help magic. <br /> <br /> Good, his cop's love interest enters Rachel Starbird. Is it based on some cartoons or something? Anyway, they try to stop the octopus by walking in the park. They hope this helps, as it is July 4th in a few days, and the octopus can join the party. And you don't know how he is when he's drunk. Rachel then gets a school bus from nowhere to make sure this movie won't end, while Nick feeds the octopus even more soap. <br /> <br /> Though it is a little shit that ends, Nick can blow the octopus, and a lot of kids out there, brave and laugh. You know, with a belly vision, it will probably get a R. real life, i want to say all ages, but i like all ages, so my last idea is: Suitable for absolutely no one. There is no sex, no gore, nothing. Now forget this movie ever existed. Join the club.
