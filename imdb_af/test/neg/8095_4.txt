I mostly rented this movie to see Shannon Elizabeth. She played well in this movie, but the plot sucked. The movie wasn't really about anything, just trying to stay alone after entering into a treaty when one of Jerry O'Connell's friends married. The other friends put this money together and who is the last time to get married, gets the money ($ 10,000) from all his friends. Anyway, the movie just tries to go through not making it and trying to make it more funny than it has been since. I'm glad I pay only 50 for this movie. It wasn't really good at all. I rated it **** out of 10 stars!
