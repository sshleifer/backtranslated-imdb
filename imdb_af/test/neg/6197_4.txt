A deaf walk through the banality of Mormon prosthabilitation. Totally un-funny. A proof of the widely-born theory that it is necessary to be humor-friendly in bathroom needs to be vulgar; It also reinforces the demand that a close relationship with Jesus does not make you funny. More propaganda than film, don't worry about any social issues that come to the table at this table. The saving grace of this movie is the accurate portrayal of young Mormon women as particularly attractive. Oh yes, it's your $ 7.50.
