Oh If any day you want to see a supernatural thriller coming out to be a comedy, look at this movie <br /> <br /> This movie was a shocker because it had so many actors in it, but what they do and how do they fit? <br /> <br /> Dealing with college scenes is like a school game where every person speaks and then comes the next person. <br /> <br /> Okay to laugh at the movie: 1) Akshay, Suneil, Aditya Panscholi, Sharad Kapoor, Arshad Warsi as college students 2) Akshay carries a gun in college 3) some pathetic stunts and SFX <br /> <br /> There are several mistakes like why the snake doesn't rape its lover and comes in late? also why didn't he just kill everyone there? <br /> <br /> But after that they have to make a 2 hour + movie so you have a tortory movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is painful to watch. The film is directed by Rajkumar Kohli, an expert who made such films in the past. He has a successful record of films like JAANI DUSHMAN (1979) and NAGIN Rajkumar Kohli wants to help his son's non-existent career. Right from VIRODHI 1992), Aulad Ke Dushman (1993) and QAHAR (1996) have tried all his flops hard to promote his son and he also throws big stars so his son is noticed. Unfortunately, nothing can help his son's career <br /> <br /> The movie has several comic scenes such as the death scenes, how the actors, after being grounded by the snake, are so fit to fight him again and the climax. <br /> <br /> Direction by Rajkumar Kohli is bad Music is bad <br /> <br /> It brings us to the throw Akshay Kumar - ordinary things, he has nothing more to do than stunts Suneil Shetty Terrible Sonu Nigam - Utante's worst debut award goes to him, giving a new meaning to the cartoon. Horrific Arshad Wars to do Sharad Kapoorbad. Aditya Pancholian irritator Sunny Deol is comedian in the scene when he saves Sonu LOL Manisha Koirala ordinary Rambha. - Akshay's pair Kiran Kumar, Raza Murad is usually Raj Babbar - hilarious for wrong reasons, the girls are terrible. This brings us to Munish Kohli. This man has a big body, he is even stronger and longer than Akshay Kumar. Unfortunately, he comes over as poor man's Akshay. His voice is terrible, his expressions are painful. The only thing he has to do in the movie is wearing glasses and making an evil face. Rajat Bedi is terrible
