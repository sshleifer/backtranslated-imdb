I'm a great comedy show fan. Racial humor is always a bit risky, but the likes of George Lopez, Dave Chapelle, Lisa Lampanelli and so on. Pull it off perfectly. <br /> <br /> They won't overboard, make the audience uncomfortable or * hoesief * STEAL JOKES! But I won't sharpen it. <br /> <br /> Carlos makes racial humor totally unapproachable. His jokes are constantly shouting racial humor to the point, because it's not funny or clever, but it is insulting. I'm not one to get cold against racial humor. But his performance of these jokes is messy, causing people to come back on his comedy. <br /> <br /> His humor is only surpassed by his increased presence in annoyance. I feel like he's constantly scorching me! And he walks around the stage like a maniac. It's just as annoying!
