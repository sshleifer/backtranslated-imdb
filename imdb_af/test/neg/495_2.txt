No emotion. Bad music (and I'm a reformed eighty-year-old metal man, so I'll be vulnerable to good things.) Everything's finished. The brother is a parody, there is nothing to hold us over, except to see what horror from the eighties will follow. The tour manager tries to bring a humanity to the thing, but doesn't get enough time. Wahlberg is okay and Aniston slumbering. We know she doesn't need the money. Is this the only role she can fit in her summer break? Certainly she should hit her forehead every time it appears on VH1 - which is only slightly less frequent than Ozzy does. It hardly qualifies as a TV movie. It's just hard to believe it's actually released into the theater.
