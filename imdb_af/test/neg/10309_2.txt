Don't worry if you look at the cover of the DVD, but Sandra Bullock will appear in this cult class for a maximum of 5 minutes. The entertainment value here is very high. <br /> <br /> To name but a few of the many highlights that need attention: <br /> <br /> - The doubled evil voices of the main bad guys - The special gun camera - The strange masks and killer killers - The imaginative ways to catch a bullet and hit the ground - The abundance of upside-down shots - The spatial scene in which Bullock unconsciously touches the street - The clich√© Italian bendman Moe (LaMotta) - The cheap synthesizer background music - The stunningly exaggerated gun fetishism <br /> <br /> And finally, not least: the super-cornish fist-fighting scenes. Wish there would have been more of them ... <br /> <br /> Extra point for the successful attempt to make me laugh aloud.
