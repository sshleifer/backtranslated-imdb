Forget what I said about Emeril. Rachael Ray is the most annoying personality on the food network and all the television. If you have never seen 30 Minutes Meals, you may not begin to understand how unsettling she is. I really meant that you couldn't even start from her until you watched the show once or twice, and even then all the words and intelligent thoughts will fail you. The problem is mostly with her ways you might guess. Ray has a firm mouth and often mimics the parrot. If you love something or think it's "awesome" (a word she uses about 87 times a broadcast), just say it. And she continually uses horrible, unfinished catches such as "EVOO" (Extra Olive!). BE QUIET! What's worse, Ray has TWO other programs on the network! I think it's some comprehensive conspiracy by the terrorists to make us angry. Give me more Tyler Florence! Ray is lame.
