I swear I didn't mean it! I just picked it because it looks good on the back! This movie was not scary at all and was actually very confusing. The demon wind was actually used only a few times, and people were killed. The one brightest place was to see Sherri Bendorf from the Slaughterhouse. However, to see what happened to her thought of this little turkey of a movie. A 3 out of 10. NEXT!
