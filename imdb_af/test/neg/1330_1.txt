This movie was terrible! My friend and I were so bored about it, we quickly sent through the last half of the movie just to see what happened. It's the typical sporting thing, she also wins or loses. The only interesting thing was when one man referred to someone as a Veg e-tab. It will be a line, my friend and I spend years reminding us of this colossal cheesy cliche waste
