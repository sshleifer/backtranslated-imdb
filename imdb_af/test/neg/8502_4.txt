Other reviewers seem to consider this movie highly. For something made by an eighteen-year-old film student, I would say bravo, but that is not the case. If you want to watch a good movie about graffitti, stick to the documentaries. It is filmed with the same quality as a digital home video. The two main characters are dishonest actors and it will be good if it is a student profile. The plot follows a lonely artist who writes skateboards around Portland graffitti. He is linked by another and their skater together to create art. Then comes the unnecessary gay love scene. Then comes the dispute between those who are never actually discussed, because this film has about as much dialogue as a Charlie Chaplin picture. This movie shows the gravitational street artists give their shape well, and the music is nice, but I won't really call it a movie.
