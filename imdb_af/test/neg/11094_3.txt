Even Sophie Marceau's presence and the little (very few) good French gags are unable to save this otherwise slow and boring movie! A disappointment. The story is poor and so deals. This film is advertised as the French version of The Mummy, but the Mummy has at least spectacular and enjoyable effects ...
