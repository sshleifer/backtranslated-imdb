I would like to know the real name of the Lodge where films from the film have been filmed. It's really beautiful and listen to the architecture of the 20's and 30's like the Hotel Del Coronado. I know it was on Big Bear Lake or Lake Arrowhead and would like to hear if it still exists. Regarding the movie itself, it's really amazing that Jane Wyman was even named for an Oscar prize. It had to be a time when she was very much loved by her academy counterparts. It would have been really interesting to get a real impression of Wyman and the other actors in this movie about the script. The screenplay of this movie, such as the recent Kevin Costner movie, in a bottle, is so incredible that it limits the credibility that the actors can bring to their part. Rock Hudson can be forgiven. He was never a good actor, but could mostly look on his body and did not have credible roles until later in his career (Pretty Maids is the exception). But Wyman had to be forced to take this movie through contractual requirements or the studio system.
