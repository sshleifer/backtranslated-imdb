If there was justice in the cinema, director Lewis Schoenbrun would never sit down on a movie set again. It seems inconceivable that anyone who can spend two full decades in an editing room, where LS started his film, could be completely without any pacing or dramatic staging, but this film is damning evidence. <br /> <br /> Bad as it is, it's fascinating. From the opening scene where a nurse is dressed in a costume, it is only for a porn movie or a shit on a Mexican variety show, the viewer is obliged to see how low it can go. The answer is not far away, as in the next scene we move to a funeral hall, where the next beautiful fashion statement in a sexy black-dressed black dress worn by one of the mourners. <br /> <br /> Aggressive inappropriate costumes are not the only fault of the movie. The dialogue is a surprise to connoisseurs of bad writing. "You turn my tears into wine," is a monster jewel. The actor deserves an Oscar for delivering one with a straight face. <br /> <br /> The director strengthens every cheeseball scene with what may have been the schmaltziest soundtrack score ever, which embarrasses embarrassment in the dialogue screens. groovebox wannabe rocknroll in transition scenes. <br /> <br /> The script introduces characters with no rhyme or reason and story beats are dropped as if with a broken patch. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget, it's a horror movie, though. Our characters find themselves in a forest where dr. Chopper and his two "terrifying" henchwomen, who are supposed to be a kind of Frankencreatures, but look exactly like Valley Girls with fake blood that disappears under their Supercut shades. I honestly saw a crook makeup on eight-year-olds from the trick-of-treating on Halloween. <br /> <br /> And again, we get a swing from the costume designer's unashamed craft, such as Valley Ghoul One prances around in a pseudo-Victorian polyblend smuggling while her partner is wearing an indescribable ensemble, which is almost hip could be the hip-corners of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> Dr. However, Chopper makes the big fashion statement, resembling a Crisco cowboy who lost his big black Harley in the bush, dressed from head to toe in black black S&M leather. <br /> <br /> If that sounds interesting, it means checking it out. There are numerous outreach and extensive dialogue (such as the precious "elephant's cemetery" scene or the "intellectual" discourse in Ginsburg). <br /> <br /> To be honest, cinematography is good, considering what was set in front of the camera, and the actors strive (with extremely extreme results) to make a bunch of heaps of clich√©s and inanities. You have to wonder if they were really dumb or just blindly desperate not to get off the set after they got one of the ridiculous villains with their 99 Cent Store weapons.
