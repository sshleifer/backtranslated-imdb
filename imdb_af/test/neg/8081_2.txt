This is what this movie is. Good God, the special effects suck in this movie. It's hard for anything to suck more than the movie's plot, but the special effects do it. Let me try to explain how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> First there is the plot. There are four punk ass teens rubbish riders riding in a forest in Duluth, MN. One of them is a dumb ass and tries a ludicrous leap and breaks his leg. A paramedic comes to help him, but is stranded with them when the helicopter breaks. Then five realize that there is a forest fire, which we see, has been started by a guy who dumps tons of gas over the forest. All they show us is his boots, and they point the scene to the scene of these guys' boots running around and burning. Meanwhile, the teens are trying to escape the fire, only to find that the boatman somehow managed to get in front of them (while driving through the bush on dirt bins!), Pour the gas over area to which they drove, and start more fires. He does it several times, and the paramedic finally gets him and starts burning him. I will not spoil the end, but this man's resilience will shout you: "WHAT THE BLOODY HELL?!?!" at the screen. Anyway, they are now surrounded by fire, and their only escape is by a methane-filled mine. Yes, methane gas. I'm not even going to try to describe the end because it's too ridiculous and you'll enjoy it if you don't see it. What you won't, because you can't possibly expect what happens. This is because of the second major problem with this movie: consistency. <br /> <br /> Is some degree of consistency too much to ask? Apparently so. I can't even count the number of broken limbs in this movie (they keep arms and legs breaking as they crash their bikes). I think every character breaks at least one limb, and several more than one. They then ran around until the scene ended, and then forgot that they were supposed to have broken limbs. There is one scene where three of those who need broken bones start dancing. But then their injuries suddenly come back when the plot needs them. <br /> <br /> Finally, the CGI. If there is a hell, it is to watch the fire in this movie. All they did for forest fires is the gravel roads with CGI fire. You can clearly see that the only CGI fire is next to the roads, and all the trees that are more than two feet off the road are left untouched. And then they zoom out and show the whole forest engulfed in flames. It is difficult to describe in words how ridiculous it is, but I assure you that ridicule is very impressive. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of those bad-good-good types. There are a few occasions where it goes down in the painfully bad category, but mostly it stays at the top of the line and is ridiculously rude. I can't wait to watch the other Nature Unleashed movies that came in the four-pack with this one.
