Well, Killshot is not terrible, but it comes close. Production values ​​are decent and the main players do a good job (except for Rosario Dawson in a wasted role), but the story is just pathetic. I don't know if the book Elmore Leonard had such stupid characters, as I didn't read it, but I suspect the book should be at least slightly humorous. The movie has no detectable humor. After the first twenty minutes you will shout on the screen: "Oh, come on! No one is so stupid!" In a nutshell, and without a spoil, everyone does in a way that is convenient to the plot, which makes no sense. A very frustrating and unrealistic movie, which can count on it as long as it sits on the shelf.
