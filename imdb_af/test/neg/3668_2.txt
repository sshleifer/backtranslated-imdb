Deceived, misty, dark, unmistakable laziness has given the high gloss MGM A budget treatment. Kate Hepburn plays a bride who suspects her rich, handsome man (Robert Taylor) is not the dream boat she married, but a psychotic killer. MGM's attempt to make a Hitchcockian thriller is doomed from the outset by a turgid, confused, ridiculous script and Hepburn's idiotic decision as a dreaded woman fearing her life (who can ever imagine Hepburn that they are afraid of anything?) Louis B. Mayer forgot to tell Vincent Minnelli that he is a thriller director, not a musical. Taylor is embarrassing. Only Robert Mitchum, who is also a good man, has retained his dignity in a quiet, low key performance. Karl Freund's overwhelming cinematography creates images of ominous beauty - and was wasted on the wrong movie. End result: Metro's "Parnell" of the 1940s.
