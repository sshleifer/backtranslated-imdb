One of the biggest lessons I've ever had in watching a movie happened this way: <br /> <br /> I was in Roger Corman's offices, like so many other vanities and since, I am working out how it all worked and how to make myself indispensable (hah!). One afternoon Julie Corman, Roger Corman's wife and a producer in her own right, asked me to upload a tape. I'm not sure why she wanted to see it. I have the impression that it was a student or a show roll, something like that, a kind of ticket. Whatever the reasons why she had seen it, was the only free video machine in the offices that was in the room in which I was working, and I was the closest person to the machine. I started the band. <br /> <br /> Faded: On the screen is a figure sitting at a desk looking at the camera. Behind him, screen left, was a door that opened in the room. Against the distant wall was a coat of arms. A second character came in through the door and started talking. The first character, the man at the desk, turned around to answer, (it's already one take, static camera, there are no slices of pans or dolly shots. Just one closed camera). The second character turned around to hang his dress on the dress and deliver his next line. Julie Corman said, "I've seen enough." and left the room. <br /> <br /> What she saw in the ten seconds of footage she watched was that the director was an idiot. Opening with two characters who immediately turned their backs on the camera's line slips? No, sorry. Next! This is how long you have. Ten seconds. Cook it in the opening shot and you're dead. <br /> <br /> I was reminded of that moment as I watched the opening of this piece. After an unmistakably long jungle travel guide, we see that several monkeys throw themselves into cages. A man wearing a gun laughs. An airplane landing and we see it taxiing completely to the terminal. God it is boring! Cut to the inside of the airport. Meet two men. Ha! Something happens! They shake hands. Cut to another corner of the two men - <br /> <br /> - and the director crosses the line. <br /> <br /> The first two shots of the movie have any spatial relationship with each one. others and the man rushed up. "Crossing The Line" is not one of the basic rules of film grammar that lets the characters jump from side to side on the screen and confuse the audience. Audiences do not like to be confused. Mystified? Baffled? Surprised and irritated? Yes. Audiences like everyone. Confused? No, you lose them. They walk out. "Not the intersection of the line" is one of those things they are pumping into you at the film school. These are basic things. This is not an irreconcilable rule (there are no irreparable rules) directors break it all the time - but not on the first real cut of the movie. <br /> <br /> I thought, "I've seen enough". And turned off.
