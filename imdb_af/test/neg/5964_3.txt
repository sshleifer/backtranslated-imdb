According to this masterpiece of the film's text (pun intended), Charles Darwin was full of nonsense when he presented his theory of evolution, because he had absolutely no mention of any alien intervention. For you see, strangers sent Chupacabras to the earth and they form the missing link in evolution theory. However, the rest of the film clearly shows that Chupacabras is a typical Puerto Rican phenomenon, so I don't really know where it fits. Are they saying that all Puerto Ricans are strangers? Either way, this is pretty much irrelevant in any case. The only thing you should remember is that El Chupacabre is a very inexpensive and imbecile amateur B movie, with no tension, character development and any style. Several duos look for this goat monster (remotely resembling the pumpkin head demon), through the streets and ghettos of an ugly city. We have an undisputed dogcatcher and a winding female novelist, some unpleasant policemen and the so-called evil scientist with his dull accomplice. As they are all extremely incompetent about what they are doing, the monster can keep on indulging in all the Latino immigrants from the area. The sample looks good and the makeup effects on the remains of its victims are acceptable cruel and bloody. The appearances are irreparably terrible and cause headaches. First of all, Eric Alegria is in his first and only lead role as the over-ambitious employee of Animal Control. Yes, it's an amazing silly movie, but you've struggled yourself through worse and less amusing low-budget rubbish.
