Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a film about an injured young girl. Do I need to describe more of the plot to you? The Exorcist and the Exorcism of Emily Rose are two awesome scary movies. Classic (IMO). Blackwater Valley Exorcism (BVE) is not. Not by a long shot. This is certainly not as terrible as a low budget copy of The Exorcist could have been. From start to finish it has the feel of a "made for Sci-Fi channel" production. This is one of those movies that will probably be pounded and mocked at Mystery Science Theater 3000 (or similar show). <br /> <br /> The make-up and effects were absolutely laughable. The acting was terribly bad. There wasn't a single show that didn't cause me to roll or giggle my eyes. Oh, except maybe for Jeffery (Re-Animator) Combs as the sheriff. The writing wasn't that terrible, but it was definitely not something special. <br /> <br /> It seems like most of the movie is more focused on who is sleeping with than the girl with the devil in the other room. Oh, there was something I learned from this movie. Apparently, if your teenage daughter is in possession of a devil, just lock in the room. C'mon. And if your daughter is in possession, don't worry too much, because all that does, let them talk in funny voices, eat rabbits, try to stare at you and put down their dowry machines. In addition, there is nothing to worry about. Apparently, she was busy with a low-budget D-List demon. <br /> <br /> There was none of the abominable acts done by A-List demons, such as crucifixion, painful body twist or even projectile vomiting. <Br /> <br /> Very nice movie. Not a discount rental. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
