Wow. So my boyfriend and I went to the movie shop to rent a movie. I love silly horror movies, so I pervaded the variety of horrible movies they had to offer while searching for Michael Moore's "Sicko". So then I found the worst of all (as I would soon find out). It looks good on the front page and the description on the back looks pretty enough. The fact that there was an IMDb quote about it as a review proved that it would be bad in a good way. So the next night we put it in the DVD player and from the first five minutes we were so incredibly confused. <br /> <br /> The movie is totally incoherent, with poorly-placed leaps of past to future that make you ask for a big 'WTF? The plot has no kind of coherent story - except for the vague allusion to a local myth about a murder, but it actually only comes in the movie in the last twenty minutes. So beautiful for the first hour you have it: random, confusing leaps; incoherent plot; parents who do not age; bad acting; bad dialogue; a boy who changes hair color magic; and an army of turbulent characters to get you bored! <br /> <br /> The movie moves so slowly that it's actually to sit and watch. I'd rather shed the toilets, honestly. Don't bother with that.
