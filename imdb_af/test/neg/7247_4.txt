Director Lesley Selander's thorough routine outdoor yellow "The Yellow Tomahawk" (1954) makes the Cheyenne against the US cavalry with leathery, harsh Rory Calhoun in the middle, as the seasoned, buckskin-clad Indian scout who must lead survivors to safety . This United Artists western was in the color of the lens, but the TV edition that Turner Classic Movies broadcast was inexplicable in black and white. <br /> <br /> The action opens with Adam Reed (Rory Calhoun of Black Spurs) evading several Indians. and with his old friend and Cheyenne chief, Fire Knife (Lee Van Cleef of "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"), killing his mind. Vuurmes warns Adam that his Cheyenne braves are ready to wipe out a nearby cavalry fort under construction because it violates a treaty made by the Indians with the government. On the way to inform the resurrected camp commander, Major Ives (Warner Anderson of "Target, Burma!") About the imminent Indian attack, Adam discovers a beautiful wooden nail that seduces water into a more staircase. Katherine "Kate" Bolden ("Peggy Castle of" I, Jury ") is another of those stupid women in the Westerners who bustle in the middle of the Indian country, without caring in the world. Castle looks really naked in her swimming scenes, perhaps also the most memorable scene of all in this otherwise predictable Western. Of course, Major Ives rejects Adam's warning from Vuurmes until the commander realizes that someone has caught his ammunition dump far beyond the fort. This is one of the many questions left by Richard Alan Simmons's screenplay unanswered in this trim, 82-minute ruler. Why would the cavalry bury their ammunition in a secret place in the desert rather than keep it on the premises in the fort? Not soon did they make this discovery as the Indians attacked, knocked out of luck and left him the only survivor. Before this attack, some white prospectors drive into the fort. Sawyer (Peter Graves of "Stalag 17") brings his friend with an arrow in his chest. While Adam gets hot water to help remove the arrow, the keen Sawyer cuts the shaft deeper and kills his helpless mate. Later we learn that Sawyer and his partner beat gold. The question of spreading the gold is also left unanswered after our heroes have survived the ordeal. Adam and Fire Mes claimed one final pow-wow and Fire Mes that Adam handed over Major Ives or everyone would die. Of course, Adam and the Indians refuse to start whitening. James Best in a supporting role as cavalry gets an arrow in his back for his efforts. Noah Beery, Jr., Plays a target Mexican exploration nominated by a sexy Indian girl named Honey Bear (Oscar-winning actress Rita Moreno of West Side Story) and Robert Bray of "Lassie" celebrity is briefly like the sick-filled cavalry officer who planned to marry Kate. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise in this unbeatable western shot on the spot in Kanab, Utah, is that the evil cavalry officer Ives, who killed Indian men, women and children in the infamous Sand Creek massacre, has a secret that he is also a native American! Ironically, the Muscle Bow that gives the Fireman out of Adam's friendship at the start of the hostility, which uses our heroic scout to kill the stem-Cheyenne warrior after disappearing from bullets. "The Yellow Tomahawk" concludes on an ambiguous note. The survivors reach another outpost, Fort Ellis, where Adam and Ives provide their respective reports on the matter to an army general, but we never learn the outcome of this meeting. Is this artistic ambiguity or another unanswered question. Producer Howard W. Koch is not related to Casablanca's scenario playwright Howard Koch. Ultimately, "The Yellow Tomahawk" is one of the many pro-Indian westerns that appeared in the aftermath of Broken Arrow (1950), where the Native American is considered a noble wilderness that is unlawfully treated by some but not all whites . Selander, who made dozens of Westerns during the 1950s and 1960s, made this minor material despite his thin characters and familiar problems. Calhoun is thrown out of a top average as the ever-serving front man, and a beautiful Castle is worth looking at her feminine charm. Peter Graves plays a skunk as usual in most of his early roles. In fact, Lesley Selander called a more satisfactory dramatic version of this movie "War Paint" (1953) with Robert Stack the year before. By the way, Noah Beery Jr. and Rita Moreno both became regular on "The Rockford Files".
