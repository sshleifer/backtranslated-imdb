I must admit that I enjoyed the previous episodes, but probably because I was younger and stupid at the time. I was sorta excited about the return of the family guy until I saw the "new" shit they turned out. No surprise, it was exactly like the old shit. All the lame jokes were there, including the flashbacks, except this time they added a joke about an old, crooked pedophile in every single EPISODE. it is just one of the annoying gags family members, and for some reason people are watching. It's no longer funny, it's just annoying. let it die. Perhaps the old man was funny at a certain time, and the cheap laugh and gags were original and fresh, but now it's just no more funny. if you actually find family members funny, than you should be delayed or delayed.
