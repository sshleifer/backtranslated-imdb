I don't know how this movie received so much positive comment. One can call it "artistic" and "beautifully filmed", but those things do not matter to the empty plot filled with sexual innuendos. I wish I didn't waste my time watching this movie. Rather than being biographical, it was a poor excuse for promoting strange and ominous behavior. It was just another Hollywood effort to convince us that that kind of life is normal and good. From the beginning I asked myself what the point of this movie was, and I continued to look and hope it would change and was rather disappointed that it continued in the same year. I'm so glad I didn't spend the money to see it in a theater!
