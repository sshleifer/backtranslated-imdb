This movie had a very unique effect on me: it realized that this movie really sucks! It's disguised as a "thinker movie" like Memento and other gems like that, but in the end, and even after a few minutes, you realize it's nothing but perfect pretentious cr4p. Probably written by a collage student with friends to compassionately say that she is sucking. The whole idea is ?? I don't even know if it was trying to scratch the supernatural, or they want us to believe it, because someone fills your mind (a very bad one, VAT) with silly "riddles", the kind you learn at the primary school trip, you suddenly come to the "one truth" about everything, then you must kill and confess someone. !!! What? How, what, why, WHY? Just like making a cake, just throw a lot of ingredients and add water? Did you forget to cook it? I think these guys have forgotten not to explain, but offer the mechanism of why this happened? You should do this when you present a story that solves normal, everyday actions (solving puzzles) an abnormal effect on people. It was terrible, with that girl always trying to look nice on the camera, and the Highlanders man, the series, who acted like the overall metal record store (yes, they are actually all s-o-b's). The "threatening" atmosphere, with the "oh-so-clever" puzzles (entering the 60's series Batman and Robin, with guest appearance of The Riddle) and the crazies claiming to be the "knowledge" behind them on their faces has. ?? just awful, terrible. <br /> <br /> I'm usually very partial about low budget films, and tend to root for the undercover by giving them more praise than they deserve, instead of their intentions, you know, but it's just An ugly excuse for a movie that will keep you up for an hour and a half, and at the end you will just complain that you fall for it.
