I look forward to watching "Wirey Spindell" as it has happened to Schaffer's Fall. Unfortunately, I found that "WS" is a walking, unengaging, boring bunch of snaps that are joined together, apparently Schaeffer's signature, a mixture of story, narration and poetry. The film tells the sexual and other experiences of a man in Manhattan to be married to self-righteous flashbacks. Just like beads on a rope, Schaffer apparently experienced every little sexual life, without weakening the beauty of the chain. The result is an incredible story of a boy growing up who doesn't get empathy and disconnects, dissatisfied and with a bad after-taste that brings the mechanical feel-good end. A mediocre indie and a step backwards for Schaeffer.
