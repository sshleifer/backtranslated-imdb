Copper pictures (movies aren't a suitable word for them) are really somewhat brittle. Their attractive visual features are reminiscent of expensive high-class TV ads. But Brass photos are unfortunately movies with the intention of entertaining viewers for over two hours! Unfortunately, they fail, their unmistakable but rather soft and fleeting than steamy, erotic characteristics that do not resist. <br /> <br /> Senso '45 is a remake of a movie by Luchino Visconti with the same title and Alida Valli and Farley Granger in the lead. The original tells a story of senseless love and lust in and around Venice during the Italian wars of independence. Brass moved the action from the 19th to the 20th century, to be precise, so there are Mussolini murals, men in black shirts, German uniforms or the torn clothes of the party parties. But it's just window decoration, the historical context is completely neglected. <br /> <br /> Anna Galiena plays the attractive aristocratic woman who falls for the amoral SS man who always puts too much lipstick. She is an attractive, versatile, well-trained Italian actress and well above the material. Her wide variety of facial expressions (sore boredom, aversion, joy, fear, hatred ... and ecstasy) are the best reason to see this photo and worth two stars. She basically endures trashy things with an amazing amount of dignity. I wish some very good parts come together. She really deserves it.
