This move is bad on so many levels that I don't even know where to start. OK - the good points - Peebles is beautiful as a dirty booty in black leather. Some of the landscape photography was amazing. It's about it. Oh, and it was a nice touch with the buffalo head over the bar in Freemanville, I find it a nod to the Buffalo Soldiers. The movie starts out well, but the characters are so flat, such a comic book, so much, the bad guys are just superficial, I'm trying to describe it further. The Spanish-Cuban-American War was involved in 1895-1898 with America only in April to August of98. I think the movie said it happened in 1893 (I can be wrong, but I don't want to re-examine it). A big part of this movie sticks to the KKK killing Jessie's father. Well boys, the original KKK started in 1865 and was in 1871 by pres. Andrew Johnson destroyed. The Clan was not even in the period of this movie. Of course, the nasty bass ** rds became busy again in 1915 and we know the rest of it. BUT for the purpose of the movie it is historically wrong and it was an important part of the plot. I think I can go crazy, go in a lot more, so here are a few jabs and I'm done. I didn't know that Boyz2Men and other bands like those of the New Orleans streetmen from the 1890s were inspired. I also didn't know that fetish necklaces were all the rage for Sioux women in the 1890s ... but then I was surprised to see a singer doing jazz while wearing acrylic 1 nails. like a western more than most people do. Such a waste of talent and money - it really had the chance to show some of American history that is not known. http://www.coax.net/people/lwf /bkcwboy2.htm for more information. It could have been so good, but it was just ... bad from 1-10, it gets a 1 instead of zero because Mario looks good in his hat and there was an Appaloosa horse in the movie .
