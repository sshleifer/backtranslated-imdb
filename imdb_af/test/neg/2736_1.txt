This movie was so terrible that I didn't even know where to start. The only positive thing I can say about this is that Luke Perry delivered a good performance. The whole movie was all over the place, there was no explanation about the cause (only theories) of the rashes or rations for their solutions or why it would work. It was ridiculous! All the characters and relationships between them were so cute, you just laugh! There was just no background for any of them. The "love affair" appeared in the writing, it was so uncomfortable. There is an army officer; great black general with a permanent cigar in his mouth, with the "aarrgh! I'm the man!" attitude, such a pathetic bad guy. The two sidekicks, which are supposed to be genius, act like two 16-year-old boys. And then to make an action, they decide to drop a rock on someone's shoulder and for the rest of the movie he coughs as if he is dying of a pneumonia or ... and then the hero (bald scene) of all !!) to help plan what is to do who knows what ... it is never a good sign if you laugh yourself out loud in the middle of the dramatic scene ... in a nutshell; Don't waste your time!
