O boy! O boy! On the cover of exhausted VHS, a picture of Sandra Bullock and her name was written on top. I just think the reason they had the chance to sell the movie in the nineties was because of Sandra Bullock's name. Bullock's fans don't have to disappoint. Sandra is just looking in this movie and her performance is the only one you can call. The rest of the movie ?? It is nice to look in the first fifteen minutes because it is bad but then it gets worse. Much worse. Direction is terrible. Acting is terrible. Scripture is terrible. Dialogue is terrible. Action is terrible. Music is actually very good. Typical score for the eighties action movies. This movie is so bad that it's close to everything Andy Sidaris ever made. It is so bad that there is no good word to describe this poor attempt to be a movie. But there was still Sandra Bullock. And super cool (sarcasm) Jake LaMotta who Marlon Brando tries to be. <br /> <br /> I think they can now bring the movie to DVD. It can be cool! And they should write on the cover: ACADEMIC AWARD WINNER SANDRA BULLOKK IN HANGMAN <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
