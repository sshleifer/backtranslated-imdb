This movie stinks more than limburger cheese! If you find it at a garage sale, leave it! I like Sandra Bullock and HATE THIS MOVIE ... Although I am ashamed, I own a copy, and the studio has changed the cover to play on the fact that Sandra Bullock is completely in it. They play it as a Sandra Bullock Movie. She has only a small role in the whole movie and she does her best, but she is young and has not yet learned her talent. Well, everyone has to start somewhere ...
