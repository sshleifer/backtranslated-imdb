Officially the first martial arts film in USSR cinematography with real martial artists such as Tadeush Kas'yanov and Russian Bruce Lee - Talgat Nigmatullin. Bad people kick a ship in the sea, but fortunately just about everyone on board is a trained martial artist. A collectible for martial arts aficionado.
