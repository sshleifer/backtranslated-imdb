When I first saw the trailer for The Comebacks, it looked absolutely terrible and I had no interest in seeing it, but when it came out on DVD today, I figured out there was nothing else that caught my interest Not, I would rent it and give it a shot. I watched it and it wasn't really that bad. I think it was sometimes immature and stupid, but there were some funny moments that made me laugh. I don't really watch many sports movies, so I wonder if I see more, maybe this movie will make me feel more, but it's all fine, I still don't mind watching The Comebacks. I admit that these stupid spoof movies are paralyzed, but what is some time in a stupid joke? The return is not really that bad if you give it a fair chance. <br /> <br /> Coach Fields fails in life, family and career both, but when given a chance to bring back his career. if he can bring a looser soccer team into the championship. But the team is really terrible, just as terrible. But with a little work and team effort, they try to give it all, although it may be more sad. <br /> <br /> The return on everything is not the worst movie I've seen, I think it's good for a few laughs and giggles. I know it was stupid, but I can't help but when the coach comes in the middle of a fight in the locker room and knocks the head of the nerd against the garment, he and the nerd are generally so funny together. If you have an open mind and do not take this movie too seriously, I think you will have a fun time watching it, if you see if it is expected to be Oscar-worthy material, it is not the movie for not you. /> <br /> 4/10
