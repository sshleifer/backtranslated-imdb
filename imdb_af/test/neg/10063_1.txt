Producers Golan and Globus would have been ashamed to release this piece of garbage in public. I know it will sound, but compared to this, the first "Hercules" of 1983 looks like an adult and exciting epic! This "successor" is moron, cheap, incompatible, childish, ominous, indifferent and BADLY ACTED. A landmark in a bad theater, and one of the few little movies I've seen, really earns the lowest possible score: no stars!
