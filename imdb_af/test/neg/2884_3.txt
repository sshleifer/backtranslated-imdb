This film claims it is a perversion character study. Some judges were stunned, assuming that perversion is portrayed, the film is psychologically deep; Actually, taking into account the exuberant material, it is surprisingly boring and level, with no motivation. Why is the main character the way she is? You won't find out from the script. For better treatment of the same theme (and a more entertaining movie), try Bunuel's Belle de Jour.
