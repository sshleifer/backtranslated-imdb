If you read the plot summary for "Mad Max", you just ruined the first 1 hour and 10 minutes of the movie. You also noticed that "Mad Max" is taking place in post-apocalyptic Australia, which will be useful, otherwise you will have no idea what is going on. The film, made in 1979, is really trying to be Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" (1971), that movie, in all its strangeness, is actually meaningful and impacts. This movie does not end and ends a car / bicycle stunt-filled hull that collapses like any vehicle in the movie. <br /> <br /> The first thing wrong with "Mad Max" is that it tries to sell itself as a revenge story when no vigilante takes revenge until the last 20 minutes. If the first hour is condensed to 20-30 minutes then added the last 20 and then added another hour, Mad Max will be a cool action movie with a large vigilante protagonist. Instead, Mel Gibson has to wait and act like a sissy for 2/3 of the film and then have a sudden epiphany to seek revenge. I still watched the sequel "Road Warrior" and I have to admit that I'm just excited about it because I want to know what he's doing next. This first movie was mostly a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Here, George Miller does some good action, but his over-the-top symbolism is absurd and the unbearable cheesy response every time a character discovers something horrible like a burnt hand or whatever you completely destroyed those moments. This is a horrible clich√© B movie technique. There is absolutely no thematic value or subtle criticism of society in this film. No matter what you think. A big action sci-fi movie makes at least a point, but the free violence done by random, strange cyclists says nothing of value. Even the villain Toecutter feels modeled from Alex's "Clockwork" just uglier and completely unimposing. The PG violence does not allow the violence of this gang to settle and get a response from the viewer. It just makes it anything. <br /> <br /> I'll give credit for the amount of stuff the movie crew inflated and crashed into things and Miller does a great job of making you feel the intensity of the clashes. Everything else is mediocre at its best and then after an hour of mediocrity you get something good and the movie ends 20 minutes later. I'm just about my fingers "Road Warrior" will meet the expectations of where this movie ends, otherwise it's wasted more time. ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my website at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
