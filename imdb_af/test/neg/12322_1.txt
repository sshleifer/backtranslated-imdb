Well, the previews look funny and I don't usually go to movies after the start of the evening, especially with my kids, because ... well, you never know. Here is a movie that doesn't appeal to children or adults, because the jokes are too pungent for kids and fall completely flat for adult entertainment purposes. I was actually embarrassed to be 9 and 6 years old and explain my 6 year old what S H * T game. In essence, what is happening here is a total turn of dr. Seuss's classic. It adds an evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry her mother's money for her money. If it was a subplot, it might have been good, but it is finally the big plot around the whole movie and the cat plays more of a sub-plot to expose the mother's neighbor to who he really is. Take my advice and read the book and pass the movie.
