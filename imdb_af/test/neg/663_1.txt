I got stuck in traffic (I live in Sicily) heading for the theater (on a military basis) to see Superman Returns, was 15 minutes late, and the only other movie was "See No Evil", there was no poster not and just a brief description of the movie on the schedule ... but my girlfriend and I decided to check it out ... As soon as I saw it, it was produced by WWE. I just knew it was terrible. The few people in the theater laughed most of the time and it was the first movie I honestly considered to walk out and I saw The Ringer. Okay, I would have walked out of that one, but I was too busy sleeping. The death of the bad guy at the end was pretty good, but unlike that, it was just stupid.
