"Problem Child" was a good movie, but did it really earn a successor? I don't think it did. The original movie's only redeeming asset was Gilbert Gottfried, and he wasn't even good at this successor. <br /> <br /> I really can't figure out why this movie was bad. For starters it just wasn't funny. Even when I saw it as a nine-year-old, I didn't go to Junior (Michael Oliver) at all. His character came to me as shiny, self-defeating, and perhaps more important, a rebel without an idea. He apparently hated every woman who had dated his father, Ben (John Ritter), to hate them alone. It also does not send a good message to children with divorced parents (currently more than half of children in America) when one woman Ben decides to (almost) marry, is a southern aristocrat who is revenging and who hates children as it is. <br /> <br /> And as cool as I thought it would have been to see original SNL chat partner, Laraine Newman comes back to the big screen, she can't even save this movie. I also found it strange that she was a white Southern DÃ©butante whose name was Lawanda. It sounds more like an African American woman's name. But of course, it has nothing to do with why I didn't like this movie. <br /> <br /> I think the movie didn't work because you had antagonists you were supposed to hate, along with protagonists you weren't supposed to hate. John Ritter's character was supposed to be a good parent who desperately tried to correct his child without adhering to authoritative parenting. Instead, he came not only as a wimpy parent, but also desperate to find a woman in a few days, no matter how good he knew the woman. Did I mention this, sending a bad message to children of divorced parents? <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, the rest of the things that went wrong with this movie, Amy Yasbeck returned unnecessary and inexplicable to play a completely different character, that young girl who was even more offensive as Junior, totally unprecedented for toilet humor, and even more outrageous and outdated homophobic humor (as far as the dog catchers are concerned). The movie was just a mess, and really doesn't deserve a DVD release if it hasn't been given one yet. It should just rot on VHS along with all the other bad, forgotten 90's comedies.
