This is another notorious Mexican horror movie. Although the original Spanish version is pretty tame, all kinds of gore and nudity for the English version are (prepared by Jerald Intrator - who had similar duties on the KURIOUS DR. HUMPP [1967/71] - and, like the American version of that. movie, was previously available on DVD by Iets Weird / Image)! <br /> <br /> I watched the original and while it wasn't good, it was pretty busy - especially with a plot so familiar as this one: a doctor goes beyond the duty to save life from his terminally ill son; He even has a hunk, game leg assistant (played by Carlos Lopez Moctezuma, who has set a strikingly similar role in the CURRENT WOMAN COURSE [1961]. I know that several Mexican films are horrible with the "Lucha Libre" (Wrestling) genre mixed, but I never looked at myself, this element is present here - the heroine is actually a wrestler - but the two styles may be happily disassembled (this is said, the wrestling sequence is done with some of the very amusing movements. <br /> <br /> The doctor's son was transformed into a monster (resembling The Incredible Hulk with mud splashed over his face!) after he had a monkey's heart in him transplanted - but then, when replaced with a comatose female wrestler, he stays this way and grows a few strings to start (he should not have changed realistically into a transsexual ... although I think so would not have been very interesting !! climatic roof order in which the monster kidnapped a child and met his police's hands, recalls THE GHOST VAN FRANKENSTEIN (1942).

There are also several graphical operation inserts, which, however, give rise to a fool: while it is made clear that only two people are involved in the operation, we see a third pair of hands constantly attaching an oxygen mask to the patient's face. love! <br /> <br /> The film is also said to be a loose reminder of Cardona's own black and white horror movie DOCTOR OF DOOM (1962), but since I didn't watch that one, I can't say not how much of it was actually for the night of the bloody ...
