I'm tired of several attempts to sit down and watch this program "Gilmore Girls". It amazed me because I couldn't just get my finger on what it was going to do. Was it about a young woman who has a baby in life and never grows up? Was it about the fact that the daughter is more responsible than the mother? Was it about a rebellious rich girl and her non-rebellious daughter? What is this show for? Finally, I just didn't mind. The movie makes me want to scream. The writing is not "smart" or "intelligent", it is syrupy and boring. <br /> <br /> So why did I watch? Because I heard so many good things about this and I'm not one to vote for an opinion until I looked. Knee-Jerk reactions are usually wrong, so I watched several times. The first time I watched it, I saw the mother running around as she was 12 and the daughter acting like she was 40. Maybe that's what didn't suit me. I never liked any of the "Freaky Friday" movies - not to say it is, but there are some similarities. <br /> <br /> I also have a friend who watches this show every week. I asked her, "What is this show about?" A very shiny young lady, usually articulating, can never give me a straight answer. So I asked others who are raving about it - they really don't know. <br /> <br /> Gilmore Girls is a TV program that is like an art house movie. Many of us will not get it, but those who go try desperately to find a meaning that is actually not one, just to be hip. Yes, I find Lauren Graham's Lorelai annoying - shining, sobbing, nasally WHINE. An entire hour of it. Wow. And the rest of the role play is about as memorable as yesterday's cheese sandwich. The town is hokey, the men are wimps, the grandparents are boring, and unfortunately I don't find anything about any of these characters, or care about anything they do. It looks like you are looking at paint on the wall.
