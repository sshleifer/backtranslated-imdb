Another French film with absurdity. Baise-Moi (F * ck Me) tells the story of two young women coming together to kill and f * ck. One of them is a pornstar who escapes from her community after raping and killing her boyfriend. The second one is a hooker who kills her platoon and sees her boyfriend being shot dead. After the incidents they met at a metro station (both miss the last train) and then the whole thing starts. They find a bound and very close. They abuse men sexually, take drugs, drive across the country and have a lot of sex. It's all about Baise-Moi really. We can see that they have no mercy on their victims. They even kill a woman for her money. Both actresses are real porn stars in France that affect the film in two different ways. They look so comfortable in sex scenes, but they can't make the whole movie worth watching, because the movie doesn't need any more capabilities. This is a version of Thelma and Louise on another level. I could recommend many things instead of looking at Baise-Moi. So, to see if you want to see a meaningless, kinky movie. * from *****
