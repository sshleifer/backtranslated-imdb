This movie has no respect for the viewer's time. It takes a 15 minute story and extends it in 95 minutes. To achieve this, they must use a very slow narrative and all run with some undeniable anxiety. By the time this movie showed something interesting in the plot, I just didn't mind. The problem is not in the scene, but rather the pacing. The story is just weak. Jim Carrey is a skilled actor, but his efforts to play light humor in a serious role are just out of place. His style of humor is not generic, so he comes across as a weakened version of himself. The number 23 causes great sadness and frustration for the people in the story, but the justification for this is never logical. At most, it's just pretty interesting. Jim Carrey has much more ability in a serious role than this movie reveals. Don't waste your money to see it in the theater. Rent this movie if you have trouble sleeping. If you are still awake after 10 minutes, you have much more than I did. I didn't love the lighting and artistic aspects of the movie. Many passive visual eye candy was thrown at the viewer with lighting or effects and it did little to improve the already bad story.
