Because that's what Hell Ride is pretty much like. Larry Bishop and Tarantino party on the Weinstein's money promise to deliver a movie somewhere. I'm all for fake boobage and drink as much as the next man, but do we really need the movie? Actually, nothing worse than the heated second hand remains of an old trend. And I'm not even talking about the 70's gazebo theater, because Hell Ride doesn't have one of the raw and unpolished feelings of the era it seems to be. No, it's smooth and shiny MTV Hollywood through and through. The old trend I'm talking about is the self-conscious pseudo-hip, synthetic world in which Tarantino meets Guy Ritchie and Robert Rodriguez. All three guys were at least talented and found success for a reason. Hel Ride is just a second-hand copy, capricious and uninspired, to the maximum polished when it needs to be raw. The "super cool" aspect comes from forced and stupid. <br /> <br /> There is no reason why, for example, such a Simple and Completely Rude Story should be told in complex, reciprocal time-fashion. It's just a post-Tarantino tip. There is also no reason why the dialogues should be so pointless useless. People clap their gums while they say nothing. At least when Travolta talks about cheese burgers in Pulpfiks, it feels fresh. Dialogues here are little more than pseudo-macho attitude. There is also no reason why a guitar rock'n'roll guitar should deliberately turn over the entire movie. Perhaps the lowest Hell Ride hits when trying to be quasi-existential. There is a hilarious dream / illusion scene in the desert where the bishop eats peyote and sees colors. I half expected an old Indian to come out and offer nuggets of wisdom. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace of this awkward maze is tattooing the boobage and Vinnie Jones's monologue over his wings (and perhaps some of the desert shots). Many boobages and warm-dressed babies. Now I can see, but a movie they don't make. All others are just an empty shell, an imitation of other infinitely more talented imitators.
