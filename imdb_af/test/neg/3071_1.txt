Whoever reads this comment may think we may have a good movie in hand. I am Portuguese and I am ashamed that this film in Portugal has become a clash. It can't really call this cinema. The direction and "mise-and-scene" are basic (even Ron Howard does better!); The writing is bad and pretentious (a very bad Tarantino); The film is covered in TV stars, models and reality show stars that are nothing like acting. Of course, when you put these ingredients in a movie, the fans of this kind of TV show will all watch. I'm also surprised that people making comments here in IMDb say this movie is a masterpiece. I thought this site was only for people who really want a cinema and understand it a bit. All the movies made in Portgal always use the same ingredients and are always terrible. If you think this movie is reasonable, please don't say your love movies and cinema.
