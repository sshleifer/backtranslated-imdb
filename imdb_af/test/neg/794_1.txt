DIE BOX (2009) * Cameron Diaz, James Marsden, Frank Langella, James Rebhorn, Holmes Osborne, Sam Oz Stone, Celia Weston. Really disappointing adaptation of the genre legend Richard Matheson's sci-fi chiller "Button, Button" through to malice filmmaker Richard Kelly, who is really a small, well-made piece in a "WTF" a-thon grab "stick out. Mysterious (and ridiculously mutilated!) Man, Langella, offers a million dollar offer to struggle a couple Diaz and Marsden. Both surprising vanilla to the crest! A box with a red button attached to stranger in the world (!) Acid strings, but does it really matter here? What is the reason why in the name of God Kelly marry so much strangeness (ie, nosebleed, aqueous transport systems? It's right? Watery.Transport.Systems) when the tension has to be tightened (oh the possibilities). If it sounds like a bad TWILIGHT ZONE episode, you're half-right (the '80s TV reboot actually did a decent petty cash adjustment, actually renting it out!) One of the year's worst movies.
