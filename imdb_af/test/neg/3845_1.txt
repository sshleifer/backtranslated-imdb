It was the worst movie I've ever seen. I have to admit that I didn't watch it from start to finish. Cleaning the toilet was more entertaining. <br /> <br /> The 'star' was the most unpleasant character I have ever seen, not funny or attractive, it is painful to watch, there is no acting, especially the star acting as a baptized, spiritually deficient take-off on one of those loud-eyed black actors. <br /> <br /> As terrible as it is to watch, one of those who can't lock black actors is a Puerto Rican look, even worse. <br /> <br /> The name of the movie is descriptive, he is the plague. This movie is a must miss.
