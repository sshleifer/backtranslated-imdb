I can remember reading that Darwin had a central experience in the Galapagos Islands, as the vast variety of wildlife there, and internally, wrote his evolution theory. Not according to this movie, it was inspired by the British countryside. OK, and like John Cleese would say-right. I also didn't think Darwin was a man suffering from a deep personal conflict and someone who had heavy reverbs and flight of anxiety. According to this film, he was. It is sad that he apparently lost one of his daughters to illness, but I don't think he would lose a family member, had much influence on man's scientific abilities. Well, not according to ... you don't get the picture. I think there is nothing worse than when science is being changed into fable, and to some extent this film emerges as if it is trying to uncover the evolutionary theory by saying it comes from a man who was emotionally unstable, who just told me uncomfortable. I think Charles Darwin was the soul of scientific investigation, cool and calm, and always thought logically. This film seeks to dramatize the dramatic dramatic dramatization and sensationalization of a clear scientific exploration. It's like a Canterbury language. I would not recommend it.
