Copy cats copied this movie from a 1974 Hindi movie called "Call Girl"! "Call Girl" had an identical story line. The way the protagonists fall in love, rebel and the climax is also in both these films! "Call Girl" is better than Water, at least from the story telling point of view. It wasn't as slow as Water! Water on the contrary does not progress at all. The goal is to make the audience sympathetic to Kalyani forever! Are Indian filmmakers better than just being copiers? Well, they call it "inspired". In their language it is: "Be inspired (without any quotation it is!)"! :)
