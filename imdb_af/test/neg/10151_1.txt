I love cheese-like horror movies, I think dead alive and bad taste is good and I think murder killing II (not even related to this movie) is hilarious. But this movie absolutely bumped, I didn't laugh, I didn't even enjoy it. You can see all kinds of mistakes that aren't even champions. The best scene the woman leaned out of the window was the one where she hit her head on the windowsill? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> Don't handle these thoughts. It is related to the slumber party bloodbath. It's awful and I don't even have an idea of ​​how it gets distributed. Rent it with a false name and burn it, all do the favor.
