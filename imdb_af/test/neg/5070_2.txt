Another example of the women-in-prison genre. It's not exactly a genre known for quality movies, but it is a notch among most. A lot of women are taken out of the bridges where they work on a prison on a rocky island. Once they are there, they are subjected to very poorly directed sex and abominable "dialogue." For a movie with an astonishing amount of sex and nudity, there's really nothing erotic about any of it. The sex scenes were uncomfortable, and some scenes, such as the landfill scene, apparently attracted. It is said that there are at least few production values. On the W-i-P scale I put it above the Frauen fur Zelenblock Neun, but under Chained Heat.
