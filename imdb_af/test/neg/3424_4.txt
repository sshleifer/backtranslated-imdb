Macbeth's story was one of the most successful Shakespeare ever written. It may be due to certain features that place it near the shooter's genre, murder, murder, kill, kill, blood waves, a tense sexual relationship between the main characters, and so on. More than that, the original play is very attractive. consider the length (it is only half the size of Hamlet) and the focus on Macbeth for whom we are obliged to care despite his bloody nature. The play is ideal for basing a movie. Not so long, it gives the directors the opportunity to explore many levels, a good actor can play the role of his lifetime, the film has a deep meaning in any historical period. Unfortunately, it's not at Macbeth. Polanski's version is quite close, but it does support too much in the Middle Ages. Welles' film is too personal, with an interesting turn to totalitarianism, the 1990 or TV version is too shallow. This 2006 movie is no exception. It is very far from a Shakespeare movie, but it is interesting to see how the director understands the story and places it in contemporary life. No knights in shining armor, but gang members in shiny cars. Many drugs and trippy music replace the fears of the night in the original play. The idea of ​​Macbeth is so simple that it is not necessary to take it into the present-day life and to plant it, Shakespeare does not need at all. The worst part in the movie is the lines. Most of the sad plays of the play, such as the dagger scene, are pruned so that it seems useless. Replacing the knock in the door with doors and horses with cars seems funny. If they wanted to make a movie about it and its temptation, they could have done it easily without Shakespeare. This Macbeth seems to be a looser with a brain injury, not a brave warrior, brave and ambitious who wants so much power, he is prepared to kill and who is caught in a net of fears and despair. The movie doesn't make clear what Lady Macbeth drives into madness, it doesn't give a reason why some characters should fear Macbeth and his "terror" (since there is no hereditary ascension, without throne and all) and Macbeth puts it in an awkward position, as the leadership of a gang is so far from the kingdom, as this whole film is far from any Shakespeare. Finally, we have two super ideas that never really meet to make it a movie that is ultimately meaningless. Don't keep track of your path, but go!
