When I was younger (oh about 2), I looked at Barney for the first time and liked it. BUT, then I didn't actually have a brain either. And now I look back and see what a horrible performance "Barney" is: First, everything on the show is creepy. Barney, the main character, is a terrible 9-foot-long, purple dinosaur who teaches 13-year-olds about "imagination ...." (* shudders *) BJ (I know what you think about his name.) Is a smaller one but creepy yellow dinosaur plugged in to be "supposudly" cool. But in reality he is exactly the opposite. After I did some episodes with B.J. watched, he came in with his slightly twisted cap and made some funny jokes, and I wanted to scream. Baby Bop-oh-oh-god! (* Vomit *) oh-oh-oh-anyway Baby Bop is the worst idea of ​​a character ever. She is a green triceratops (it is a dinosaur) wearing a yellow blanket. Her remarks of "hee-hee-hee" and Barney's praise of "super-deeee-dooer" make it difficult to put through each episode, as the seventh graders learn about shapes and ways. <br /> <br /> And this, my friend, is what makes this show really awful.
