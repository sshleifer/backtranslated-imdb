Just to save your money and time, I will continue to say that this movie is definitely not worth the game and gas it will take to burn it. Don't waste your time. As a matter of fact, you'll be better off forgetting that you've ever thought of looking at it. I saw better B movies seriously in a language I can't understand. Anyone who has ever given permission to make it must be sown. The only positive thing I can say for this movie is with a new screenplay and the real director and actors, it can be a wonderful story. Let me break it down; A virgin becomes pregnant by a devil, the baby while she wants to feed people inside her womb. They are trying to make up for the fact that it is possibly the worst movie ever made with curse and useless nudity. All in all, not worth the dollar, it hired me.
