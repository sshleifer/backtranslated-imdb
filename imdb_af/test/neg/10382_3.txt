This movie just turned out to be missing. The plot has evolved so many times in such a short time that it seems to have lost sight of what the true story was. There was a lot of wasted dialogue and just seemed like the writing was rushing and a bit wandered. The exorcist scenes and storytelling began to begin the background stories of the character (which was a little weak). <br /> <br /> All in all, I would say if you didn't rent. The rest of the horror section at your local video store and you have some jones for a movie you haven't seen before. You are much better off just watching the Exorcist or The Exorcism or Emily Rose.
