You have to hand it over to writer-director John Hughes. With great success behind him in the misfit teen / high school year, he managed to reach out to other areas of comedy, finding in the bargain a great ally in comedian actor John Candy. Here, throw-off adult Candy became a better person after he agreed to babysit his brothers' prudent children; It's a surefire formula designed to please both cynical teenagers and their parents, and it's no wonder the movie was a winner with theater audiences. Yet Hughes relies almost entirely on Candy's charm to convert the scenario, and one can finally get tired of the repetitive gags with the star front and the center. The kids are sitcom smart, the other adults formless blobs, and Amy Madigan is too intense, in vain to play Uncle Buck's girlfriend. Later, a television series became known as the material was already television-perfection. * 1/2 of ****
