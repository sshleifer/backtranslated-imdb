Sigh. I am surprised when I see so briefly, get attention and instructions and what not. I watched this movie at a festival before the filmmaker gets any attention and immediately forgets. It was quietly annoying to see that it was the Grinch Who Gold Christmas Heartpot stole, along with the narrative, the set design that was seen many times, the very poor Tim Burton-ish style and the story going nowhere. And we got the "joke" to shoot the crows with the 45 first, but good. <br /> <br /> But I think that's really unacceptable is that it even swings its basic concept out of a comic book, called LENORE about 1999, The Creepy, Small, Deaf Girl by Roman Dirge! As any fast internet search will reveal. I mean, what's that? So do they make a Hollywood contract and make doors in Canada for a movie maker? "Give your head a shake" as Don Cherry can say.
