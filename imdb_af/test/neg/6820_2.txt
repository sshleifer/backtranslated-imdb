Dooley and his dog partner, Jerry Lee, are back in this second successor (? !!?) I really had no idea that they left one successor. And for a movie that was only slightly better than "Turner & Hooch"? This time, after Dooley retired, he had to raise his dog (with other dogs, people) and wait for Jerry Lee to pound. Real classy stuff. I mean now. The original had at least some good laughs. This one has one. Jim Belushi looks old and exhausted. Both Belushi brothers were big in the 80's. If John didn't die, would he be as bad as his brother? That thought makes me sad for some reason. <br /> <br /> My Degree: D- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: USA network
