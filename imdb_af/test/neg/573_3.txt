It is a movie about people who receive a love letter. No one knows who has been submitted and no one knows who it is. A good throw, led by Kate Capshaw, Tom Selleck and Ellen DeGeneres. However, this is a completely dull plot. For example, the Capshaw character, one of the premier burghers of a small New England town, is taking an immature university student working in her bookshop this summer. She chose him instead of Tom Selleck, the village fireman who was crazy about her. If it's not the symbol of stupidity, I don't know what is. Just an example of how dull this movie is. Watching Kate Capshaw jogging is a pleasure, but you immediately realize that she's never had a day in her life. Another clear part of a dim movie.
