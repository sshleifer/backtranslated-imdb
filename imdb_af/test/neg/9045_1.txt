Umberto Lenzi is launching new lows with this recycled waste. Janet Agren plays a lady looking for her missing sister. It seems the sister is part of a Jim Jones-type religious cult in New Guinea. She hires a scruffy guide played by Robert Kerman to help her get the cult's connection in the jungle. It's another (!) Cannibal movie, and I'd probably have liked it if it wasn't Lenzi who took out this movie with scenes from his superior "The Man from Deep River." I mean every cannibal scene is lifted directly from this movie, which I think makes it as credible as Al Adamson. I cut down. *** SPOILER *** 1/2 star and this is for the dildo scene.
