A group of heirs of a mysterious old house find out that they must live there as part of a will in the will or be profaned, but soon find out the history of all who lived there before they died. strange accidents or murder each other. <br /> <br /> You've seen it before, and this one is too low-budget and slow to scary and has no real surprises in the climax. No special effects or gore to talk about, actually the only wonderful thing about the movie is the quality of English dubbing, which is sometimes as bad as a cheap martial arts movie. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10, pretty low in the pitch order of 80's haunted movies.
