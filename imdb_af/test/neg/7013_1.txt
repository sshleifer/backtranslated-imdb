Lucille Ball tries to look 30 years younger than she actually was in this poor excuse for a musical. <br /> <br /> The movie has cut some of the worst choreography ever seen, with the constant threat that Lucy can break into a song. her bourbon vote at any moment. Lucy's total lack of talent as a singer and dancer sinks the movie before it can start and apart from the hard Lucy fans. Nobody will find it very bad. Bad costumes and cheese-like designs do not help. Further evidence that Lucy was nothing good, except to make silly faces. <br /> <br /> Targeted by Gene Saks.
