I was in Blockbuster and I saw a movie called Dark Harvest. The cover art looks good, the plot is not that bad, and the tagline (you reap what you sow) has the movie look pretty good. But I was stupid that day, because I did something I never had to do. I hired a live video-independent horror movie. With my much better rent I went home, ran Dark Harvest into the DVD player and it started. I thought I'd see the trailer after the movie was done (BAD IDEA), but go ahead and watch it anyway. NOW for review. * POSSIBLE SPOILERS * First, the play of the "kids" sucks and the scene when the 2 (main characters) speak, the lighting sucks and the buildings even look fake! Now they go to this house, where Sean Connel (I think he is the main character, I don't care), family lived there. Suddenly they all are killed by ... (gasp) A KILLER SCARECROW !!!! GHHH !!!!! The scarecrow is, of course, the definition of a low budget, and the screens where the scarecrow is computerized seem so fake, it is hilarious. It makes dinosaur sounds and everything! And then at the end ... they shoot the scarecrow with a gun (it's red for God's sake and looks like it was bought at a local family dollar) and it waits a while and then ..... (gasp) BLOED UP !!!!!! <br /> <br /> Save yourself a while, I'll tell you this movie. If you have to pass an hour and a half, look at the wall because looking at the wall is A + fun compared to this disaster. It's quite funny. <br /> <br /> Overall Grade: F If there was anything lower ** F - ** if I were to give it.
