Because Disney more often than not, ignores the animation quality and a need for a good plot in their successors, it was actually a nice surprise. I don't know why Disney is no longer paying attention to their successors. The graphic quality is always inferior; No background worthy of the name Disney, unimaginable images and worse dialogue, with little or no attention to the real story, and the caricature drawings are almost always worse than the Saturday morning cartoons in detail and quality. <br /> <br /> The animation quality is still poor compared to Disney originals, and the dialogue is pretty thin, the story line and overall performance was really enjoyable. <br /> <br /> While not so fascinating, it doesn't fail to capture the charm and / or secrecy of the first. There is a little hint, here and there hidden away. <br /> <br /> The kids will keep it anyway. <br /> <br /> It's a 4.5 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the enemy :.
