"The Dominee" is based on the life of a real Dutch gangster, Klaas Bruinsma! In the movie he is called Klaas Donkers! I have doubts that events in the movie have something to do with what really happened! But it does not matter! Because it couldn't grab my attention! This movie bored the crap from me! It doesn't have fabric and style! The substance could have been forgiven if the act was good and if the director tried to do something original! Without the substance you should at least bring style or decent action! Shouldn't we be entertained? It would have helped if the director saw more gangster movies! Obviously he didn't do it! Otherwise, he wouldn't have done it like he did! This film received a lot of publicity due to a small scandal surrounding Klaas Bruinsma and a member of the Royal Kingdom! This scandal has nothing to do with the movie ever so! Without it, the minister would never have succeeded! I'm sure of that!
