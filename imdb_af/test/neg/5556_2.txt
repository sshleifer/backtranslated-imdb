OK, I've seen Hershall Gordon Lewis movies before, but this one really takes the cake, it's really greedy and rude, not to mention disgusting way the strippers are done. I speak bad acting that plan 9 from outer space looks hamlet, the only salvation grace is the late big Henny Youngman as the comic club owner, yes, my wife ... please. The stripteasers are really sexy for 1972, I believe they used the same plot again in the Roger Corman movie; stripped to kill in 1987. I enjoyed the earlier HGLewis flick 100 maniacs, which was a mini-masterpiece of all but bad acting, no awards here, but be aware that this is a brilliant movie that paves the way for Friday 13th has. and seen. In a disturbing scene, a half-naked stripper clasped her buttocks with a meat maker. Lewis hit again. 2 out of 10.
