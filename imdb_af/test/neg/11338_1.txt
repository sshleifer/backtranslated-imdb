When I watched this movie, it was already a forced choice, because my original intention was sold out. What was inspired was pure horror, this movie was so bad I could barely bear it. The story is not worth it, a gay goalkeeper forms a gay soccer team to play against his old straight team which - after discovering his sexual orientation - has made him difficult. loaded with unbearably old and overused cliches of gays, the thin plot fits perfectly with the rigid dialogues. It's amazing that actors like dietmar berry or charly h√ºbner waste their talent and time on such nonsense. 10/01
