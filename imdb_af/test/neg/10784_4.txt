The bearers of western style feminism over the various subcultures of India have so far largely not existed, the two entities that invade alien worlds and threatening (in the name of tradition) should never coincide. Art mimics life (or so goes the claim) and a popular Hindi theater is no exception, reflecting an underlying misogyny that unfortunately forms the basis of much of the collective Indian culture. But why? What about the female sex that made it so hateful that women are routinely subject to the most unimaginable horrors, including rape, murder, child murder, illiteracy, infidelity, and the subjugation of the spirit called "dowry"? Rajkumar Santoshi's latest offer, "Lajja", asks the same claimant, linking the atrocities committed against women through three separate chapters / episodes that include the journey of shame endured by his chieftain Vaidehi (Manisha Koirala). <br /> <br /> The direction of Santoshi's part is not aware of the level demanding the story. He fails to reach the necessary sensitivity to portray the saga of sadness and confronts the issue of misogyny on the side, rather than on the head. Santoshi recently said he did not make the film for an international film festival, but rather for the masses of his country. Unfortunately, the stickiness shows, and the movie is too often in the action-blood gore genre that Santoshi specializes. The film suffers from its rough episodic pace and its end is quite confronted. <br /> <br /> The female cast is given many kids and more rounded characteristics than their male counterparts. The lead actor is played sensitively by the luminescently beautiful Manisha Koirala, who in Lajja proves that she is one of our time's more capable leading ladies and gets a good role and action, come out with a truly laudable show. One wonders how brilliant she might have shone if the film was made by a director with the appropriate creative intent and appreciation of the problem. Mahima Choudhary puts a laudable show and continues to show that she is an untapped talent. Thrown like Janki, Madhuri Dixit performs with a never-before-look fervor and felicity for what really earned the name of 'acting'. The role of a street-performer who finds comfort in alcohol and the promise of an unborn child stands as the biggest risk in her canon-dance role canon which has retained her exhibition status over the past decade. It leaves the final and most disturbing performance in this female saga, that of the unceasingly talented Rekha. Lajja is Manisha Koirala's film. There is no doubt about it, but it is Rekha who dominates the proceedings in a show that stings in your legs and sends echoes of terror through the hearts of your heart. Rekha dazzled as Ramdulari, prior vanity and complacency to deliver a performance so full of authenticity and ingenuity that emotional nudity becomes the mantra of this part of the film. Equations are indeed unfair, especially when delivered to one of the world's leading ladies, but in the gracious presence of this ruling legend, the others fall in her shadow. <br /> <br /> "Lajja" has nothing of sophistication. Proto-feminist dramas such as "Zubeidaa", "Pinjar" or even the Hel Queen Queen Laadla: it fulfills its female goals in two early moments: the harsh tirade in which Mahima manages her in-laws for their abuse of her father who has no other crime committed as she did to a girl. She breaks out and leaves the wedding procession. As her father was destroyed, she began to cry, blaming herself for the chaotic destruction before her. She said, "Why did I say something? I ruined everything! It's my fault!" Her grandmother, who sees the abuse of her heavily, comforts her and says, "Why are you crying? There is no reason for you to cry. You are not guilty and the debt is mine. The fault is of every woman "What came before you, because if we had the courage to say today what you said today, you would not need anything to say today." In this scene, the importance of the Feminist Legacy becomes evident by words. <br /> <br /> The other, more subtle moment comes very early in the film when Vaidehi (Manisha) fled from her abused man to the retreat of her parents' home in India. For Western societal viewers, it may seem reasonable (of course) that any abused woman will seek the protection of her parents; however, it is a common taboo in many Eastern cultures, India among them. Once a woman is married, the identity she assumes is that of her husband and his personal assets (family, business, children, etc.). Turning her back on these responsibilities is a serious social sin, one that is truly no equivalent to the western woman. She is then regarded as contaminated and as "damaged goods", one whose value is entirely subject to her own actions and her refusal to the role she is given. She is not so much an individual, because she is an emblem of family honor. Her father rebuked her for her actions, worried that his family honor would be irreparably irreparable by the girl he had already transferred to another man. His primary concern is that of the threatening marriage of Vaidehi's younger sister, a prospect much less likely to be with a divorced older daughter in the same household. He in no way tells her that she must return to the man to whom she belongs lawfully, however violent and sadistic he may be. He took the centuries-old saying against her that "The honor of every house is in the hands of his daughter." Quietly and painfully she replied, "Yes, the honor of every house lies in the hands of his daughter. But there is no honor for the daughter herself."
