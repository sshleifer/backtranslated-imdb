Not only did I read the book and watch the movie, but I was stationed at USS John F Kennedy when they filmed it. Needless to say, movie crews and actors can try to get people to do their job. Now, about the movie. As a Navy man's career, I was pretty upset about how they showed life aboard an aircraft carrier. I could put the inaccuracies in the film apart (anyone who lived on a carrier), but it will take pages. One particular stand out was when they were in the CIC (Combat Information Center) and they watched a RADAR contact move across the screen. Every time the contact moved, it rang. Unfortunately, that equipment didn't sound like that (I was a technician on that equipment). The book was based on fact, the movie was not. The sequel to TV shows was just as bad and the fleet finally realized that support for this series would just make them look bad. If you are a Marine person, watch it as a movie about the bearer life is seen from Hollywood's eyes. If you're not a naval person, watch Midway or Top Gun, at least those movies are entertaining and fact-based.
