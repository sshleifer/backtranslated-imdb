You may not believe it, but when the credits rolled to this movie, I chose the name of the director. When I saw it, I burned it in my memory and I never forgot it. This movie is over. This makes Ed Wood's films like Orsen Welles look. At least B movies are entertaining, it was a soul-deadly experience. The quality was so bad, I began to wonder who allowed this to happen. <br /> <br /> I hear Uwe Boll run fourteen miles a day. This is because people have to swap him out of town with flame and lift, where his films are also being watched. The writing was terrible, the lighting was like that of a high school soccer match, and the film was just above the quality of Roger Patterson's Bigfoot video. The play was also performed by people who are ashamed of the production to say their lines with any credibility. In the end, a movie Alan Smithee was not recorded. I learned that day to avoid any movie by this man despite the circumstances. From what I hear, it's not a bad thing to do.
