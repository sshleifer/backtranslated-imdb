This movie starts with interesting set design and a promising point of departure, but fails to supply the cultivated film goods. In a keen parallel universe where everything is owned by the Blump corporation, it is a terrible rise-comic that finds success when it grows a third arm from its back. <br /> <br /> All the potential for the big cheese is here - 80's star Judd Nelson, Wayne Newton, horrific visual and strange plot deviations, obese women in lime lingerie, necrophilia - carried away - never pay. <br /> <br /> The pacing is the biggest problem. Every scene is extremely slow. Nelson's rising routines are supposed to be funny because they are not pathetic. But every performance continues until it's not even tangentially funny, but boring. <br /> <br /> Imagine someone telling you the longest, strangest joke, imaginable, full of cheerful self-congratulations for how funny and strange he thinks it is. Imagine having been stuck for two hours, you never got a punch line. You've bothered to watch The Dark Backward.
