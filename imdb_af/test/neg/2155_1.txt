There is no use to describe the complicated, excessive melodramatic plot describing Civil War bitterness, a crooked city boss and other complications. It's all bad. <br /> <br /> Stella Stevens, Andrew Prine, Bo Svenson, William Smith, Tim Thomerson and Lee Majors are all good actors who can't be big stars (or big stars). <br /> <br /> Here they are all wasted on a picture that looks like it was shot in a wild west tourist trap, with costumes borrowed from the local high school theater section. In fact, most of the plays also appear to be at high school level, which may not be as bad as it is not so pretentious. <br /> <br /> The name of Ed Wood is used too lightly days. I think in this case the equation is justified. However, I suspect that old Ed would have made a more entertaining western than this.
