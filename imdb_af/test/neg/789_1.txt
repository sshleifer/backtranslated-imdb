I like movies, but I didn't find anything to keep from The Box. I was interested in the 'hook' of the plot, but unfortunately it never went and it was impossible to follow. Anyone who says they understand this movie is probably making it feel like they are part of something, and I have news for them. The emperor has no clothes. <br /> <br /> The only undertone in this movie is that women should blame for the original sin and damage humanity. I heard that story before, and it makes less and less sense every time. It is true that this movie is different from many movies that are currently appearing in theaters, but it does not worth the ticket price.
