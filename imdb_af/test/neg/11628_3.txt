Jack Higgins's straightforward tension over a debt-rated IRA bomber forced into a final work (where I heard that plot before) gets a snarky treatment from cult director Mike Hodges. Mickey Rourke, with disturbing red hair, confesses everything to the priest (Bob Hoskins, of all people) who accidentally saw the shooting. The rules of the church keep Father Bob speaking, but then Rourke will fall in love with the priest's blind cousin. They bind at the church organ. What? Really, that's the plot. Alan Bates is around as the top dog mobster who calls (literally) the shots and he looks like he's the only actor on the rogue test that Hodges strives for. Assets are ready to make some kind of PR.Z. PRIZZI'S HONOR, but no one else, including a supportive charismatic Liam Neeson, has been informed.
