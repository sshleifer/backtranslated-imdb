Perhaps it is unfair for me to review this movie because I walked well before the exit. It's strange, because I usually like Shakespeare on the screen and I enjoyed Midsummers Night's Dream once, many years ago, when I saw it on stage. <br /> <br /> I think two things have tackled me: the wheezing dick with the Shakespearian name, Calista Flockhart, and Michelle Feiffer in a giant clamshell. Well, I suppose you can say it should be a comedy - but if the scenery is funny and the actors are not, I want to say we have a bad movie on our hands.
