-Maybe contain spoilage <br /> <br /> Obviously, anyone who ever made this movie had many connections. I just can't see it differently. What really surprised me is nobody using the name Allen Smithee, and more surprisingly, everyone involved didn't use that name. <br /> <br /> Anyway, where to start. The bad dialogue, the bad costumes, the sorry-looking movie stock, the unintentional comedy, the overarching characters and more inconsistencies than George W. Bush's college career. I don't know what was harder, the man lost his arm because of a snowball or the slow scene where all the baby Jack Frosts was killed. Also in this movie is one of the great lines of all time voiced. "How do we know he is?" As there is another mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with snowballs! A great camp movie, but a very bad movie overall.
