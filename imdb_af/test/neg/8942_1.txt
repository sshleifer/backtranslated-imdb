It seemed as if a lot of the 3rd graders had stolen a video camera, borrowed some old editing programs from 1995 and joked one another. Trash RGC written on August 1, 2006 (pos. 747): This movie is a piece of @ $ # @ # @. It sucks To call, a movie will be misleading. It was a group of friends who had a good time videotaping one another. The storyline was very difficult to follow. The attempt at artistic camera angles detracted from the story and in themselves they made a dizzying experience all the time. The acting, although comic, was very amateurish. The concept is OK, I think. Maybe next time, producers should raise capital and hire real-time professionals and try again. I have to say I am sick and tired of so many thinking that making a good movie is easy. It's not easy ... This fact seems to be lost or ignored by many who believe that without any training / experience and talent they can make a good product. I think eventually they'll learn how difficult it is, I'm so disgusting. I HAVE NO COMMENT Chrisite wrote on August 5, 2006 (Post 762):
