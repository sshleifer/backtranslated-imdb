I was 10 years old at Wrestlemania VI in Toronto and the event I saw was very different to what I saw on the Wrestlemania Collection DVD I just watched. I do not understand how the WWW does not have the right to some of the old music, as most of these songs were created by the WWF, they should not worry about licensing and legal fees that prevent shows like SNL from release of season sets. It's quite silly to hear, but to hear from me. Demolition comes out to their theme music at a Wrestlemania personally, a memory I never forgot and it didn't exist on this DVD. What is the point of them, even the rights of this great video library, if they have to change it so drastically to use it?
