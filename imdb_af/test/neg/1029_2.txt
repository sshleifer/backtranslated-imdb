It's hard to believe that Oprah Winfrey produced this piece of junk. The show couldn't even hold a candle for past cooking shows, including Emeril Lagasse. Rachael Straal is the most annoying talk show and cooking program in TV history. since Harriott had a great cooking host I watched, at least ainsley Harriott has some good moments and some style, this one has no style at all, she is terrible host, the kitchen looks horrible the writing is terrible, the disappointment is over and the opening credits are so bad, it makes me sick. Now I enjoy cooking that has a cool sense of style, but it has absolutely nothing. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst TVs of the year.
