IMDb calls this movie a comedy. I have no idea what genre this movie is, but it is definitely not comedy. tragedy maybe. <br /> <br /> I won't say if it's a good movie or not. All I know is not a comedy. I wanted a laugh tonight and what I got was a bizarre idea of ​​someone's attachment to an ugly chair. <br /> <br /> This movie is not being advertised. It's a film school step I can only take, meant to make people think. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone I know, or even I don't know. It's ridiculous bravery that doesn't make sense at all. <br /> <br /> It made me think well. It made me think, "I wish I returned that ninety minutes of my life." <br /> <br /> I'm sure the world is full of armchair critics who have bowed a liberal to their worldview that will make this movie worth watching. <br /> <br /> I'm not one of them.
