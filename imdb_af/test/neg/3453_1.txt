Making a movie for less than 1 million can be a triumph for a line producer or accountant, but do nothing for the audience. The balance sheet might have been nice, but the viewing experience was poor. <br /> <br /> What will be an Irish Cinema victory is when people realize that production values ​​and writing cannot be sacrificed. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why people spend the energy joining a movie if the quality of the production is worse than a low grade TV program. <br /> <br /> The shortcomings of the plot were mentioned. In another review on this site and I totally agree with what was written. What I want to add is that the film shaved the surface of several genres without ever settling in one of them. The film would benefit from a straightforward comedy or social / political commentary. <br /> <br /> My overall impression was that the movie was rushing, themed under development and not visually standard. On a positive note, the performances and music were very good.
