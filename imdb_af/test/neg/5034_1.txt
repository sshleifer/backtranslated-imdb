Well, the ten years later this movie was released and the sand time didn't improve it once. Again, like the other commentaries, the Aussie filmmakers had to have a bit more drama than in the middle class aussies. with not much in dialogue. middle class is not funny or rich. There is also a mish mash of throw. why a young woman with an old man is going to marry her father, it escapes me. It's so sorry for this movie, looks like a great place to vacation. Anyway, she's an hour and thirty minutes of my life, I'll never be able to come back again. live to short to watch this movie.
