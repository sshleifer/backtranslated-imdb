I hope the people who made these movies read this comment. The choreography was horrific, the plot was zero and the actors where so low budget writers seem 5 star to this litter. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes where so slow you can see the actors are waiting for each other to perform the next move. Camera cut and poor lighting cannot cover the cheap effects. The lightning was just stupid. The weapons look like something from a final fantasy game, and the double bow and arrow were just boring like anything I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Next movie you decide to try and invest in some wireless mics, better script and actually try to spend time on your stunts. <br /> <br /> Honestly, there are programs on TV that one day play and throw together over a few hours, which looks better than this one. <br /> <br /> Keep fighting martial arts (unless it's as poor as your play), then you take quilting.
