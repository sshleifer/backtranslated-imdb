All I can say about this movie is that it is absolutely boring. The intro for the movie is probably the worst intro for a horror movie I've ever seen. I mean an angry chick who hits a man in the head, with a frying pan, is not scary at all. That's what I think the director is aiming for. because, but it was actually "generous" funny. <br /> <br /> The acting in this picture was past pathetic; a note to directors, if you make a horror movie, please hire some good actors, not a popular soapster who doesn't know how to act. <br /> <br /> The deaths in this movie were boring. .. not gore, and sorry, but horror movies without gore, or good tension is just cheesy. I think this girl is being murdered by her in the middle of Tokyo, and not one person sees it happening, they just declare her "missing", wow that's awesome! <br /> <br /> Finally, if you and your friends want to see this movie, make sure you bring sleeping pills, because I guarantee you won't make it to the end. My friend and I left because we didn't even care what happened at the end. . <br /> <br /> Cheers
