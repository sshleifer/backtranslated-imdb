I saw this movie without knowing much about it. The split screen device was immediately annoying, and things didn't improve for me after the title set was finished. The plot, characters and dialogue were all extremely clicked - poor man of abusive family is thrown out of the house, wants to get out of his' fate ', regain himself, change his voice, dress others' clothes, are adopted by gay. man who keeps going to participate in an international set of drugs that British aristocrats take. <br /> <br /> Patricia Highsmith's estate (talented Mr. Ripley) has to sue the makers of this movie. The three-screen for me, along with the longer than 120 minutes, highlights the fact that it hardly exists. Can't decide which image works and is the strongest, why not show three and hope you get it right with one of them. This gimmick removed any connection or interest I had with any characters. Key dialogue is repeated 3 times over each screen, as if to say "it's an important / moving / deep moment, okay!". <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. <br /> <br />
