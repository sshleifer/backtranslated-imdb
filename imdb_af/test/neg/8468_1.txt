This is utter nonsense. I studied Nazism and read many manuscripts that day. The parallels use most of the classic disruptive apocryphal myths of Nazism and then compare them with complete, particular generalizations about what constitutes 1/3 of the planet. It is made for an audience of Polly-Anna complacency that is widely spooned, with terrified thoughts, irrational conclusions, deceptive ideas and nonsense logic. <br /> <br /> Who made this hit peace? Easy. <br /> <br /> When everything is said and done; Que Bono? That's who benefits in the long run. <br /> <br /> You don't. You offer money and rights. Muslims don't, they get our bombs. Please try again. Answer it, and you've unlocked a large door.
