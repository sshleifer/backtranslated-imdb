This movie was horrible ... How could anyone even think that this movie was like those in the "good old days" when Tim Thomerson wasn't even there. And to make things worse, they used clips of old trance movies. It's just awful. NO trancer movie is complete without Tim Thomerson. I love Fullmoon movies, and I've been watching them since I was 4 years old. I'm through everything they've done and this movie has almost lost me. Now I have a few lines to fill, so I continue. Their way of breeding new trancers is completely stupid and also to send Jack back in time. What happened to the TCL room. And finally! What happened in the end of trancers 5 where Lina says and I quote "Jack gave me something special" and her and another broad look at her stomach. I do not know. Maybe there's a BABY there. There were so many other places to go, but full moon sat down
