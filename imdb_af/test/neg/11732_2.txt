No no no. This is my advice to you if you want to see this movie. Anthony Perkins is the one and only Norman Bates, like Janet Leigh in her role as Marion Crane. It looks just like a colored version of Psycho, with some lightly different touches being thrown in for a more modern appeal. Vaughn is boring Norman, and Viggo Mortenson's Sam Loomis looks too much like the cowboy compared to the original. Please do not do yourself justice. Don't bother about this. One can only wonder what Mr. Alfred Hitchcock and Mr. Anthony Perkins will now think ....... <br /> <br /> * from ****
