This movie is somehow with 6.2 stars. It seems unthinkable that the director has so many relationships. I have a loss to explain it. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs. You only have a certain number of hours on Earth, do not waste 1 and 1/2 of them on this delayed pounding Guano hope! <br /> <br /> There is no story as apparently the director "wrote" (and I guess with a blunt orange crayon) the next day's writing at the end of the day's shooting. The "story" is noteworthy, no it is aimless, there may be a story to fill a commercial. Didn't hate ads? <br /> <br /> Now both leaders can act, they decided, of course, not to be here. And even the author / director can actually write both directly and as evidenced by his next work, "Toy Love" <br /> <br /> To recover, even if you get this movie for free, even if you pay to watch how avoid it. <br /> <br /> To paraphrase Monty Python's quest for the holy grail, "Start flight!"
