Made, this is my reaction to this movie. I really hope it would have been a good contemporary treasurer, but it doesn't even fall into the category of slashers. Instead, it tries to be something it isn't, it's a psychological strain, and it fails so miserably about it. Even the title "Freak" suggests it might be interesting. Adapt it to the cover art on the DVD and you think "OK, maybe I'll try this one". Time is not worth it. <br /> <br /> The story actually starts to look a little interesting with a poor, distorted child with bandages trapped around his head, chained by his fat mother. She screamed for him and probably beat him, because in one scene we actually see her for no reason. After all, he decides that he has had enough and collapses her face with a stone. Today he is now in insane asylum and is being transferred. On his way he broke out of the bus he was in and escaped. Also present the 2 main characters, a girl and her older sister. They move and touch the road. So most of the movie drives them around in the car talking to each other. But the bonds "Freak" are now underway and are about a disastrous murder! (I am quite sarcastic) <br /> <br /> I can't believe how boring this movie was. The budget was the smallest ever with absolutely no special effects and the dialogue I could only care less about. It's one of those movies where the packaging is better than the movie itself. And to compare it to Halloween?! Rubbish! I'm not even a fan of the Halloween series (except the 3rd one), but Halloween is much better than that. At least with Halloween we have a good score and some really creepy moments. With this there is virtually no music except a piano here and there and there is nothing crooks about this movie. Perhaps this movie would have performed better if it had a solid score, because even the worst movies are tolerant if the music is good. <br /> <br /> Well, that's just my opinion of the movie. I thought it was just a complete means of time and money. But since the movie has a 4/10 rating on IMDb, there must be people like this movie. I'm not one of those people. 10/02
