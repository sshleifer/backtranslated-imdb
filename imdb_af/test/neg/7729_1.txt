It's almost embarrassing to say I've even seen this movie. I mean it doesn't matter much to make a good zombie movie, except good special effects, lots of blood and gore, some scary moments and a decent plot. Do Home Of The Dead 2 Do Any Of These Things? No, not one. Of course, it's not as bad as its predecessor, from Uwe Bowle and it's the only thing about this movie that scares me. <br /> <br /> The dialogue in this movie is notorious, with such lines as "What do you do for a life?" In response "I kill zombies" and "I was never a disc jockey, I was a soldier. " The special effects are even embarrassing for a TV movie. I mean seriously, the zombies look like they have bloody lips on the crack. The army base in this movie is a parking garage, with a desk and an open gated room. This movie is so low budget that they couldn't even get dressing rooms together. In fact, this whole movie seems to have been filmed in a middle school. <br /> <br /> Why is it that all female soldiers in this movie are models? And for that matter, why is everyone in this movie so clueless about what is going on simply to kill the zombies. Heck, one man even tries to give food to the zombie. <br /> Overall, this movie makes even the worst Scifi Channel movies look great.
