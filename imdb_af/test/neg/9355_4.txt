Go to a filmwoman and ask them the title of the movie directed by Robert Wise. With the second unit war by Yakima Canutt and Sergio Leone, Ken Adam was designed and played by Max Steiner. Sir Stanley Baker, Sir Cedric Hardwicke and Brigitte Bardot, were filmed in Cinecitta in 1955 in color, scope and stereo, with a thousand extras - and they will tell you to leave and stop. <br /> <br /> They'll tell you there's no such movie. That the names you quoted NEVER worked together - they were not at the same time. And you have randomly chosen the names of a movie publication and try to satisfy them. <br /> <br /> At what point can you direct them to IMDb and show them the role and crew of Helen Van Troy. "They'll be surprised! This lesser-known sword and sandal epic has all these names and more - Niall MacGinnis, Janette Scott and good old Harry Andrews. <br /> <br /> And it's definitely a strange thing. After the war, 1000 Italian extras cost about $ 25 a day and gowns were a staple of Italian theater The orgy screens were shot twice - one with tops, the other without (you can guess which version has Britain and America). I even believe La Sophia is an extra in this one. <br /> <br / > Anyway, the names STAGGER the idea, but it is just coincidental, all of the names just reaching the end of their careers (Canutt, Steiner) or starting (everyone else). Only Robert Wise and Niall MacGinnis in the midst of their careers. <br /> <br /> For the record, Leone was uncredited and taught her dealings, yet Adam had to enter the declining circle find the ceiling of sets (a brand he would put in all the early effects.) - Baker only has to die and help produce like Zulu and Robbery - and continue with a Welsh TV company called Harlech - then tragically dies young. <br /> <br /> While Harry Andrews goes on to become one of Britain's favorite character characters - Janette Scott (Thora Hird's daughter) will never make the real big time, but who can put her in "Day Of The Triffids" Forget (although her little bit was added later - for padding and a happy ending) or "Crack In The World"? <br /> <br /> Sir Cedric was theater, but knew how to cup on film - and Bardot ... was BARDOT, for gawdsake! <br /> <br /> But what were these star people doing in this camp old nonsense? Don't ask me. The two main stars were no-name Italians - Helen had a mustache and Paris was beautiful - while the Brits were just there to support. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I think you can do this one only as a big FLUKE. A stereo. To be honest, if I didn't see it, I wouldn't believe it!
