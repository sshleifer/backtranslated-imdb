This film was released in the UK under the name of Blood Rites. It was banned and never filed for release. <br /> <br /> As The Horrors, it was presumably a hit with the horror-hungry denizens of New York City's famous 42nd Street Grindhouse circuit. If you are looking for some bloody horrors, you'll find it in this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, you see the development-disabled Colin (Hal Borske) on a live rabbit, shaky 16mm camera work that Ed Wood looks positively wonderful. <br /> <br /> Three sisters should spend three days in the family home with their husbands before the old man's money is paid out. Of course, in such a situation people are going to die. Family secrets are being exposed and a lot of blood is being wasted, especially during an abomination. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it was the bunny bit that the British objected to, I know I did.
