Drilling, completely predictable soap. Mary Tyler Moore is married to Ted Danson, who has a relationship with Christine Lahti. Moore is friends with Lahti and does not know about the fraud. Danson dies in an accident and Lahti is pregnant with his baby. To yawn! <br /> <br /> I am ashamed to admit that I paid money to see it in a theater in 1986. I have had three stars, but even their considerable talents could not deduce it. I definitely knew what was going to happen. As another poster said - it plays like a PG rated lifetime movie. <br /> <br /> Lahti didn't even swear at one point and even lost Moore once! Also, there is a useless shot of topless women playing soccer (!!!). Other than that, it is TV-friendly. The only good thing about this was Timothy Gibbs who played Moore and Danson's teenage son. Very attractive and quite a good actor. In addition, there is nothing to recommend it. You've seen it before ... and done better. Of course this has been forgotten. Skip it.
