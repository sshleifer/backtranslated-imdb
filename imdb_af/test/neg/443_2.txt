Maybe I'm too generous when I give this movie two and a half stars out of five, but sometimes there was a moment. But as an American werewolf movie, this one is a missed opportunity! There are no real plot connections with the superior original to speak of, but the story is in some ways similar to "London". <br /> <br /> * Possible Spoiler Warning * American kids go to foreign country, one fall in love for a beautiful girl. Another of the children is slaughtered on the same night by a werewolf being bitten, and in spite of his wandering friend's warnings, through the full moonlight he sprouts fur, chicks and claws. <br /> <br /> But there are some differences in the story, for one; the girl is one of the werewolves. second; There are three American children. And the third; there are some strange - @ $$ werewolf cult intentions to take over the world! As crazy as it sounds, the last one was not a joke! * Spoiler Ends * <br /> <br /> The movies suffer from many things. First, the bad play, drag it down! Tom Everret Scott's performance is at best amatuerish, and he and Julie Delpy, who play his love interest, don't look at all at all. second; A weak writing that seems to be all over the place. Many elements of tension and dark comedy, which made the original one great, are lacking in this one. And whoever said that the heart of the werewolf that benefits you will change you, will your man change? Last I heard it was not part of a werewolf lore! third; terrible special effects; The werewolf effects are done with computer animation, which works for things like dinosaurs, ghosts and spaceships. But look like hooks, false and artificial, when used for hairy creatures like werewolves. <br /> <br /> However, there were a few things that saved this one of the total "turkeydom". There is one hilarious scene in a Parisian cafe when Andy (Scott) has coffee with Serafine (Delpy), he drops some condoms on the table and tries to give it off as a chewing gum, chewing a bubble and to blow! also; the soundtrack, a very cool mix of alternative rock groups like Bush and Smashmouth. Although none of the songs have the word "moon" in their title, the soundtrack, like the original movie, is great. And another funny scene like a rotting corpse, played by Julie Bowen, striving to whistle and sticking out her eyeball, laughed me out loud. <br /> <br /> But as a whole, this movie seems to be lacking in white and tension. of the original. And the over-terminated end doesn't help much either. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 Two and a half out of five stars (average.)
