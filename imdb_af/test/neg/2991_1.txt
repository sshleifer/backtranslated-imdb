Don't misunderstand me: I enjoy craft movies, low-budget flicks, character studies, and foreign films. Unfortunately I can't enjoy this one - glacier pacing, complete lack of plot and characters you can't hate enough to hate, but you can't tolerate enough to keep. <br /> <br /> For me, Distant, was like watching the floor show of the locker room of a reality show - all the screens that were considered uninteresting, which would not normally make the final cut, were the only ones scenes. A camera in my apartment with two of my friends moving around for hours doesn't make an interesting movie. <br /> <br /> Distant make sure the viewer feels so long streets of no dialogue (almost 10 minutes before the first word is spoken out of the credits) can be made to work (2001 occurs), but for I have to force something else to sign me up. <br /> <br /> If you are the kind of viewer who can sit down by a movie and be happy with movie analysis, maybe it will work for you. However, if you are someone who wants to relax, relax or entertain movies, you should probably look elsewhere.
