Agreed this movie is well shot, but it just makes no sense and no use of how they look 2 hours like 3 just about a little love story, <br /> <br /> It could have been an episode of fat and the beautiful or the oc, briefly, do not see this movie because there is a song every 5 minutes to just make you sleep, I gave this movie 1/10 because it was the lowest and no it is based entirely on a true story, more than half of it is made up. I repeat the direction of photography is 7 or 8 out of 10, but the movie is just a bit too much, the actor's nose voice just wants me to blow my nose. Only you are a real him mesh fan of this movie is a great no-no.
