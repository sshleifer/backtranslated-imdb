Aliens loses a huge monster, called Zarkorr, and then sends a hologram that looks your average stupid teenage girl to tell the postman, Tommy Ward (Rhys Pugh, in the only movie you ever see him) chosen to fight. Also, if he loses the plant, he will punish, so he goes out to fight Zarkorr the Invader! This movie is bad, very bad. It's so bad you need negative numbers just to give it a rattan. Strangely written, badly directed, just under the Power Rangers top-of-the-wood scene you just grab a Lumberjacks horde not to get out! And don't start me on the theme song at the end. The people who made this stall from S $ @ # shouldn't be out loud near a camera or something about movies. Zarkorr is a cool looking monster that should have been a million times better than this one in a movie. Do yourself a favor and don't see this movie, it's 80 or so minute of life. The actors in it never worked again. <br /> <br /> 3/10
