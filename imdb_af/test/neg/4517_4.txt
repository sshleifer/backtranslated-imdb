I found my tire of this long forgotten show. Besides the theme song 'DISCO BEAVER FROM OUTER SPACE'. This show is barely watchful. You will flip through channels, just like the couple flip through the TV channels. It's a TV parody. <br /> <br /> The beaver is cool. The homosexual Dracula, the chick discussing her Peria experiences and the woman with the excessive lips discussing homosexuality, show us everything wrong with TV. This is all BAD. Just like the beaver from outer space lost in this new world, you will be too. *** from *****
