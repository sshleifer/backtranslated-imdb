I just watched Lonesome Dove, back to lonely pigeon, streets of Laredo and Dead Man's Walk. All excellent. This unfortunate junk was inexpensive and poorly behaved. <br /> <br /> In the previous series Captain Call and Gus McCrae come out as tough respectful cowboys. Despite the fact that Caption Call is being played by another actor every time each one has won me quickly. In the Dead Man's Walk, the boys are credible as the younger versions of the experienced Texas rangers. In Comanche Moon, they are just a few cubic rednecks. I had to stop watching. <br /> <br /> I suspect many of the glowing reviews for this show were written by the people who made this stinky stack. This is a pity to another big franchise.
