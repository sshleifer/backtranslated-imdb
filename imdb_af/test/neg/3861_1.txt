I've seen many movies over the past few years and I'm a big fan of comedies. <br /> <br /> But this so-called comedy almost reduced me to tears. This is without a doubt the WORST movie I've ever seen, the worst. <br /> <br /> I remember hearing about this movie from a friend and decided to watch it. If I could, I could turn back the time. I will regret as long as I live, the time I wasted to watch this garbage. <br /> <br /> The storyline is so insane; it just makes no sense and makes you confused. There is a Scottish crowd and a German headhunter who are after Pestario 'Pest' Vargas (John Leguizamo), the Scottish crowd after $ 50,000 and the Germans to his head. <br /> <br /> In the attempt to escape the plague, take the form of many disguise. But to this we testify to the most annoying, worst, petrified acting, dialogue and sounds in cinema history. This movie irritated me so much; By the end I was full of aggression. I was so angry that I wasted so much time watching a movie that would surely drive depressed people to almost certain suicide. I mean how can there be hope if a movie can be given this permission? <br /> <br /> I know people have their own opinions, but the most shocking thing about The Pest is that people really like it. Why? What is funny about a man who is annoying from the very first to the last? A man who can't act? Who has an annoying voice and confusing face? <br /> <br /> I sat there thinking the movie would get better, surely. It didn't. Usually you want the good man to survive, but I wanted the Germans or the Scottish crowd to find and kill The Pest, anything to make me out of my misery. There is nothing funny, interesting or normal in this movie, it's just annoying and confusing. The jokes are dead before they are told. I feel sorry for the cameramen who do not say how the film is made, but actually have this drift film. I won't be surprised if they receive counseling. <br /> <br /> If you want to stay healthy and part of society, my advice is never to watch this movie. I'd rather join my room for 5 weeks and go without food and water than to see this movie again! <br /> <br /> I don't think I'll ever hate this anymore.
