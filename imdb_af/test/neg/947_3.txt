The most accurate description of how Billy Crystal shows in My Giant is to say this movie is in his career, like "Ishtar" was for Warren Beaty's - it didn't ruin it, but it slowed it down. ... Crystal must know the three golden rules of Hollywood: 1) Never play beyond a child 2) Never play opposite an animal 3) Never play opposite someone who is nearly 3 feet higher than you is as innocent as a child and "deeds" like an animal. <br /> <br /> What is this story? A comedy? I think, but I didn't laugh, except at the screens where Crystal is on his own and not charged with his (what-is-her-role-in-this-movie) ex-wife or the aforementioned Giant. Did I mention that there is also a child in this movie? Well, forget about him. The boy is brought in to make us feel sorry for Crystal, and we do it, but for the actor, not the character. Billy Crystal is a funny man. If you don't believe me, look at old "soap" or "Saturday Night Live" episodes. Go hire "City Slicker" or "Running Scared" or "When Harry With Sally." <br /> <br /> The "Giant" is more humane than fairy-fi. <br /> <br />
