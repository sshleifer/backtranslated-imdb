Dracula 3000 is the symbol of painfully cheesy theater. From the beginning I assumed I was in for something pretty nasty. With a cast line featuring Casper Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio and Tiny Lister, what can be expected? Well, let's just say the expectations are broken. <br /> <br /> If I really start, I feel this review has been going on for centuries, so we're going to keep it simple. The vampire is not even called Dracula. The space crew carries coffins from the Carpathian sector of the Transylvanian system. In his big scene, Coolio talks about the most terrible things ever spoken in film history. In the year 3000, all wear bad clothes according to today's standards, they have nothing more advanced than a modern wheelchair, and adorn them with neon lights stolen from a roller coaster. <br /> <br /> Upstairs That's all ... the end. Merciful God. It does not deserve to be destroyed. It must be believed. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie a "1" and I wish I could give it a zero ... but I feel compelled to make you look. What madness is this?
