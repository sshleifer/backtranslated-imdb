I'm sorry, maybe it's part of the waves praise for firefighter since 911, maybe it's an old-fashioned story. Maybe it's not meant to knock your socks off, but sorry, this movie is terrible. As in the title, cliché 49, I think it has at least so many clichés. It's a barren story (impressive to be sad when there are dangerous fires and life saved) over a firefighter. And his urgent life has returned to the past style in a useless 'scene from now on'. We start the movie with the hero in a collapsing burning building. The whole movie is about to try to love this man, so we print a few tears when he comes to the end of the movie from the beginning. I found it difficult to care for and wanted him to have gone up earlier in smoke. Clichés are abundant such as: - killing the best friend, first-job love, a new job, first birth, a worried man with a dangerous job, a father figure boss / better, 2.4 children (though 2 but close enough), sacrifice your life to save others, awards for courage .... on and off. It's every firefighter's life, every police officer, nurse, doctor in one way or another. It was lazy, if it was meant to be a 'life shining before his eyes' when he died, God helps the poor shit. I'm surprised that he no longer sucked smoke into the smoke to go faster. The flashbacks are mostly mundane and predictable, dully performed, and with a soundtrack that The Laughing Cow could put out of pocket, it was so cheesy, it actually sounded like music or copyright free elevator games !!! To be avoided at all costs, unless you need something to look with grandmother on a Sunday night. Or maybe if you are related to a firefighter - warning - your life will end terribly or you will be afraid of life if you are a brave firefighter according to this movie. Unless your John Travolta (strange Velcro styles hair in this one !!)
