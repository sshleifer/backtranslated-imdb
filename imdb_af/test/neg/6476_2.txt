I was 12 when I watched the original movie (I lived in Italy and the Italian title was "FBI, OPERATION CAT!") It was a fun movie and not just for children. This terrible remake is even pathetic for a 5 year old! What did Disney have to destroy their reputation and the memory of a lovely movie I don't know and I just can't believe it. Even the title song in the original movie (both original version and the baptized Italian version) was very nice and created the mood for the story. On this remake, the title song is even worse than the movie itself. It was just nice to see Dean Jones, even though it was just for a cameo look, he was often on the big Disney movies. I can't see anything else positive in this remade movie.
