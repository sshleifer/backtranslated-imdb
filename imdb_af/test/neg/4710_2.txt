I rented this movie because Elijah Wood did good work and I thought it could be a covered treasure. It wasn't a treasure. I don't know if it was straight to video, but it should have been straight to the dump. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood fans will love the fact that he looks shirtless in a much too short shower. But, no healthy person would like this scripture. Imagine Memento being played by teenage actors, but ten times more confusing and one hundred times less credible. Case in point: Janeane Garofalo plays a caring psychologist (apparently "keeps the mediocre chain alive"). <br /> <br /> As if false memories of syndromes and mind-over-matter medicine were not enough, the movie also depends on one of those inexplicable psychic twin bonds that move the plot and disturb the audience. This double band creates a few too many confronted love shows between Wood's character and She's All That's girlfriend, who plays Wood's evil sister's angry cancer victim friend. <br /> <br /> Adding to the folly of this screenplay, Wood's other friends are a mentally challenged cancer victim and Nier, a young black boy suffering from a mysterious kidney disease. Kidney's dying wish comes true when Dr Garofalo gives him his own Walkman. This character's chopped feature in the story is adjusted by its weather-and-weather relationship with the barrel. Usually attached to a wheelchair, kidney has several inexplicable scenes that cause it to push others into it. <br /> <br /> Kindey's characterization may be one small detail, but it indicates the film's many other errors. The Bumblebee In any case, it certainly falls, but it never flies.
