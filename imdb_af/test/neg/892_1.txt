I saw House Party 1-3 and I loved them, but this one was not funny at all. First, it can't be a Home Party movie without Kid n'Play right? This one sucks and it was more like a black version of Ferris Bueller's Day Off than a Home Party movie. Second, who is John-John? This new character can't even be compared to that of the other three movies. Now I know why they put it straight on the video. It has horrible music, poor plot, unmatched actors and no hilarious jokes. My advice, just look at the movie at night if you can't sleep. series to House Party 3 since Kid'n'Play separated to that one. I hate this one remains my local video store does not have this movie and never wants to buy it, or also want to see it on Comedy Central. Just because Chris Strokes has talent for managing an emerging R&B group doesn't mean he has talent to direct and produce films, am I right or what? Eventually, the female characters are all dressed like cheap two-dollar hookers by most of the movie. SIMX divorced a year after this movie was probably released due to the failure of this movie and has just been forgotten today. In simpler terms, this movie is not cute anymore !!
