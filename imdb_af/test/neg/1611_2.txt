Stranded in Space (1972) MST3K version - a not very good TV movie, for a series that should never be set up, in which an astronaut trapped himself on the evil twins of Earth. Being a planet of the same size and mass circulating in the same plane as the Earth, but on the opposite side of the sun, is a well-worn SF chestnut - the idea is over 2000 years old, invented by the Ancient Greeks. In this version, the Counter World operates as an Orwellian 'perfect' society. Where, for totally unexplained reasons, everyone speaks English and drives late model American cars. After escaping from his jail sentence, the disruptive Earth is being hit by two double-packs and black polo-neck achievers by TV and bad filmmaker Cameron Mitchell, who not only wears his intention. It is an attractive evil combination that I totally intend to adopt. if I ever dominate a totalitarian. Our hero escapes several times before he begins to look at the alien world's three men and wonder if he is ever going home - and set one of that Man alone in a hostile world. Make a new friend every week, but move towards the end of every episode showing so loved ones of the industry in the 70s and 80s ('The Fugitive', 'The Incredible Hulk', 'The Littlest Hobo' etc.). The strangest peculiarity, however, was the title order. Somewhere between 'Stranded in Space' was first recorded in 1972 (entitled 'The Stranger') and the MST3K version in 1991 somehow of the 1983 film 'Prisoners of the Lost Universe' . So in 1991, the opening credits for 'Stranded in Space' jumped under a few shots of three people falling into a case transmission and disappearing. It's a sequence that has nothing to do - even thematically - with anything that follows. <br /> <br /> Just to add to the Nasty B movie confusion, one of the actors in this movie on the footage, Kay Lenz, appeared later in a 1994 movie called "Trapped in Space" . If you know it, you can never save your life, but it can bring you great points, and you can see fellow trash enthusiasts - if you could ever maneuver the conversation to the point where you can undoubtedly hit it . like a total idiot ...
