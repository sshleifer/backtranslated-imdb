Some changes for the better (the special effects are more complicated), some for the worst (Scott Grimes, a similar child in the original, changed into an uncomfortable teenager), but generally this succession is about the same original - which doesn't say much. The PG-13 rating is doubtful; Although the film is not scary at all, there are a few short but very explicit gores, and some out of place nudity. (* 1/2)
