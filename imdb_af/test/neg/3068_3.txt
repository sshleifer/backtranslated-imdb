Recognizing the picture of the dinner on the cover of the DVD, I realized that it was a local movie. The word Detroit in the title continued my suspicions and I watched things and yes, a local movie was it. <br /> <br /> So I picked it up. Someone I knew really knew about the producer / director (don't remember what) and said the producers / directors paid people to be in this movie. <br /> <br /> Brilliant! What a great idea. The filmmakers get some capital to do the movie, thanks to their role and crew. Then the investors (throw, crew, others) get the profits I imagine. <br /> <br /> Profits! <br /> <br /> Anyways. This film completely destroyed me. The special effects were special as in special kids driving the small buses to school. However, the acting was very amusing, not deliberate. There is a good line where a man says, "Well, this leg won't smoke itself!" as a bakkie line. Unfortunately, this is the only fun part of the whole movie. The story? Well, I followed it about 3/5 of the way, and then everything didn't make sense and when we sat there it suddenly ended. I mean as in, no decision of anything .. as they run out of time. "Sorry, out of time, good night!" <br /> <br /> We were surprised and intrigued and thrown into another movie. Then a neighbor of mine appeared 20 minutes later. With one of the guys in the movie! We throw it back and he (the actor) gave us a running comment, which was great because he was totally tearing the movie! <br /> <br /> What more could you ask for? <br /> <br /> The most absurd scene for me was a motorcycle chase scene because it was so dark that it could literally be a man passing by with a flashlight and not a motorcycle. It and the jaw dropping in your face are suddenly ending so you can cry. In pain! The zombies look less like zombies than my colleagues do. And I don't work at the mortuary either. So, I recommend seeing it if you can get someone from the movie to come over and give you a running comment on all the things behind the scenes and make sure this person hates the movie just because add to the fun. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, give this one a pass. Rent something like Feeders if you want a joke in a funny way ...
