It's really sad to see a once-off big director like Deodato delivering a second like this. This movie was so terrible that it put an end to his film career. The box lies, it's not an erotic thriller, the hell during the 97 minute run, Charlotte Lewis barely shows us one nipple! I thought it would pick up as soon as William Burger acted (in one of his last roles), but his character was suddenly killed. This movie fails almost every way. Claudio Simonetti's music is a bit more than noise, and the plot had no sense at all. For some reason, Lewis is affected by ghosts attacking the telephones. (?) By the end, the characters have been forgetting for the past 90 minutes of hell they've been through and laughing instantly when they make the evil spirits on someone else, Lewis's ex-boyfriend, sick. What?!? This movie made me little, besides anger, for me. And I was born half dead. For the real 80's Deodato fun, watch the BARBARIANE or the ATLANTIS INTERCEPTORS, leave one on the video shop rack. Argento can make a better giallo than that!
