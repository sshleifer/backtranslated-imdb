Stumble across this movie on Amazon.com. Never heard of his release, but the three reviews gave it five stars and rave reviews, such a beloved German movie I bought a copy ... <br /> <br /> Say I am not was not impressed. The production values ​​are cheap, the story is derived, the characters are less than tempting and for a comedy it is surprisingly short. <br /> <br /> I wanted it, but I just got it. Or maybe I expected more of independent German movies as a gay spin on The Full Monty and a cast of stereotypes. <br /> <br /> There are pieces in the movie that don't make sense, like one of the Leather Bear's trying to get Ecki in a sling - as he watched him twice? Or the revenge-free ex-woman arriving at the game but eventually stopping her estranged gay man? Bunkum is not the word! Well, that explains at least the movie-British title, I suppose ...
