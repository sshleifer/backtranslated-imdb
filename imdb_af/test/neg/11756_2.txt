This is in itself an above average film, but why was it made in the name of Bog? It is impossible to treat it as a thing for itself, as it is an almost shot-for-shot remake of an Alfred Hitchcock classic of 1960. You can't see it without the 1960 movie in you consciousness does not fall. <br /> <br /> What does the word "credit" mean? How can we acquire Van Sandt and his associates with anything other than deciding to use different actors, slightly different sets and colors? <br /> <br /> Anne Heche is attractive but lacks Janet Leigh's firm decision to become a respected middle class. woman. And Heche is younger than Leigh, who made her fruitless attempt to marry and settle, the despair of a 40-year-old woman. And Heche doesn't produce anxiety like Leigh did. The scene with the CHP officer who looks in her car window illustrates the weakness in the role. In the original, the officer asked, "Is there anything wrong?" Leigh: "Of course not. Did I have something wrong?" The officer hesitated for the answer: "Well, honestly, yes." The exchange is omitted from the remake for the simple reason that Heche is not nervous enough. <br /> <br /> The worst change, no doubt, is replacing Vince Vaughn for Anthony Perkins. It should not be Vaughn's fault. Who can fit Perkins in the role? Perkins is winding, bird-like, long-necked, in an external, charming exterior that has an inner vacuum mask. She's every move (eating sweet corn, with his apple's apple bobbing) and every statement, the dull laugh, the arid chuckle, is on the point. He just can't be improved. Vaughn brings to life the presence of a short-haired, buttery man who, like a Lance Corporal of the American army, was released. To represent his psychosis, which he can do all, is a manic giggle, in addition to what would otherwise seem to be a perfectly normal Norman in speech and manner. (Unlike the original Norman, Vaughn doesn't even fall over the word "fallacy" because it looks like "phallus".) He can just hang around the motel and wait to hear about his application for a soccer scholarship to UCLA . <Br /> <br /> The direction deserves some comment. I don't see what the story adds to seeing Norman's masturbation as he enters Anne Héche. I DON'T DO IT. I wonder why it's there, just as I wonder why the rest of the movie is there. <br /> <br /> And I think to impress ourselves with how much color the visual experience adds, Van Sant seems to have missed a bit of Hitchcock's more subtle stuff. Heche is given underwear of all different colors - green, pink, orange, and - mango? Is it a color? If so, what is the full color? Do not worry. The point is that in the original, when the travel camera first looks through the window of the Phoenix hotel, it captures Janet Leigh in bed with a pure white half slip and a white bra. Later, after stealing the money, we saw her again in her underwear - this time she was slipping and bra black and black. It's a small thing, but Hitch's own. <br /> <br /> With that, the idea of ​​shooting in color might not be bad, except that the black and white shoot of the original was excellent. The color and strange lighting effects in this version change the ordinary, boring and subliminal ominous motel into something that looks like it belongs to the Las Vegas seed component. <br /> <br /> Most of all, the 1960 movie was shocking in more ways than one. I can remember seeing it in a drive in San Diego and staring at the screen as it became clear that the central character was actually DEAD - halfway through the movie! Nothing like it has ever been done. <br /> <br /> The murder in the shower, in both movies, was a great improvement on Robert Bloch's original novel, incidentally, in which the writer wrote something, The murderer then entered the bathroom and her head with " a knife cut off. "I don't make it up. Well, not quite. Even here, Van Sant's movie gives us too much. There is more blood and more naked flesh. And where Hitchcock closed the blood for the first time, the Swimsuit overturned and loosened on Marian's open eye and when the camera pulled back slowly to reveal her face, he rotated his camera from a slight tilt to the right vertical, making the viewer a sense not only unbelief at the murder not a dizzying disbelief. From Sant, his camera does not make a delicate 10 or 20 degrees as Hitchcock did - he really turns it on his axis. <br /> <br /> It won't do it to call Hitchcock a bow because it is not a valid looting of Hitchcock's material (already in "Psycho" I, II, III, IV and "Psycho: The Beginning Years", and " Come into my office: Bates's Revenge, "and" Hand Me That Knife, Do You Want?: The TRUE Story of Norman Bates. ") A rehashing and grinding away click original stuff, a crumenal acts if it is not a criminal. And it's not about the many homes in other movies, especially the French, such as the infamous "ocean of boredom" scenes between Marcel Brulee and Jeanne Gateau in the very admired "La Mere de la Nuit." (Perhaps I should add that the last sentence is a terrible attempt at a parody of academic critics. And if a chicken's stomach grinds maize, it is a crumbling act. I will not do anything except this Gags say, as they are, is more fun than the movie. <br /> <br /> So who made it? I have to guess. Kids who are too young to know the original and who don't like black and white movies? Children who hope to see another regular treasure movie? Chimpanzees?
