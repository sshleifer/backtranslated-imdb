Tom Cutler (Jackson) is a retired policeman who now works as a crime scene Cleaner upper. In his latest work, he cleans and cleans a new crime scene and is unaware that the crime has not been officially reported. Uh, it can't be good. <br /> <br /> You always hear about Cleaners, but usually when a gang or a gangland hit, bodies need to be removed and the area cleaned. This one is different because Tom Cutler is working with the police to clean up after police investigated a crime scene. Hey, somebody needs to do this. You know the police won't. The film makes it very clear and it is up to the family to clean the area. <br /> <br /> It's almost a good excitement, but a plot by Tom's daughter (Palmer) makes this story somewhat uncomfortable. I think they had to fill in a while. Oh, they brought this side to make with the other side's plot, but it was still a reach and uncomfortable. See? <br /> <br /> It was almost a good excitement because there was a noticeable lack of tension, tension and the pace was somewhat thin. The music also didn't help, as I noticed the music was more suited to watching people take a long journey. You know, travel music. Get it? HA! <br /> <br /> The acting of all was excellent in this almost good excitement. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language: No
