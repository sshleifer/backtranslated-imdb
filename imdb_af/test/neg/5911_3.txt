Just read through the other comments here, and were a little surprised to find that no one said anything about the play or plot. <br /> <br /> Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy can both deliver a great stand-up comedy program. . Great actors are not. Enough about it. <br /> <br /> Regarding the plot? Oh man. Every time the movie tries to trick you into believing that the people are going to lose, you know the scenes: "What? The good people are losing? Oh, I see it was just a trick", it's all so bad , you can look it a mile away. <br /> <br /> It has 2 or 3 funny moments, but not enough to save the day. <br /> <br /> It's a bit stupid that this Comment should now be 10 lines. Many people will fill it with shit because it is eligible. Being short is an art.
