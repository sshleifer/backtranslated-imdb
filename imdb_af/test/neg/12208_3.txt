You just have to read the roll list and credits to salivate in anticipation of this DAVID COPPERFIELD, but unfortunately! How much great acting and director talent could have changed one of the richest stories of literature in such monumental BORE is completely beyond me. It's fair to look at the lovely photography, especially the Yarmouth rows, but, DULL !!! No need to continue! Skip it and watch the Selznick or the amazing BBC mini series from the 1980s.
