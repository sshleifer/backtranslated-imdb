Probably one of the worst movies ever made, I'm still trying to see if it's fun, but I definitely didn't have anything. Perhaps the film lost something during the English-Italian translation, because I miss the one to see it again in the original version. <br /> <br /> My rate for it 2/10, and I feel like I am "I'm pretty generous (let's say 1 point is for Liv because she's a good babe, and the other point is for that decent actors trapped in a worthless, useless and pathetic movie). Beware <br /> Alex
