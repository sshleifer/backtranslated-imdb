I agree with another viewer who wrote that this movie reminds the insignificant Melanie Griffith / Jeff Daniels comedy, "Something Wild", in which a very eccentric free spirit is associated with a conservative and very orderly young man and the two Set as a few and basically, her personality gradually affects him. He lost and learned to enjoy their short-lived try. This is exactly what is happening here, except in the role of Melanie Griffith placing a convenient grocery store eccentric, Alex (Rosanna Arquette) in the role of Melanie Griffith, and a super-careful teenager, Lincoln (the name is not by Devon Gummersall not played) in Jeff Daniel's part. This movie even shares the same twist and sudden genre change where the rogue, violent boyfriend suddenly comes to an end and things end pretty badly. Right here, instead of Ray Liotta throwing it back to the 1950s, it's Peter Greene. <br /> <br /> The story is about a teenage child who is in his own small world. He has a kind of fascination with death after his brother's suicide, and his parents also disconnected, and behaved rather strangely (the mother is convinced that Christmas is coming soon, despite being August). Then, on a night out with the "guys" (one of whom is played by Jason Hervey of the Wonder Years), trying to buy their beer, he walks into Alex who decides to kidnap him and his friend's car (with his permission, of course) and they are descending for a mini-adventure on the West Coast deserts, robbing easy-going Robin Hood shops and watching the routine self-discovery. Everyone asks more about the other's life. But, Alex left a partner in her theft trade, and he doesn't go away easily. Although we are not consistently reminded of him or something like recurring jumps or switching to his point of view. At least it's done very smartly. <br /> <br /> "Do Me a Favor" is a mostly underdeveloped story of criminal disaster and self-discovery that is quite a bit for the first half of the movie, but delivers the goods a A little late when Alex and Lincoln come home at home in the middle of nowhere. By the time the filmmakers give you enough stimulation, the movie is almost over. I would recommend that if it's the kind of story you're in the mood for, and despite Rosanna Arquette who always gives good performance (even in a poorly written movie), I'd still recommend it to be in it's best shape. catch, Wild.
