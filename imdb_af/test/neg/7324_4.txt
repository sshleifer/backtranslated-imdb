I love Kevin Bacon and Cathy Moriarty, and I love Mary Stuart Masterson, but the movie was not good at all. There wasn't a nice character in the picture, and the plot was almost non-existent. <br /> <br /> Me. Masterson is a great actress, but she just didn't pull out the "tough girl" character. (She had similar problems with her character in the second day of Christmas.) Perhaps she should avoid these characters, especially those with a silly female child playing. <br /> <br /> Evan Rachel Wood was unimpressed. Her character was a little, simple and simple, and no young actress could have given Harriet any positive feelings. <br /> <br /> In the interest of full disclosure, I couldn't even finish looking at this picture. Forty-five minutes of my time is enough to waste.
