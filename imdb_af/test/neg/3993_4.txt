I have always seen the Italian horror maestro Dario Argento's efforts as a producer with a certain suspicion and it was only confirmed after my fairly recent viewing of Lamberto Bava's horrible DEMONS (1985); The fact that it was his third installment didn't listen much promisingly, but I decided to give the movie a rental regardless of the fact that we were in full Halloween swing. I checked the theater wagon on the Anchor Bay DVD before watching the main function? The undeniably striking visual resources have inspired me to be sure, but then the movie is decent (which no longer makes sense in the two-minute montage, and can be seen to be most of its highlights wisely set up <br /> <br /> This is a definite decrease! <br /> <br /> With promising enough with a medieval prologue straight from Alexander NEVSKY (1938), it goes off fast because it is too much on surreal images at the expense of the story. As a result, several characters randomly take the middle stage? With the insatiable masculine appearance that previously dedicated to the dark forces, the bishop (Feodor Chaliapin), who caused a mere red herring, gradually assumed the mysterious black priest to heroic traits. The foremost lady is for whatever reason through a buck-shaped devil (who leads to a sexual ritual conducted before the other cults, everything has also been clear from ROSEMARY'S BABY [1968]) and a fairly impressive year-old Asia Argento as the rebellious but lovely sacristan's daughter (who emerges as the only survivor at the end). Incidentally, the older Argento also joined the film's story and script with director Soavi and (under a pseudonym after apparently falling out with Dario in the early stages of production). Original helmet Lamberto Bava and productive genre writer Dardano Sacchetti (I met at the 61st Venice Film Festival in 2004). <br /> <br /> The extremely confused second half of the movie then sees a group of people ?? including the inevitable teenagers, but also a killing English couple (whose constant bickering is given an amusing nasty punch line)? Just as locked in a building in the grip of evil spirits (the church is the cemetery of a satanic cult)? Not that this horror trip will probably see the memories of Luis Bunuel's sublime-surrealistic EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962)! Eventually, the movie is becoming increasingly disappointing (although Sergio Stivaletti's horrific effects are anyway noteworthy), since I thoroughly enjoyed the only other Soavi title I watched? CHURCH MANUAL (1994), which I own via the R2 SE DVD. Having said that, do I still want to capture his debut feature? STAGE FRIGHT (1987) ?? and the director's follow-up effort to THE CHURCH, entitled THE SECT (1991) ...
