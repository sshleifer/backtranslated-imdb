I was disappointed with the third movie in the "Death Wish" series and would not recommend it unless you really are in Bronson. He is his usual self in this one, perhaps a little lighter heart than in the other; The rest of the roll is good if you watch a movie of the week on TV. The whole movie has the production value of a bad episode of the A team and I like the escape fun of a show like the A team, but not on the big screen, even if it is an action movie that doesn't claim make something too sophisticated. The movie takes a while to go and then it eventually becomes out of control to the point of ridicule. The plot is something from an episode of "Highway to Heaven" and Bronson looks like a fish out of the water with the majority of the senior citizen and the rifle game is so out of control that you don't even get satisfaction from Bronson's revenge against the bad guys. Save it and continue to the 4th installment I highly recommend.
