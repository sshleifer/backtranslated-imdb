^ ^ contains spoils ^ ^ <br /> <br /> This movie is crowded. Don't look. <br /> <br /> There is no one in this movie to root for, or even for, the woman and his winning standard. Everyone is selfish and many things do not make sense. <br /> <br /> The acting is at its best mediocre and everyone blows too much about everything. No one can even cry credibly. <br /> <br /> If you leave the room for another second, something will be completely out of the left and it will NOT make SENSE. <br /> <br /> For example, I left the room for a second while Jennie Garth's character slept with her driver. I come back, seriously about 4 minutes later (I'm also pretty sure there was a commercial somewhere) and she slept with the Berko man. <br /> <br /> I gave up on this movie in the time that Berko was an ass for his fiance in the car because she didn't want to cut off the wedding. <br /> <br /> I wasted 2 hours of my life. You shouldn't.
