I must surely be guilty, but I certainly expected hell to expect more from a movie entitled "Black Dragons" and turn to secret WWII conspiracies, Nazi plastic surgeons and revenge. This movie is a dull failure with an incomprehensible structure. The actual plot (which is basically quite ingenious and intriguing) becomes apparent only during an explanation near the end, but the problem is that you no longer care. We see the horror icon Bela Lugosi infiltrating into a society of prominent American politicians and killing them one by one. The story is right before World War II and? especially after the end has been tested? This is definitely a prospect with lots of potential, so it's quite a shame that it's no longer properly worked out. However, there is one big dialogue I can't resist sharing! Husband to wife: "Do you want to marry me?" "Why?" "So I can beat you? That's the only way you will leave this place!" It's the only highlight in an overall boring movie. Bela Lugosi is beautiful ?? as usual ?? but his ghostly performance alone is hardly worth buying this movie. If you are interested in seeing other ghoulish performances of his (in movies with decent screens), look at "Invisible Ghost", "The Corpse Vanishes", "White Zombie" and of course the 1931 Dracula version.
