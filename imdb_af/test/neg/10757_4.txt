Without saying how it ended, it is enough to say that the whole thing of about five minutes before the end ends. If the standard was maintained throughout, the movie would be worth seven. <br /> <br /> One wonder in a way that a woman has been added. (Well, not really!) The premise is a good one. The situation in which the victims find themselves is pretty scary and it's done pretty well, but you get the impression that the creators of the movie have lost interest to the end, or if a previous contributor says, they have changed writers and turned on somebody surrendered.
