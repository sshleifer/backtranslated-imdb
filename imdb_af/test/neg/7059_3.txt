It didn't go too long after Halloween started the slasher excitement because the category was cursed by ongoing mediocrity. So early in 1983, the genre had struggled to release more than three decent offers a year and by '88 the stem and slash movie became almost the horror theater horror. By that time, big studios were all aware that repeating the tired formula was no longer profitable. This left it to independent and mostly inexperienced filmmakers to continue the legacy that John Carpenter created. Although there were an impressive number of features that hit shelves in 88, most of them were poorly produced and taken as a whole, they were actually unattractive. There were a few jewels under the rubble. Scott Spiegel's intruder in his rough form was a wonderful cheeky classic, while Evil Dead Trap proved that the cycle was not completely without style and panache. William Lustig's Maniac Cop was successful enough to start a franchise and two years later, Dead Girls and Mirage were the last staggering breath of life in the difficult category. <br /> <br /> It was the ongoing release of sklock such as Berserker, Blood Lake and Rush Week that cursed the shooter movie for eight years of obscurity. It eventually took the big budgeted flamboyance of Wes Craven's Scream to provide the necessary resuscitation. After I heard nothing from Demon Warrior before I unexpectedly appeared, I immediately assumed it was part of the low forehead waste that led to the downfall of the abrasive phase. But with that, the film boasts an intriguing premise that sits comfortably alongside Scalps and Camping Del Terrore as another welcome addition to the native American influenced catalog. <br /> <br /> A truck pulls on a bushveld and out of step two laughable dramatized rednecks. The lumberjacks are only ten seconds on the screen, and then they are killed by an unhealthy threat. Next we meet a group of five young adults heading for a spot of shotgun targeting on some of the local wildlife. The area is owned by Neil Willard and has been passed on by three generations of his family. His grandfather stole the land from an Indian medicine man who was rumored to have a curse on the property. According to legend, every tenth year a Demon Warrior with a great hatred for mankind stole the forest that gives revenge on those he considers responsible for the arrow of the tribe's house. It wouldn't be nice if those myths were a lie, as often as a clockwork, is a male assassin with a taste for blood. Will the children stop this phantom killer? <br /> <br /> Demon Warrior is best described as a larger, budgeted (but horribly inexpensive) remake of Fred Olen Ray's Scalps. The film of both films is virtually identical and the director even throws a scalping series to confirm my suspicions. Things start promising with a few Christmas-free Friday's 13th-style first-person cinematography and a few shock sticks made up by Frank Patterson. Thomas Callaway has a good work with photography and the tribal drum count makes a refreshing change from the more traditional late eighties synthesizer garbage. Battles of tension are placed with some credible legal decorations and there are even a few attempts at humor. The killer was successful in the devil's clothes and the inclusion of a bow and arrow as the murder weapon was a touch of the director. <br /> <br /> Fred Olen Ray's notorious slasher was striking for his sharp and credible disturbing atmosphere. Unfortunately, despite the fact that it is produced twice on the budget, Demon Warrior never comes close to the movie that so desperately emulates. Rumors have it that the majority of Texas Baylor University actors have been set up and not even paid for their inclusion in the function. It goes without saying that the drama is quite abysmal. I especially enjoyed the hilarious John Langione? An 'Italian' Native American (don't ask) that portrays about as much emotion as the trees in the forest that surrounded him. Warrior started off with some credible views of the director's panache, which led me to be a welcome inclusion in the scrap index. Unfortunately, the poisonous sundowner of horrific drama and an end that was plucked directly from stupidsville, seriously changed the initial plan I had in mind for an attack. It is a pity that the dramatic types have been scrapped from the bottom of the thespian barrel, because Demon Warrior sometimes has flashes of potential. <br /> <br /> All in all, Patterson's movie is a mixed bag of ideas ?? some of them were good, but mostly they were shockingly mediocre. Because it was released at a time when the slasher genre was watered down to avoid the scissors-happy censorship, there's nothing to mention. Even the scalping series is relatively tame compared to Olen Ray's graphic representation. Demon Warrior has the strange moment of credibility, but not often enough to justify a purchase. Not as bad as the above Berserker, Blood Lake et al, but not really that good
