Well, for this horror of a movie, I didn't expect anything good. I find Steve Carell annoying, and Bruce Almighty was pretty good, but there is absolutely no reason for a successor. Somehow, this movie was even lower than my expectations, even if I didn't. <br /> <br /> Does anyone remember the Disney movie Noah with Tony Danza? Well, let's just say that Evan Almighty got it out of the way, too many ways to justify the movie. Evan Almighty actually had the same layout as Noah, with the exception of a few techniques, it was nothing but a carbon copy of a far superior movie that was actually FUNNY. <br /> <br /> Another thing, did anyone get sick of Wanda Sykes's stupid, unfriendly, excess, one-liners that were literally in every scene? It was completely ridiculous and dragged the movie more and more. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that I have seen the film (Noah) ten years earlier, Evan Almighty has to be the predictable movie I have ever seen. I figured out the whole movie from start to finish within the first five minutes and finally realized it was ripping Noah left and right. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you're a little unclear whether you want to see Evan Almighty or not, you're already sick of Jonah Hill, who plays the same role in every movie he's in, likes Bruce Almighty, and does not want to see a predictable, dry, unpredictable movie, with Steve Carell trying to act like Jim Carrey. Please do not see this piece of garbage.
