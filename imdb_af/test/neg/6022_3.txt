This movie was an absolute waste of time. It's nothing but a gangster movie. It contains a very predictable plot. My feelings are impersonal to the characters, and the dialogue is mediocre at best. Half the time you are looking for something else to do, because the movie is so boring, because you already know what is going to happen. The other half of the time that you hopelessly hope the protagonist, grows some balls or ends his life by jumping off a bridge or something. The secondary characters are also usually one-dimensional. There is no depth of any of the characters in this movie! No depth!
