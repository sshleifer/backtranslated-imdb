I have to explain that this Shutter is a head above The Grudge and Dark Water, while still not achieving the same amount of atmospheric creepiness the Ring determines. <br /> But although movies, like life, don't exist in a vacuum, it's for comparison with other thrill / thriller / horror movies. Honestly, I am not writing a long summary here and will say that this movie seeks to rely on music-induced "horror" rather than atmosphere and the "ghost" itself is not so remarkable. The plot is pretty basic and predictable and is nothing to write home about. While there are some exciting plays that are creatively frightening, most of the movie is vanilla. If you enjoy the grudge and it's ilk then you can enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Degree: C-
