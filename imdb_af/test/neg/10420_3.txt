I'm pretty sure Poe would have considered it a travesty. The first two stories are decent, nothing spectacular. And then there's Toby Dammit. What on earth was Fellini thinking? It is a blunt, random, dull piece, with little to recommend. One must feel frustrated about the lack of background or conclusion, but there is only relief that it is over.
