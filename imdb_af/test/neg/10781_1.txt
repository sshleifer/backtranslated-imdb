Sometimes there is such a movie that you just watch in awe. This is one of those movies. Of course, I can't help being biased. I'm from Chicago, so I watched the screens carefully for accuracy and I don't find Billy Crystal funny at all. And I can't do all the English style photography (Tony Scott etc.) with the smoke machine working overtime and all the faint-colored, soft lighting. I suppose we should believe that Billy Crystal really is from Chicago because he wears a Cubs jersey. Oh and the plot. If you really think about it, these guys should be locked up, not the bad guys, as they are more dangerous. And of course there is the clich√© of police on the verge of retirement. But the funniest scene is the climax where the good and bad guy machine in the Thompson center dies. Of course, it's a cool building, but it is the equivalent of a great White House drug deal.
