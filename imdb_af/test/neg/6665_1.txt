There are so many logical errors in this show, it's hardly worth explaining to me. 1) Mystic Gohan does not exist. 2) Uub is as powerful as MAJIN BUU, but plays absolutely no role in the show, but is easily attacked by every bad man. 3) The whole Super Saiyan 4 idea is delayed and it is terrible that he lost Super 17 (which is the worst idea for a DB villain ever) 4) Super Saiyan 4 Goku is not a Super 17 match, but non-transformed Goku using a move he learned in a movie not supposed to happen, kills him with ease 5) Vegeta is completely useless 6) No character except Goku has any impact on the outcome of the fighting. 7) The series ends with a ghost bomb ... come on 8) Goku invincible? absorb dragonflies? lame 9) Gotenks? ... Better still guys ??? Tribe ??? they suck both 10) Super Saiyan 4 involves a magical transformation in an adult 11) Goku is a child 12) Goku is a child 13) No super saiyan level 2 (characterized by electricity) 14) No imagination with the animation from Gogeta 15) Gogeta totally useless 16) Big Bang Kamehameha is the biggest in the anime history dropped (not really logical, but I'm going on a tangent line) 17) Shortest character fights ever <br /> <br /> I can last longer than I have not suppressed most memories associated with this display. If I make enough money, I'll fund the recovery of this series.
