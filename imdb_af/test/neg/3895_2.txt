I would admit that I didn't pay full attention to everything in this movie, but to be honest, I don't think it would matter. Local councilor Sidney Fiddler (Sid James) basically persuaded Firecombe's incompetent mayor Frederick Bumble (Kenneth Connor) to hold a beauty contest to enhance the town's image. They are faced with Augusta Prodworthy's liberation struggle (June Whitfield), who is trying to sabotage the match, but they also have publicity agent Peter Potter (Bernard Bresslaw) and Connie Philpotts (Joan Sims). Soon the young, beautiful wannabe models will appear, including Hope Springs (Barbara Windsor), Paula Perkins (Valerie Leon), Dawn Brakes (Goldfinger's Margaret Nolan), Debra (Sally Geeson) and Ida Downs (East Enders Wendy Richard). When the girls have a cat fight, they pull down regular residents, but after a while of a few splashes, not those funny innuendos and William (Jack Douglas) who have overactive moves, it eventually comes to the competition and that is just after that can't be bothered. Also Patsy Rowlands as Mildred Bumble, Peter Butterworth as Admiral, Joan Hickson as Mrs. Dukes, David Lodge as Police Inspector, Angela Grant as Miss Bangor, Arnold Ridley as Councilor Pratt, Robin Askwith as Larry, Patricia Franklin as Rosemary, Jimmy Logan like Cecil Gaybody and Dad's Army Bill Pertwee as chief fire officer, Charles Hawtrey, apparently the Carry We ended up, but where is Kenneth Williams? I think I see Babs and young, beautiful Pauline Fowler in bikinis, but for the comedy value, it fails miserably, and the overuse of the swan whistle just comes on your nerves. Nice arm!
