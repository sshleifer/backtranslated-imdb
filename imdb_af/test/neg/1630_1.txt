I saw one late, late, late, show show when MST3K was just a twist in Joel Hodgson's eye. I had the privilege of seeing it without knowing exactly how bad it would be. I didn't know that a woman with an arrow in her chest could run in about half an hour (thank you for giving her specific directions) and then taking days to get it back to the castle with help. I didn't know that a sword-resistant barbarian species could run in the bush and create a hangover and a flute powder bomb in less than 30 seconds. I had no idea how a movie could be. <br /> <br /> It's a bad thing, kids, a very bad thing. If you enjoy bad movies, go for it.
