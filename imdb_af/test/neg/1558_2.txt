Zarkorr is a bad movie. It doesn't even fall into its good category. It's just bad. From the (missing) design to the acting on the special effects, everything stinks about this movie. For the first time, the movie looks like it was filmed in empty rooms, with some props being thrown in to make it look good. Then our acting so bad that it plays a high school seems to be an Oscar candidate. And above all, there are the special effects that are so bad that they look like an amateur who pulled them into their garage. The villages supposedly smashing the monster look like my cousin's train. So obviously false that they scream at the viewer. The only good thing about the movie is the monster pack. It's just too bad that they've spent all their budget on it and left nothing for the rest of the movie. And maybe a decent script would also have helped.
