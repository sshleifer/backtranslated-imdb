I'm not sure what it is, but there seems to be a curse when it comes to movies about the elusive Bigfoot. There has to be another movie approaching the subject intelligently, not one that creates a true tension. Both "Legend of Boggy Creek" (1972) and the first film entitled "Sasquatch" (1978) became a minor cult but also not very memorable. Both films were aimed at family-friendly audiences, preventing them from actually trying to scare anyone. "Harry & The Hendersons" (1987) was the first big-budgeted movie to use Bigfoot, with a tremendous creature design by Rick Baker. However, they also chose to pursue younger audiences, but this time as a comedy (such as "Bigfoot" in 1995). I waited a long time for someone to tackle the subject as a thriller, perhaps in the style of 'Jaws' or 'Predator'. When I saw it at my local video store, I thought my dream came true. Boy, was I wrong! Lance Henriksen plays a billionaire who leads a Pacific Northwest expedition hoping to find his daughter because she was on board a small plane when it crashed into the mountains. The point of departure is interesting and sounds promising. The truth is, it never builds a true tension. I never found myself interested in any of the characters, because each one was very two-dimensional and quite soft. Even the always trustworthy Henriksen seems to call in his actions. Every time he appears on the screen, he looks bored. He must be as there is no action for the first hour of the film. As for the creature, where do I start? I thought we would at least get a cool monster running around in the woods, but instead we got it bare (yes, I got a bare one!) Man with a pecky skin and fur coat here and there. Make a cross between "Swamp Thing" and Chaka from "Land of the Lost" and you'll get the idea. Nothing like the artwork on the cover box, I don't assure you. Untidy editing and indifferent directions also add to the confusion as half the time, everything looks like sequence, while the other half of the movie is constantly inflated with these long, slow-fading outs (which didn't make sense or meaning) . They even stole the entire infrared vision of P.O.V from the creature in "Predator", which just looked stupid and out of place to be effective. Perhaps this is all that proves that Hollywood should just forget to make more Bigfoot movies, because they have to make another one work. So far, everybody is as scary as an episode of "In Search Of" 3/10
