Wow, pretty unbelievable that something bad can actually be made. I give this movie a 2 because it's so bad, it has a certain "car wreck" kind of appeal. It's so bad its comic and it does have a certain entertainment value. In addition, there is a little generous nudity and it is always appreciated. <br /> <br /> So where do I start. The acting is over, that's how you watch a high school play being filmed. Theresa Russell had to do something really bad for being forced to make this movie and her acting reflects how happy she is in the midst of this mess. <br /> <br /> The rest of the role is simply stupid. the cupboards of Dan Cortese as an FBI agent, the cherry on top of this piece of shit. His acting really laughed at me. <br /> <br /> What the script and director C. Courtney Joyner and Mark L. Lester should be simple, must be back and shot.
