Very disturbing but knowledgeable and written and intelligently oriented with a good eye for color and detail. Mary Beth Hurt, Sandy Dennis, and especially Randy Quaid are exceptionally good. The story centers on a young boy (Bryan Madorsky) and wonders where all the remnants they eat every night come from. His parents (Hurt, Quaid) strange behavior causes the school patient (Dennis) to get involved. This is a gruesome cannibal movie. But it's not bad. If you want Hannibal, you'll like it. If you don't like parents, stay away from the movie. Just give advice to Cannibal Lover and Haters. <br /> <br /> Rated R for Strong Adult Themes and Graphic Violence.
