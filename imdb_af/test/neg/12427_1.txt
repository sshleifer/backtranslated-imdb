I think it's one of those few movies that I want to judge as low as possible just to pay it a compliment. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen this movie in about 25 years, so I can really say there's not much left. Video still finds it very difficult to find. But I remember my brother and I somewhere in the poisonous brew of UHF channel television in the mid-1980s when I was about 10 years old. So I've never seen the beginning of the movie, but I've seen most of it. The first thing I remember is that this couple sneaks out of a campsite and they row to an island to make out, and then they are attacked by insane Scots in a kilt with an ax! They manage to escape from him, but are attacked by the Loch Ness Monster, who in this movie is just a head and neck without body. The eyes and mouth of the monster do not even move, it looks like a pi√±ata. <br /> <br /> I mean, I have never seen anything about it ever before and it has completely blown me out. I saw bad movies on TV in the early eighties, but I have never seen anything so completely unknown and so uncomfortable and unceasingly made it seem that the people who made it spent less time and effort than we it looked. I've seen some of the Troma movies and that kind of thing that deliberately "campy" but it was the pure and real thing and it was my first encounter with really big bad movies. This movie was like the last wave of the ride-in era and I just caught it in time. Actually, when we looked at it, we couldn't find out if it was made in the 50's or 70's. It comes out just a few years before I saw it. <br /> <br /> Later, I contacted the Mystery Science Theater and invented many of the old B movies and series, but I've seen it in this movie. The movie is so funny I have never laughed so hard at the Monty Python team or Bill Murray or any comedian. After watching this movie, I always tried to search for the "good bad" movies and I have a lot of my friends in it. But this movie was and basically is an impossible one to find. I never really found out if it was even who Larry Buchanan was until the 1990s when IMDb kicked off and the internet started and information started running. But this movie has yet to be discovered by many who appreciate its transcendental bad qualities. Look for it.
