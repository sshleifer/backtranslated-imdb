First. Should Cameron Diaz ever be allowed to act again? To call it a bad performance will be an insult to bad performances. It was a historically horrifying performance. Any small chance that Diaz was a serious actress is now complete. Laughably horrible. <br /> <br /> Two, the movie was extremely boring and not much thought. I can move around and consider human nature without watching terrible actors, seeing a horrible story. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, there was not a single peculiar character, and even worse, it seemed to be done by design. You weren't supposed to feel, or feel sympathy for any character. It was pretty effective. I wanted them to just die to be honest. Aliens included. Child included. Everyone was just one big joke in this movie. Everyone literally just walked around, and they called it a movie. You can hardly distinguish the zombie "employees" with regular people, because they all looked like zombies. <br /> <br /> Finally, nothing really makes sense. Of the characters' reactions and emotions, to the literal story line, it just seems haphazard. It's just a very bad movie, disguised and regarded as a "think man movie", which is supposed to be confusing. Give me a chance. A bad movie is a bad movie. And this movie was bad.
