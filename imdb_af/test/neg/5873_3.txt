I bought this movie at a savings store. Months before, my friend told me when we were talking about silly movies we saw. When I saw the cassette, I knew I had to get it. I watched it the night. I could say it was going to be a lot of cheese and cheap. . . This led me to it. I plucked it in and I laughed all the way. I recognized Gregory (The Ice Cream Man), but I didn't recognize his name and couldn't remember where I saw him. Later, while watching the Andy Griffith show, Clint Howard (Ice Cream Man) was considered extra since he was Ron Howard's brother (Opie Taylor). I got the credits and I rushed. I went to my mother, who also watched the show and said, "It's the room man!" She also sailed. This movie is great, but just for laughs and criticism. This is the perfect example of a cheesy horror flick. If you would like to laugh and have fun at low-budget movies, rent this video.
