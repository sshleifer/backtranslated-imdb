As I watched it, I managed to make a flashy, lambing criticism of this "movie" (it's actually video), but then I saw somebody already doing. I almost agree with him. But then it looks a lot of trouble and millions of lira have succeeded, so I think you should give them credit to try. However, it is said, anyone who does not know the Lovecraftian world and that is what they are trying to convey will probably think ... well, it's not just really bad, but it makes absolutely no sense. Thanks, I read a portion of the other review (a little gushy, maybe?) That revealed that this man also did "The Shunned House" (which looks nice by judging the DVD box ), so now I can avoid it and save my thoughts from any further exposure to such desecration of the brilliance of HP Love Craft.
