I watched the MST3K version of the movie, and this review includes minor spoilers. <br /> <br /> When I watched this movie, it looked as if it would be possible to have a cute sci-fi movie, but the more I watched it, the more disappointing it is. The first reason is pretty idiosyncratic. I enjoyed the mules shy girl with glasses much more than the model that Wanda became at the end of the movie. More deeply, it was the fact that the loss of glasses and change in clothes replaced any real character growth. Instead of growing into a character that could take care of herself, Wanda was just as dependent on men as she did for her as she was at the beginning of the movie. The acting could have been better (though I was tired of cracking over Ireland's voice - they were even in the movie itself! It's not that bad.) The background was okay, but it was a bit hokey (strangers = people with face muscle). and could have used more explanation. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it was just that I was interested in the movie itself, but Joel and the bots did little to me. The movie might have been better. <br /> <br /> Overall (for the movie itself, not the MST3K), a 3 out of 10. It was a great movie, for what it was.
