For this movie, based on a television program, and a serious final. I thought it was a bad way to end a serious one. 'M * A * S * H ​​goodbye, farewell, and Amen' was pretty good, but not this one. Unless you really like the series (like myself), this movie is over. <br /> <br /> I was a loyal fan of the show, even Stevens, but the plot was too gimmicky and Dave Coulier, man, that man didn't. They didn't have to use Tim Meadows, he is a good actor, but he was too good for the script. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was pure cheese. I'll give it a 4.5 / 10
