I hated it. I hate self-conscious pretentious ignorance that masks as art. This movie is either stupid or stupid. After the first half hour, I quickly held the DVD version and saw the same young shennigans over and over. I was angry that I spent hard-earned money on sophomoric clap stairs. Tinting drift in sepia or blue does not make a movie, let alone art.
