Ocean's 12 starts on annoying and gets worse from there. Like a well-known award offering, every major actor / actress is depicted in short 60 scenarios that apparently cease to have a blinking "applaud now" sign. The first 60 minutes of the film is incredibly weakened, poorly edited, and sometimes, completely unrelated to the story and confusing. Talk about the story, there is one, kinda ... but it's hardly visible to all the "look at me" shots and cameos. Only Matt Damon was actually "acting" in this movie ... the rest of the cast apparently only existed to participate in a rat-pack-wanna session. As for the heist, the action, the drama .... it was in the last 8-10 minutes of the movie and was pathetic and anticlimactic. Awful! Awful! Awful!
