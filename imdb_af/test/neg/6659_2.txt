Extremely bad! I don't expect much from Garcia, as he is one of the most overstated actors today, but Keaton really had to know that this movie would suck and come out while he could (not that I love him, but hey, he has batman). <br /> <br /> In one scene, Keaton is transferred to a hospital and a Hannibal Lecter type face mask worn when two attack dogs bark on him (dogs can know evil you know) and Keaton grows back on them and makes back and whisper with their tails between their legs. Has the movie comedy right there? Garcia makes a fool out of himself in a dialogue with dialogue. Only a complete retard can probably be found and the child is too irritating to feel sorry for. <br /> <br /> If you are going to make a movie with such a poor plot like that, you need charm, humor, a solid action. Take Die Hard for example, which is good despite its pretty crazy plot. <br /> <br /> Although Keaton's character was joking, I drove all the way. I wanted to see Garcia crying over his dead child and Keaton sucked martini on a paradise island. This movie makes a good laugh. Watch it with a witty friend and you can have fun as this movie is recommended in almost every scene for wisdom cracks. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's an insult to your intelligence and a huge waste of money. Greed made this movie and thank God for making his own ass.
