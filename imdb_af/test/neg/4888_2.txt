No shortage of female flesh, but still not interesting! Lenzi is at least able to start as far as possible at Spasmo and start with Kiss Me Kill Me <br /> <br /> The Hard Gore R2 DVD edition can be cut at 86 minutes, but this movie has one act of cannibalism and one victim - a scene with an indigenous girl who is broken and escaped by the cannibal tribes, after which we are warned and later burned to some huts. Arsonist Holocaust? Firestarter Fernox someone? <br /> <br /> Certainly not a cannibal flick, but was there ever a decent one made? Avoid.
