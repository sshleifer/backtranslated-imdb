Am I the only one who thought the point of this movie was graphic violence? I didn't know anything about Leigh Scott when I rented it and wouldn't have done that if I knew most of his previous films were horror movies. I'm not at all, I just expected an informative docudrama from the 9/11 report. <br /> <br /> Instead, I got an almost incomprehensible, violent movie. The only good thing for me was that it made me read to read the report, to find out what the movie was about. <br /> <br /> I wrote it because I'm shocked that we've become so immune to violence in movies and on TV, that it wasn't even worth commenting on the bloggers whose reviews I read do not have.
