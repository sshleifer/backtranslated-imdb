(This review is based on the English version) <br /> <br /> Orson Welles's legendary unfinished epic was just that - unfinished. It had to be left as such, not thrown together in this awkward, boring composition of any material available. <br /> <br /> While making sure that this was done with the best of intentions, the filmmakers not only neglected to do Welles's vision, they also managed to discredit it through this version on audience to bring. <br /> <br /> The first thing the viewer strikes is the amateur quality of the sound. Not only are the newly-voiced voices rather poor performances, they are also inconsistent. Welles' original recordings (with his own voice, as he often did) are preserved in a handful of scenes, and they do not agree at all. There was not the slightest attempt at consistency. Add to that an extremely empty sound mix that has only a minimal sound effect and atmosphere - a long drive during a big festival (including the bulls), sounds like it was recorded in a deserted suburban street with about three people making Die sound of a crowd intended to be in the thousands. <br /> <br /> The real problem, however, is the inevitable fact that 'Don Quixote' was incomplete, and it is obvious to look at it. The film is made up of a handful of scenes that are constricted and pulled out to ridiculous lengths just to ease the running time. Case in point - the order where Sancho is looking for Don Quixote in the city forever. It's just Sancho who approaches people in the crowd and asks them the same questions over and over. There is no way Welles ever intended to use it in its entirety, but that is what appears here. It takes more than twelve minutes, where it would probably last about two minutes of absolute maximum in a properly completed version of the movie. <br /> <br /> While the beginning of the movie was relatively complete and reasonably well done, the rest have massive holes that simply cannot be filled with endless overloads of the Spanish countryside and even more shots of Don Quixote & Sancho go back and forth. There is no end either. No resolution, no conclusion, no punchline, no point. <br /> <br /> Although there are private collections that were not available to the filmmakers, it could not be possible to explain what would be needed to complete it in a coherent work. Welles simply didn't shoot, mainly because his chief actor died before they could finish. <br /> <br /> However, the fact that it was not completed could never be one would think it was just enough to see just a collection of footage from this masterpiece. Unfortunately, putting it all in such a cunning way, there is a very negative impression of the film in general. In particular, that was clearly a tremendous performance by Akim Tamiroff as Sancho was completely devastated with the new voice and with long stretched scenes that eventually made him just annoying. <br /> <br /> Orson Welles's vision for this movie was somewhat more ambitious and complicated than a simple repetition of Don Quixote's story, but that is what has been attempted here, and so the point is lost. The only person who had all the material in everything that could be worthwhile would have been Welles himself, and he didn't. <br /> <br /> The material could be much better used in a documentary chronicle of Welles' entire saga trying to make the movie. Welles himself even got the perfect title for such a doco: "When are you going to finish Don Quixote?"
