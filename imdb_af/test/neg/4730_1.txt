Mmmm, a previous summary, says: "If you like strangers and predators, you'll enjoy this movie." I couldn't disagree anymore. This film does not pay respect for its weighty lineage and has reduced two of the best loved sci fi strands to little more than a teenage horror slasher movie, it does not have the tension or incidents present in previous alien or predatory movies and there is no noticeable main character, I really didn't care about any of the characters and I was in a good mood to see the stereotypical casting die as soon as possible. if possible in the vain hope, something better they would replace, it really requires superhuman incompetence to ever have invented two of the most terrifying creatures, failing to make a pleasant, exciting movie. Just look at it if you want to see how NOT to do it. .
