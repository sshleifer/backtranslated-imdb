The movie was a pleasure to see if you are a fan of the Stooges. The story is told from Moe Howard's point of view and his relationships with his brothers Shemp and Jerome (Curly) Howard, also the lifelong friendship with Larry Fine. The movie deals mainly with the high-and-point cameras of the Stooges multi-decade career. The decisive director and makeup artist did a good job of finding actors who looked like the well-known ensemble. The actor playing "Curly" Howard did a good job of portraying the on-camera antics of the most beloved Stooge. A must see for any fan of Three Stooges shorts.
