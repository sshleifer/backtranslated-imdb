I just realized why the colors and sets in "Sakuran" were so flashy and fun, and just painful to look at. The story is about a high-class prostitute known as an oiran in Japanese. Their kimono was always shimmering and gaudier than other kimono so the oiran would stand out. But the director, Mika Ninagawa, had to make sure that the director stretched even more than the main character, or even the story. <br /> <br /> What Anna Tsuchiya did in the movie just gave me the creeps. You can't call it. It was nothing but catering to her collapsible high school girl base. Hey Anna, good luck on the one you get older. Yes, right, an oiran as a rough and vulgar, prone to violence, biker chick. Haven't we already seen you portray this character in a more appropriate movie? <br /> <br /> The story was painfully boring and predictable. What is the story of "Sakuran"? A silly bitch is always true to herself, it's just that: a stupid bitch. She finds it inexplicable that men are attracted to her and that she has an inexplicable ability to manipulate men and becomes a successful high-class prostitute even though she speaks and acts as if she were a member of a female biker gang. This so-called seductive ability of her is spoken, but we never see it in action, probably because of the dissatisfaction of the main handicap-cup, I mean actress. <br /> <br /> The main character of the movie makes a rich and powerful man angry with her because she is waiting for him while serving a much lower client. Not very annoying, is it? How can such a woman ever become an oiran? Oh, because the previous one killed her and the house needed a whore that could claim a high price. Who would pay a high price for a slut so cheap? Rumors come around. How can there be no repercussions for what she did to the powerful man? Because the scriptwriters are crazy. They just made a lot of shit. <br /> <br /> Then an even more rich and powerful man falls for her (why?) And she throws him over to a strange guy who is generally cold and far from her, but respects who she really is is (which doesn't make sense. How can anyone respect someone so worthless?). <br /> <br /> As if right, it's like the director clung and has a great psychedelic color on the aesthetics, culture and society of the Edo era. What about such things as sabi, mono not aware, wabi, subtle, elegance, a rigid hierarchical society? Everybody shoots up by a director who comes down as a senseless, nouveau-rich couple. The unbelievable thing is that so many other Japanese people have watched this movie, taken down the director, and took pounding spoons from this burning smelly shit and shouted how good it was. <br /> <br /> Argentine tango music with violin and bandoneon as a backdrop for the Edo era when Japan was completely isolated from the international world (except the 3.7 hectare Dejima)? Why not just Anna, the bad-ass biker, answer her phone, and the rich and powerful daimyo character drives in a physical fit in his red Ferrari? The music we had to listen to was crooked and anachronistic (the same as the art design). <br /> <br /> Nearly the end I liked that there were only two or three small flowers on the sacred Christmas tree. But earlier, the second she said she would leave the quarter when bleeding, we all knew exactly what would happen. How boring, to telegraph the end so clearly. But what is the point of the old tree that is bleeding? The rich and powerful man has already blossomed the pleasure quarter into cherry blossoms like the Yoshino mountains in the spring. It didn't impress her at all? No, of course not. I already know about whores. The guys who treat them nicely are kicked in the balls. Perhaps it is the whores who commit people to make people idealize when they themselves know the truth of who they are: just cheap and worthless. <br /> <br /> Considering the director's obsession with goldfish, the second to last scene of a goldfish on a veranda had accidentally hit. Two fish are tumbling in a stream they leave to escape outside the walls of the pleasure quarter, while goldfish are stuck in their troughs and cannot survive outside (just like the denizen's relationship with the pleasure quarter). Otherwise, the talk of the goldfish has no meaning. <br /> <br /> In the final scene, the cherry trees were full of flowers, but the shortness of the flowers is one thing special for cherry blossoms. I couldn't help thinking that soon enough dusk would wipe away all the soft pink color and warmth of the scene. The sky would quickly go out of shade hands, into an eternal storey, and fall the night. It will get cold, very cold. And dark. It wasn't really a happy ending, was it? Romantic Love (in the Edo Period) Can survive in the face of terrible poverty and be delayed for as long as cherry trees bloom. Maybe a few days, unless it rained sooner. But the unimaginable romantic love we see here? His existence in this period is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Anna Tsuchiya walks in her shoes? She couldn't do it. Literally. Look at the scene of her "promenade" where she apparently puts on the right shoes, but she must hold on to the old man's shoulder to keep her turban. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give it two stars for the art movement, but then I realized what it was all about. Sick domination on the part of the director. Those colors and sets are just like the director shouts: "I'm the most important one here! Me! It's all about me !!!!"
