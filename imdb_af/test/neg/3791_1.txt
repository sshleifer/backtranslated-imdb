Terrible writing, directing and acting! The author / director portrayed Southerners, especially the South African law enforcement as ignorant, backwoods, homophobic and racist (a very popular but ignorant, stereotype, which the film industry would like to survive). Acting (or overworking) and writing occurred amateur and low budget. The plot line is the same old, old, Hollywood story of the average racist and homophobic rednecks that are eventually defeated by the enlightened people of Newwold Yoke Ceety. <br /> <br /> I was educated in the small Louisiana town where this film was filmed and looking forward to the movie, but was immediately disappointed in the first few minutes of the movie. The start of the movie shows a gay bar in the "swamps" of Louisiana. How ridiculous a concept! There are many gays and gay bars in Southern Louisiana, but no gay bars in the "swamps" or small towns of Louisiana. We are then announced to the sheriff who uses the phrases "homuh-sex'l" in the worst southern draw and exaggerated performance ever. Then there is the scene where the local police watch porn on duty in the police station. I could continue with the terrible stocking activity or the outdated stereotypes or ridiculous scenes. <br /> <br /> This director and his crew have been welcomed in this small, friendly town and have shown true southern hospitality. The townspeople of the Arthur Lake, and the state of Louisiana, had to be insulted and demolished only in the final editing. The good people of the Arthur Lake were excited and welcomed by the fact that Hollywood was in town, because they did not know that they would eventually be portrayed as ignorant, racist, and homophobic land-locked in a low-budget amateur movie went to DVD. My advice: Skip this one or watch Cinemax late at night if it ever makes their rotation.
