A good example of reversed, politically correct racism where white men are offered senseless brutes, who are just there to be murdered and their indigenous adversaries as noble heroes, better than their appearance and abilities. Apart from the fact that the story becomes excessively dull, it also prevents the neutral viewer from being able to identify with one way or another - that is just to simplify. The recurring score is incredibly annoying (like the voice over), the characters have no depth and the viewer is quickly lost between questions such as "who is this character" and "what hell is meant to mean". Photography is wonderful, and overall there is a lot of atmosphere, but beautiful shots of misty landscapes alone, save this movie. The DVD box uses Kiefer Sutherland as an eye catcher. In fact, his character could be played by somebody else, as it is basically just an empty shell (like most non-Maori characters) and in any case disappears halfway through the movie. But if you're keen to see Jack Bauer in a kilt, it's your kind of movie ...
