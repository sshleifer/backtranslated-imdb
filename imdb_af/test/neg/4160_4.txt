*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> I saw this movie last night at a show. I've already started with Tim Robbins and love sci-fi. The first third of the movie was very cool. The score was good, the movies were interesting, the filmmaker's vision of the future was realistic and yet interesting. I remember remembering to myself: "This is the most intelligently created sci-fi movie I have already seen." Then they couldn't keep it together. <br /> <br /> Although there were a number of "rough around the edges" with this movie from the beginning (namely, editing, and later some of the writing / plot development), these issues were forgiven. They became unforgivable as soon as the movie lost its momentum, and then the movie just got boring when you realized it wasn't going to go. <br /> <br /> Robbins couldn't breathe life into his character, but did the best he could. His female counterpart (her name escapes me now) was good in her role. <br /> <br /> The main reason for the twist of the movie was that the filmmakers could not decide whether they were a sci movie or a futuristic love story. They also didn't end. <br /> <br /> Good: <br /> <br /> Some of the cinematography: grit, sometimes feels a few days later. <br /> <br /> Great for a futuristic movie like this. <br /> <br /> I dug some of the location shots. <br /> <br /> The music was cool. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers' vision of the future was realistic but still cool and interesting. <br /> <br /> I like the interactions with the other little characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the writing was interesting (early). <br /> <br /> The girl Maria Gonzales played (name can't remember), she was good. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS UNDER *** <br /> <br /> A few questions / comments: <br /> <br /> I felt that many of the futuristic things in this movie was convenient to fix a patchwork story. Namely viruses. It is clear that the virus they gave at the end of the film that made her physically "scared" was just there so that they could live in another sex scene and then she could report him uncontrollably for Code 46. take them away and wipe out his memory and end the movie. Classic 'dream order' cop-out ends when you ask me. Tie all the loose points very neatly if you just make it dream? <br /> <br /> Was Robbin's character obviously good like intuition or was it the virus? Why didn't "They investigate the many issues around the girl who is a clone of his mother? It could have made an interesting story. <br /> <br /> Initially, I love the greetings of everyone in the speech. But it became intrusive, especially because their accents were not convincing. I get it, the future will undoubtedly be racially and culturally more androgynous, but it started out as an AT&T Global Networking brand. If they were outside, how could they have gotten it? Busted for Code 46? <br /> <br /> "Cover" was never well defined. Sometimes it was as trivial as a Visa, and other times it was as vital as life or death. Again, loose definitions allow them to use it to paste the diverse parts of the plot together. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm starting to get negative about it so I'll stop. There were some cool scenes, and interesting things about this movie, but it only gives a 4/10
