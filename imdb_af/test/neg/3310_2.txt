Great music, but aren't these people pathetic? A true period of The Trippy Sixties, and it left me depressed. The director paints the wrong side of the jet set life and it bumps like a horn. If the culture of the time led people to do these things, it seems to me that it was all a journey of no discovery, just despair. I really tried to keep this movie, but these people are not everywhere on my page. Yes, it would be nice to see the world, go away for a while, but I always plan on coming back. Drugs are not the cause of these characters' decline, it's their communities? These guys passionately drink their cup of poison. They buy their lives well, and eventually, make the journey that is life cheap. Are romances ever so dark? <br /> <br /> Cheers: Interesting scenery. Wonderful soundtrack by Pink Floyd. <br /> <br /> Caveats: Dated. Drugs. Depressing. Thoroughly unlikely characters; They are not flower children. <br /> <br /> Just for the curious, as most packages swoon the Pink Floyd. (Rare Floyd tracks that many people have never heard, because FM is not what it was.) <br /> <br /> Rating: Two stars.
