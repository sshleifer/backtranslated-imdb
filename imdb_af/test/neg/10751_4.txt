Low-budget murder mystery about a public defender trying to beat his client from a murder was found guilty of 12 years earlier. Complicating things is the fact that he escaped oversight after his conviction, but the PD believes the man is innocent of the murder and work to find the right murderer. Gig Young like the PD is ok, and James Anderson as the convict is actually pretty good, but the picture as a whole only gets along with little tension, and despite some good character factors in the movie, the performances are usually lower. Director George Archainbaud was apparently more homemade westerners - this time he raced against Gene Autry's TV series in Columbia - but even if he tried to inject any liveliness into this picture, the hack script would have defeated his efforts. . The best movie is the movie climb with a courtroom scene that is straight from an episode of Perry Mason and is just as predictable.
