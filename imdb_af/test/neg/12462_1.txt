As a rule, I try to find as much in movies as I possibly can enjoy. I made no exceptions to "Tart" and did my best to appreciate it. But no attempt, no matter how big, might redeem this zealous excuse for a movie. <br /> <br /> It has failed for several reasons. First, cinematography was pointless and ineffective. Secondly, the script reached depths of 'poor' that achieved it well and beyond the 'bad' good 'category. Thirdly, the acting, left wise return that was won - it was a pity, it was really. Anyone who saw Mischa Barton (seen as the remarkable terrible Grace, a character so badly invented and realizing that Ja Ja Binks doesn't look that much), like Devon in John Duigan's "Lawn Dogs" will wonder what went wrong between now and now. Perhaps, if she had a character she had trouble with, and a modicum of direction, she could at least give this reason for the movie a salvation function. Oh, so this was not the case. Lastly, the film had no meaning, nothing to express, nothing to reach. Really, I wonder why Christina Wayne bothered. <br /> <br /> "Tart" made a poor effort to be something, and failed. The result - a movie, unfortunately, so bad that it is very, very bad. Don't bother - it's really not worth it.
