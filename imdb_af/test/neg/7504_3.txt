In the near future, a dark stranger walks in a southern American city plagued by zombies. The establishment of a group of friendly face residents, our stranger, teaches the harsh realities of city life. There are two groups of people; The upper classes, which live safely behind the concrete walls of the city, are provided by the state police at the right price. Then there are our friendly face residents. These lower class people live next to the zombies. There are only survivors to exchange goods that they tackle during the day, with the police in exchange for lunch boxes. Our stranger finds out why his world is plagued by zombies. A new diet pill that suppressed the urge for carbohydrates was the foundation. The desire of the human race to shed fat has resulted in the fall of society as we know it. These pills have increased the desire for protein, ie meat, even the pet poultry. However, there was one more serious side, and after death, people with an even stronger urge for proteins, namely human flesh, responded. <br /> <br /> With what I feel is an imaginative introduction, I felt that this film realizes inventive material. What better way can explain the cause of the zombie race than by a contemporary idea of ​​people's desire to make any sacrifice to change their body without the hard work of the gym? However, the imagination of this movie soon stopped after this exposition. This film falls in the old fall of 'I can't imagine how the world will be when society collapses'. If you look at this movie, you won't escape to another world like you do if you look at Planet of the Apes (original), Alien, Mad Max or Texas Chain Saw (original). In this film, the alternative society is defined by people with hair-colored orange and green. Face painting and charity leather jackets. There is no sickness about life in this alternative society, just healthy faces and over-made zombies. Movies should allow you to escape, and do not remember wiping your wardrobe and fetching your old patches to the charity shop. <br /> <br /> Forget about some of the pitiful acting or the overtaken zombies. This movie fails because it is polished, too friendly and too predictable. I've watched movies like this since the early eighties. If you are going to make a movie of this nature, I suggest you see movies like Dawn or The Dead (original and remake), Threads or Fulci's Zombie to see and experience the despair of a devastated society.
