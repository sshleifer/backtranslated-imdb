Pure schlock from start to finish. The average age of 12 may find it an interesting discrimination. Otherwise, this is a pure campsite endurance test. Like one of those so-so Star Trek The Next Generation episodes that think it's important to say. <br /> <br /> You will see that each plot turns a mile into this by-the-numbers hull. However, it is worth seeing for the depiction of drunken prostitutes, a brothel where young women pay old men to have sex with them (how about rollover) and lesbian soap operas. The ghost of Valerie Solanis lives!
