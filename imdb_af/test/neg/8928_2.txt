Star count: ***** Jodie Marsh **** Michelle Marsh *** Kym Marsh ** Rodney Marsh * Hackney Marsh <br /> <br /> Harlan Banks (Steven Seagal - not quite as bad an actor as Kevin Costner but ....... aaaaahhhh, you get it) is a modern Robin Hood (listen now, you can hear Brian Adams music playing in the background ... no, not really), the kind of guy who steals bad blood money from drug dealers and use it to keep orphanages open. But now he's approached a trip in a Las Vegas elevator in one of those last things before retirement work. But, of course, it's all wrong and he blows the patsy for the big guys in and out of jail. Here he meets a man named (although you will not know to pay attention to the movie) Ice Cool (Treach), with which he forms a friendship and eventually goes out of prison. As soon as he is free, he is proving his innocence, finding the missing money, and of course getting along with those who have adapted him! <br /> <br /> From all of Seagal's recent straight to video films, today you look dead. Most of it is in a theater, even with a rapster as his co-star such as his previous film films Half-Past Death and Exit Wounds. Yes, he doesn't seem to be making films about caring for the environment, but as if he's black and co-starring with rappers. But TIME is not a movie and it is a luxury. The Great One will never enjoy again until Under Siege 3 materialize (as ever!) <br /> <br /> The movie opens with a smooth, seasoned look that commands attention, but everything goes fast from there . As soon as Seagal imprisons, the plot loses its coherence quickly. In fact, the character of Treach seems to come out of nowhere without any introduction as its sidekick and from there you quickly lose interest in it. <br /> <br /> That's it. I know I said it before, but I think I mean it this time. I don't think I will give any of these straight to Seagal movies anytime. I honestly have no enthusiasm to watch Shadow Man smoothly. In fact, I can honestly say that I didn't really enjoy any of his STV movies, and today you're definitely not an exception, an apathetic, boring effort that is best avoided. *
