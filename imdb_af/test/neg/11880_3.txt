What a stupid waste of money! 30,000 square foot rebuilt ancient Rome, 2 million cubic meters 50 foot tall buildings, 10,000 costumes, 2 year work, an International Antique History Committee (sic!), Some first-class actors and actresses. The final result? An empty TV movie for a single-digit IQ attendance.
