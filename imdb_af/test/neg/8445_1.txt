WARNING: I advise anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet to read this comment. <br /> <br /> If you plan to watch this movie, DO NOT! I warn you ... this movie is VERY boring and basically scary, not similar to the Horror movie, to watch. I got this Piranha movie for another Piranha movie and when I noticed I was making a mistake, I decided to look at this one anyway. I wish I didn't. This movie is so horrible and so unbearable in every piece of material I couldn't bother to let someone say this movie was halfway. For one thing, this movie should be called a Boring Talk About Wilderness instead of Piranha. They only agree with piranhas! At the same time, the way this movie was so bad I just fell asleep for 20 minutes. At the end my mouth was wide open and I barely looked at the white TV screen. It is a VERY poorly directed and poorly filmed junk that I feared that I had brain dysfunction after watching it.
