OK, so I know better than watching movies on sciFi. . . There, sorry. . . SyFy. Of shifafa. Or whatever it is. So sue me. I advised my entire board on Saturday for a non-profit organization. I can be forgot to flop in my armchair and would like to see a movie I have never seen, rather than reading Proust in the original or learning how to play the guy. <br /> <br /> What I want to say, I didn't deserve excavations. Of which I have seen nothing. Was there any? Did I fall asleep? Why is it called? <br /> <br /> Some icky visuals. Not many scares. As with too many movies in modern horror films, no reasons are given - apart from shared humanity - to care about any of these people. A half point for the idle entrepreneur, who was clich√©d but has a good scene. <br /> <br /> It's all kind of plays like Final Destination delivered by a board game. The game has an interesting look and it is one of my favorite old confrontations. I'll give it so much. The downside is that the game has more personality than most characters. <br /> <br /> For the end, if you don't see it, I think you've fallen asleep. Somewhere back at the beginning of the genre.
