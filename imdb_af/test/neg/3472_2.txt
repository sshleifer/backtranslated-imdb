For a good take on the Roman Empire watch the excellent BBC produced miniseries "I, Claudius". It just sucked. The play was pathetic and you can almost see the actors watching the camera. Hans Matheson was annoying. Cheese factor was so high that it promoted constipation with repeated views. Even Caligula was soft. I think this film is quietly supported by "religious" groups that will remain nameless;). The overt sounds of Christian liberation and persecution were blatant if it gave a hint. Stay away from what you ever do - the running time is so long that I could read Harry Potter's first book faster than the time it took to see these trips. <br /> <br /> Italy did better - don't let Hans cute face you. He's not a good actor ... he's a big drill.
