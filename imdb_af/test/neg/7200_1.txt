I absolutely hated this movie! I was 9 when I saw it. This is the only movie I've ever walked into the theater. My mom, dad, and I all looked at each other during the movie and knew we were wasting our time. This movie stole about 45 minutes from my life. Everything about it was ridiculous. The whole premise was too distorted. To be 9, I was always easy to entertain. This movie proved that I could do nothing and still entertained me.
