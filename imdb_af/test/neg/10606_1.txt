To be a fan of the series, I thought, how bad can the movie be? Well, I got my answer. Some movies should never be made. Why call it a remake of the series as the only similarities are that there are three main characters. The Pete character in the series was not a little baby as depicted in the movie. The only good thing in this movie next to the music and that Clare Danes is beautiful is that it was short. What about the dance scene ??? The only reason I didn't go out of this movie was because it was so bad that it was funny. Maybe it was the plan! It's really bad when a cheap 60's TV show is better than a 90-year-old $ 20 million movie. El Mariachi only costs $ 7,000 and is a much better movie. Don't even waste your money if it's tied up, it's not even worth renting.
