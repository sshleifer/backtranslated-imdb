I want to say that with these expectations I went too much to the movie. I thought it was going to be funny, because it was the successor to Bruce Almighty who was really funny and that was Steve Carell's star, an excellent comic actor, but boy, sucked it. <br /> <br /> The movie is advertised as a sequel, but it has nothing to do with the original, since only the people who regroup their roles are Morgan Freeman and Steve Carell, but Steve's character is completely different. He is no longer the yoke. He's in the first one. He's a good guy. . The story is different and the actors are different and it's not funny. <br /> <br /> All the actors involved (Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Wanda Sykes, John Goodman, Ed Helms and even Jon Stewart in a very crazy way) have talent but none of them seem to use it and it looks like the movie is just for the money. <br /> <br /> Now, of course, the plot is shaped to Noah's story, but there are so many wrong things with it, I don't know where to start. I think the big problem is that in everyone around Evan he thinks he's crazy despite all the things that happen to him, he grows a big white beard over two days, he gets help from animals from around the world. He is building a huge bow in a few weeks, in real life people will not mock this guy, they will say he is the new Noah. <br /> <br /> Also, the special effects are good, but what the hell is the biggest movie flood ever filmed in Evan Almighty? Did they really have to waste such good special effects as filler for this crappy movie. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey seems to be a clever guy because he has three of the worst successes ever made, son of the Mask, Dumb and Dumb and now Evan Almighty. <br /> <br /> It was a huge disappointment and Tom Shyadac should be ashamed.
