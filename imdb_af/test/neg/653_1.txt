Ren√© Zellweger is brilliant, but the rest of the movie just doesn't work. It's like a hamburger jello molding - interesting idea, but who ever thought it would really work on film? I like director LaBute's two previous films - they were mercilessly honest and chilling funny. This movie only manages to be merciless and chilling - with jumbo popops of the tracks. (As a high concept, think: Doris Day-Rock Hudson movie Sam Peckinpah may have made it - now reduce your expectations of matching the current mass-product state of Hollywood.) These actors like talented Freeman, Kinnear, Eckhart, Vince , and Janney ALMOST makes their scenes alive, is proof of the tremendous talent of their talents to come across material that just doesn't coincide. I would have found Freeman's funny, feel-good-about-self speech at the end of the film (in a Lynchean way) if it was not for the disturbing suspicion that this unquestionable moral is supposed to be seriously accepted. do not become.
