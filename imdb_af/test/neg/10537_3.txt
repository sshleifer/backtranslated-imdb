It's a very bad action movie for various reasons. First of all, Seagal is terribly out of shape. He looks old and fat, plays as if he has to observe an annoying obligation and his fighting scenes require creative editing or ordinary replacement. Second, his opponent is a very bad villain. It's about a smart and mean masterbrain and chestnut deliver. So how about the action? Well, the two parties are shooting each other permanently in different places of the Alcatraz prison. They shoot wild and bad, because compared to the amount of ammunition needed, body figures are quite low. There is nothing to save this movie. There is not a single good line and not a single good joke. The small psychological interlude with 49er One and Judge McPherson is ridiculous. So what does it have? Well, the ordinary Bell helicopters, blue lights and slow moving motion, doors with dots and 1000 Watt lights shining through the holes, characters jumping through the air as they shoot, many weapons come from nowhere, ' a long black dress that has a fat black man and a thin wooden box containing 25 tons of gold. The pain lasts to the last, a hopeless approach to alleviate the final credits. California sailor Don Michael Paul was writing and directing. This mountain of boredom at least comes from just one simple mind.
