Yeeee-Haa! <br /> <br /> I saw that it is claimed that most American movies are cowboy movies in disguise; that Hollywood is so in love with his only true original creation that it reinvents the cowboys. I'm not sure I buy the argument completely, but Slipstream is proven to support the theory; It's a cowboy movie with planes. <br /> <br /> It's actually one better than that. It's a Spagetti Western with planes! Replace the planes with horses, make the Android a priest and this movie will be indistinguishable from any of a dozen Italian Spanish semi-art shoot-ups with pretensions of the Seventies. <br /> <br /> The movie wasn't spoiled because I learned to believe in some of the reviews I read here, but it was definitely not good.
