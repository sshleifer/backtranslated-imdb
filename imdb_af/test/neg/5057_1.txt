Sorry for any spoilers it contains. But if you want to read anyway: I really wonder why so many people are so high on Kevin Williamson. Let's look at his work as a script writer, will we? There are Scream 1 and 2 (plus the story for the next one), which I think is pretty funny but much overestimated. In addition, Scream has made a franchise, and has ceased to become a parody of horror movies and just become another one. Then I know what you did last Saturday, which is actually the same movie. He wrote Halloween jointly: H20, but even he had the point not to take credit for what he did on that monstrosity. Then come The Faculty, which I can only say, was God-fearing. (Very fun to make). Don't even start me on the ridiculous, soap operative Dawson's Creek. I can trace how bad it is for hours. So then we come to Mrs. Tingle. First, there are tons of little disabilities in this one. For example, in most high schools I know, the valedictorian is NOT the only one to go to college! This idea that Katie Holmes's character would never go unless she was valedictorian was absurd. Have you never heard of financial help, it's a shame? Also, I don't think you're being expelled from high school or getting into college because you've been cheating on one test. There are a lot of others, but I will hit the big one now. The end really bothered me: they committed a crime, but it was good because the teacher was a bitch. Great. Do you know how many of my teachers I can abduct on that logic? I'm sure the police never made any statements to find out the whole story. It probably won't be necessary. Helen Mirren was good, she added a nice flair to a character who, as a previous commentator noticed, had NO reason for anything she did. And has anyone else noticed that Katie Holmes can't act at all? Her self-righteousness has become incredibly annoying. "You wanted me to fail. Blah blah blah. ' Her last two scenes with Mrs. Tingle was the worst. The only reason I didn't regret losing $ 8.25 to this disaster is because she's been a little hit. No, wait, I'm sorry to lose the money: it wasn't real, and she survived. Mr. Williamson, if you read it, you made the same movie (some violence and / or scary things being offset by wise children who make sarcastic jokes and references to other movies) are just too many times (I count 6 so for, not including Scream 3 and whatever follows, and I would really appreciate it if you stopped. Otherwise I can just kidnap you and threaten you with a crossbow. Ok? :-)
