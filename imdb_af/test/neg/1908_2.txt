All I have to say is one word ... SUCKS !!!!. The only reason I gave it a 2 is because Josh Hartnett was in it and he's cool. Would that little boy's ass hit ... silly stupid and brainless. By the end of this movie you can't stand Klein and don't really care what Leelee does. Hartnett was the only good thing about it.
