I can't understand why many people hate it. <br /> <br /> This movie includes many of the overlapping institutions of the historical and biblical epics of the fifties using solid pieces, props and costumes similar to those seen in other movies. Here, however, the story attempts to run throughout human history, with a trial of humanity being put to the test, with a guilty verdict which means that h-bombs will go from all over the world. The prosecutor is the devil, with Vincent Price, with refugees. Okay, so it's a little hokey that the defender calls "The Spirit of All Men", but I think it's one of those things that gives this movie a sense of period charm. The Spririt of the Man, in his last role by Ronald Coleman, is played almost well. It is also the last movie in which Groucho, Harpo and Chico Marx all appear, but not together. Groucho plays Peiter Minuet who buys Manhattan from the Indians, in a scene played purely for campy humor. Chico is not funny at all as a monk who thinks the world is flat, and Harpo, we are told, is meant to be Isaac Newton, to discover gravity. Most other performances are well done. <br /> <br /> Other hokey things are that the trial is likely to take place in outer space, depicted as a cloud and blue world. There is something called "The Great Clock of the Outer Space", which at the point of midnight may indicate the end of the world. <br /> <br /> But in his heart the film addresses the problems of WMDs and the eternal question of whether humans are basically good, or basically angry; and put it in what I think is an interesting way. Also, anyone who likes the look of costumes of the fifties should look like this movie.
