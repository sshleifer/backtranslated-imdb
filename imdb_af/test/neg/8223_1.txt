Garden State was at best a mediocre film. The film looks more like a compilation of thoughts that the author (Zach Braff) had, rather than a coherent story. The unfounded plot may have been more gripping if not caught with inexorable scenes that were no more than "peculiar". Coincidentally, these scenes are often those that are transmitted in conversation. (Zack walks past the tap that turns on as he passes by, a crazy crazy party scene, calling over a gorge, the list goes on). <br /> <br /> The main character is flat, decaying and ultimately unlikely, which is most exhibited in the scene where he speaks to his father, even ignoring his father's problems, including a recent deceased woman, and about his own " What should I do with my life? "Problem. <br /> <br /> The movie ends when Andrew (Zach Braff) decides not to go back to LA because he can't tear him off the love of his life, Sam (Natalie Portman) for 2 days did not know. . What just might lead me to conclude that the message of the movie is that love at first sight cures the professional dilemmas ... Sure you can interpret it as a misapplication of priorities, but if so, it could had been better. Much better. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't know what it wants. A drama, a comedy, a teen desert movie or a spectrum of other things. I'm not saying this as a single genre-oriented person, but as a person who likes several genre pieces like those mastered by Stanley Kubrick. The reason I feel it doesn't work for Garden States, because rather than adding the genres together, it jumps around; one scene is a genre, the next one, and again so again. <br /> <br /> I heard that many people told me to cut Zach Braff a bit, it's his first feature film and he debuted as director, writer, and lead actor. Impressive as it was a first movie, I think he can do better with as much money as he has. There were much better first time film directors (Michel Gondry "Human Nature", David Gordon Green "George Washington"). Maybe if he was writing writing OR directing OR acting, it would have been better. Zach Braff is a talented artist, perhaps his second attempt will not be so boring.
