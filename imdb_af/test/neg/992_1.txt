at a Saturday matinee in my hometown. I went with an older friend (he was about 12) and my mom let me go because she thought the movie would be good (it's rated G). I was assaulted by loud music, STRANGE images, no plot and a stubborn refusal to make ANY sense. We walked halfway because we were bored, frustrated and hurt our ears. <br /> <br /> I saw it in a revival theater 22 years later. My opinion has changed - it's even WORSE! Basically everything I hated was still there and the movie was VERY 60's ... and badly dated. I have all the little jokes ... too bad, it wasn't funny. The constant shifts in the toes have quickly become irritating and there is absolutely nothing to get a firm grip on. Some people will like it. I found it frustrating. By the end of the movie I felt like throwing something heavy on the screen. <br /> <br /> Also, all the Monkees songs in this movie SUCK (and I love them). <br /> Only for ex-hippies ... or if you are stoned. I give it a 1.
