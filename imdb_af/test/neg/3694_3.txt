I like 50-year-old sci-fi movies. I like the really good things (like the day the earth was still founded, when the world collides, invaders and many others) and sometimes the bad people because they can be really funny and fun to watch with friends like plan 9 from outer space). However, when a scientific film is bad, but not bad enough to be fun, it really should be avoided. This movie is just such a movie. The posters make it look like a kind of sexy sybeest is attacking humanity, while the real plot is much less interesting. A woman is married to a woman. She is infected and starts to grow to a large size and decides to find this worm and kick its tail and it is about it. Also, many of the special effects really stink - especially the giant paper mache hand that comes into the room to grab the evil hubby.
