This movie was pretentious, dull and just not funny. The filming technique reminded me of MTV. I'm a fan of Hartley. But what does he think? So much more thought could have gone into this movie, considering the subject. It could have been a real theoretical battle over good and evil, but Hartley, the stand technique seems to be used to soul the viewer.
