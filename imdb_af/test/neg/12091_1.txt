***** SPOILERS ********* <br /> <br /> This movie was really awful. This woman deceives her employers from the beginning and even goes selfish to tear them apart. In the end you see her calling from the trade she learned from the pupil of her "pupil". I put the pupil in quotation marks because the governor never really wants to teach the child. She looks her hate and can't stand to be near her. I felt sorry for the little girl who just wanted to be loved, was absent that it was understandable that she would say and was just breaking things, but the viewer wasn't supposed to sympathize with the girl, the viewer was supposed to sympathize with the governor who hated her pupil and manipulated and misled her employers. I just couldn't do it. It wasn't the story of a self-made woman, rather, it was a window in the minds of one who used others at every opportunity without any other thought for anyone outside her own family. I couldn't stand the governor! It was a very horrible movie. I only paid one dollar to rent it, but even that was too much!
