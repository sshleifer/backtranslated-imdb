It could have been better, but it was good. It helped me get away from my boredom. I didn't want to see it, the only reason I wanted to rent it is because Jamie Martz is in it. He is an unknown actor but he shines and is the highlight of the movie ... the end was so terrible and the acting was good for ab movie ... i give it a 4 out of 10
