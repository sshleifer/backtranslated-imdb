Poor Jane Austen. This dog of a production does NOT make her wonderful tongue in the cheek novel any justice. Starting at the top ... poorly adjusted. The scriptwriter deserves extra lows to try - think about it, I don't know what she's been trying to do, but it's enough to say she missed the mark by years! Link it with all the overworking and terrible production values, this is one adaptation that would never have happened. It would have been much better if they just gave the money they poured into this flop and donated it to a worthy charity. Do yourself a favor, read the book. It is almost certain that you will enjoy it a thousand times more than trying out this turbulent production!
