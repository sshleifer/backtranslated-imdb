It's an old-dark-house movie. A young couple crawling around a strange cottage said it was being managed by Satan, where they walked from one bad crew to another: a distressed lady, a monkey, a monkey, a little lunch, looking for people, and (for some reason) two Chinese. They end up in a throne room where the hero has to play a "Price Is Right", like a game with seven steps with seven illuminated footprints. hence the title. For my taste it is too much of the same thing. The crawling corridors are amusing for a while and then repetitive. Compared to Harold Lloyd or Buster Keaton or Laurel and Hardy who do the same in two roles, it's not really funny. It's also not scary, and apparently wasn't meant to be: the household is too absurd. Most movies in this genre balance the comedy with a real threat, and usually two - one that leads the characters to believe is real, and the other is a cover for it. Here, the cover should not be taken seriously, nor is it covered. A few moments of fun come from the mix, but it's a lot of fun. The novel on which the film is based was a straightforward one and I think it could be played straight, and it can still be.
