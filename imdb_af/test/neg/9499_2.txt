I don't know where to start. Perhaps the whole idea of ​​this movie is just a disaster waiting to happen. There is nothing humorous about kidnapping. I don't know what was more offensive - the subject or David Arquette's "performance". It was as if a bull was being watched, it was cut off penis, although I think the bull feels better afterwards. The filmmakers need to find something about Sinatra other than his son's kidnapping to show (like, I don't know, she TALENT AS A SINGER !!!!). His family should not relive that horror. Thanks, GOD, it's just shown on HBO and not released in theaters. Please do not look if you have self-respect.
