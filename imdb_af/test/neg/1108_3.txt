As someone has already said that the living dead puppies were cute and if they came out as a new series of evil little things, I would buy one or two. Well, basically, this movie was dark, not in the vague sense, but I couldn't see very well. And it was boring. Three women in a house, the youngest did not go into the bush under any circumstances (well, it didn't sink) and it would have been better if the council had involved their death. And if no one does any cleaning or laundering or something, you will think a lot of cough will arise. A sexy young mom where you waste your time trying to determine her age (by my calculations 34 or 36). And it looked like it was more than 20 years since someone lived there, so what were the fathers' young adult photos on much older album? I'm so tired of clichés that just lazy, and here they come in thick and fast. Teens are stoned and drunk in the car and well, you know where it leads .... death and apparent deafness, because Tim seems unaware of his friends. I mean, I did a lot of driving a car where the driver's instructions didn't scream and I heard them. Cliché weird man in the forest nobody believes. Plumber who lives in them for years, and this is his first experience with these kids, so he drives along, he avoids a young daughter in the death of the night ... running him over your idiot! Cliché ... in a forest without having an idea of ​​where you are going, armed with the knowledge that the fence children (yes they are again) are out and about. Senseless scene the brutalization of pig ... why do so many directors see no problem with animal mortality and slaughter? I would have seen the kiddies much better and hit people on the thighs than that. Zombies don't seem to have that much energy in other movies. The villain, how ineffective was he? His big part was in the shop. He won and demanded to be served first. What one was not a popular man. Why not kill him before the family arrives and avoid filming or trying again. I give my points home, the forest and the little Goth Dollies, I want one!
