this western / musical / comedy is not one of the best of the genre I saw. I found it very slow. It just remained after the inevitable end. I also found it disjointed.i couldn't wait for it to be Randolph Scott is the leader here, and Lloyd Bridges is also star. But for me money, Edgar Buchanan is the best of the bunch. Buchanan appears in many Westerns in his day, which often offers comic relief as he does in this picture. . I also like Ann Dvorak as Rita. Otherwise, I can't think much about this movie. The film is based on a novel by Ernest Haycock, who also wrote the novel Stagecoach, in a movie of the same name in 1939, and again in 1966 and again in 1986. The 1939 version of Stagecoach is in me thoughts one of the best movies ever made. Anyway.as for Abilene Town, my voice is a 3/10
