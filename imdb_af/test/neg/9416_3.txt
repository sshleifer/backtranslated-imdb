Mario Van Peebles is trying to go the Jean-Claude Van Damme route and play an apostate robot soldier who is going to preserve AWOL to preserve himself, but the government won't. Under the simplistic plot of Van Peebles, residents of the rebel protect and defeat an improved version of himself in this disappointing movie. This blatant rip off Universal Soldier (which is much more fun than this) just goes nowhere. The biggest problem is that the movie is so incredibly inactive. Peebles are just waiting and there's just not enough donkey boots to justify viewing. On the other hand, the movie looks like a capable version of R.O.T.O.R, although where that deadly movie was hilarious, it laughs in some of its legally unconvincing action series. Also like R.O.T.O.R it does not make sense in his narrative and basically the film is terribly boring. Plus the villains are disappointingly poor and basically the movie needs a real action scenario to work, because the material is too boring. In all respects, Solo is a very poor movie. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of 4- (Poor)
