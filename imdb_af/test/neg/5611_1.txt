This movie has so much potential to be hilarious, but still moving, but also has very little impact. It had a good story line, it just wasn't as well done as it could have been. The strange "hallucinations" during his sleep scenes had absolutely no meaning and were definitely not necessary, they had no impact, nor did they understand or borrow. <br /> <br /> Jon Heder's character was OK, but could be expanded to more. He played the crappy he played at best. The character was funny, but again it didn't know what it could have been. <br /> <br /> Mila's character was perfect and her performance was on the point. <br /> <br /> Eventually the writing was terrible and more often than not, it didn't make sense and its hallucinations didn't fit the movie at all. This movie, with a better dissertation and directing, could be a national Lampoon's Vacation contender for funny, bad things happening to a person traveling on America. <br /> <br /> Instead, it was just worthy of a second "reel". If I had seen it at the theater, I would give back my money and book the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing this movie did was half an hour of my life. It also succeeded in making everyone involved in the movie look bad, simply because the movie was a stinker. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie to anyone! Ever!
