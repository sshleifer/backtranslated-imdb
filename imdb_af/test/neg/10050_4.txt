From time to time, it is highly advisable to watch the aristocracy with a silent film about the hard life of ordinary people to remind themselves of the privileges and the comfortable life they have enjoyed since the beginning of mankind or even before? compared to the complicated and hard work that ordinary people have to endure daily, as the aristocrats rule the world. <br /> <br /> And that's what happens in "The Love Light", the first film directed by Dame France Marion to be known later in the silent and talkie world, thank you for her work as a screenwriter; Better for her, definitely because her career as film director doesn't impress this German score. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of Dame Angela Carlotti (Lady Mary Pickford) a cheerful Italian girl surrounded by a "picturesque squalor" (an important disagreement between upper and lower classes; aristocrats prefer to to be surrounded by "picturesque luxury" ??); She has two brothers and a secret admirer, but all she gives him in return is indifference. Destiny starts working hard and soon soon war is declared and Dame Angela's two brothers are involved and the next line is both dead. But the fate is even cruel and Dame Angela meanwhile falls in love with? a German !! And to make things worse, she doesn't know that her Teutonic sweetheart is a spy and that the light suggests that she sends him to the lighthouse every night, doesn't mean it's a love thought, doesn't mean "Ich Do you like "but" Sink Any Damn Italian Boat At Sea "? <br /> <br /> Luckily for Dame Angela, her soon-to-be sweet German spy will be found by the neighbors in her home in which she hid him (a strange fact, because it's not an easy task for a German to be unnoticed?), but the German spy would prefer to die before being caught by those Italians. Of that German love, A half of the Teutonic baby will be born (the evil fate at full speed ??), but a greedy neighbor who has a particular idea of ​​motherhood will carry her son with the consent of " a Catholic nun who took the Trent Council to extremes? a fact that would put Angela on the verge of madness. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Dame Angela's secret admirer has returned from the war and you can think that eventually, Angela Angela's sad life will improve; a huge mistake because Destiny has her in the store, that the returned soldier is blind. But as they say in Germany, it can be a disguise and eventually Dame Angela will restore her son and start a new life with her blind darling in a poor Italian village that is supposed to be a happy ending to the general people. <br /> <br /> As this German count said before, it was much better for Dame Frances Marion to continue her career as a screenwriter, as she has seen a lot in "The Love Light" . of imagination to find amazing stories, yeah wohl! ?? but a completely different subject is to direct movies and her silent debut lacks emotion and rhythm despite Dame Pickford's efforts to engage the audience with her many shame. The non-existent film story causes indifference in the spectator which makes it the kind of movie where only Dame Pickford gives herself the interest and not her circumstances. <br /> <br /> And now, if you allow me, I have to temporarily take My leave because this German Count Morse must send signals from the Schloss North tower to one of his Teutonic rich heirs.
