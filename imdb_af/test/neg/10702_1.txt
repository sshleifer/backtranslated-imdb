All I ever heard was the equality of the sexes, and here we have a movie that not only portrays imbalance, but continues with a whole concept that one generation is better. I warned all the time that I have hope for the redeeming quality to make the viewer feel like there is hope for the future, and there was not. I will admit that I did not complete the film, but I had to turn it off on the side where the old man told the genetic man Adam it was good to become a whore and get it, and I quote: " More tail than any man in the past. "I don't know this is a bad review on myself, but it is the author and the crew's responsibility to develop a story that will interest a viewer and they have failed. This film betrays all true female natural qualities of the mother figure and the need for balance. Instead, it would illustrate what America ran through lesbian natzis, and I'm not against lesbians. Thank you Mr. Director! Someone please give me a redeeming quality ... I have it! There is no successor!
