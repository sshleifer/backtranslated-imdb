I bought a DVD collection (9 movies for 10 Euros) where this one was included. It seems to be the "uncut version" whatever that means. In addition to the low average quality and short scenes, there was one thing that was very strange - the soft sex scene. It started with a close-up of 2 larger breasts. After about 2 minutes I had an expression on my face that fit the term "boooooooooooooring". very perfect. 7.5 minutes of not even the concrete like tits (currently the term breast is a bad choice) far beyond entertainment. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie was more like "people aren't / stupid, are they?" <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the DVD was scratched and I got my money back.
