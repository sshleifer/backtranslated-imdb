"The best movie of the 90's" "Welsh Trainspotting" .... Aye, right! I went in this movie with fairly high expectations, and it was all downhill from there. <br /> <br /> This movie was supposed to be this archetypal film about the early 90s drug culture and will allow everyone to see within this scene and break the presupposition of the media following the moral panic following the death of Leah Betts in 1995. Unfortunately, it has become very short. <br /> <br /> Where Trainspotting could treat you as an adult on the subject, and potential drug-related issues, we just gave it a scary story about the wonder of drugs and how it can, you know, like opening your mind completely. Cue some guff about Bill Hicks, and Howard Marks ad nausea. It is sometimes painfully bad. I mean, the scene at the end between Lulu and her aunt really made me laugh. <br /> <br /> Now maybe I'm just a cynic, but the way Jip leads us through this story is like listening to THAT Sour, stuffed guy you've met at a home party once, who talks to you about how the man holds us back and how Acid freed him from the tribes of modern society. You just want to shake your mind and ask him to leave the premises. <br /> <br /> The writing was a real problem for me, because where Trainspotting had Irvine Welsh's excellent book to mention, it was written and directed by Justin Kerrigan. The words "Jack of all trades, master of no one" come to mind. You can see where his inspiration comes from, especially in the style of narrative of main character Jip (which sets the main character in a social situation where he speaks directly to the camera and describes what goes through his mind as the scenario spells out) The problem with this being that some of the speeches on the camera are just painful to watch. Primarily, it comes down to a lack of empathy for Jip, but they are so desperate to sound philosophical that they just end up like your average A-Level drama project. The direction is good, and the intentions are good, but it is so lacking in any integrity that you start to wonder what the hype is about. <br /> <br /> But it's not bad. There are moments that are really very amusing and entertaining. Moff is the highlight of the movie for me. For an independent film, it also managed to attract a high number of British British actors / actresses, which might explain why there was such a buzz about the film. <br /> <br /> Best 90's movie? Not with a long shot, but if you're looking for a solid Sunday night movie, then it might be your pocket. However, the film is inevitably flawed by the hype that surrounds it.
