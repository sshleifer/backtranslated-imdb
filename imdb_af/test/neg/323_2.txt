Ugh. Pretty awful. <br /> <br /> Linnea Quigley gets the best bill, but her character doesn't have a big role. Who's her character, anyway, the aunt's aunt? Another user said she was getting naked in a shower scene. While there was a crash scene in the movie, it was a head and shoulders shot. Maybe there are some alternative versions of this movie. <br /> <br /> Quigley has a bigger role than John Carradine, Cameron Mitchell and Brinke Stevens. Carradine briefly appears in a monk's mantle that reflects vague dialogue. No other characters are with him in the scene, though he is kind of composed, or else there are shoulders who undoubtedly belong to someone else. There is also a very bad photo of him in a komo lock (it looks like a bad photocopy), and a decent picture of him in a family Bible. He originally acted Jack-O or something. <br /> <br /> Cameron Mitchell briefly shows on a TV as a TV horror host. Brinke Stevens is in the movie in which he shows The Coven, in which she walks in a mantle around a cemetery. Apparently there are more of the Brinke footage as a bonus feature on the Retromedia DVD dual feature Mark of the Hitch / The Brides Wore Blood. Jack-O: What is it about? Darn if I know. A boy is told of a pumpkin-head demon killer, and he and some other children are afraid of a woman who thinks they are for some reason a witch. She follows him home and offers to help his family with their Halloween haunted house (pierce your hand through a hole and feel eyeballs that are actually grapes, etc.). The pumpkin head killer appears a few times to hold on to branches as he watches people, whether his hand is holding the camera and sitting with it for a while. Sometimes he manages to do more than just keep things and kill people. <br /> <br /> There are also some flashbacks to a western or prairie family, with the little boy also playing the little boy in that family. : Ancestors of her, I think. I think they are in Jack-O's background, but I don't know how. <br /> <br /> The little boy is apparently the main character, but we don't learn anything about him except wearing glasses. , has nightmares, and will fight bulls, even if he's going to beat the process. More time had to be spent to establish his character. I couldn't have cared anymore if he died. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, not even for Halloween.
