Welcome to the world of Vikram Bhatt, the one who was once successful and had several hits with small actors such as KASOOR, RAAZ and also the multi-jumper AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA and her one movie with Aamir GHULAM. <br /> <br /> One sneak peak About these movies, it's all Hollywood remakes and a few decent kids like the one that worked. <br /> <br /> SPEED is a remake of CELLULAR and it's too terrible. <br /> <br /> Looking at the stars, we once sold, but now out of work Urmila and Sanjay Suri, we have the flop Aftab, Ashish Chaudhary, Zayed Khan and others. <br /> <br /> The movie can be a decent thriller, but many problems are there The storytelling has several cringeworthy scenes like Zayed who are hijacking a mobile company and many more and the stunts are laughable while the kinkies eventually lag. The movie also lasted long to reach the theaters that spark it <br /> <br /> Direction is terrible. Music is outdated. <br /> <br /> Zayed Khan screams, makes faces. tc what he always does, Urmila is well in her part. Sanjay Suri is not that convincing Ashish Chaudhary is trying hard in a negative role and he's okay. Aftab is awful and he makes you down a negative role. Surprise, same director hit him his only solo KASOOR Sophie is terrible Tanushree is a non-actress
