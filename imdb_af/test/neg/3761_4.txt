Although it can sometimes be very boring, this movie isn't really that bad. The acting is fairly well done, as stereotypical, and the production values ​​are quite high, considering the Sci-Fi movies that would come later in the decade. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with this movie is some of the very outdated features in it. There is the man of Texas, the "professional" scientist, and the worst of all the female scientists who finally realize her femininity. For a movie that wants to make a statement about man, it loses part of its impact by reducing its characters through sexist stereotypes.
