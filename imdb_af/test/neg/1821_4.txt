Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson are showing good performances with the Southern / New Orleans accent in this detective movie. It's worth seeing for their scenes - and Rickman's scene with Hal Holbrook. These three actors are staffing us to entertain us, no matter what the movie looks like. The plot for the movie shows potential, but one gets the impression of watching the movie that it is not shifted, as it could have been. The fact that it is affected by a rather uninteresting subplot and usually disrupts uninteresting kidnappers. The movie is worth seeing - as for nothing more than entertaining performances by Rickman, Thompson, and Holbrook.
