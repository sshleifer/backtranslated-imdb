This movie includes 2 famous actors I have previously enjoyed watching. There is action great and every action is warmly felt. But it makes me think that these two were thrown to college for the first time in a speech / drama class and told one to dominate and confine to the other in a room without leaving her and the woman to be truly innocent and to treat her with enough mind to leave the audience in tears for her release. <br /> <br /> The only good part is the acting capabilities, the plot has the same rhythm as Hitler's influence and I hated the lead player for that. But all these things could have been done within 15 minutes, so dragging it out for more than an hour was a mere punishment for everyone who watched it. <br /> <br />
