The film successfully presents a graphic representation of the suffering of forced sex work, but nothing more. The left-hand agenda behind this movie can be seen a mile away and let the viewer be ashamed as he looks to know that feeling. Thus, the women are kidnapped and sent to the Yugoslavian territory to work as sex slaves because the US military institution is corrupt and looks away while their private security contractors are selling overseas people. You don't need half a brain to see the relevance to the war in Iraq and the Black Water Company. <br /> <br /> What a load of left blast! It seems like I've been misleading my whole life to think that this problem and many others were a direct result of communism's grip on this region for 45 years. But no, it was the American war in Iraq, which is also responsible for earthquakes, tropical storms and the constipation I had last week. <br /> <br /> The movie ignores the fact that 95% of sex trade women are willing to sell their bodies for money and access to the western block. You also see screens that are so stupid, you want to pull your hair. We hit someone in the streets of London in the broad daylight, in the streets of London, beat her, and then her unconscious body dragged half a mile back to the apartment where he raped her. No one sees it or calls the police, and the running woman doesn't mind screaming during the race. Better still, we see 4-5 women later set up in central London in a light day to be sold, one of them has a broken face and people are joking in the background as if nothing happened. You can't get this stupidity. <br /> <br /> I thought such a trash was exclusive to Hollywood, but I was apparently wrong.
