It seems that Dee Snyder turned halfway through the script. The second half of the movie is basically just a rehash of the first, making the movie very boring. In summary: Cop's daughter was searched in the party via the chat room where she was sexually molested / tortured by psychopath (played by Snider). Cop saves her, psychopath is put in therapy / prison. Psychopath is released four years later and the whole thing is played again. Within all these are very inexplicable plural elements: Why was "Captain Howdy" psycho in the first place? How about the one-off personality path to bible dumps? How does he kidnap all the adults and succeed in closing their mouths without a fight? And maybe the biggest unresolved secret of everyone ... how does a 6'2 "man with pink hair hide completely behind a 5'6" average build woman? These are just a few of the questions I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> It seems Snyder has tried to comment on a) the "dangers" of online chat rooms, b) the hypocrisy of Christian sexual mores, and c) the effect our distorted Puritan society we as individuals have. If so, he failed. The movie was just too weak to entertain, but never to convey social messages. The torture scenes are stupid and boring, becoming silly (especially when Snyder goes into one of his "pain and death" monologues), and everything is not stupid. The scene recording scene is really lame ... when will the police get caller ID and * 69? The young partner of the chief cop character is especially awful ... he should basically not work as an actor. And the sound in the final revealing scene is really poor. I suspect they couldn't afford two tree mids. <br /> <br /> The rest of the play is not terrible, but it's not good either. The policeman is quite a note, and his standalone quality is not entirely credible. Dee Snyder is not bad at all, but he snaps and cuts too much. Robert Englund (who deserves better) places a somewhat amusing performance of a hypocritical redneck. If you're a big Robert Englund fan, the movie is probably worth seeing for him. Everyone else is forgotten. <br /> <br /> Finally, we've done all these platter elements before and better, in films such as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, HELLRAISER, and TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. I suggest renting one of the tenants instead of watching this turkey. 3/10. <br /> <br />
