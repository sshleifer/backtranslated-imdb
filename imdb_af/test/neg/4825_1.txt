I think this program is a garbage dump. All they do, argue and clap their faces and they call it acting? These people pay a lot of money for this and most of them can't even act to save their lives. Also, the story lines are awful and after watching it for a few minutes, I'm bored of it. I like the way Harry Hill takes the mickey out of it on his TV program 'TV Burp', eg. the poor joke "The Princess and the Pea is not exactly Shakespeare is not it?" who had Sonia and Naomi in stitches. I don't see how funny it is. I think it's a waste of everyone's money for their TV license, so it can be displayed 4/5 days a week. Is there nothing better than that?
