After American Indians have become scalp number one boy, the border man, Bruce Bennett (like Daniel Boone), looks like he wants; but he really wants to make friends with the natives. When the Unhappy Indian Chief Lon Chaney Jr. (if Blackfish) also loses number one son, it becomes harder to clear up misunderstandings. Apparently, it was Republic Pictures' attempt to do for their "Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer" that did Disney Studio's success with "Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier" (1955). <br /> <br /> The "Dan'l Boone" song, whistled and sung by a group of kids in a wagon, did not follow Fess Parker's Davy Crockett the Hit Parade. Singer Faron Young (like Faron Callaway) does not publish the title song (perhaps sensible); He sings "Long Green Valley" and makes a good impression as a blonde boyfriend for Boone's daughter. But Spanish actor Freddy Fernandez is the film's most valuable player. In a cute scene, Mr. Fernandez reminds Mr. Young the name of the character ("Susannah") after which he must fall in love. <br /> <br /> **** Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer (10 / 5/56) Ismael Rodr√≠guez ~ Bruce Bennett, Lon Chaney Jr., Faron Young, Freddy Fernandez
