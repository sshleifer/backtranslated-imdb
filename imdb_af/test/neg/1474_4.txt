Sorry, people, but everyone who says it is a big documentary ... and that award won it at Sundance. Well, you're all thrown. I've heard for a few years how to see this documentary and I finally watched it. Maybe in 1999, when it came out and the reality TV didn't have such a dominant presence in the industry, this movie would have been entertaining. But Mike and Mark clearly play themselves, Mike and Mark. Sometimes they are funny and some of the lines look like the cuff, but usually they don't ring true. They are the reality version of Jay and Silent Bob. Yes, the people are real, they are not actors, but it is tackled, it is exaggeration of themselves and it is so obvious that it is hard to believe so many people think it is the right thing. I wasn't deceived, so it was a bit boring. Mild amusing, but don't miss much if you miss it.
