Tru Calling was good, but it could have been good. The concept was intriguing and allowed for seriously strange and frightening story lines that could possibly be explored in the future. Unfortunately, the writer and an actor dropped the show. <br /> <br /> The writing wasn't bad, but there were holes. In episode 13, "Drop Dead Gorgeous", an incredibly poisonous poison is thought to have been used to kill the victim. It was so poisonous and killed so quickly that the victim did not have time to run or even shout for help. Yet, there was no plausible explanation for how the killer got such a powerful poison. <br /> <br /> In episode 15, The Getaway, the policeman responds unrealistically. In the second dinner scene, he (recklessly) tells the robber to drop the gun and when she doesn't follow the command and turns the gun in his direction, he turns it into a standstill and then rises in a hostage situation ?? The situation for which he was warned. His answer would have been to shoot the robber when she did not follow his command and turn the gun on him. There are other errors in the stories, but I will leave them with these two examples. Despite the writing errors, I liked the show. <br /> <br /> The other problem I had was that I couldn't accept Eliza Dushku in this role. In my opinion, she is too inexperienced and lightweight to wear this part. She never went anywhere, she rushed; And too often she comes to a sudden end. <br /> <br /> She also had no real emotional facial expression or intonation. She also has a pensive look or a cute smile; seldom are other emotions visible. As she tries to appear dramatically, she starts looking away and "then" turns her eyes to her fellow actor. Or else she starts her line to her opposite and then looks away. Both are irritating when done as a substitute for true emotion. An example of her lack of intonation is in episode 20, "Two weddings and a funeral", during her second wedding speech no emotion is missing (eg hearts in our hearts). <br /> <br /> I have everything from the other actors in their respective parts and they were all credible. With enhanced writing and a major change, Tru Calling can make it.
