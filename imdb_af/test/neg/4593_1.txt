"Speck" was apparently meant to be related to the killer Richard Speck. However, there has not been much murder to be found in this movie, and none of it is explicitly shown. The most disturbing scene in the whole movie is perhaps when Speck kills one of the eight unlucky nurses in her own bath, but even that is just implied and not shown, except for some unconvincing downward push from Mr. Speck's leg. The most entertaining part of this movie is probably the voice-over, which must prove to be the sensible annoying nature of this movie. Every aspect of this movie is terrible. Unless you love boredom, don't bother it. This movie only looks after 72 minutes, but it feels like an eternity.
