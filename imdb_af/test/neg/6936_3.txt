Eugene O'Neill's 4 and a half hour 1927 game brought on screen in less than two hours. The play's combination of symbolic dialogue and gothic melodrama did not age very well and the role-cast made it difficult, especially Norma Shearer's Nina and Ralph Morgan's Marsden. Clark Gable as Ned Darrell is better off, but mostly because she is a gruff character who is not given the philosophical mockery of the others, which is better suited to Gable's series. As soon as the plot falls to the quadrilateral and the audience adjusts to the voicemail, the movie also gets better. The technique used here is another problem. On stage, the action froze while the actors spoke their mind to the audience. Here they are made as voice calls. You will think it will work better, but as the action no longer freezes, the actors are forced to talk and grab the camera to fit the emotions into their minds. Plus, it's hard for any movie paint to watch this movie and not think of Groucho Marx's hilarious parody version in "Animal Crackers". To these disadvantages, some intercepts are made for censorship (Nina's debauchery is softened and her is not mentioned for the more central abortion in the play) and a miserable (unreasonable) score that turns into background music. -the-century whip. O'Neill calls this movie a horrible hash of attempted condensation and idiotic censorship, and although "Strange Interlude" is nowhere as good as her later "The Iceman Cometh" and "Long Day's Journey Into Night", it certainly has improved earned. than that.
