Six students at a monastery do the unthinkable - killing a nun that is persuasive. Now, eighteen years later, the nun's spirit is back and revenge for her murder. <br /> <br /> Yes, basically it is short of it. There is more to it than that, but I still have no idea what it is. The only very cool thing is the effect on the spiritual nun, because I was pretty impressed with a lower budget movie. I'm also confused whether it is in English or not. Most of the actors are Italian, and even the title here is in Italian, but they spoke English in the movie (I think, or it can be bought, I still can't tell). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the real premise of the movie is pretty idiotic, and the end doesn't just make sense, it ... well ... doesn't make sense.
