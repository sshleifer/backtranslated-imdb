I have absolutely no idea why I watched Ali G Indahouse except that Salon seems to have committed a crime by not nominating Sacha Baron Cohen for an Emmy for his work on the Da Ali G Show. It is a sure bet that I will never see that show, because there was absolutely nothing funny about the movie. Comedy? Torture was more like that. It was just about the dumbest thing I ever watched. I will admit that I am captivated by Rhona Mitra. I didn't see her. She was not in practice during the time I watched, so I think I should look at Boston Legal one of the evening to see how she is doing something worth watching.
