Alright! A Sci-fi / horror / action B hybrid directed by Jim Wynorski and in the final scene we get a cyborg with a deflected metal head that kills many people! As with any Wynorski movie, he throws a whole bunch of crazy ideas and subplots that don't usually lead anywhere. But "Storm Trooper" is more like a two-movie-for-the-price-of-a-kind transaction. On the one hand, we share the drama / thriller (such as opening the movie) with Carol Alt killing her incredibly boring and ungrateful man (a plot that just leads nowhere). And on the other hand, we share the 'escaped cyborg on a rampage', 'Night of the Living Dead' style. With Carol and the Cyborg people are trapped in the house and a lot of special OP's / bounty hunters who play the role of the zombies are trying to break into the house. Needless to say this movie is not there with the greatest. Zach Galligan (of "Gremlins" fame) is especially painful and Corey Feldman (in a small supporting role) is completely wasted on this movie. Wynorski even leaves one of his own movies here, because I'm 99% sure he uses a stockpile of his previous film "976 EVIL II" (the scene with the explosive truck and motorcycle). Yes, it's not that good and so much fun. This is only for Wynorski fans. And I'm one of them, if you didn't know it.
