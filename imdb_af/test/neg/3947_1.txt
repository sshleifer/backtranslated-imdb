I tried. God knows I've been trying to keep this Swiss cheese from a movie, but the story was too full of holes, some big enough to ride a horse car. The acting overall was the same and the characters were enough enough that you were sorry they had died as recently mocked, which scattered to die their own gruesome deaths. Overall, however, it wasn't really scary. Then we saw ghostly fast-moving figures in the background, because "The Brood" was back and it was scary briefly. This movie has never solved the basic plot points and it's the author's work. Of course, you expect the director to pick up that the story doesn't make sense. Like what was the secret room behind the wardrobe, why did the blood-hungry ghost not die when she received the nails as prescribed by the book they had read earlier? Why did the computer "play over" for Frankie's character even though he lived? The list goes on and on. I don't really feel comfortable recommending this movie, as it makes you feel like you're wasting your time and there wasn't enough discount in really anything.
