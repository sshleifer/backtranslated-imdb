Stephen King TV movies can go 5 or 6 and nobody complains, right? So why do Stooges only give 96 minutes? I'm not asking for a PBS mini-series, but would a two-party kill anyone? The movie steamed over events to be called and called events that could be omitted. I want to give a salute to the representations of the stars ... they had a hard work because they didn't really look like the Stooges, but the spirit was there. After watching the movie, I took out a band of American Movie Classics that had the right deal about it and laughed at me. The movie was pretty emotional, especially after Curly had the stroke and Moe had to continue the business. When Curley started crying, I lost it. As I said, the movie was good, but could have been and should have been much better. Maybe it's fit, but the Stooges tore when they were alive. Now, 25 years later, it happens again.
