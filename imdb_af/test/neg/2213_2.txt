It's amazing to think that this movie only came out one year before Star Wars, but it seems like it's a million years behind it in sophisticated and special effects. Actually, the art and set design (nice Victorian spaceship) is not bad; These are the monster costumes that are most laughable, which looks like the "man in a rubber suit" samples of the lost in the space TV show. The evil holman makeup reminds me of some of the strangers from ancient TWILIGHT ZONE reruns. <br /> <br /> The script is quiet, and outside Peter Cushing's comic relief, the play is also very miserable. This movie is only recommended if you really enjoy bad kitschy SF. And the music ... yikes! A horrible 70s experiment with synthesizers that doesn't fit the movie period and looks like someone with a Minimo and a 2-band tape machine.
