This is the second addition to Frank Baum's personally crafted Oz movie trilogy. This is essentially the same childhood as in the other two pictures, although I prefer it to others because it is shorter. As in the other films, there are performers in animal costumes, an adult woman suggests they are a boy, and the characters and plot jump all over the place while the camera work is static. This time in the middle is a magical mantle that wishes, and the boy played by a woman is made king. <br /> <br /> Most special effects are seen at the beginning. Fairies are represented by multiple exposure photography. And there is a man in the moon who looks like those of Georges Méliès years before, most known in 'Le Voyage dans la lune' (1902). Méliès' imaginative fantasies and creative trick effects made him the premier pioneer of early theater. The films he made around the turn of the century were much better and even more technically advanced than this little Oz series.
