Interesting concept that just doesn't make it. I watched the whole movie, but had to read IMDb comments to find out what Code 46 means. When / when explained in the movie, I had to be in a coma, or possibly brain-dead. I just watched it for Tim Robbins. The fact that I didn't know the other actors had to be a hint. We all have to start somewhere, but this movie shouldn't be. What the 'anti-empathy virus virus' - Holy Utility Belt, Batman! Where was The Joker, The Riddler, etc.? Also, why were the women condemned so cowardly? If I want to see less-than-clear stick figures, I'm just walking down the street. The best part of the movie was the car accident. It was completely credible, and not over-the-top like most movie accidents.
