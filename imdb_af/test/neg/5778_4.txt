(There are Spoilers) Ordinary slasher movie with the story taking place in and around this God-leaving mine outside the almost deserted town of Sutterille. After receiving a postcard and golden sophistication from her brother Jared, Shadrach Smith, Clair and her husband Nick Breman, Carrie Bradac and Sean Hines, along with four other friends and armature gold prospectors, Alx & Tori, Steve Wastell & Sangie , and Hayden & Rox Ann, Rick Majeske and Elina to involve themselves. <br /> <br /> It later emerges that the fact that Jared disturbed the long-forgotten gold mine, the ghost of the infamous Jeremiah Stone, Vernon Wells, has come to life and is beginning to frighten. Stone, or 49er, is about the most ridiculous shooter / killer in film history. Stone looks like he has been buried for years under a few tons of coal stations, with this hook cut people in two. After being in almost all the stolen local hermit Tannie Nelly (Karen Black), whose daughter Eva (Alexandra Ford) was also one of Stone's victims, they tell those who are still alive that if they do not return the gold to the Stone Mine not, the crazy miner Tennie Nelly will only be given enough time to tell her story before she has been transformed by Stone into a human torch and eventually jumps into a nearby stream. movie goes on endlessly with the killer mine on the rampage, and looks as though it is as scary as toast and just as dark. Even those in the film showed no real fear to him yesterday. In one scene when he broke into Nelly's house, everyone loaded inside, instead of running away, letting the ghost miner lose his right arm; Stone spent the rest of the movie with a miner's choice attached to his "blunt". <br /> <br /> In addition to actress Karen Black, the film "Miners Massacre" also features veteran actors, John Phillip Law and Richard Lynch as the city sheriff Murphy and Old Man Prichard. Suitable stuff, but nothing special about the movie has a predictable end when the whole gold mine goes up in flames. The audience has given a hint by the makers of "Miners Massacre" that the end to this senseless lunacy is nowhere in sight and can revive very well in the near future, God helps us all!
