Frederick Forsyth's books have always been so complexly planned, with turns and turns, and usually a great surprise. This adjustment had nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> So many of the great things in the book (the history of Monk and the betrayed agents, the plot to influence the outcome of the Russian election) were completely lacking. adjustment. Instead, this is a completely new plot of bio-weapons that was a yawner. <br /> <br /> Forsyth's lead actors have always worked in the shadows, forever just slightly out of reach of the antagonists. The joys of his books have always been the turn of their mission. Swayze's Monk may have also hung a sign around his neck and said, "I AM A SECRET AGENT" for all the attention he has called for himself over time. the movie. And with all the attention, the amount of time it took for the bad guys to catch him was surprising. <br /> <br /> Permitted there was some energy for this movie, and so I give it a "3" instead of a "1". It was also nice to see underutilized benefits like Patrick Bergin, Ben Cross, Michael York and Barry Morse. <br /> <br /> I hope someday somebody will do another Forsyth movie adjustment like "Jackal's Day".
