Angry behind you, for a specific purpose, has been created to move the writers / directors' personal views on who is on the water or who has to dance with the devil. Unfortunately, it seems that the creators were so focused on making their point of view that they completely destroyed its power, with power that feeds their point to the viewer. The way the message is presented reminds me of the stories I heard from the Spanish Inquisition! From one true Christian to another, avoid it like the plague, fear tactics never work when you try to send this kind of message! <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, the selection of Muslim terrorists was racist and unfair they were terrorists, so they should be Muslims). The assumption was good, the story was a good channel for his message, but it was the execution of those short-lived ideas. This makes it very difficult to separate the message from the messenger. <br /> <br /> It would be better to have your old "Ghost" DVD with Mr. Swayze is pushing to get this message better. At least the movie didn't try to move your throat off. Or if you want good Christian movies with a powerful message, try "End of Spies"
