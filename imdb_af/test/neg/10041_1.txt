BELL WITCH HAUNTING (aka THE HAUNT) is an American horror movie that is supposedly based on real events that occurred during the period 1817 to 1821. <br /> <br /> It shouldn't be confused with BELL WITCH: THE MOVIE, a movie star Betsy Palmer based on the same opportunities. However, I can say I wish I saw this other movie instead of the one I saw! I enjoyed Betsy Palmer's cold show on Friday 13th. As such, I believe that even on a bad day, she will get a better performance than anyone involved in the travesty known as THE HAUNT. <br /> <br /> With regard to my heading, this movie is not painful to watch because the content is disturbing. It is painful to watch because it is just boring. <br /> <br /> Read the positive reviews for this movie, but I could only identify three possibilities. The first possibility - these authors were somehow involved in the production. The second possibility - the authors not directly involved - was paid to write positive reviews after the production was completed. The final possibility - none of these writers have seen enough horror movies and are therefore inexperienced with the concepts of successful endeavors. <br /> <br /> The plot for the plot is Robertson County, Tennessee. James Johnston receives a visit from two journalists who are eager to hear the story of the Bell Hitch. The story is told as a series of flashbacks. A series of supernatural events begin at the home of John Bell and his family. It soon happens that a mysterious spirit is behind everything. <br /> <br /> On the surface, the plot appears to be a standard poltergeist relationship, though based on real-life events. <br /> <br /> True Implementation However, the brilliant concept is concerned, but everything that can go wrong is going wrong. And then some! <br /> <br /> First, the acting. The acting is almost uniformly horrible across the board. This factor has the most damage to production, undermining any credibility credibility or interest on the part of the viewer. The voice of the shaky spirit sounds more like a teenage girl who is experiencing teenage rather than a powerful demonic force that expresses malicious intent. I almost laughed when I heard about her lines. Unfortunately, this voice has become very annoying! I may not have lived in the 1800's, but I find it incredibly difficult to believe that any young woman living alive will speak the way this "ghost" does! <br /> <br /> Secondly, the direction. The direction is random and very uneven. Some scenes show promise, but potential is wasted by the clearly inexperienced director. Nothing is done with the camera, with sound or with lighting to add intensity to the screens intended to be scary. The atmosphere is equally flat. An inventive spirit is presumably behind supernatural events. Yet, the effects are so incredibly clumsy that no one who has seen a proper horror movie would buy into them. I'll give one example. In one scene, the spirit falls on someone. See the scene for yourself. It's almost funny - almost. <br /> <br /> Third, the writing. While this may be the case that the events shown are true to accounts of actual incidents, it cannot be denied that most scenes are incredibly flat and boring. Screens as short as two minutes feel much longer due to the poor dialogue dialog that does not add the characters or story. This movie is too much dependent on conversations to promote the story. While this style was also the case with British films from the British abomination flower of the 1960s and 1970s, it cannot be denied that dialogue exchanges were always interesting to look at in these more professional earlier works. For example, Peter Cushing can read a telephone directory and still keep the attention of the viewers. The same cannot be said of the actors in the HAUNT. <br /> <br /> Finally, the humor. The unguided efforts to make humor in this movie are unfair. An obese boy is the butt of many jokes. One particularly horrible scene is that the boy goes to the outside toilet. This scene should never have been included - but it is and completed with sound effects if you don't understand what it is doing! <br /> <br /> The only positive points about the movie are the place and the costumes. The decision to shoot the picture near the original location added that it is a measure of authenticity. The costumes were also well chosen. <br /> <br /> Overall, THE HAUNT is a terrible movie. It's not even in the "so bad it's good" league. Rather, it's just boring. I advise everyone to save their money and avoid this movie like the plague. Don't even bother to see it for free! <br /> <br /> I've never seen the other movie about the Bell Witch. But it can't really be worse than the HAUNT. Can it? I'll give this other movie a chance if I can find it. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, I would recommend everyone to watch and ghostly watch horror movies. THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING, RINGU, THE GRUDGE (Japanese original) and ONE MISSED CALL (Japanese original) are great places to start.
