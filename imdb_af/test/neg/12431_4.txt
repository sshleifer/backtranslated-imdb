Choose a stereotype, any stereotype (regardless of race, sexual, cultural, etc.), and I bet you'll find it in Wassup Rockers. Do you think all Spanish teenage boys are stupid, hairy, unarticulate and dirty? Are Spanish Girls Sexual, Easy, Ass-Closing? Want black people all to fight and carry guns? Do all gay people do theme parties with pink drinks and ask young boys to model for them? Are all White teenage girls rich, stuffed princesses bored with white teenagers and looking for something a little more dangerous? If you answered yes to any of the previous questions, you, my friend, are a bigot and you will love Wassup Rockers. <br /> <br /> Director Larry Clark likes to shock his audiences (I was 15 years old the first time I saw children and I think that's why I'm still a virgin), but Wassup Rockers is not shocking ?? it's just bad. He tries to be edgy and realistic with his minimal dialogue and body slopes, but these characters and this story are completely unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Simply put, Wassup Rockers is a teenager's fantasy. Which 14-year-old boy doesn't want to be in trouble, crashes parties, drinks 40s and is told by the hot, rich, white girl that his uncircumcised penis looks dangerous? In addition to the demographic, I really don't know who will enjoy this movie.
