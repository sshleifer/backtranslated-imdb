The unthinkable happened. Having only seen it a few years ago, I had a movie that was my benchmark for horror and the movie was called McCinsey's Island. A family adventure movie with Hulk Hogan and Grace Jones (I don't make it up) has plunged it into new depths of filmmaking and is still the only movie I saw that made me wonder what the movie's budget could be spend. Like new schools or cancer treatment for drugs. However, for bare and unobtrusive levels of crap, any movies will have to lower their lower standards if they want to "Guest House Paradiso" to distinguish it from being one of the worst movies I ever had to watch. <br /> <br /> This movie sets us free for two of the biggest losers imaginable. Richard (Rik Mayall) is a hotel manager, as unfriendly as anyone you can imagine and so distorted that you are about some rough. His friend Eddie (director Adrian Edmondson) is an alcoholic waste of human life and they are trying to drive Britain's worst hotel on a cliff next to a nuclear power station. Between them, they often give cartoonish violence (with sound effects), steal anything that is valuable or interesting, from the fools staying there and staring desperately at any woman. The plot, like that, involves the arrival of factory Italian screen goddess Gina Carbonara (Vincent Cassel) fleeing from her wedding and trying to lay down in the Guest House Paradiso, to the astonishment of Richie and Eddie. And ... this is it. <br /> <br /> I thought the Carry On movies represented everything bad about the British film industry and God knows, we have spent so much time and money trying to escape that terrible legacy. We've had movies like "Trainspotting", "28 Days Later", "Four Weddings And a Funeral" and the brilliant "Shaun Of The Dead" (also starring Simon Pegg), but these ... drag the movies that shout and kick back to the days of Sid James and Barbara Windsor's top using a bicycle whistle. "Paradiso Guest House" is so low in its ambition that it hinders you the moment you see it. I kept looking and waiting in anticipation for the jokes to start, but they never came. Just an endless stream of knotted buttons, unimaginable scenarios that explain explanations, slightly amusing violence with frying pans and fridges and almost nothing that yields as much as a sniff. Break the first ad (it was on TV, you see) and I was ready to switch off, but my loyal duties to you, my readers, kept me going. "I look like they shouldn't have become" my mantra, so your parents better remember how much you're guilty of this for me, because it was about as much fun kicking sand in my eyes and being violent dog food. . <br /> <br /> Trust me, I loved the "Bottom" TV show. The combination of suitable foamy plays by Mayall and Edmondson with OTT young humor worked ... for half an hour every week. Certainly not for an hour and a half, as Edmondson and Mayall leave themselves in their small private joke and press the rest of the audience. Honestly, it makes Mayall's "Drop Dead Fred" like "The Godfather" and you have to meet one of these two people (who is actually only responsible for the chaos on the screen as if it were a movie), feel free to quickly to be a boot to their testicular region. They will probably enjoy it. Pegg and Bill Nighy (both guests at the hotel) are towed with this sinking ship, but at least they survived. Mayall and Edmondson should not be so happy. The movie equivalent of Chernobyl and should be avoided as such.
