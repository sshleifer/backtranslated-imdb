The problem with making a movie, however, is that the final, the cream-de-la-cream of the movie, the battle between the two seasoned ships, must be done well. Disappointingly, this scene in Ironclads is of course done entirely with small model ships in an overgrown bath. There is no tension, little explanation of what exactly is going on and what the time frame of the absence is. <br /> <br /> The film takes quite a few freedoms with the surrounding story, like all true stories when they are converted to a movie, such as the traitor of the Union and especially Betty Stuart (Madsen). a Virginia belle. <br /> <br /> It makes it possible to make a possible decent movie that includes an interesting story on the iron clothes to preach about the ills of slavery. It was not in place in this historic drama, and was a cheap attack to bring in the women viewers. It only managed to reduce the positive of the film.
