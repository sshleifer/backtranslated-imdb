I was fixed by this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> The main action of the movie is nothing special. There seems to be a tribe of snake-worshiping people in a remote mountain region of North China, where women rather than men are the leaders and decision makers. I think among some men, it's enough to make "Succubare" a horror movie. Anyway, sometimes Chinese men in the village will wander, make the local girls attractive, seduce them and then abandon them. Unfortunately for the men, the women put them under a game, derived from snake venom, which would kill them horribly for 100 days - their stomachs swollen like a pregnant woman with living worms and snakes - if they did not return. <br /> <br /> Forget about the coverage of the US video. It has nothing to do with vampires, although there is one infinite blood drink scene. The title itself is only marginally applicable: "Succubare" is the Latin word meaning "to lie under it" and that is the root of the word Succubus, a female demon who would seduce men in their sleep. Actually, it's the PEOPLE who are the deceivers here. <br /> <br /> But this is not the main action of this ridiculous movie that is so difficult. It's the small incidents. I will overlook the carnage and slaughter of an ox carried out on the screen. The participants are very experienced, as if it is an unpleasant duty they really do in real life; and I'm sure they actually ate the animal. Although I do not want the act to be printed in my face as "entertainment". <br /> <br /> Whatever I want, I can see many, totally weird shots of an unknown man, interrupting the story from time to time by eating live animals. He started tearing the movie through a live snake with his teeth. In the course of the movie he devours a bug, a lizard, a paddler (I had to leave the room afterwards), and a whole mouse (I stopped watching at this point and lost my appetite for days) . Let me emphasize that it was completely unexpected and nothing to do with the movie, unless it is a cynical reference to love as it is portrayed in the movie: a blind, selfish, dominant mechanism that separates helplessness ... but then again, I'm probably just rationalized to get the rage out of my head ...
