and I saw many movies. I saw it in the theater in 1989 and until today I remember the sickening urge to walk out. If you like John Belushi, respect his talent, or even the holiness of the theater. This movie has nothing to offer you. It is mostly a pathetic showcase for the writer of Belushi's biography, Bob Woodward. As we see the progression of Belushi's life going on the screen, Woodward actually sees in the movie as a ghost character. The most offensive scene occurs when Belushi dies, looks out of his deathbed to see the author stand above him and he says poorly: "Breathe for me, Woodward." There are too many terrible things to call them all, of which the least is the opening that Belushi jumps out of his lift box into the mortuary and is attacked in a taxi by a man named "Angel." I will then leave it.
