I bought this movie for a few dollars at a "Clearance warehouse hall" one day when I was just looking around. The cover looks good, but the movie is B&W (I wish they would not try us with colored covers on B&W movies, but it's a common thing to look out for!). <Br /> <br /> When I looked at it, I was pleasantly surprised. It was better than I expected. I was disappointed that it was a B&W, but the effects are pretty good, definitely better than, say, "Invaders from Mars", which has a crazy effect, and it's great to have John Banner in something other than Hogan's Heroes to see. Overall, this movie is not bad for a B grade, and definitely worth two dollars from a nostalgic point of view. It's not my favorite sci-fi, but it's not my worst. This is OK.
