A horrible mish mash of predictable story lines and presence poorly rendered PC clich√©s ad nauseam (races cooperate, the heroine is smart, and beautiful, a man who offers himself to save another life, a father / daughter relationship etc. . Etc.). The movie looks like something created for network television and probably stayed there. Even the gifted Tommy Lee Jones fails to save this BOMB. I encourage you not to waste money or time on this movie ruin, from the time that Hollywood disaster films flew. <br /> <br /> The two stars are only given to the CGI people and the PR people's ability to get even one movie to put it through.
