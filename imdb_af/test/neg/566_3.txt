I loved the first 15 minutes and I loved the dialogue in the tribunal - which became the best showcase for the director's prospective techniques - but this movie eventually ends. Even if it is purely regarded as a metaphor for the suppressor / repressed dynamics of the relationship between the US government and its more "disobedient" citizens, it still has no punch and credibility, and eventually I watched my watch And hoping the clear end would happen. <br /> <br /> And for the record: despite turbulent rumors to the contrary, this movie has never been banned in America (I can't comment on the rumors of British censorship, but I am suspicious). Hollywood refused to distribute it after showing its initial film festival, and I am more than willing to believe that the Nixon government had any influence on this decision; However, the fact that it never appeared on American television is merely a reflection of the medium's rather cautious and advertising-driven way of doing business. As far as the present is concerned, you can get your own copy of the DVD delivered via Amazon in a few days.
