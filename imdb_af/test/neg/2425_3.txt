Firstly, let me just say that I live in South Africa where rugby is our biggest sport by far, and our national team, the Springboks, won the World Cup twice. So this is quite a big problem here. I played my whole life and I'm shocked at the poor attention to detail in this movie! I initially thought it had the potential to be a good movie, taking into account Neal McDonough, Nick Ferris, Gary Cole and Sean Astin, for the sake of good, but it was a mockery of the sport. They basically messed it up with your usual everyday American football video. <br /> <br /> My first problem is that this movie probably captures the values ​​of rugby, but the discipline or should I say its total lack during the games is contrary to this. In the final, it looks more like an NFL game, with Penning attacking the ball several times before the referee. It would have led to a few red cards immediately, as it would never be unpunished. by a referee I can assure you! You also can't find a coach in world rugby who would have so little control over his team. Any coach will take a dump on a player's head if he deliberately makes an opposing player or double team as he did in the final ... red card and certain suspension. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it is absurd that a coach will play a brand new player who moves all his life together, to the hooker who is a highly specialized position and says that for the team's good?! What ?! Hooker is a highly specialized position in the front row where you have to scrum very well and preferably throw the ball into the unlocking time, which Penning never does for some reason. Moving a wing to hooker without any extensive long-term training will first cause your team's death on scrumming. Secondly, the poor child will probably break his neck! How good is the team I ask you? Finally, the overall high emotional pitch of the movie is too much, because although rugby is a good sport and it builds good friendships and team spirit, it rarely gets out of hand and corny. I saw real soccer drama with less emotions than this movie and it has grown, but in this one Sean's acting skills are dragged too far and the film also tries to force an emotional response from the audience, which is ultimately boring and difficult sometimes look. Hollywood has made some good sports films over the years, but next time they are in a sport recently taken up in the States. should try to do their homework and maybe get some experts in the dress. <br /> <br /> Do it right or don't do it at all!
