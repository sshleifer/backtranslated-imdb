What a filth of film ratings wrong - a 2.1 on the IMDb scale as I write it. People, it's much closer to a 3.0, I'm even going to go out on a limb and say 4.0 where I put it. Come on - how can you have a movie about a static electricity net around the earth and alien amorphous cell structures, and don't give it at least 4.0 for creativity? Then you have all that great dialogue like, "Dave, look at the composition of this mud." You know, I don't think they ever came to that mud again. It doesn't matter, it's the kind of movie that the 'Z' movie lives on, and I can now rest easy. Actually, I saw it quite a few years ago without the proper appreciation, along with Corman titles such as "Attack of the Giant Leeches" and "The Wasp Woman". I don't know what the fascination may be, but quote a character from the movie: "Whatever it is, work it fast!" <br /> <br /> Back to that strange amorphous cell structure - I like the idea of ​​a third element competing against your standard red and white blood cells. When astronaut John Corcoran (Michael Emmet) returned from the dead, I had visions of a scene that might have been the forerunner of 1979's "Alien", but it wasn't. Instead, budget constraints limit the picture to a feathered Big Bird beating, though the concept was nearly a decade away. Who knows where one idea leaves and picks up with another? <br /> <br /> Look, it's not that bad. Not so good, but not so bad. Every time you have astronaut astronauts with strange creatures who are determined to take over the Earth, you have a winning combination. Throw in the cheesy sample factor and you're on the go. Just remember - a wounded animal that is big is not good.
