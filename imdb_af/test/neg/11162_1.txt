Love the TPBs, but it was a lame episode. Didn't feel the same as the series or the movie. It looks like it's been in a hurry. I didn't enjoy it at all. The so-called acting was terrible. The film appeared as they knew it was a money grab of an episode to quickly market. I hope we don't have a special Easter, because it will be for me. Writing this episode was definitely Mike Clattenburg's worst in the history of this show. The direction left a lot to be desired and I almost felt bad about throwing and crewing this poor Christmas special effort. As I said, I love the TPBs, but this one goes to the trash.
