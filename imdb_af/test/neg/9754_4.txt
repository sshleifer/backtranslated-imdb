I didn't really want to see Step Up, but my friend just kept on bending me to watch this movie, especially because she's so in love with Channing Tatum. I constantly bother her about it and say this is the only reason she loved the movie. But she somehow convinced me that it was a movie to watch, that if I love movies like Dirty Dancing, take the lead, and save the last dance, that I love Stap Up, and what is it? I think every movie is somehow right for a view. <br /> <br /> Well, you know those movies I just mentioned above? Dirty dance, take the lead, and save the last dance? Well, put it in a blender with some gangsta love in it and that's what you got. Not to mention if you've seen those movies, well, honestly, you've seen Step Up. Because Channing is a lower class with street people who just feel the music obvious while the classmate has to take a firm step, how will they ever fall in love if they are so different? It is their chance to act after the passion, the secret and the desire of the dance! <br /> <br /> OK, it was a crazy plot explanation, but as I said, as long as you saw those movies I mentioned, or even if you just saw the plot, you get the movie. I don't understand how it has a 5.5 rating, I bet it's the Channing lovers! LOL! I'm joking with your guys, but that's all right, I think I just didn't get what others did with the passion, the riddle the dance is! Oh Antonio Bandares, where are you when we need you? <br /> <br /> 4/10
