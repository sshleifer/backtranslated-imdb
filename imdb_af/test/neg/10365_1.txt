This movie is slowing down a cheap movie trying to be a stoner movie because the characters are looking for pot, but none of them are smokers just a lot of garbage. Thomas Hayden Church should no longer direct this movie, which is a waste of the film. People who like this movie have commented well, but some of the people here are just delayed and not watching movies, so they think any bad movie is sucking the actors and sucking the movie balls. <br /> <br /> I think many people will be upset because this movie is trying to make itself look like the ultimate weed film when it's just the worst movie about the weeds I've ever seen. I hope people will stop the director from directing shit like this even weeds can't make this movie funny or entertaining.
