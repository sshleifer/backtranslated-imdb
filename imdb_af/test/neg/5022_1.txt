Don't kill my fans, but I have to say something about it. Advantages: Well, the most generously interesting season I've ever seen in Inuyasha's seasons is just the Shichinintai bow. Unlike the rest of the seasons, I personally think this one has more of a real plot line and those mercenaries; good god they are so nice characters. Shame they were murdered. Of course, I will write a 15-page essay, why I enjoy the Shichinintai so much, but it will be boring to some of you. So this series actually has some nice characters. I'll miss Bankotsu ... poor, poor, psycho-little boy. Disadvantages: Outside of Shichinintai arc, the range was generally boring, repetitive and some of the characters were extremely irritating. Kagome for example: She overreacts too much to my taste; She acts like Yuka van Elfen Song. Inuyasha: He's a hard mouthpiece with a big sword. What's so unique about him? He has ADORABLE DOG EARS! Tch. Sesshomaru is all talking, no action and very much wrong. Naraku should just be the wimpiest villain ever in the anime world. Miroku and Sango ... they have a little color, but they just look too much on the sidelines. But what battles me most than the fact that they have absolutely no common nerve. Rumiko Takahashi did a lot better than that. I've seen it before. <br /> <br /> If you like series with lots of action, no annoying love triangle, not repetition, then it's not for you.
