I need to know better. I saw too much of Rob Lowe's early work to expect everything from this movie, even if it is about hockey. <br /> <br /> Here's another tired sport theme. Children have the potential for greatness, it is clear to go far beyond its spectacular attitude. And, spree, he comes out of it as the bright player type of champion. Is this all that can be said about sports movies? Certainly there must be other feats that athletes undertake. <br /> <br /> However, this movie should be one of the biggest cheeseballs. Everyone's interactions are just foolish, and not in a silly funny way. And I can't think of any additional features that can ease my position. Not the actors (definitely not Swayze who plays Lowe's reluctant mentor), not the story, not the music, and very little of the skating sequence. <br /> <br /> Usually, I am a sucker for 80 movies, even though they tend to be a bit viscous (ie North Shore, the Karate Kid), but not even good 80's trash . For a good 80s sports movie, look elsewhere. There are a lot of them out there.
