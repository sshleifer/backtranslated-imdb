A family of dirt farmers moving from the west. <br /> <br /> The head of Walnut Grove's latest maize bread is called 'Charles'. He works at the mill that loads a lot of wood, but who in hell thinks he's cutting all that wood for a mystery, because none of the people in the whole town have enough money to buy a splinter, much less " a two by four. <br /> <br /> The village is the 'Olsons', a rich but stupid clan that has moved to these parts to sell all the dough they sell for 11 cents a dozen eggs. They have two children, a boy, 'Willie' and a girl, 'Nellie', who has only one savings asset among them ... Nellie is hot and it's fun to spy on her if she takes a bath the cricket. <br /> <br /> The townspeaker is also the village idiot, because he thinks he's really something special for this backwoods dome landdille, when in reality they can't stand his boring sermons and the only thing they pray because on Sunday it is up to him to fall off the nearest cliff as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> The city doctor is a dinosaur who saw his better days 20 years ago, but he hangs anyway, so he can give Free Breast Exam to the old days living in the village. Unfortunately, the only time this old hot mama comes up on their knees is to get a loaf of bread from the oven to give the Doc his services. But it is good with Doc because he knows that these old wenches give good bread. <br /> <br /> The back of this colorful collection of country maps is Charles's wimpy-woman Carolyn and their three girls, Mary ',' Carrie 'and' Half-Pint '. Mary is another hot chick, where all the guys sneak a look when they take a shower or a shit. Carrie is an annoying little child, but keeps a cookie in her mouth and you won't even know she's there. Where is she? ...... There she is ... She's in the backyard with a pack of cigarettes ... how cute! Halfpint is the town's latest screwdriver. She may not have a brain or any kind of body to talk about, but she can spit another boy in the whole freaking school. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful town, Walnut Grove, where someone is always. dropped off from a roof or driven by a wheelchair, and it is also beautiful, composed of one building ... the church / school house / town hall / pool room. Oh, it's a little hairy on the prairie, but that's right, especially if Mary takes a bath in the cricket. That's when you can see how hairy it really is.
