I usually prefer French movies about American people, with explosions and car hunters, but this movie was very disappointing. There is no way to write a spoiler, because nothing really happens. This French couple have been living in Lisbon for years and going back to Paris for a friend's wedding. They announce to another friend they eat with what they are going to divide. Not much is happening, they don't want to know if they want to divorce or not. I don't necessarily think their hesitation is making a bad movie. It is very human to hesitate before making such a good decision, but it can be treated in an interesting way, giving flesh to their desires and their relationship, but this does not happen. One gets out of the theater about why these two came together or wanted to split. The only piece I enjoyed was the conversation with the drunk. It was true for life.
