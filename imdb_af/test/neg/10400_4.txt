A group of young filmmakers with virtually no budget made something clever and original - and although there is some originality and a few skilled drawings in this sleeping puppet show, Dante's Inferno, nothing special is clever. Dante's "Divine Comedy" was a brilliant piece of social commentary. This film is a vague moralistic student profile with pretensions to High Art. <br /> <br /> I suspect those who loved this movie were those who were easily amused by the sophomoric pokes at some icons of political and / or religious law, and that those who hated it offended because their favorite icons hit. If so, little of those pokes really rose to the level of satire. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the movie is a sudden outbreak of "Schoolhouse Rock" on the subject of lobbying and the "revolving door." It is really a pity that the whole movie could not be a musical . This would have lost a great deal of the annoying film school's pretense and added a much stronger element of fun.
