Since my first VHS recorder, it has been a tradition to collect the incarnations of the old chestnut by Charles Dickens, and I have tackled this one and "Karroll's Christmas" this year. Fortunately, when this one was on the Hallmark Channel at the 3:00 am awkward hour, I was saved to change commercials. However, it was just saving grace. <br /> <br /> The writing was lavishly dull with almost no clever scenes to save it from anything more than a teen-over-soap like Beverly Hills 90210. In this one, a good man who knows her set aside the only logical explanation for her transformation in a Scrooge-like TV talk program is hostess. It has messed up Dinah Manoff, who only plays a bitch goddess on the other bitch goddess Tori Spelling (who at that time had more garment paint on her face than some colonial homes) and Bill Shatner may be one of the few fun things in this otherwise furious adjustment . <br /> <br /> Some of the best opportunities are wasted like the ghost entrances. Aunt Marla's entrance could have been spectacularly funny in the hands of a decent writer, but this Christmas turkey did not become clear. <br /> <br /> Tori Spelling can be a lovely person, but she has all the acting skills of a mannequin, and it makes a bad performance all by itself. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was good to see Gary Coleman's work again, but the writing doesn't give him anything to do except to drop his eyes and pamper the right dialogue. <br /> <br /> What is most disturbing is that the transformation of Scroogedom to Tori is "sweet and light" as convincing as a passionate conservative. Now, if someone wants to write the ultimate Scrooge story of a George Bush and Karl Rove, we might have a refreshing change from the usual bad Christmas Carol Clones. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Mrs. Spelling and / or 90210, this can be your cup of Christmas. I would prefer a stiff shot of dish and a cold beer to wash it myself. This one I can just throw away before it's been here with me long ago. <br /> <br /> God saves us all!
