To put it simply, Mind of Mencia is the worst, unassuming show on Comedy Central, and probably all the television ... ever. I love Comedy Central and watch all the apps and movies there every time, but every time the intro for this show starts even after a good comedy, I can't find the distance network fast enough. <br /> <br /> Telling Mencia used, worn-out jokes in a bad attempt to be controversial, then the ethnicity he just talked to in the audience would show as saying: "They liked it, so it likes your race, and I also have an extension ". Give me a break Mencia, I don't know if those people are plants or not, but just because you're going to a black man and five to one of your ridiculous jokes doesn't mean he thinks you're funny, it means just you put him on the spot and what is he going to do, are you hitting TV? He gives the impression that his jokes are deep, meaningful, and thoughts, which appear in his advertisements, but when you look at the show, almost 100% of what he says is common sense. He also claims that only smart people get some of his jokes, but you don't have to be smarter than a monkey to understand what he just said if he says, maybe you should finish 3rd grade Carlos. The guy continues to say that he says what others just think, but I think you will find that if someone thinks what he says, they all came out on their own, it was ridiculous and they never said it. in the first place. <br /> <br /> All in all, watch 1 episode and do it as you need, because after seeing one episode, you've seen them all. Why Comedy Central renews this terrible performance is far above me. If you're looking for good comedy, look elsewhere, because you'll find very little of it.
