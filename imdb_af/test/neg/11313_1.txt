This morning I remembered myself that this film existed. I thought to myself, "Oh yes, there was a Mr Magoo movie, wasn't there?" This is more surprising because I remember following the controversy surrounding this movie (the advocacy group for the visually impaired said this movie was humiliating). I even went to see the movie on the day it opened because I'm a fan of both mr. Magoo and Mr Nielson thought he would be an excellent choice for Mr. Play Magoo. I even remember the credits opened because I thought it was quite amusing. <br /> <br /> However, it is a complete space. I think it's a pretty sad statement about any movie that is so lame, so soft and so completely without merit that you can't remember anything about it. I understand that Leslie Nielson is not always known to appear in first-class comedies, but I saw him in "Spy Hard" in "Scary Movie 4" and "Police Squad 3". None of these were movies, but at least I remember * something *. Mr. Magoo is completely empty. <br /> <br /> I now find out whether all the controversy surrounding the movie was actually generated by the studio it produced, in the hope of at least generating a little bit of interest in an otherwise entirely worthless movie.
