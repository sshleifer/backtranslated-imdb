I loved the first "American Graffiti" with my whole heart and soul that I saw as the best movie about rock n'roll, along with the best teenage spot I've ever seen. The first film was given George Lucas' careers, which would later do the epistical "Star Wars" before he did the incidents two decades later, while Richard Dreyfuss made a star in Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Child and other films. . <br /> <br /> Somehow, without the two, the magic died. <br /> <br /> "More American Graffiti" shows audiences who happened later in the sixties with the rest of the characters where Steve (Ron Howard) and Laurie (Cindy Williams) protested against the Vietnam War while their friend Terry "The Toad" field (Charles Martin Smith) himself is in the war and is trying to get out. John Milner (Paul Le Mat) is still the hot trailer in California where he never left home at all. The rest of the supporting actors in the movie of Candy Clark's Debbie (Terry's Girlfriend), the pharaoh's gangsters, along with Harrison Ford and others, don't really do much. The original film looked teenagers out of the streets without bloodshed with the early rock n'roll music by Buddy Holly, The Fleetwoods, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Bill Haley and the Comets, Buddy Knox and more that nostalgic insect in the brought back. classical music. The "More American Graffiti" soundtrack is a mix of rock, soul, country, hippie music and the late 60s mood of protests, drugs, sacrifices and more. <br /> <br /> After looking at "More American Graffiti" it seemed like the audience members wanted to see what happened after the title epilogue of the four main characters in the first movie (except Dreyfuss's character) where it was not needed. This movie wasn't necessary either, because I was happy to see that Lucas or Dreyfuss didn't move to bigger and better projects.
