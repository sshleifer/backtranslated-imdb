Cronica de un desayuno combines the worst shortcomings of the Mexican theater, a rare show these days. <br /> <br /> It's pretentious: we want to believe it's deep, just because some scene is out of focus, another is pseudo-surrealistic, but another play with the Eisenstein Infante Caifanes tradition of laughing crying faces. The issue is fragmented, and it's all so solemn. <br /> <br /> It has poor writing: the main story hardly develops, so it has three smaller, unnecessary stories stuck in it. They're just good at making the movie longer. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting is bad. A true achievement to keep in mind that many of the best-known Mexican actors have been thrown. <br /> <br /> There is an abuse of unnecessary dirty language. To the point that Paloma's character, symbolizing the dreams of childhood freedom, is using it thoroughly. <br /> <br /> It's homophobic. The character Eduardo Palomo played is the worst and most punished representation of a transsexual I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's very boring. I finally impressed with the people who left the theater before the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Everything it tries is better done, in Mexico and elsewhere. <br /> <br /> In other words: "Para partirte la madre, nada como una mala pel√≠cula"
