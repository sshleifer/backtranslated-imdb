There were many hype of this movie and the ads seemed to be wonderful. Unfortunately, like Bring It On 2, it brings 3 shameful glory to the original Bring It On. There is shameless stereotyping throughout the film. The rules given to the actors were humiliating for all the races involved in the film. The performance of Hayden Panattiere was substandard both in terms of acting and cheerleading. There were several scenes in which I literally clipped, because I was ashamed of the cast because the scene (lines, plot, etc.) was just as stupid. My recommendation to the makers of any future Bring It On films is that you have to appoint good cheerleaders and learn to act because the "play" of the cast was terrible and their lack of cheerleading ability made them completely useless for the film . Only great character: Kirresha.
