I watched the TV guide last night and saw a movie lover, Heather Grahm, who I liked in movies like Boogie Nights and Austin Powers. That's why I decided to see it. It started well, but you could say the story was missing, and about halfway it started to deteriorate. I can't remember this movie being in the theaters, and I'm sure if it was, it wasn't there long. The acting was clumsy and unconvincing, the dialogue was stupid and predictable, and the story was confusing and stupid. Definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I like movies like those that compared it to Fight Club, but this one doesn't come close! Heather Grahm has done much better since then. I gave it a 2 out of 10, but that's because I clicked on the wrong number, I wanted to give it a 1.
