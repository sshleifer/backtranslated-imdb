I don't know how this DVD made its way into my collection - my wife suggested it was one of those "3 for £ 20" sales at a high street store. The thing is not worth 66p, let alone £ 6.66! After investing a lot in it, I was obliged to see it to the end, just to make sure it was just as bad, and it was. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was terrible, the story line was impenetrable (I still don't understand what the hell is going on, despite the fact that the synopsis has been read), the work of the camera was unpleasant and hopeless , the acting was wood (not helped by the dialogue). <br /> <br /> In fact, there were no redeeming features - no, not even the beautiful Sandra Bullock, on whose glittering career this stack of foam was probably sold. She must get her agent to buy all the rights to it and then bury it as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> As a final amusing example of the director's clumsiness, there was a scene where the young chief spoke to his father's talks. ex-army sidekick during management. It was the clearest bit of dialogue in the movie - no engine noise at all! I am looking forward to the car damping technology that eventually comes across the dam in British cars!
