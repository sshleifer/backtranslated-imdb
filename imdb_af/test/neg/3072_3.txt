Awful. There is no way to get it. A script on the level of some Mexican soap opera, a choice and use of the shooting spots that make the movie labyrinths and at the same time repetitive and monotonous, with disastrous actions of almost the entire role. The references to Tarantino's work, made so weak, are more insulting than anything else. I suspect it was not for the shameless and plot-unrelated exploitation of Matadinho's generous curves, no one would bother to watch this movie at any theater. <br /> <br /> These are the kind of movies that made me have no desire to watch Portuguese theater.
