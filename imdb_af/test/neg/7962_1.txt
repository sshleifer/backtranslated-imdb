This film spends a lot of time preaching against marijuana. However, the plot and footage is so insane that it looks more like the poster child for LSD. <br /> <br /> Plot: Michael's heroic struggle while fighting his drug addiction while being exposed to humiliation. by the likes of Winnie the Pooh and Papa Smurf. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is a good message, but it was obscured by the fact that the authors took a pretty boring PSA idea and tried to stretch it in 30. minutes. It includes a song series, where it is said that there are a million, rational ways to say no. like "I can't smoke pot, I have homework!" <br /> <br /> The authors can't make their minds about dealing with the characters they've brought in royalties. Initially we see them all hiding from human characters, but within five minutes we see that they are all running in a naked face without noticing anyone. Soon they are interacting with the human cast, and the only one even slightly disturbed by this fact is not the drug abusers, it's the little sister talking to her teddy bear. (Pooh, by the way.) There's also the little thing drug demon is swinging around. Because you know, printers don't give children drugs. He is also ambiguous. Although he may be symbolic of Michael's addiction and therefore not seen by other people, he goes home and lets Corey come back to get her into drugs. So I think he's ... uhhh ..... move! <br /> <br /> The whole plot finally crashes into a crazy sequence in which Michael appears in the Morning Carnival of Souls on Saturday, a theme park from hell where the various cartoon characters pick him up and ignore him. For example, Miss Piggy eats him in a sandwich and spits it out. If the writers were not high when they wrote it, then I should recommend getting them high because they are no longer crazy about it. Of course, the film ignores the fact that Michael had two heights for two years, so why this sequel would scare him off is beyond me. <br /> <br /> I realize I'm totally a hunter on this movie. but I actually only saw it again, because I made the effort to find it on eBay because it is a little cartoon. The level of unintentional humor is brilliant. Take this scene, for example - Michael's father roots through the fridge for a beer. He noticed that many of them were missing and named it to his wife. The ever-striking mother told him, "Don't worry, you probably just drank them last night." While we are of course supposed to learn that Michael drinks beer (in addition to the pot and crack), we read in and realize: Hey kids, it's okay to have chemical dependencies as long as you are an adult! Scenes like this are worth the small price of this movie. Oh, and the fact that you hear Simon the Chipmunk, says "Marijuana."
