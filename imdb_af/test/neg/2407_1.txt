Simply put, the only saving grace that this movie has is institutions, costumes and an OK punk concert. How H.R.Giger should feel about his cyborg photo on the cover of this movie, I don't want to know. Immediately, all I could do was make sardonic comments about the movie characters. I was hoping the freaks in this movie would do them the right way. I feel SPOILERS a comin '! I wondered if this movie was in the spirit of the first 20 minutes. was meant to be just as humorous half-baked as the rest of it? Investigate all obvious political cries (Police are trying to rape a "freak", discussing superficialities between the "freak" and the freakish boy and the punk concert with the female singer) and using slow motion in the road series (which screams "martial arts coordinator") I just don't know. The character named "Steve" irritated me because he was trying to take battles with people off the street (he had to be touched and raped) and looked bad when he broke the man's neck to the end (wants I have to show you how to do that?) I have to say, if they had developed other characters better than they did "Splatter", it could have gone somewhere. If there was a 0 to give this movie, it would have got it, but unfortunately it is a 1.
