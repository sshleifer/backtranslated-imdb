I find the company that made this movie wanted people to think about the Conan movies, but unfortunately for those who made this one, it is just like that. You'd think, man the Conan movies were pretty cool ... this one is completely bored and sucked. The story, who cares? It will no longer help you like this movie, as it looks like a very cheap movie. Arnold, does not seem to belong in this one, why he agreed to play the role is outside me. Well, probably for the money. I just like the monster in the water that turns out to be a machine. Lamb This movie is simple and just awful.
