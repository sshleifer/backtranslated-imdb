It takes an eternity for this typically over-simplistic and idiotic Stephen King-based movie to finally get out of the starting blocks. About half an hour is spent on unnecessary introductions to various boring characters and their irrelevant, small personal issues that can generate boring housewives and apathetic pensioners in soap dramas, but that's the main genre (or so I thought naively). The mutt fails to see all the scary things Leonard Maltin, the infamous, clueless / hopeless and always gritty film critic, disagrees with. He regards Cujo as "really scary". (I often have to wonder if Maltin is actually thick - or just keep doing favorites for his Hollywood friends.) It is both illogical and inconsistent as Wallace survives an attack with only a leg injury. And of course, her car breaks down only when she needs to save her life: this is one of the oldest horror movie clich√©s; trust King to use it to minimum effect. The point of departure is incomprehensible, too banal, even for a horror movie: a racial mutt attacks a family. Is this already? This kind of thing hardly forms a 3-minute sub-sub-plot in your average zombie movie. I even think Cujo had to realize he was starring in a turkey. Mutts has terrible agents ... But what I really don't understand is how people can throw themselves into the Cujo book and read it from cover to cover? These SK fans must be immortal: this is the only explanation, ie why treat their time as such a meaningless commodity. <br /> <br /> Body part: 3.
