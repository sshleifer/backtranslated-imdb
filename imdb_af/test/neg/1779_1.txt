I'm a fan of low-budget B movies and camp horror flicks, but it was too much, even for me. <br /> <br /> If you can come alongside the poor plot, the cheese effects and the uninspired play, then the horrible script will kill you or you will. The dialogue was probably written by high school tigers, who thought that the words "sir, yes sir" over and over, made these guys sound more military. <br /> <br /> The characters were all the typical cardboard stereotypes: Gung-ho sarge, sorta gung-ho other sensitive person, evil scientist with secret agenda (bare or of course), bitchy brainy chick that would warm if she also tried stupid sexy chick with important information, idiot "genius" Nerd, random other kind of military dudes who die soon enough, and a vigilant guardian, a crazy scientist who was in control "until something went wrong "Oh yes, I almost forgot, there is a secret military (navy) submarine. On the ocean floor, 5 minutes from HQ (or so it looks), full of radioactive scorpions (ok?) and dead bodies. Your goal is vague and poorly defined ..... <br /> <br /> If you see it, don't say you're not warned.
