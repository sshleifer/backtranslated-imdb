Words cannot express how poor this film is. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, the acting is sorry, basically the whole movie is a joke. <br /> <br /> With a running time of 97 minutes, it's about 96 minutes long. <br /> <br /> It might have been good as a short sketch of a comedy program, but the premise is far too thin to work for that amount of time without boredom. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one, rather rent a good movie!
