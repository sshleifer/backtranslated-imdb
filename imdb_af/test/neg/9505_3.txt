This movie is very hard to understand, why does the couple want to divorce? No reason is given, we know nothing about their life in Lisbon, and even nothing about Marie's work. We can only understand that in this life a certain drill originated. We don't even know who took the initiative to ask for the divorce. <br /> <br /> The way of filming is special: I didn't know the director's name before the end of the movie, when I read On the screen I understood why it was so slow, just 42 shots in a hundred minutes (I counted them)! It reminded me of some Japanese movies I saw in the 90's. In fact, we must assume that it is the expression of another culture, even if the set is in appearance. I don't know if this story would suit a Japanese couple. <br /> <br /> One can see the logic of the screens, but the result is a drill, but I decided to watch it to the end, because I wanted to get the spirit and its meaning . In fact, I just understood that the story of these two creatures is not over, as the train leaves the station without Marie. It's a little for such a long time! I can't recommend this work.
