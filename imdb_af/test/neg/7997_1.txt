It's one of those movies that is so bad, it's fantastic !!! It has everything that an early eighties movie needs: Spotted pants, Big Mustaches, Chicks with Farrah Hair, and most importantly, NINJAS !!!! I have a few choices to fix for you. Cole's army mate has a strange monkey-like face and always seems to speak without moving his jaw. He gets his ass handed to him over every other scene by the thugs who want his country so he gets drunk through the whole movie. At one stage, his farm workers eventually turn back after running down the gangster man's hired goons and Frank, I think his name is Frank. He's moved like that, he shouts for the whole group. and they all move to the rooster field of the farm to start the festivals. It is fun at every level possible. Whether you take it dirty or literally, it still warms my heart. Another funny thing is Sho Kosugi's little grunts and animated ninja-style moves. I remember this man from when I was a child and he said he was the only true ninja in the world (he has advertisements in martial arts magazines) if I remember correctly. My friends and I were a little ninja crazy during the time this movie came out and I can remember seeing it many times in the local theater. I wondered if I watched Starz last night, why every gritty American gangster always has a stronghold in the Philippines and wears a white Steve Martin suit. In fact, this guy goes much further than asking all his thugs to wear white Steve Martin suits. There is a scene where it appears as if 20 Steve Martin mimics are attacking a 1970s Sears lingerie (Cole) model. As we arrive for the final battle, Cole breaks very uncomfortably into the bad man's headquarters and is immediately found by a secretary who, in turn, warns a guard who rounds off his pump action shotgun, not 30 feet from the bad. guys not and no one seems to see or care. Cole, wearing a completely white ninja outfit, continues to climb a step on the shoulder, then hit right into the area where all the bad guys are. The second in control tells him he didn't need everyone to kill everyone as they expected him, and give him a ride to the bad guys, a big Cock Fighting arena. Don't ask me why Cock Fighting is a big part of this movie, but it is. When they arrive, Cole still wears his ninja mask, even though everyone knows what he looks like without it. The last battle comes closer, as Cole has killed everyone and now Sho, as I would like to call him, revealed that he had kidnapped Cole's lady, Frank's wife, and met them in the funniest cockpits you ever saw. Sho then, very polite, I can add, says the lady and the fight will start soon. They do their bending and begin to circle each other, both masked by the road. When they join the battle, Cole turns out to be someone else with a "funny ghost" on completing Bruce Lee's "Game of Death". Cole finally comes up, Kills Sho, who dies with honor, is getting ready and everything is fine. Next we see Cole, after ruin, everyone's life is about to divide the village again, but not before to shade the brutal death of a fat man with a crochet hand and then he inexplicably looks at the camera, freezing frame, credits.
