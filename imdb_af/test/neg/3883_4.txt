I saw it with high expectations. Come on, it's Akshay Kumar, Govinda, and Paresh Rawal, all of whom are great about their comedy, I really hope for a laugh riot. Unfortunately, that's not what I got. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, nothing in this movie really made me laugh out loud. There were times when I climbed one or two things, but nothing really made me laugh. In short, it was a heavy attempt at comedy, and in a way, a bit of a Hera Pheri wannabe. <br /> <br /> From the three main guys, I think Paresh Rawal's role was the strongest. This was not the biggest role, but it certainly looked more like Govinda or Akshay. Their performances were good, I think. Nothing special, just mediocre. Although Govinda stole Akshay's highlight in more than a few scenes. Lara Dutta and Tanushree Dutta also appear in this movie, and both were pretty bad. Lara's role didn't move me or let me laugh, and Tanushree Dutta's character just got on my nerves! The music seems to be the only good thing about Bhagam Bhag. My favorite song is "Tere Bin", followed by "Afreen", which I really liked. "Signal" and the title song "Bhagam Bhag" is also worth listening to. <br /> <br /> You'll also like or you won't. And to judge by the poor comedy and lack of direction, I don't think you will.
