Eh. I watch this movie in class because someone signed it and brought it in. I expected a half-hearted effort to portray the Hercules myths, and because the ads look serious, I expected it to be half-way fair. <br /> <br /> Ten minutes into the film I realized it was a complete CRAP. The only thing in the movie half way true for the myth, is the bare (and I mean bare) minimum. Parents, half-brother and work were called the correct name. Other than that, the rest of the movie was a huge inaccuracy. <br /> <br /> I'd say it wasn't much better than the Disney version of the movie. The Disney version is made for little ones, so not too serious. This movie, with all sex, violence and nudity, was clearly meant for an older audience, but the story presented here was almost inaccurate as the Disney movie.
