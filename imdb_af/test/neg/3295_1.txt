WHAT HAS THINKING?!?!?! How sad is an actor who is extremely talented like Michael Rapaport - who stole our hearts into "Mighty Aphrodite" and fascinated us in "Ill Town" - to this pathetic level. The writing on this sitcom is the crust left on the bottom of the barrel after it has been scraped. Shame on everyone involved. There is a trend: big movie actors who are no longer hot goods turn to TV often with disastrous results (referring to the stinkaroos on CBS and NBC, but ABC has a "Boston Legal" stripe - hipster and great nostalgic use of Bill Shatner). To waste Michael Rapaport in this "All In The Family" rip-off is an insult to viewers and mostly Michael himself.
