This episode was boring and not even in the kingdom of abomination. So far this season Masters of Horror has produced a really good episode ... The damn thing ... it's still early, I believe the episodes will get better. . I admit that the vampire episode was good, but didn't have a solid story. The episode about the couple that catches the serial killer started boring, but the last fifteen minutes were really good. Although I am only disappointed with the lack of originality and horror of the first season's episodes. Please save this season John Carpenter! I believe that Pro-Life will release the whole dull season so far. <br /> <br /> "You're an evil little elf!"
