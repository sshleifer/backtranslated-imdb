Wow ... not in a good way. <br /> <br /> I can't believe people are digging this trash. Most of the shows on television are pretty bad, and it's been going on for quite some time - they're getting worse, but Las Vegas definitely takes it home. What a terrible show ... <br /> <br /> The actors are a lot of the C + loss that has never happened (except James Caan ... who knows what he thinks when he was on this mail has signed) so it's not their fault that this show sucks. They just can't help it. Blame the producers and the writers. I can't believe they shot it and were actually proud of their work to air it.
