Although I can summarize this pathetic episode of Night gallery in two words, these two words are "horsemanship", I must write at least ten lines. It's a very sophomoric episode, not worthy of Rod Serling's standards, but rather an unknown attempt at some ironic black comedy. The prospect of giant rodents inhabiting the moon, a lifeless orb, is completely ridiculous, just like the construction of a giant mousetrap. I suppose we should also assume that the moon is made of green cheese and that is how these absurd creatures survive. I can only assume that this episode was presented as a filling to replace the other two episodes first broadcast. All in all, a waste of film, actors and airtime.
