I read a lot of hope from readers of the book that it will be a faithful adaptation of the story of Nora Roberts. If I didn't read the book, I don't know if this adjustment was true, but I know it wasn't good. Actually, the script was the best part of the movie, so kudos to Nora Roberts. <br /> <br /> I planned ahead and watched Carolina Moon because of Claire Forlani. I've never been sure she's a good actress. She was decent in some movies, average in others and very bad in this one. But, Forlani wasn't alone. The performances were all over the place. Oliver Hudson was wood and boring. Josie Davis was hammy. Then, in the midst of all this B-rate acting, there is Jacqueline Bisset! She didn't have much to do, but to portray bitterness, but even to sleep there, she was miles ahead. <br /> <br /> However, Forlani remains one of the most awesome women in movies and I was not disappointed in this. I believe Forlani can be more than eye-candy, but until she stays in a good movie in a good performance, she stays on top. And I will continue to look diligently at everything she participates in. Fandom is so nice. <br /> <br /> However, this movie, Carolina Moon, was very bad. In addition to the bad acting (false southern accents is really distracting), the direction was pedestrian. It wasn't terrible. It was just the boring TV caliber you used to seeing on Life. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of any of the stars, you'll probably enjoy Carolina Moon, because I have. If you're a fan of the book, you might see the story on the screen, even if it's in a dark form. Otherwise, this movie is imperceptible.
