I have never seen the original 1930 version of the movie, but this remake is one of the worst I have seen in years of a great production studio. To see actors such as Meg Ryan and Annette Bening, once near A-level talents, sleep their way through poorly written roles, are painful. There was no desire to be in front of the camera for anyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> Jada Pinkett Smith and Debra Messing play worthless roles that don't affect the plot and don't add entertainment value. Jada Pinkett Smith's character is used as nothing but a ploy to look modern, with an African American lesbian character, but in reality she is just looking cool. There is no real reason why Brass in this film is different from filling in the amount of women in the original I take. <br /> <br /> The side characters played by Eva Mendes and Debi Mazar are stereotypical female characters, with Mendes portraying the vixen to steal the rich but bored and moderately neglected man and Mazar covering the gossip. <br /> <br /> The movie is boring, without charm, humor or sympathy for any characters. It almost felt that the film was a punishment for everyone involved, either in front of or behind the camera. <br /> <br /> There is one glittering hope in the movie, but few may surround it by the dull and dying stars about it is Cloris Leachman. Leachman is still a wonderful talent that brings her remarkable charm and humor to the film, in the small role she has.
