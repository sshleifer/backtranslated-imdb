I love Das Boot. I was hoping for something on similar levels - a realistic war film depicting soliders and civilians on both sides as real people, with both the joy and pain of the battle. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Stalingrad seems to be written by a third degree and directed by a fifth-grade student. Large parts of the movie appear simple, and leave it completely untouched. The dialogue in translation is ridiculous, but does not look better in the mother tongue; you just have to watch the actors' faces during the bad moments of dialogue to realize how bad this movie is.
