THE BUSINESS is a very bad TV movie from the 1970s involving the ex-wife of Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood as reluctant lovers. She has polio and leads an exclusive existence as a pop songwriter. He is an ambitious lawyer who is very outgoing and has completely beaten her. Their affair, as it is, is doomed from the beginning, and she knows it, but anyway it goes along. Two things to see if you're trapped to watch it: Wood's Jane Fonda hairstyle that never gets crushed, no matter what, and a song she sings early in this horrible movie. She sings it for four or five or six minutes, so you know it's classic padding between ads. This is also one of the worst songs ever written, and the woman who did Wood's singing voice had to be shot and put out of her misery. Also observe all the tops and dresses. In comparison, Wagner looks relatively timeless, with cut hair and a range of classic suits.
