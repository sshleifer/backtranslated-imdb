I felt that the film Skammen, led by Ingmar Bergman, was very dry. It shows the things people will do to survive during a war and the shame that comes from these actions. However, I feel that it is not complete or that attention is not being kept. He never came completely into the plot or deep into the character emotions or reasons behind their actions. The only thing that I had to pay attention to in the movie was the transformation of the two main characters, Jan and Eva. Many times during the movie were just the two main characters who had their daily tasks and didn't even have a conversation. I understand it was to show the reality of these people, but I feel there are other ways to show reality and entertain it. I think Ingmar Bergman could have filmed this movie in a more sounding way.
