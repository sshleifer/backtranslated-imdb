This good man-vs-the-evil tyrant story, which was placed in Russia in the 19th century, may have been an attempt to further Steve Reeves' career beyond that of the Hercules movies. However, in spite of the various costumes, it is still a "Hercules" movie with the usual stylized dialogue, random dubbing, and cardboard characters. On the other hand, there is a lot of action, the pace rarely flags, and Reeves gets one of those scenes where he drove to the center, tied with ropes and gave a powerful swing, which of course has little effect on his challenging character.
