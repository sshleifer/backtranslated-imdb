This film lacked credibility for two reasons. One, no mayor of a big city, and New York is definitely as big as it gets. Would allow a congregation in its city to degenerate into such a violent place to live; especially for voters who have a lot to say about his or her future job security. All the victims in the movie were mostly elderly, Jewish or defenseless. At the age of 62, I have never seen a movie portraying such an absolute lack of respect for authority. Even "Escape from New York," which was fiction, first, ie they told you that it was science fiction, not to such a deep-seated violence. In this movie, most elderly victims were victimized and had guns, but were reluctant to use them. Also in this movie and I did not see the previous two, it is more lawless than the "Escape" movie. Second, gangs as far as my research shows have never been as collaborative as this movie makes them out. On the one hand they get a gangster from another gang working in their area and he's dead. But when heroes start shooting at local gangsters, the next gang is welcomed with open arms. Out-of-town gang members are always regarded as outsiders and stopped. We must believe that when automatic weapons are used against our gang, the other gangs want to be in it. Why did the outside gangs come to help? I believe that more than one gang came from outside to help. What did they come for? Another question, why was the gang leader in jail and why do fellow prisoners ask his permission to attack Bronson's character? It wasn't a good movie and I could go on, but I won't.
