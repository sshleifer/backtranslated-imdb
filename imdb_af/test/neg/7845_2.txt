This movie was terrible. John Wayne is sometimes a brutal actor. The lead maiden who plays the role of "Maura" did a good job and tried her best to make scenes credible despite Wayne's infinite, one-dimensional, performance. Did you see him seriously when he had to speak in his sleep? Ridiculous. And his character became such a terrible person in the second half of the movie and then did nothing to reconcile for his behavior and is still forgiven by everyone, including his arch-enemy, without even being sorry. The story was completely unquestionable. We were supposed to believe that two adults, both tremendous successes in their respected fields, would sabotage a job and expose the lives of innocent men simply because they didn't like each other? You can pretty much randomly pick any scene and it will probably leave you shaking your head in disbelief that someone has paid money to make this movie. It's too bad because the only other Wayne movies I've seen are the shootist and rio bravo, who were both good movies. Unless you are paid, this one does not bother.
