When I first saw this movie in the theater, I was so angry. It blew me all the way. I didn't see it for a decade and then decided what hell, let's see. I now look at all hellraiser movies to see where it went wrong. My guess is it was with successor 5 who was the first to implement the whole. "I'm in a dream. I see strange things. Oh no, what's happening. Oh, it's a dream. Oh, it's not a dream. Oh, wait, I see something. Spooky, oh never mind" - hard story. Those successors do not even require the box to be opened, or to adhere to the rules of the first 4 movies. If you saw a pin head, you're almost screwed and dead. The first 3 hell racers placed this story, which made it so scary in the first place. Nothing fancy, nothing strange, the box opened. Kirstey was the only one who could find her way out, first because of Uncle Frank. Then because she had information about the cenobites. This movie at least tries to keep it, even if it was a bad story, it was quite a bit of hellraiser. No, I'm pretty sure part 5 was the first part to completely destroy the Hellraiser series. Now they're again 1, and I don't even think I'll see it. Oh, who do I guess, and probably I'll probably be disappointed.
