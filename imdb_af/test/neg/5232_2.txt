Needed Things was one of my favorite Stephen King books. But this movie is one of the worst book adaptations I've ever seen, they have changed so many things that made me sick. Even the concept of the book is fraud, things that do not always show their memory throughout the book is not shown in the film. Althogh it was nice as many Stephen King movies are, but so many Stephen King movies did not follow this book and became a piece of Hollywood trailer waste. 10/02
