I just watched this movie on DVD this morning and was so disappointed that it even thought it was a good joke for the audience. In other words - the creators do not plan to make comedy drama. Anyway, in the end, I realized that Mr. Tony Giglio was serious about this movie. It is a pity because: the dialogue is ridiculous, the acting is poor and lifeless, the story is a fish story! Poor Ryan Phillippe - despite his efforts, his character in the movie probably remains his worst performance! What to say to Jason Statham - lack of all sorts of skills to develop the role of imaginary fiction ... For these reasons I agree: 3/10
