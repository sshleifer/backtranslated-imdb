Look at this movie ..... just to really appreciate how good the original is. I'm not really hard to please, but it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It hurt me because I love Chevy Chase, Jackie Mason, and Dyan Cannon. The writing was just awful! I thought Chevy would have at least ad libbed better things than he did. There was almost nothing to laugh at in this movie. I went to enjoy it. I wanted to laugh, but almost cry. <br /> <br /> Initially, credits read Special Look by Chevy Chase. It worried me from the beginning. Chevy is actually more than I thought he would be. It's more than a "special look". Sorry, the look was not special. Mason's character would have been a good secondary character, but grew old as a head. I'd rather (much more) see Dyan Cannon. At least she was fun, if not well written. I also missed the gratuate teen sex scene. Mr. Gopher got rid of cute and innocent rodent who deserved to be inflated. Jonathan Silverman is the only character that interests me and we haven't seen enough of him. <br /> <br /> I'll take it back. Try to see half of this movie, then ... remember the Alamo, the Maine, and CaddyShack I.
