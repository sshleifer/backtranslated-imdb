It's one of those movies I've watched and wondered, why did I watch it? What did I find so interesting about it? If I was a truck driver myself, I didn't find it very realistic. No, I have never used a 'lot of lizard', and I have never seen, nor heard of one driving in the country in a brand new seventy thousand dollarvv. <br /> <br /> The same thing about a Pimp, who has never sampled that particular woman (until the end of the movie, and well, he still doesn't really ...) and just gets $ 50 a cut if the prostitute gets $ 200.00 (good, $ 150.00 after his cut, yes ...). I still laugh at the many lizard comments Ivey made (they are Lot Lizards, they'll screw anything with $ 20, and some men are dressed as women ... or something equally strange), which means we're better than they are, because we can still be prostitutes, but we are getting better. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's just a story of a young woman who wanted something more of life, then a dead end job while at home (she's 18, remember?) and shy basically doing the same thing by her mother (death career). She had at least a roof over her head and a job. She turned FIVE tricks on the road ... I wonder if the $ 750.00 she made was worth it? I won't guess.
