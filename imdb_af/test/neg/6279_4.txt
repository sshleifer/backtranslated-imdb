H. Wells' World War by director David Michael Latt is a slightly less than average movie that is not bad if one considers the budget for which he was working - only $ 1 million. For this budget the production value was not bad - the best part was the visual effects (I was thoroughly impressed with the CGI considering the budget) and good design. The less-stellar parts of this movie are the very well-extended story (but again I think it's because of the budget they had - they had to extend some scenes to create the feature length 97 minutes), the acting (Again it's because the actors had no story to work with), very few exceptional camera shots, and the music. However, I can let go of the negative parts again, because the film is made for a scant budget and still has good production value. Yet you have to see it for the sake of how a low budget version of the World War, even with errors, can be made. 4 out of 10.
