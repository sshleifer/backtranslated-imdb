If I could give this movie 0/10, I'd like to do it, and that's the first movie I wanted to judge so low. It's worse than terrible. If I see it in the movie, I want the cinema to pay ME to watch it (at least minimum wage). Some of the camera shots were pretty effective, but many were garbage, eg. diagonal reflection in a mirror that separates its head and shoulders from its body (believe). Several completely useless murders of innocent citizens. 2 murders that made me run because of the victims' actions / facial expressions when they were shot. I just watched it to the end (quickly forwarding 10 minutes of the boring senseless dialogue) and hoping to see Seagal in a decent hand-to-hand fight, but there was almost nothing of it (it should have known when he initially threw someone while you were taking an elevator and slowly displayed it with music - ending of 'action' scene). In one scene we see the Seagal hand slowing down the neck, making it clear that his hand didn't even make contact. The main villain goes back to life. He is shot in the chest on 2 different occasions. The first time it is with a shotgun that blows the 2nd / 3rd floor on the street. In summary, this movie is a total waste of time and a total joke. It looks very low budget (even for Seagal). The color is dull and gray. I can go on and on .... just like this movie, but I won't. Watch this movie if you have sleeplessness. It is guaranteed to let you sleep.
