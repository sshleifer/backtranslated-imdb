What a good role and what a pathetic effort to make a movie. The writing is full of holes from start to finish. Incoherent, not coherent ... totally ridiculous. One of the most talented / beautiful actresses in the world (and I am talking about Nastasia Kinski) is here without a memorable line. Worse, she assumes her hair halfway through the movie, but it's obvious that she wears only a cheap black wig that was bought from a drag queen costume shop. The best moments are given to a character actor and his dog in the apartment building where main actor Peter Coyote lives. Fairuza Balk is poorly photographed to begin. She looks like an overweight man who eats too many buffalo buffets. I was looking forward to this movie. I wanted it, but I think I'd rather look at Nastassja's phone book, with her OWN hair.
