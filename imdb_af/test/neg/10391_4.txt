A girl named Isobel is owned by a demon. The local priest (who was previously dated from Isobel's sister) should try to save her, but the bigger problems are with the family's suspicion of each other, rather than the devil in their daughter. <br /> <br /> This movie was directed by Ethan Wiley, the author of "House" and the author / director of "House II". I loved the first movie and looked the second one better, so you would think it would be a winner. Unfortunately, this one looks like it's been thrown together by first-year film students. Dawson Leery could have done better. I thought of the writer of the new writer Ellary Eddy, especially since the idea was almost original (try their cash on the fans of "The Exorcism of Emily Rose"?), But Wiley had to do his magic. br /> Also, you'd think veteran horror stars Jeffrey Combs and James Russo would help this movie. Russo (playing the bishop) scarcely appears, and Combs has a big role as a sheriff ... for the five minutes he's on the screen (but I love the mustache). So, no help here. <br /> <br /> After seeing the Exorcist, all other exorcism films should be compared to the classic by default, no? And the demonic possession in this movie was not terrifying. No headaches or paranormal activity. Just a girl with a deep voice and running makeup. All the "demonic" things are centered on the father who accuses everyone of sleeping with his wife. As another reviewer wrote, "you get a lot of Isobel reflecting on her bed, as it is a trampoline hiding in her closet and jumping from a hay cage. Yes, it's Chuck E. Cheese gone wild . " Unfortunately, this is the scale of the evil in this movie. If you want to watch a movie about relatives who find accusations and shout at each other while the injured daughter is sitting in another room. camera, this is the movie for you. But if you don't say that to me, you have a horrible taste in film if that's what you're looking for. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to focus on the father who sleeps a cowboy to sleep with his wife (who has not slept with his daughter) and the vet to sleep with his wife (what it may, but deny it. And then you have a gardener who attacks the injured girl with a crucifix and tells the family to call an exorcist, but as soon as the priest enters the gardener, he doesn't believe in God. What were all the Bible references you did five minutes ago? <br /> <br /> A horrible exorcism movie. Horribler examples of what Combs and Russo are capable of. And such a sad show of directing to the "House" series of films has become classic. I would like to pretend that Wiley did not have to make this shameful derivative and inseparable, uninspired movie. The power of Christ forces you to avoid this movie as if it were a cardinal sin.
