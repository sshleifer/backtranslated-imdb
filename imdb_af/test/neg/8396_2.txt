I subscribed here just after I watched this movie, and felt it was so terrible that his reviews would be entertaining at least. But all you criminals look like is like that. And so, since I want the job right ... <br /> <br /> From the opening shot, the movie presents its contempt for the audience's attention by a completely inconspicuous picture of an irrelevant bridge for a long time , long time. Then it goes to some slow-skateboarding, which is at least a little cool, but then offsets the brilliance of excitement by letting the most repulsive soundtrack song I've ever heard. Some girl screams in whispering French that sounds like lax plywood. Anyone who has decided to be there has never driven a skateboard, I guarantee it. It was there to test the limits of the audience's patience. <br /> <br /> From there, the movie is about 50 percent slow motion. You know what's worse than a generous slow-motion shot? A greedy slow motion shot of * nothing happens. * Here is a man walking along a road. Here's a guy sitting. Here's a man looking around. Here is a man looking at another man. After a while I started to watch the movie with double speed and bring it back when people appeared on the screen involved in the real dialogue, which was rare. Once I slowed down the movie, and I delayed the movie to find out what a girl said, just to see the camera speak to her, but the sound was another terrible, terrible song and her real voice was not audible. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of some good advice I once wrote about writing. If you have nothing to say, don't use fine tricks to pretend you're doing. Come back to work and think of something to say. All these camera tricks, such as slow motion and strange lighting and lenses and freaky music, are what the absence of content looks and sounds. Many people have apparently bought it and experienced emotional gravity and deep meaning, but I think they are projecting it on a movie that wasn't involved in creating it.
