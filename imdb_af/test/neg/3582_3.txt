I caught the North American premiere on this at the Chicago International Film Festival. I was disappointed outside. Of the mood in the audience I was not the only one. <br /> <br /> The movie takes a long time to come to the conflict and refuses to solve it and rather choose to tell the story. "Prosecute". Is it a destroyer to reveal that a movie has no end? I regard this as a warning. It's at best only half a movie - and not the good half.
