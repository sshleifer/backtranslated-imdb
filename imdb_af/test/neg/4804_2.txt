Virgin innocent Indri finds herself at a home of prostitution run by ruthless pimp MG. Indri is caught in MG's private prison after she refuses to love him. Of course, Indri and worldly upper king Helga join forces and plan to escape. Maman Firmansyah's leaves, uninspired direction and Piet Burnama's dull, talky script undermine any trashy vitality that this movie needs to qualify as a pleasing piece of babes-back-burst exploitation junk: the slow-paced pull painfully through, there's no free feminine nudity whatsoever (the girls do not even show a skin during compulsory group trainings!), the expected torture and decline are both very tame and soft, the moderate crumbly gore does not impress, and even a ridiculous kitten sequence is not nothing to get excited about. Thomas Susanto's pedestrian cinematography, the fun lousy dubbing, the unfortunate 102-minute run, the juicy theme song, and Gatot Sudarto's cricket game add some insult to all the terrible injuries. Only a few decent last line-out actions offer some relief from the over-abundant stultifying tedium. A complete throw-inducing dud.
