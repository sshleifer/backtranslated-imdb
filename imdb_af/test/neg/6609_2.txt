the movie is simply awful (2/10). Although the actors try their best (sometimes it is not much), special effects are ... let me say so, it would be better if there is none. <br /> <br /> The script is based on Sapkowski's prose, so it should be the greatest benefit of this movie. Unfortunately, this is the opposite. There is nothing more about the original atmosphere. And that's all very chaotic. Maybe they just had too much material to show in 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you want to see this movie, I'd recommend searching for the TV series (same title, same actors, even the plot remains the same) made at the same time. It's so much better (9/10) and the story there really is. :)
