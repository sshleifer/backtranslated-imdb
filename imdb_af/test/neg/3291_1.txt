Have you seen the same tired, exhausted click sit-com stories, characters, 1000's of times before? Just make it out to suck more than others. First, there is not a single character in this show that is even remotely suitable ... especially Michael Rapaport. Dave Gold is by far one of the biggest donkeys ever to receive a television screen ... apostates occur. As in real life, a father was unlikely to be cruel and simply incompetent for parents ... fratricide would be your only option. To call the remaining characters stereotypes would be too complementary. If these characters end up on life support, the line to pull the plug would be light years. How this show is finished one full season, much less 2 is a mystery. FOX cancels "Arrested Development" and keeps it on the air ??? You tell me the terrorists won't win.
