This movie is too stupid for words. Even if you see it as a parody about filmmaking, if you consider it a whole camp, even if you waste your time, you see it - because you've seen it a hundred times. But maybe you're a big fan of high-screaming girl voices, you're still in love with Barbie and Ken and you can noise this typical 80's electric guitar background ... Well, if you have a chance.
