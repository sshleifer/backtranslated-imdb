AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHEN IS THE HOURS STOP? That's what I said between the beginning and the other part of the movie that really sucked. This movie has almost been alive from me and I've been through some very bad movies. Coming from a true Puppet Master fan, I'd expect to hear myself say it, but that's true. The plot is uncomfortable, the special effects are terrible, the soundtrack is the most awkward, infernal tootle I've ever heard. Oh! I almost forgot about the play, it was so bad that I forgot it, wasn't there at all, nuff said. The only redeeming factor in the film is the puppets themselves, they are truly the stars and can do anything but Guy Rolfe himself (he is the puppet master) and although you can see their threads and strings, they carry me through the painful start to finish off Retro Puppet Master. Eventually PM7 is recommended for true fanatics who are masochists. <br /> <br /> Roach <br /> <br />
