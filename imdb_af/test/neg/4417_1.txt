For me it is a matter you will never understand if you have not lived it. Read it to know why I will have such unlimited anger. <br /> <br /> I heard a lot (Bruce Lee) .. my dad loved him .. my mom who hated a small shot of violence loved him! and how she now talks about his "The Big Boss" aka "Fists of Fury" and the experience of viewing it at the Egyptian movies in 1973 with all the great success. I also watched a good film about him (Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story - 1993) .. so I cried myself: where are your movies Bruce? !! <br /> <br /> I went to the video store .. and it was dumb move .. (you will know why!) .. and waw .. I got a lot of Bruce Lee movies. I chose one (Bruce Lee in New Guinea) <br /> <br /> I did it for myself and watched that one. OH GOD, please forgive your servant. I harmed myself but with no intended decision. I wouldn't do it if I knew she was damaging his evil !! its mythical level of abomination !! <br /> <br /> Then I didn't understand what was the big fuss about Bruce Lee as a great immortal star ??? .. why somebody will care if he or she is here ... this hero (who I watched!) Isn't it so gifted and not the genius and of course it's not sexy? <br /> <br /> Until my dad saw this star and he asked me to break into any of his close-ups and after he had examined his face a little, he made me very definite. said. "It's not Bruce Lee"! so i got too confused to ask: who is this stupid guy anyway ?? !! <br /> <br /> It was 2001 .. 2 years after my first entry into the IMDb database .. so I immediately tended to know who the hell is, that man .. and I discovered the truth. He is not Bruce Lee .. No my dear friends .. he is Bruce Li !!! <br /> <br /> And what a big .. so big difference !! I just want to know who can love that bad clone? Whether God forbids .. likes his repulsive movies. I looked at two of them and couldn't finish the third! <br /> <br /> Then I ignored all our video stores because it was inexpensive (write on the posters THIS Bruce Lee is!) and I have the original. The only Bruce Lee, which is such a big star, and O, BOY, he definitely had the right to immortality. And no less.
