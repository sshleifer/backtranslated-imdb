This film is about a party created by the high school "scary girl." As per the illogical of these types of films, she got permission to keep the party at a house that was previously a crematorium, a dubious place that has been shut down for a long time. Apparently the history of this piece of property is one of those village secrets that is best left untouched by the healthy people, although the legend is whispered to the youth. Why is this crematorium really closed? What actually happened in the past? <br /> <br /> I love these killing-kill movies of a supernatural nature as long as there is something in them that is not copied from one hundred other movies. The highlights of this movie are a small theft of a 7-11 robbery by distracting the clerk with a lively view, the changing clothing scene by the "good girl" seen by her younger younger brother, the ultimate death of the ugly neighbor who hates the holiday, the haunting mirror image and the concept of running water is a barrier to the supernatural; The best part of this movie is when the possessed party sponsors dance to BAUHAUS in front of the fireplace; those scenic rocks.
