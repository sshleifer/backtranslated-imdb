I looked forward to it and frankly there were some bright spots, but it would have worked better if it focused on one story than shooting around the world. The many dogs were great fun, but I got bored with the wine fascists who were drunk about their achievements (;-)). I felt it would have been better than an hour's TV documentary, concentrating on one of the many different issues that it explored. The most interesting is the French village near Montpelier, which fights an American wine company's campaign to get rid of the historic forests. A socialist mayor agreed on an agreement, a pretty timely election had come, and a communist mayor was elected, who denied it, to the despair of American wine outreaches. <br /> <br /> Hopefully the director's cut will be shorter than the original.
