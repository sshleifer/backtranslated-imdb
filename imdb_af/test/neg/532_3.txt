This movie is a cyborg in and of itself: half-nonsense / half-life original movie. <br /> <br /> As a cyborg, this movie has only one purpose: to make you wish you spent the movie in a dark room pushing yourself into the testicles. <br /> <br /> Unlike many people, I didn't rent this movie because of Angelina Jolie (I'll explain why I soon rented it). I'm not a big fan of me. Jolie, though I will say her show was stellar! Her empty stare and robot activity really believed me to be an Android hooker. If someone has a clip of her on 'Inside the Actor's Studio' and explains how she prepared for this role, please send me my way. I'll make sure to use it when I try James Lipton for crimes against integrity. <br /> <br /> So what hired me to rent this movie? One would think it was hoping to see Angelina Jolie's nipples, but it wasn't. No, the reason for this rental rests solely on one of the images on the cover of the DVD; this from Jack Palance's face! HALF OF HIS FACE IS ROBOTS! When I saw this, I thought that "Palances" legions would slowly march through a fiery desert and throw away those who were foolish enough to resist. In my mind, every member of this unholy army of Palances had a red, glowing eye; a red, glowing eye that looked at people and saw only "meat". They were the architects of Oblivion ... a cold, steely apocalypse ... A nightmare from which mankind would never wake up. It is a beautiful image that I will cherish until the end of my years. <br /> <br /> Like most things in my life, the real movie didn't meet my expectations. No, there was only a "Jack Palance" and the only visible cybernetic extensions he had were on his legs. Unfortunately, the improvements didn't really "improve" anything. This is unless you count WHAT as a POLIO VICTIM as a super power. At least they were a scene where Jack, like a faster-happy Alzheimer's patient, grabbed hell from some people. I waited for him to shout: "I'm foolish to pay too much for prescription medication!" Unfortunately, any outbursts of geriatric anger were among the only disorders. <br /> <br /> The movie had an abundance of a poorly developed love story about a man (Elias Koteas, also the poor man's De Niro) and a cyborg (Angelina Jolie, John Demon Spawn of John Voigt). Oh man, can the love between a Romeo of Meat and a Juliet of Silicone ever be last?!?!?! This can be if you follow Jack Palance's simple advice: "You must beat each other's time." <br /> <br /> Yes, I don't know what that means. However, I'm sure I don't want Jack Palance to be the one to explain it to me. I definitely don't want him to show me! As an experiment, I suggest you ask your significant other if he / she "thinks we've reached a level in our relationship where we can beat each other's TIME?"
