The gates of hell opened and this movie spat out, then closed again. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, I appreciate other movies I've seen, like all other movies. Nothing makes sense in this movie. <br /> <br /> It will take too long to mention all the plot issues. In fact, except as a warning, it's really not worth wasting the almost infinite space available on the internet over this movie. <br /> <br /> From now on I will review IMDb before watching any movies. <br /> <br /> Hot darn, IMDb forces me to write more about this movie. I think I should warn you about Edison Force while I'm there. But if you had to choose between the two, choose Edison Force.
