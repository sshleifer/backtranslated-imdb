Maybe it's because I read Peter Straub's wonderful book before I saw the movie, but I was very disappointed with this movie. In my opinion, the filmmakers have removed everything that made the story interesting and unique, replacing it with more general Hollywood style elements. <br /> <br /> It's also bad, as this movie has a tremendous role, especially Fred Astaire, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Melvyn Douglas, John Houseman, and the then unknown Alice Krige. They are just not very valuable. <br /> <br /> In fact, I was all leaving halfway, but a friend convinced me to stay to the end because he was sure to get it. better. He apologized to me during the final credits.
