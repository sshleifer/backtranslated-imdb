There are many different versions of this one that are moving around, so make sure you can find one of the ungraded copies, otherwise a few gore and one nudity point may be missing. Some versions also leave most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there. The track I saw has the screen title WITCHCRAFT: EVIL ENCOUNTERS and is released by Shriek Show, which maintains the original US release title WITCHERY for the DVD release. It's a pretty picture and looks like it's all the footage, but has some nursery / aspect ratio issues. In Italy, it is released as LA CASA 4 (WITCHCRAFT). The first two LA CASA editions were actually the first two EVIL DEAD films (retitled) and the third LA CASA was another film from the same production company (Filmirage), best known in America as GHOSTHOUSE. To make matters even more confusing, WITCHERY was also released elsewhere as GHOSTHOUSE 2. Except in Germany, where GHOSTHOUSE 2 is actually the OGRE: DEMONS 3. OK, I'm better off just now. I'm starting to confuse myself! <br /> <br /> Regardless of the title, it is a very striking or unfortunate effort. Some of it is good, some of it is not. I was actually in this movie for the first half or so, but by the end it became a senseless mess. A large, uninhabited island island, about 50 miles from Boston, is the neighborhood, as one-by-one people are chosen by a German-speaking witch (Hildegard Knef). Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff), who wants to tie up "Witch light," and his virgin writer-friend (Leslie Cumming), who studies witchcraft, are asleep at the hotel without permission. In addition, real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth), who shows potential buyers Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) Brooks, comes. Their children are also gathered together; pregnant daughter Jane (Linda Blair) and very young boy Tommy (Michael Manchester), as well as well-known architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland - Hasselhoff's wife at the time). Once everyone is inside, their boat driver is killed and the boat disappears so they get caught up and basically into the mercy of the "Lady in Black." <br /> <br /> So what can you expect to find here? Very unpleasant! One of the characters closed their lips and then hung upside down in the fireplace and accidentally roasted slowly through the rest of the pot. There is also a crucifixion, witches who eat a dead baby, a swordfish by the head, someone who is set on fire, a possession, a Sesame Street recorder, the virgin raped by the devil, an older vein that blows out and explodes thanks to voodoo doll and some other things. From a technical point of view, it's a nice movie with pretty good cinematography, decent score and good gore effects. The hotel / island area is also beautiful. Blair (especially at the end) and Ross both seem to have fun and Knef is wonderful like the evil witch. Although people like to mock Hasselhoff, he is not bad either. <br /> <br /> At the bottom, despite all the gores, the film looks somewhat boring and becomes monotonous after about an hour. The supernatural themes are also confused and confusing. When characters in the witches are swept to torture and killed, the filmmakers have decided to skip the screaming actors over a silly-looking red spiral whirl that looks very cheesy. And the witch lower itself is empty and cheap design with unfinished wood. And while most of the players are at least decent, some of the performances (especially the "actress" who plays Hasselhoff's girlfriend and child) are so bad they are constantly distracting.
