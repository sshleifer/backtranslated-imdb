I just watched this movie and am disappointed to say I didn't enjoy it a bit. It is so slow and uninteresting. This child of Harry Potter plays a shy teenager with a rude mother and one day the rude mother tells the child to get a job so that they can accommodate an old guy who apparently has no place to live with his family started living and therefore the child goes to work for an old lady. And this old lady who lives alone, teaches him about girls, drives a car and lives! I couldn't see how an 18-year-old man enjoyed spending time with a terrible lady in her 80s. Sorry if my comment on this movie has saved people who could enjoy it, I could be wrong, because I am not British and cannot understand the social and family structure and way of life. Mostly, the film is made for the British audience.
