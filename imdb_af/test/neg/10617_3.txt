I watched this movie that I really thought had a promising start, but then it just disappointed me. The problem I think with this movie is that the director tried a bit too hard to make this movie strange and original. There were too many flashbacks and too many bad "effects" that got me annoyed by the movie. I love Debbie Harry and Isaac Hayes, but they disappointed me in this movie, they could do much better. This film was promising in the beginning, dragged in the middle and finally disappointing. The movie can never beat Stanley Kubrick's healing when it comes to controversial issues, strangeness, and movie originality.
