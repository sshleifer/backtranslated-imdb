I agree in many parts with the fairly thorough review already on the subject of the miniseries, and agree that it does have its advantages, not just its disadvantages. For example, the original film captures much of the middle and final sections of the novel in a single montage, including the discovery of Gurney Halleck and the love affair of Paul Atreides and Chani, who is a travesty when reading the novel. probably born from the studio writing the other reviewer. This was one of the major shortcomings of the original film, and the miniseries include many of the original plot lines cut out of the Lynch movie due to the vast nature of the Herbert novel. <br /> <br /> However, this is in itself a double edge. Rather than completing a text-to-celluloid transfer of the novel, the creators of the miniseries were asked to create their own plot lines, absent from the original novel. Likewise, although it is definitely a "fuller" version of Duin's storyline, it is also a break from the original heart and soul and main vision - that of prophecy. Where are the internal monologues that characterize and demonstrate Herbert's writing that reflects the many different characters, without suddenly changing the point or expanding words or unnecessary and stored spoken monologues? Went. So much of the original pain of Paul's decision to choose the jihad or death, the choice to fulfill or evade the prophecy, is surely the most interesting aspect of the novel itself (and one that is far from science fiction). fans are enchanted) is gone. <br /> <br /> Without prophecy, what is the point of Dune? It's just a more educated and learned version of Farscape or Andromeda. How sad it is all that we provide. Lynch's film was flawed, yes. But a flawed movie can lead to a correction by another filmmaker, adopted by the finest points of Lynch's movie art and rejecting some of the more remaining aspects of the style while the storyline is being restored. Now, this story will probably never be translated into film again, and I find that heartbreaking.
