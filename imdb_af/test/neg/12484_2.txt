Yes, what did I expect? I thought it would be a movie about young adults at their turning point in life, such as 'Sonnenallee' or 'American Pie', which I liked very much. I wanted to see a funny movie, perhaps with an ironic look at idyllic Wuerzburg. And what did I get? <br /> <br /> Attention, spoilers for! <br /> <br /> This movie begins with a long dialogue that gives you a good hint of what will inevitably follow: more long dialogue. Sometimes I thought Moritz Bleibtreu had forgotten his text and tried to hide it by improvising and just repeating what he had said before. But as I think of Bleibtreu as one of the better German actors, I believe this effect is really meant. I think the writer wanted to show how boring to talk to friends, especially when stoned. But really, I don't need a theater to be bored by the stoned friends' talk. Boring dialogues make the most of this movie. <br /> <br /> Okay, that's one thing. I can handle it, I've seen nice movies with horrific dialogues, just think of Schwarzenegger's life's work. But the next thing is that characters are cheap and flat and the storyline is as predictable as anything. Just one example (SPOILER !!): Why do you think someone takes a hose to his hemp plants deep in the forest? To water them? Of course, do you usually find water pipes deep in forests? The only reason why this water snake is there is that a hunter who happens to come while the two protagonists are filling their dope harvest, drug abuse, and eventually being filled with three bottles of Jaegermeister. I hated this scene because it's very violent. Usually, I don't mind violence in movies - slapstick comedies are full of it. But in that kind of comedy there is a silent match between the film and you that people are not hurt when they fall on their faces or are hit with chairs or such things. But if that happens in a movie that is otherwise realistic enough, slapstick scenes also seem to be real. In this particular scene in "Lammbock" I really thought this hunter should be seriously injured, if not dead. The final scene really made me feel like he was left there to die, full of more liquor that anyone can handle. And the protagonists just walk away. It would have been different if the author consistently followed one style; the scene could have been quite funny. <br /> <br /> Talk about consistency - that's what I missed most from this movie. The whole movie looks like a list of little episodes that came to the author's mind. Things just happen without a clear reason - yes, I know, it's life, but it's not cinema, because cinema is meant to tell a story without showing boring episodes without any meaning. I asked myself, "Where's the point?" the whole time. Characters along the two main sentences are not highlighted, but you never know why the lead singer's sister wants to sleep with his best friend Kai. She tells you, but I couldn't buy it at all. I think she was just there to give Kai an opportunity to perform these childish AIDS test sketch, which you certainly saw a thousand times before and especially better. The protagonist's friend meets you once, then she leaves Germany (which you don't even see and the old one doesn't care) and eventually it is mentioned in one sense that she met someone else in America and with the protagonist. It seemed to me that the author wanted to fix a few loose goals. He didn't really know, you never really know what's so bad about studying law, daddy's son (daddy does everything right and serves coffee in the middle of the night, which makes me one of the most beautiful characters in the whole movie) and live in beautiful Wuerzburg. Even supper with daddy's low friend, who was able to show how terrible it was to meet dad's expectations, was flat, just another nice meal with the family's friends (except for the trip the man Later on, but I don't think eating before eating with parents was not the point of this scene, if there was any). I experienced worse bad meals in my life than this one and have still written my exams. I couldn't understand a single character in the whole movie, they just looked flat and indescribable. <br /> <br /> All this made it a not-so-good movie, but not one that I didn't want to see again. It really had some good scenes (most of them were not new, like the one with the beautiful and understanding policemen), some were really funny, some dialogues were nice and I like Bleibtreu's play, although he Repeat stereotypes again this time. Not good, not horrible, that's what I thought after the movie was half over. <br /> <br /> But then this intrusive scene came and I really found it repulsive. Incest is simply not funny. I don't even know if it was going to be funny, some people in the audience laughed, so it could be meant this way. This scene spoiled me for the whole movie, I couldn't feel the sympathy for the protagonist anymore - I can't feel sympathy for anyone who is a helpless person. It's not rape and rape for me. funny. So it can be a hint of drama or the like, but the incest is never mentioned again (although we thought it might be one of the reasons for the protagonist to eventually leave Germany, but as it is never mentioned again, I know.) It is even completely unnecessary. I almost expected the sister to eventually conceive, which would just add the finishing touch to this tasteless story, but not even fulfill this final clich√©, just as nothing really resolved or thought through until the end of this movie. It's not really funny, it's not really a drama, it's not a road movie a la Tarantino in spite of desperate tribulations, it's certainly not pleasant. <br /> <br /> Skip this movie. See "Final Fantasy", it's also bad, but at least with beautiful pictures and not so tasteless.
