I was sneaked in by the big names. Rob Lowe, Mario Van Peebles, Burt Reynolds, and the fact that it was an independent film. Incredibly slow start: 35 minutes, two barren songs and a blunt rip off. I didn't care about the characters, and the plot never prompted me to pretend to be realistic. I can't believe it's what it does on the screen. I loved watching this movie because it felt so good when it was over.
