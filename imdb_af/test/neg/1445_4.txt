I first rented this movie on the infamous day of September 11, 2001. Since then I have seen it several times. My only complaint is that it is too short. "Strangeland" would be a complete piece of horror art at two hours. As it stands, the running time is just one hour and a half. <br /> <br /> Ex-Twisted Sister member Dee Snider wrote, produced and stars in a small Colorado village in this 1998 festival. He plays Carleton Hendricks, a crazy sadist who has psychotic ideologies about human evolution and a love for near-death experiences. Hendricks is not a pushover, he is a six-foot "modern primitive". Someone who has tattooed and pierced their body to the limit. When making his first full look in the movie, it's a scary face. <br /> <br /> Hendricks's mainstay in life is to share his "spiritual awakening" with his abducted victims. He visits Internet chat rooms called "Capt. Howdy" and then invites people to his home. They believe they are going to a party. Instead, they find themselves in a home of pain and suffering. Hendricks sows their eyes and mouths and tortures them through blades and hooks in many parts of their body. If it gets sick it is because it is. <br /> <br /> One of Hendrick's victims is Genevieve, the teenage daughter of detective Michael Gage. Gage not only succeeds in saving her, but also arrests Hendricks. Four years later, Hendricks is being released from a spiritual institution that is completely rehabilitated to community disapproval. A group of rednecks led by Freddy Krueger himself, actor Robert Englund, decided to kill him. They fail and Hendricks returns to his old self. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie I will leave for you, just to say the conclusion is satisfactory and will leave you in the quarrels. With the exception of Snider, the play is not too good, but it is useful. The direction is also good. There are some humorous parts in "Strangeland" and they are very funny. I also loved the soundtrack, it's great and worth buying if you like rock. Overall, it's a movie worth watching. If you love low-budget horror movies with a sense of humor, check it out. You will probably like it.
