A teenage boy who is not in the army and has not trained to be a pilot takes a foreign land to save his father. If it's not ridiculous enough, he speaks a colonel in the Air Force to help him get his hands on a jet [wow!]. To make the picture even more absurd, the colonel dares his career and life by giving the mocking son a few hands. They don't just make more colonies like this, but they never did it. This juicy, crowned film should be thrown into the air and blown away by a MIG.
