This movie is pathetic in every way possible. Bad acting, horrible writing (was there one?), Horrible editing, lousy cinematography, cheap humor. Just plain horrible. <br /> <br /> A few weeks before this movie, I saw The Wishmaster, and I thought it was a deadman for the worst movie of the year. Then I saw 'The Pest' and suddenly the wish master didn't look that bad at all. <br /> <br /> Bad Bad. Incredibly bad.
