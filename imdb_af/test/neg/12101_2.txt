What a waste of energy and money. What a waste of what talent there was. <br /> <br /> Emilio Estevez was completely wasted and mostly unused. Jon Lovitz was very generous, but useless. Harry Dean Stanton - why bother? And was it just me or could Kari Wuhrer barely act in this one. <br /> <br /> The story was fairly non-existent and completely unfounded. One of my biggest problems was the reaction of the characters to the events that occurred. As the surf "dudes" pick up their lives every time they are threatened in the last half? Anyway, you never saw them! Setting up some scenes has gone too long with not enough down payment to drop us off. Nothing in this "movie" has really become true or true. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say is a few (very few) of the scenery are nicely filmed and a few scenes were lightly interesting. Don't see it if there are so much better meaningful movies.
