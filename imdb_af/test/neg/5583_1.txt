It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The highlight of the movie is a comparison between the smell of natural gas and a dirty vagina. <br /> <br /> The acting is pathetic. I know acting is hard work and things, but that's why it should be left to real actors. Watching these people is looking at Michael J. Fox's brain surgery. It is shaky at best. <br /> <br /> One of the other remarks will be that the movie is being saved by Dan Gordon's actors and Chris. Only Dan himself or maybe his mother could believe it was good acting. <br /> <br /> The special effects in this movie were terrible. The worst special effects were for the gas explosion in the lighthouse. It looked as if someone was shining an orange light from the bottom of a fridge-model model. Certainly, there was a little computer animation low above, but it didn't help. I suspect that the special effects on this movie were created and delivered using an Amiga computer from the late 80's.
