The riddle as a concept is an interesting idea, but I'm afraid it is wrong, Vinnie, if he gave the Hardman role, is his element as in Lock Stock and Snatch. In this movie, Vinnie plays a Newspaper sports writer (greyhounds to be precise), which is easily beaten in the course of the movie and bundled over a balcony by a man aged 10-15 . I'm sorry Vinnie is tough looking tough and should throw him like fool. Try to investigate a friend's double murders and a drug addict near the Thames. He takes on the role of the policeman, while the real police are participants who fall between Charles Dickens' films. <br /> <br /> When Vinnie is on the screen, his reputation is ahead of him, it seems difficult, but not in this part should be difficult to operate, at the camera in parts. Looking at the Mean Machine, he is perfectly thrown, and credible and does a very decent performance. <br /> <br /> Going back to the movie that slightly confused the case, is the jump back to Charles Dickens who tells another story with characters that also appear in the present day. These two stories seem to be unrelated to the same actors used. <br /> <br /> The sound on the film, especially of Julie Cox, is sometimes inaudible and has not really washed out what her role in the movie is. Vinnies loves interest. She started the movie as a Detecive, but fast. becomes the girl. <br /> <br /> The death of the prostitute is kind of answered but not yet answered. Sprinkle the Charles Dickens stuff and you can have a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Vinnie, slowly becoming Britain's Steven Segal, joining the supporting actor role, you're very good at it.
