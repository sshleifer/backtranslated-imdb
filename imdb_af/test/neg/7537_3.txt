Two teenagers in the north-east of England are desperate to raise money and buy annual tickets for their favorite soccer team. They are going through a series of "comic misadventures", but eventually come to the smile. <br /> <br /> The trailer for this movie sells it as a comedy and incorporates most of its light moments. However, the tone is increasingly grim and the end result is a depressing story associated with well-known stereotypes. The two "heroes" have no problems with lies, fraud and stealing. Their opponents are a ridiculous teacher, a pantomime villain of a father, a psychotic skull and a significant but incompetent social worker. The other female characters are a drug-addicted teenager, a pregnant schoolgirl and an abused woman who makes herself smoke. There are no nice characters, and the audience can only feel sorry or disdain. Local actors, Tim Healy and Kevin Wateley both play against the type as bad things, but the writing and direction of their characters is so one-dimensional that they have more than novelty value. <br /> <br /> Chris Beattie and Greg McLane perform well in the two young leaders. However, they are overlooked because they have the wrong accent. For anyone from the north-east it is clear that they both come from the Sunderland / Durham area, yet we are of the opinion that they are indigenous to Newcastle. As a Geordie myself, I can assure you that the accents are not the same at all. Take the phrase "Let the poor boy speak". We say, "Speak the pooh" as they say "pee lad", with two distinctly different vowels. This contradiction creates a ridiculous double irony in a scene in the Sunderland soccer field, where the two boys try to disguise the Newcastle accents they do not have and * suggest they come from Sunderland - what they clearly do . In a soft comedy, this kind of criticism can be seen as nit-picking. However, the spectacular scene of the film makes it clear that writer / director Mark Herman is seeking eager realism. That means "close enough" is actually far away. <br /> <br /> I was hoping for humor and optimism from this movie. , and found rather tired old cliches. Tyneside is not a gray desert populated only by losers, and to tell them, Herman must know he would offend. It is interesting to compare the movie with the same director's "Little Voice". It is also largely negative and populated by one-dimensional characters. "Little Voice" has at least a talented heroine and does not become in the same degree in misery. I heard 'Belter' next to this year's "Billy Elliot", but the movie is a much nicer and life-enhancing experience. By the way, I might just be too old, but I've lived On Tyneside for 42 years, I've never heard anyone outside this movie use the phrase "Purely Belter".
