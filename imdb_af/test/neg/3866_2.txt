The fifth collaboration between Marlene Dietrich and director Josef von Sternberg, BLONDE VENUS, is a movie that looks good while it plays but does not involve the viewer. The devastating story of Dietrich, who is torn between two men, becomes a mammoth cabaret star and fights for the custody of her child, and is often cut like pieces of three separate films half baked together. Dietrich is unknowingly thrown into a rather passive, reactive role for many of the film and her character abhorrent viewers, while Herbert Marshal is indifferent to her bad husband and Cary Grant is largely wasted as a suave commander moving in and out the picture. The movie features some interesting kit pieces (the Hot Voodoo number is the high point) which is impressively surrealistic for this Hollywood era, but it does not seem to be useful in such a dull, incoherent movie.
