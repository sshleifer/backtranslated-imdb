There's something about Doug McLure's appearance in a movie that is a misery guarantee. His DG initials are like a special movie certification, which comes somewhere before 'U'. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Cushing suffered from both a dilator and a poor judgment of his own. He did excellent work in the Hammer movies as Dr Van Helsing. I saw him doing a very sensible Sherlock Holmes in 'Hound Of The Baskervilles'. And his magnum opus was probably Grand Moff Tarkin in the first Star Wars. The only man but the emperor who could tell Darth Vadar to stop and get away with it. But - crikey! - He did some turkeys. There was that sad Daleks movie for one. And here's another one. <br /> <br /> There is a machine hijacked from Tracy Island. It is a cylinder with a front screw and traction devices on the sides. I'm surprised. Jerry Anderson did not plead for plagiarism. Maybe he was bought. But if the movie is any guide, they can't pay much. <br /> <br /> This is 1976 and we are still playing in a latex bodysuit. <br /> <br /> It's really over. Some movies have an entertainment value in the 'so bad it's good' category. This doesn't even control it. It won't even entertain kids. "Crash Corrigan's" 1930's stuff went out more.
