I found Code 46 very disappointing. I thought the concept was good and therefore has great potential as a movie, but found that it didn't deliver. Code 46 lacked thought and structure and the storyline did not go well. I thought Tim Robbins' character was not well developed, for example. I thought there should be more information and thought to be in his family life and not completely ignored it because I felt it. When they first violated a code 46, it was suggested that they didn't know they could be genetically linked, but all the technology was available. He took her fingerprint and therefore genetic details when he investigated the fraud. I was constantly waiting for something to happen and to develop the story line and yet it never did. I felt that the film had a great potential to stimulate intellectually, but seemed to be the opposite. Code 46 became too clever and ultimately had no imagination. I would not recommend this movie. The only good thing about the movie was that it was relatively short.
