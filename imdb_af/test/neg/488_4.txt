This short was short of director Del Lord's last and only Shemp. The problem: It was pretty poor and the cafe scene was almost a carbon copy of a curly, short, busy brother (1944). The interrogation scene was pretty funny and the beginning of the cafe. But there are many plotholes in this brief. For example, why do the jerks push the garbage can when the police come? In the remake, "Cash and Hash" (1955), director Jules White regulates it and the reason for the stubborn hideouts is because there is a gun fight between the police and the armored car robberies. The scene in which Moe has problems with the oyster was previously done with curly in "Dutiful But Dumb" (1941). The haunting part of the house wasn't so big, except the hilarious scene on the outside of the haunted house. To remove it, the end did not succeed. Rating: C-
