..what distinctive good, memorable movies of movies like this. It is not entertaining, touching, funny, interesting and sometimes feels a little sub-human. The principals act as if they were worldwide, in the worst way, when they were supposed to contact each other and the audience. <br /> <br /> Starting out conventionally enough. Rich kid gets new car for graduation, but the dean says he can't have the car after the ceremony. However, go with joy and stop at dinner on the wrong side of the track for a quick argument with local yokels. Wise asses the waitress's girlfriend / girlfriend. Shockingly they play chicken until they accidentally burn the dinner, they left three minutes earlier (aren't all the dinners five feet from the gas station?). They said they had to pay the price in court. So the only reason to get this "fish out of the water" to stay in town is to reach the scenario that both boys need to help rebuild the dinner. Worse than that, the rich child stays with the family of the non-rich child .. in the room above the attic. That room above the loft saved many people who needed a bed. <br /> <br /> The inexplicable child is treated well by the girl, who never mentions him that he has almost killed her. Of course, it does not promise her boyfriend and is never completely explained. You don't know why Sam (Leelee Sobieski) falls for Kelley (Chris Klein) or why Jasper (Josh Hartnett) allows it. <br /> <br /> Chris Klein is tolerant, Leelee totally unbearable, and Josh doesn't register much of an impression. The character with the most life is the judge who cites Kelley and Jasper to rebuild the dinner. She gets at least one funny remark, which is more than anyone else. Everyone is so mean and humorous that you will feel a bit of a roof if you even think of smiling while the movie is on. <br /> <br /> The end is one way to end the piece, not the most original, but at least it was over. I don't enjoy a movie that a little girl can really love anywhere in the world, but since I'm not one, I have to. The most beautiful thing I can say about this movie is that it is not moderate, and although it does not force it, its innocence and home-spun, winding dialogue comes from a good place. 10/04.
