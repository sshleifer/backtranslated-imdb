I saw it on Italian TV as a kid and remember that I like it - in view of the blending of live action with animation; However, it was already in the end ... and after all these years I have to admit that the critics were right! <br /> <br /> What was wonderful for a child's eyes was actually very poor, not boring for a fantasy adventure; deadly, both stars (ex-angry young man Richard Harris) and director (action expert hunt) are not suitable for the material! At least, Michel Legrand's score (with lyrics provided by author Don Black) is useful - if not exactly inspired. Incidentally, a number of celebrities are among the voice-artists of this British-Belgian co-production (Julian Glover, Bessie Love, Murray Melvin, Robert Rietty, Vladek Sheybal, Graham Stark and it's his last movie work, Michael Bates). While the essential plot points of Jonathan Swift's classic novel ('giant' Gulliver the pawn is in a war between the young of two neighboring countries and on the escape ends in a land of giant giants) come out, it gets up ' done a strict kiddie level (with stereotypical characters, but fortunately, little interference from the comic / romantic variety) - making the whole business somewhat senseless, beyond its intrinsic experimental nature, as Max and Dave Fleischer are already a wonderful feature film cartoon of the book already done in 1939!
