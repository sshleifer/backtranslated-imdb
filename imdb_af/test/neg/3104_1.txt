The worst movie I've ever seen, I didn't even watch, I just sent it to Burt's bits and then the end !!! He's the only reason to watch it! I have to admit that I own a copy because I'm a big Burt fan (stop laughing) and need it for my collection. I wouldn't mind when this movie came out. I rented a nightmare because my local store had only 2 copies and fans of all the different stars always beat me there, I am disappointed when I sit down and watch this movie !! THERE IS NO REASONS OF QUALITIES ABOUT THIS MOVIE !!! Absolutely Nothing to ever hold about this movie !!! this movie has become a joke between myself and a friend Burt's worst !! Rob Lowe's Worst WORST HOUR AND A HALF OF MY LIFE
