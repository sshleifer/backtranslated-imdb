Can you believe that a college professor made this movie ??? <br /> <br /> Same man who made DHOOP <br /> <br /> The movie is terrible and has some strange scenes ever <br /> <br /> The main message is nice but gets bad offered. <br /> <br /> The movie looks like a collage of amateur scenes, miscasts.etc and bad performances. <br /> <br /> Direction and everything is poor <br /> <br /> Music is okay <br /> <br /> Emran's naughty stripe works and he does well. Tusshar is bad Tanushree and Isha is annoying bad Paresh when he looks at the mirror.
