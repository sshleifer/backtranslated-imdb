You will probably be very disappointed by this sequel who is not a prosecutor. AWIL is a classic. But this movie is about as far from classic as you can get. What a joke. Special effects that are not very special, terrible dialogue, non acting.and a legally ridiculous subplot attacked quickly and unconvincingly (not to mention briefly) with about a third of the film left.did I mention the story is less then lame.there is no way it was supposed to be serious horror movie, but it's too stupid to be funny any way. The rating he currently has (4.8 / 10) is too generous if you ask me. My rating for a US Werewolf in Paris: a 3.5 / 10
