This movie is a good companion to Blair Witch, because it is so wrong that BW did right. Like BW, this one represents a documentary haunting event, with every member of the team manning his own camera. <br /> <br /> The meaning of reality is never there. The participants are poorly written clichéd characters and the events that occur are equally cliché (the cat jumps out of a closet, falls candlestick, etc.). The stylized dialogue and improper improvement through the exaggerated attractive role also detract from the docu feeling. And the worst of all, the so-called participating cameras record too many events to perfect even to be remotely credible. Actually, with some review, this thing could have been a Blair Witch parody. In fact, there is a scene in which the blonde historian eats a sandwich with a big dress on it, which is actually pretty funny, and reminds me of a similar brutal scene from Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. But in the end, the event is played straight, without a punchline. It's hard to tell what the intent was with The St Francisville Experiment, except to devour some perishable BW goats. But it was pretty sad when the only real interest I could find was whether or not the blonde historian had to cut her t-shirt in a particular shot.
