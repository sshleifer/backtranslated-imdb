FREDDY FORSYTH has set a storyline that will suit the mood of the West's suspicions about Putin's Russia. Forsyth installs a nasty guy like the Ruski president who wants to return the country - not so much to Stalin's Communism, but to Hitler Fascism. In fact, his Political Manifesto could come straight from Mein Kampf, rather than Marx. And the wage has the latest weapons of biological destruction to reach the ethnic cleansing pogrom of the Russian Federation. US mercenaries connect with Russian Prez to realize his fanatical genocide, but then come into Dirty Dancing's Pat Swayze ... and, yes, things get really dirty and dirty. He is a former US operations-driven driver, Jason Monk, appointed by the British government to see what the Russians are about. Swayze's character, who is no Monk (!), Featured a Russian beauty Elena (played by beautiful Marta Kondova) on his previous missions to the former Commission City. Hardman Swayze does a good job of defeating the evil Russians. But the young, unfamiliar actress, Marta Kondova, steals the movie as his nubile, 18-year-old Russian daughter Elena, who helps root the root, which threatens her beloved Mother Russia.
