First, I'm in my mid 40's. Have been seen in horror movies since I was a kid, so I saw a lot of variety. IMO, it's not as bad as the crowds who gave it a 1 or 2. <br /> Yes, this is a low budget horror flick. The dialogue is sometimes tolerant. The basis of this movie plotwise is actually pretty good. For those of you old enough to remember or lucky enough to watch them on DVD. It's much like a 1970s movie of the week. Just add in blood and small gore, small T & A and curse, without big names. This is for a T. I would rather see it than Jason vs. Godzilla or whatever the other forerunner. It's not that good, EVIL DEAD was a LOW budget movie. At least these guys give credit to try. With an acoustic MIL budget it could have been a good movie. My score is viewable 4.
