"How many ppl know this?" ... "Let's keep it that way!" I wonder at least some new dialogues can be made or not? The movie is a real poor copy of the original. Bruce Willis probably did this movie while he was asleep. The way he looks at Richard Gere's face with his cold-blooded stare as they get near the harbor ... oh my god! scared hell out of me. Why does he kill Major Koslova and her friends are not yet clear to me. Another thing I couldn't understand was the poison solution he put on the car. (What in the world was that?). The movie is haywire and climax is boring. Another funny thing was how the Russian was murdered in the club. I laughed at my seat when I saw that scene. Also, what was that thing about the gay man. What was its purpose. I think the movie is too fast to understand. You really have to think what hell was on the director's mind. LOL. <br /> <br /> And the best scene was that Richard Gere was trying to hold on to two pillars on the pillar. someone should let his head lose if not contact with the pillar.
