The comparisons between the 1995 version and this are inevitable. Unfortunately, this version falls very short. <br /> <br /> The casting is uninspired and the acting wood. One gets the impression that the director didn't read the book, so the characters didn't understand. <br /> <br /> Sir Walter Elliot is portrayed as a pompous, but his unintentional silliness that has captured Redgrave brilliantly (in the 1995 version) is nowhere <br /> <br /> The Musgrove sisters are so unlikely One doesn't understand why Wentworth or anyone else would give them a second look. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Wentworth and Anne is without feeling. <br /> <br /> In the 1995 version, Hinds and Root managed to convey the depth of emotion. The two of them felt towards their body language and facial expressions. In this one, it is difficult to understand that Anne's years spent unless they read the book. <br /> <br /> This production does not affect the emotional complexity of the main characters' relationship. <br /> <br /> In the scene where Wentworth goes to Anne and Mary who have breakfast, it seems to the viewer, as Mary thinks, they are little acquaintances. <br /> <br /> In the 1995 version, when Wentworth walks in (the first time he sees her in years), the tension is thick. Wentworth is furious in waves, while Anne is almost overcome. <br /> <br /> In this version, while Wentworth Lousia court case, it's as if he's really invested, lacking the undercurrents. In the 1995 version, the viewer sees Wentworth's anger at Anne. He mocks his court in front of Anne, as if to say, "Look what you gave up, I no longer need or want you." <br /> <br /> Yet, he still pretends to be suffering, as the scene where he asks his sister and the admiral to take Anne back illustrates. In the 1995 version, the viewer feels Anne's shock that he would care if she was tired, and we also feel Wentworth's discomfort he still gives. In this version, he only goes with Lousia, as if nothing happened. <br /> <br /> The turning point where Anne talks to Harville about who is tallest, male or female, is completely blocked. The actors just call lines without emotional investment. <br /> <br /> When Anne reads the letter from Wentworth, she's reading a grocery list. <br /> <br /> Contrast it with the 1995 version, where the viewer feels Anne's joy at her second chance. We were there with her as she read the letter. The director has read both actors the letter and you both hear their voices. Wentworth is full of frustration, passion, and hope, while Anne's is developing incredibly to joy. <br /> <br /> This production has more scenes after the revelation, probably because it was necessary to explain to the viewer what just happened. The 1995 version doesn't have to be explained, we knew and were delighted with the characters. The only thing this production has in its favor is that the Mrs. Smith subplot was intact while the 1995 version did not. <br /> <br /> However, the 1995 version also included part of Austen's original ending. The scene where Wentworth is commissioned by the Admiral to find out if Anne and Mr. Elliot wants to return to her home (which he and Mrs Croft rent) after marrying. <br /> <br /> It's a production to avoid at all costs.
