I can't print this movie too much because it's obvious halfway through the look they are trying to make it bad, or "camp" if you prefer. Anyway, many of the parts they tried to make funny, but often just for the cheese factor. Watch the space invaders game, actually played as real life! Scratch your head at the bumbling robots ... oh the wackyness! And watch the whole thing with the 'time warp' go over near the end! And the sexual innuendoes continue to fly ... I'm actually surprised it gets away with a PG. Oh good. A fun way to waste a few hours, but Star Wars / Trek it is not, people. 3 out of 10.
