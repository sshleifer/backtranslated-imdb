"Dr. Cameron, a discredited scientist succeeds in his experiment to create serum that transforms men into wolf-like creatures. Originally developing this formula to help the world, the scientist decides to use his newly created topic to give revenge Scientists' daughter Lenora is cautious about her father's actions and shares her suspicions with a newspaper reporter. When scientific control over his creature is lost, it falls to the scientist's daughter and reporter to stop it, " according to the DVD hat's summary. <br /> <br /> The mad scientist George Zucco (like Lorenzo Cameron) rather creates his formula unpredictably, by mixing human and wolf blood. This brings out the animal in Hulking Glenn Strange (like Petro aka Pedro), who is directed to act like Lon Chaney Jr. in "Of Mice and Men". Johnny Downs (like Tom Gregory) and Anna Nagel (as Lenora Cameron) are a nice werewolf hunter and girl in need. Certainly, "The Mad Monster" is no substitute for "The Wolf Man"; but this is a useful addendum. The grainy black-and-white photography enhances the dull cow-bedded atmosphere. "God" (unreasonable) also makes a good end. Like Blaine (Robert Strange) said, "Mingling the blood of man and the beast is just holy!" <br /> <br /> **** The Mad Monster (1942) Sam Newfield ~ George Zucco, Johnny Downs, Anna Nagel
