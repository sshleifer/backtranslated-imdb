This movie was terrible! Ashley Rose Orr, while a talented crane dancer, and singer (actually a little better than Temple in terms of the latter), is a terrible actress. She plays the character like the Shirley we saw in her movies on the screen or she plays her screen or offscreen persona. So, what we get is an exaggerated cutesy, and totally unrealistic (not to mention). If one wants to see her side, one can only rent one of her movies. The only bright light here is Connie Britton's portrayal of Gertrude Temple. I don't think it was terribly realistic, but at least it worked out well. Save yourself the trouble and hire The poor little rich girl.
