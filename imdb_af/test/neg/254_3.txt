the usual indemnity - I don't give 1 star ratings to movies that are harmless, bad, low budget and stupid, although they can earn it. These movies are often funny and appreciated 2-4 based on entertainment - not as a representation of their exemplary filmmaking. This movie fits perfectly on this model. It is a Mexican monster movie, with a voice-over story and extremely poor non-special effects. The makeup is not that bad, and the play is sometimes quite entertaining, but this movie is almost as stupid as Aliens vs Predator and the writing is not half that smooth. Aliens vs Predator can get one of me, but I want to see it again before I commit). <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous but complicated. If you have read so far, you really should know ... A group of remarkable unscientific scientists consist of the main characters. Most of them are heroes - kind of - but one is (of course) angry, and pretty wrong. This crazy scientist finds a laughable, nuclear-powered robot (which looks a little like the can of Wizard of Oz, but has a human face that is inexplicably in its head). An Aztec mummy, discovered by the same scientist, whose wife was just an Aztec princess in the past (does not ask) is put on the robot for the big "climax" to the stiff movie fan on the floor. stomach lobe. <br /> <br /> For its worth, given the budget and the complete slack of the screenplay, it is a very entertaining low-budget goofball monster movie. If you're in that sort of thing, go for it.
