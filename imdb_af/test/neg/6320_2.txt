In the opening order of "Where's Poppa?" George Segal rises one morning, shaves, showers, puts on a gorilla suit and goes into his mother's bedroom. We later realize that she will give her a massive heart attack that will kill her and get her out of life forever. It's about the level of humor one can expect from most of this photo: madness, mixed with what can be considered morbid. <br /> <br /> Segal plays a New York attorney who lives with his so-called senile mother (Ruth Gordon), whose life is even more complicated when he meets a nurse to care for the old bag. the girl of his dreams, the pleasant former Trish Van Devere, like Florence Nightingale. His dilemma: how to integrate the lovely nurse into his and his cheerful mother's life. <br /> <br /> Segal's performance is about the only thing that keeps the picture together. His frustrations, his reactions, his comic timing is almost indifferent (what has that guy become?); where the movie failed in other areas. Ruth Gordon's characterization is terrible as the mother. At first, you can't figure out if her character is senile or just consciously vague to move her son out. By the end, it's clear she's just nuts. When Segal Van VanweÃ« comes home to meet her, Gordon's eyebrows appear and she gets a mean, sinister look. She wants the intruder to be removed from her son's life; she calculates. This is not the mode of a senile person. You don't get a consistent performance throughout the picture, which is probably the director's (Carl Reiner) mistake as much as Gordon's. Ruth Gordon's old "Rosemary Baby" wife is very successful as the audience responds as annoying with the kind of impressive, rogue person Rut Gordon generally plays. But when Mia Farrow is too scary to fight back, Gordon is getting more messed up, her teeth digging deeper and deeper and we are afraid of Farrow; This kind of imposition is really scary. Here we are asked to laugh at what we would normally find annoying, and if Gordon played the whole way helplessly, we might be able to do it. But she is selfish and also means, and it dampens what little humor is there. <br /> <br /> There are, however, some good laughs. A courtroom scene with Barnard Hughes as a military officer and Rob Reiner as a counter-culture punk is pretty hilarious, and Vincent Gardenia does a good job as a Lombard football coach. There is also an inspired bit where Segal's brother (Ron Liebman) was thrown naked by muggers heading for Segal's place, asking him to carry something home - and he packs him the gorilla. <br /> <br /> But a lot of the writing is poorly drafted and doesn't make sense. Why is a New York lawyer with his own practice even in the first place at home? Why does Segal, if his mother is a senile, try to reason with her logically: "If you spoil it for me, I will eject your heart." Why does Liebman cut through the park if he knows he's going to fall over? Why does he take a taxi after leaving Segal's with a gorilla suit? Why didn't he take all the taxis? A nicer little would have been Liebman, than the gorilla, who terrorize the muggers. Why does Van Devere come back - after her first husband was cooking, why does she want to get involved in this forest? I think if I put it to Carl Reiner, he would say, "It's crazy people, they don't have to make sense." It's a convenient way to excuse a lousy, full-featured script. The characters' moment-to-moment behavior doesn't have to make sense, but do their motivation, and that's where "Where's Poppa?" falling apart; The situations are created to have just the gag, and the gags are mostly one-shot, they don't build anything. <br /> <br /> Carl Reiner is the most guilty in this whole fiasco. How he gained this vague reputation as a pillar of comedy puzzles; basically, his career was to hold a microphone before Sid Caesar and Mel Brooks while talking in funny voices. His son Rob has ten times the skill and intelligence as a director. Reiner pushes buttons in the display of biz a monkey can do his job. And it's clearest in its framework of action. Why is the whole of New York shot in close and close-ups, but the scenes in the country are all far and wide? This is the mindset of Carl Reiner's direction, claustrophobic for the city, spatial for the country. In the last lunatic scene at the old people's house, the camera is so far, you can't even figure out what's going on. The sudden end pointed to a resolution that Segal could have reached ninety minutes ago; It also suggests that Reiner couldn't figure out how to end the picture. So he just cut it, as another example of "madness". Reiner seems to be foolishness, and madness without logic is always funny. It's not, and the creators of "Where's Poppa" are so demented like Ruth Gordon Pepsi in her fruit lover.
