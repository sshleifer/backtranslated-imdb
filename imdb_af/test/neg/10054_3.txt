The bridge at Remagen contains some of the most prominent war magazines I've ever seen. Aside from the acting, which is wood, no tank commander is attacked with his tanks parked in pretty neat rows, in the middle of roads, and with troops all with their arms not ready. The constant suicidal behavior has so often come to my mind that I find it impossible to enjoy the movie. Apparently, writers and directors have never had real warfare and never bothered to include an expert. This movie is the very antithesis of the excellent detail in Saving Private Ryan. Unless you are less than 7 years old, I recommend seeing something else. <br /> <br /> GB
