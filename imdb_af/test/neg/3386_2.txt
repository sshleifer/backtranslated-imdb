Hear some good remarks about this movie as very stingy and frightening, but neither is it. It is clear that the scriptwriter wanted to make a scary horror movie, but at the same time some teenage comedies for the young target audience. Scares and comedy rarely lead to good movies, as does MONSTER MAN. <br /> <br /> Not really funny, or scary or enjoyable at any other level. <br /> <br /> Aproaching 39 years of age I saw my share of horror movies. I have seen good and terrible things, but the harvest movies that are being released these days are so terribly mediocre. This leads me to see it. Accepting these days for bad movies is what really annoys me. Let's look at them, they produced lots of shit in the 70s, 80s and 90s, but they were also considered as such. Today they are considered a good entertainment. - Bollocks!
