I must first say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life! Annoying factor number one: Never see the "boy's" face (for the whole movie). And the infinitely more annoying factor: that incessant phone call. Nothing but listening to the phone over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over ... you get my point. The old man was harassed, but the VIEWER was too! Initially, the movie was interesting to me, but it deteriorated very quickly. The movie may be good as a short, but was certainly not enough to maintain anything that reached the movie length. I think what I'm trying to say is that the message about racism (which eventually appeared in the last two scenes of the movie) is secondary because these old men are being harassed. Who cares to sit and watch what is really nothing more than an old man who offends uncertainties with someone who calls him? If you've never seen a movie just touching your skin and you're driving CRAZY ... check this one!
