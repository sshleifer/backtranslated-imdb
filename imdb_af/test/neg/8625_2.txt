There are just so many things wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges weird accent. <br /> <br /> Rita's ability to crack password code <br /> <br /> The whole script <br /> <br /> The end - especially the last scene when bringing two coffees to the table for Jeff and Rita and the publisher. J & R laughed and said, "We no longer drink coffee". Well why did they order it ??? Of course they did it. If they didn't do that and the waiter brought each one a coffee, there would be three coffees. <br /> <br /> Total Tosh.
