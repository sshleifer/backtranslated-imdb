It was a long time since I was so lame and sowing like a movie. It's one thing to keep a slow pace where characters are progressively developed, or an aspect of the movie is clearly enhanced by such pacing (such as "Lost Translation"). However, there is a difference between slow progression and straight storage, as happens in this one. I am reminded of the appearance of Helen Mirren's face, that she had to be disturbed by the disappearance of her husband! Surprise, surprise! What a wonderful creative moment was the meeting of the mistress and woman? (sarcasm) And what a wonderful way the whole story falls apart at the end of each other. Actually a masterpiece.
