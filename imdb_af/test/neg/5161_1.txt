It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Thank you, I saw it for free. I would have hated wasting my money on it. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is no character in the movie that is nice in any way. Michael Caine comes close, but even he's pretty flawed. The rest of the "commandos" consist of disgusting ex-cons. There are the two gay Arabs, and three guys trying to rape a red cross nurse, and the "leader" who has no trouble killing his men so he can escape. <br /> <br /> The "mission" is anything of tension. They need to inflate a fuel drop. Sounds exciting, right? Well, the footage follows them through endless sandstorms and fastens flat bands. Yes, you are reading it correctly. The "tension" is whether they will run out of savings. We actually WATCH they change something like 12 apartments on the road. This is how incredibly exciting this movie is. <br /> <br /> They get the fuel dump to find it a lid. So, nothing to blow up. And at this point, the British army decides for some very distressed reason that they no longer need these guys and send them their stay to the Germans to kill them. <br /> <br /> So, at least you will have an exciting race for freedom? No, instead, they decide to blow up another fuel drop to create a distraction. But when they get in the place, they put off a travel wire, and the Germans come to get them. They call them a loudspeaker. <br /> <br /> Weird. If the Germans knew where they were and where they were going, why did they drop them all the way in the shower before jumping the "snare"? Instead, they wait until they come to the fuel depot and put all their charges. Yes. Right. This will happen. <br /> <br /> So, they blow the dump, the leader sells all his men - except Michael Caine, as he was offered $ 2000 to bring him back alive. <br /> OK ... so, the men are all betrayed and murdered, and Michael Caine and Nigel Davenport survive. The British troops come in with tanks, and they decide to be saved. As they wear German uniforms (they wore them to blow the dump) they tie a white flag around a stick and walk in the road. <br /> <br /> Some British men walk on them and machine gun them to boredom. Kredietrol. <br /> <br /> Yep. The two "Heroes" of the movie die because of a random violent action. <br /> <br /> It's almost like the movie suddenly ran out of budget and decided, "It's a wrap. Kill them and we'll go home." I wasted 2 hours of my life, looking at this tired, unimaginable and totally unrealistic movie that ended with a mercy of a bomb.
