WARNING: MUST HAVE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The wrinkles in the aftermath of the first "Jaws" movie have always been in the 1980s as well as beyond. Film samples came from radioactive monstrosities to unfamiliar and indifferent animals in the unexplored corners of human experience (ie: sea, depth, genetics). Although "Jaws" was a milestone in this particular area of ​​film horrorism, few films could fit the visceral impact of the original. "Shark Rosso Nell'oceano" (a devil fish or red ocean) is a devoted follower of the original "Jaws" formula. After several unfortunate boats and seamen were brutally murdered by some ocean creatures, there is an initial drive to discover the animal, then it is not possible to study it without terrible results, and a final push to destroy it. Although the filmmakers attempt to inject fresh life into the comparison by adding elements of technology and corporate conspiracy, the result is nothing short of disastrous. This movie sinks under its own weight of devastating editing, brittle and inexpensive rare. <br /> <br /> The most sickly compelling feature of "Devilfish" is the cookie cutter editing. From the beginning of the movie when 3 different scenes are merged, the viewer gets the feeling that the movie has no technical credibility. The editors seem to have cut the plays around a set of musical scores instead of cutting the movie and then making the necessary changes to the music. In addition, each track is an intercut and it seems the editors have never heard of the terms "fade", "cattle" or "dissolve". The impact of scenes can never be settled, as they begin immediately after a final line and a new scene. Silly camera tricks are in abundance, such as when two of the main characters share a private moment on the beach and a sort of time-lapse picture of their act is made up of their bodies. <br /> <br /> The music is equally slim. The creature theme is a hopeless duplicate of the theme "Jaws" with a slight variation. Although I would like to keep my reviews free of MST3K influence, Mike described the best bleak score as "soft core pornography". Failure to deliver tension in a movie that relies heavily on it is a killing for the devil. The acting is outdated, the relationships stunned, and the whole conspiracy is ridiculous. However, the question remains that if genetics has progressed to such a level to create a large chimera of a sea sample to protect ocean interests, why can a more practical use not be better applied to humans? One of the few positive aspects of this movie is the idea of ​​the monster, although its presence of the movie is less than stars. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is bad enough to dip under moderately. If "Jaws" are never made, then the movie can be described as an average because its subject would be new and exciting, even if it was executed inefficiently. Unfortunately, as a copy of Spielberg's original thriller, it is most comfortable on a rubbish dump.
