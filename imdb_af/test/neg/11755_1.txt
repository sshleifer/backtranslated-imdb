I know curiosity killed the cat, but I just had to see Psycho's remake, especially after I was on such a Hitchcok trip and knew his job. I watched the original Psycho, although I was a kid, I knew how to respect it and not just that, it was an excellent movie! One of the best, in fact! The first thing I said when I heard about the remake was, "How do you restore perfection?" I also thought about it, but I think I now have more open minds and that might be a way to put Psycho into a new generation. <br /> <br /> But it has become a total insult and is banging on the face of the original Psycho. I know it was said, but I looked at making this movie, and the director was like "Oh, I just want to update it and shoot every scene shot like the original" ... what's the friggin point? ! OK, but I want to rate this movie myself, although it is offensive to the original blow. I mean, the acting wasn't at stake, but honestly, the actors seemed to have just watched the original and just memorized the lines and made it their own. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie I want to slap Anne Hasche, she said, "I've never seen the original, I just wanted to work with Gus." Ooh, it made me angry because honestly, it's not just that, she really sucked in this role as Marian, she wasn't convincing, and she wasn't a horrible scene. Vince Vaughn didn't make it ... let's put it that way, the movie was terribly missed. It was a sin against the film and on its own, it was actually a bad movie. It was too much and destroyed, which could have been a new introduction for a new generation. But to Gus, let the movie make one know what they are doing! <br /> <br /> 1/10
