I sat down for 2 hours with pure boredom. I look at IMDB, although it is not high on the list, it is in the top 250. I was a little indignant. Although, yes. I am very impressed with Robin and Matt's acting abilities, but have not yet preserved the film. I'm not sure what I really like about the movie. Maybe it's because I spread math. Maybe I'm not too much because I talk for 2 hours. Although I loved "American Beauty", but it was. I just want my 2 hours back. It was a huge waste of time. If I miss something in this movie, please email me. I'm curious why it's on the top 250. And don't say, "Because it was a good movie." <br /> <br /> 2/10
