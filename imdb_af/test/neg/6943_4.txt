An incredibly predictable, clich√© story about a woman who was no better than she should have been. Unfortunately, the screenplay by one-sided experimental novelist John Dos Passos, of an original French exotic pot boiler Pierre Louys. This time, Marlene Dietrich Concha, a manipulative, cold Spanish beauty. Don Pasqual (Lionel Atwill) raised her from the cigarette factory, but she demolished him. He warned his long, friend Antonio (Cesar Romero) against her, but to no avail. A duel occurs, claims Concha Pasqualito to try to kill the only man she's ever cared for. He doesn't: he shows his pistol in the air, but Antonio shoots him. But instead of going to Paris with the young victory, she goes back to the man who would die for her. With an unexpected bit by Edward Everett Horton as a Spanish governor. Dietrich plays the part of a Spanish woman by constantly moving, turning the waist and turning and then turning back, fluttering, throwing her head, and so on. And she made faces and had a curl in the middle of her forehead. Photography is strange enough: no outside scene can be shot except by a cloud of bare trees. No indoor scene can be shot without much detail so it's almost impossible to follow people moving across a room. No consecutive Dietrich scene can be. shot without a big wardrobe change. The carnival scenes are so full of confetti and streams it is almost like an underwater scene in the Sargasso Sea.
