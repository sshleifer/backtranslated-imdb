My brother and I are very big Asian movie lovers, so when I hid this movie in a store, I bought this one on DVD because it sounded very promising and I couldn't wait to see it. So I watched this movie with my brother and I have to say, in the beginning it was very promising. Both of us have much loved this brutal ball scene in the first scene. But I think it was all. There are some interesting battles, but it's not an action movie as it claims. Instead, it's a love movie ... with the clich√© of love played so much on top, even Shakespeare will vomit on this title. Sorry for my language. By the way: The characters work like being picked up from the street and giving 100? for playing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Well, my brother and I watched it to the end, because we thought it could get better. But completely, it never did. This movie has seen place # 1 on me and my brothers' worst movies ever, followed by "Fantasy Mission Force" - don't look at it either.
