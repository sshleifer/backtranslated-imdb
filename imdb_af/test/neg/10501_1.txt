So, this is the WORST movie you'll probably ever see. It's there with "Crossbones" and "Southern Comfort", but if you're a bad movie fan like me, this horror of a movie will be the most fun you had in years. WHY does the camera make old school sounds of old school when it is zooming? WHY does that random man push a Nascar memorial board in his pocket? And who is he anyway? WHY do the vampires shoot lightning after they die? What is this? Highlander? Dracula McCloud? Who cares! Just laugh about it. This movie has no continuity, no plot, nothing, really. Ron Hall's series of emotions is always down. He looks as if he needs to be sad, angry if he has to be confused. The rest of the players could not get out of a paper bag. The special ("Short Bus" kinda special) effects are randomly placed, and never needed. Most scenes are illuminated with a desk, if clear. Mel Novak has the AUDACITY looking down for his line, and it's not even worked out. They just keep filming. In fact, half of this movie is not even on film. This is 1/2 film, 1/2 Sony hand-cam. For most of the films, they seem to have left their spree at home. This movie doesn't just have a few plot holes, it's a minefield of confusion and spiritual pain! But OH, I love it! Thank you Ron Hall for this cinematic horror. I went out and bought because it's just as funny. ($ 1.99 on Amazon, and I hurriedly delivered it!) <br /> <br /> "I have weapons! I have weapons! I HAVE WEAPONE!"
