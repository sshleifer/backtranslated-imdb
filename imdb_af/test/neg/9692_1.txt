I couldn't believe what I saw ... (once) brilliant actors in this urgent effort, never to be made. The plots are terrible and the dialogue appauling (initially I thought it was a spoof), and the acting is uncomfortable. Everything about it is bad, from the cheap sets to the fake backgrounds, a lot of paintings expanded. Respectful filmmakers are struggling to realize their vision, but this slanderous, pathetic attempt to make a mini-series makes it our television, with 3 Oscar winners making appearances. I can only guess everyone involved, somehow hurt the writer and director and was forced (perhaps with gun) into this worthless T.V. trash can die.
