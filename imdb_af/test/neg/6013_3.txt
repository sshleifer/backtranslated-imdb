This movie should be called adventures in Cinemascope. It is like the scriptwriter and also directs the Cliff's Notes page 3 outline and decides that it will be a great vehicle for a film about the Italian Alps. Rock Hudson is pretty good here, but the dialogue doesn't match Hemingway at all. This is a made-up version of Hemingway. Hecht, the screenwriter, is a hack. Watch the 1932 version with Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes. It's a good movie and was made by someone who understood Hemingway and the war in northern Italy. Gary Cooper is very, very good compared to his performance in For The Bell Tolls, where he is stiff as a board and thinks he is in a Western. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you're a Hemingway fan, do yourself a favor and don't look at this movie. Your best bet is to get the unmatched audio CD and just listen to one of the greatest novels ever written.
