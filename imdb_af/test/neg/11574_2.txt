"Scientists at a remote laboratory experiment (add scaly creatures here) and do not create control samples. Meanwhile, a cracked military team / scientist's daughter / bank robber finds their way to the remote and is threatened by giants "One by one they are eaten, all during an" exciting "race not to be inflated by the forces that initially created the monsters." The sad thing is that it is like a dozen movies on the Sci appeared, sounds -Fi channel. I just wonder what is going on. Sure ... I like bimbos and Hollywood Hunk wannabes are eaten by CGI cattle, as much as the next person ... but where's the plot or originality? Granted, there are times when Sci-Fi Channel Shines. Battlestar Galactica, as a little dark, can be very good. Authors continued to pump life into the various Stargate offers, and the latest BBC entry from Doctor Who is surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> Even in the various "giant animal" movies on Sci-Fi, the animation seems to be getting better all the time. Compare the commodo in this movie with the rather small version in the first giant commodo movie on Sci-Fi. <br /> <br /> Well ... how about another plot? Perhaps another difference On a whim I started searching the internet. Under the rubble I found some interesting stories that can appeal to SF fans and work Russian CGI animators at once. I present to the network http://www.macrophile.com/~arilin/archive/metamorphosis-day with a suggestion that they contact the author for the story rights. (The story contains violent images generally equal to those of various Sci-Fi channel offers.) <br /> <br /> The story has subplot, ethical and moral commentary on the nature of humanity and does not end in one of that awful "they actually killed all the monsters ?? moments, but let you totally guess and in a completely different mindset. <br /> <br /> What is generally what science fiction is supposed to do, no ?
