If I could evaluate it zero, I would come from someone who likes shock / exploitation movies and Waters in general should say it's useless. <br /> <br /> It does nothing, serves nothing, an idiot with a camera and an urge to prove its smartness by rebelling against social standards, all this is like it. <br /> <br /> It's totally amateur, both in principle and accomplishment, it doesn't have a point, its excretion for the sake of disgusting, obscene with the whites of a neanderthal, it's useless. <br /> <br /> Someone said Waters was probably "complaining" about all the bad pressures and horrors others had with this movie, but why? If I made a short film depicting a man in a bathroom taking a 10-minute visit, would it really be the same accommodation, but why would I be proud or "cut"? <br /> <br /> It would be because I am so unconscious that I have to convey it so I can say "HA! Take that censorship and mainstream! I'm so rebellious doing what I want and filming it!" No. <br /> <br /> Waters shouldn't be proud of this mess, but the fans of water shouldn't see it, it's useless, it's without any use. <br /> <br /> It's not even fit the culture criteria of art. <br /> <br /> To keep or defend this movie is to be deliberately designed to defend as an anti-culture heard for the mainstream, in modern terms. this movie is the hot topic of movies. <br /> <br /> useless and outdated. A Poser movie claiming it is recognized as rebellion.
