Well, it wasn't a complete waste. Armand was, as usual, very good in the movie ,,, the whole Turkish vs the German thing was kind of strange because I remember seeing Bulgaria at the start of the movie ... dint 'to go back and watch .. The central theme is about the serial killings loosely woven with the whole gang of warfare. Never seen a movie where the characters are Italian, supposed to be Turk, English (American accent and euphemism) with German words. The climax was the most interesting part and there were parts of it that didn't make sense to me yet. Anyway, if you have nothing else to do, you can see this movie.
