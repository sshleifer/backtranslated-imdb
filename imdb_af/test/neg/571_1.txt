** Possible Spoilers ** From Dreamworks and director Peter Chan, "The Love Letter" is a romantic comedy that takes place in a picturesque coastal town in New England where single mom Helen (Kate Capshaw) owns a beautiful little bookstore. One day at work, Helen happens to have an anonymous letter (the 'love letter' of the title) that was somehow filed under a reading bank pillow. After reading the amorous prose in it, she believes it was written to her, deliberately placed in the couch so she can find and think for herself that she knows the identity of her secret admirer. Unfortunately, however, Helen leaves the letter where her employee, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres) finds it, believes it is for her and, of course, thinks she knows who wrote it. Circumstances then bring it to a young man named Johnny (Tom Everett Scott), who thinks Helen wrote the letter to him. And before all this is chosen, you can only imagine the hilarious situations in which all those involved are cast. And I mean to think, because the way this movie plays is getting the audience little of it as it does itself. There are two specific areas in which this romantic comedy fails: it is simply not very romantic, and it is not funny; And this is a powerful combination that causes this film to flame almost from the opening credits. Once the institution and main character (Helen) are set up, it's basically going nowhere for the next ninety minutes or so. By the time you finally find out who wrote the letter and who you could give less. Tom Selleck, Blythe Danner, Julianne Nicholson, Gloria Stuart and Geraldine McEwan, have been completed. It is a pity to see such a talent being wasted on such a small staircase, and it looks bad in the balance. Kate Capshaw, who usually brightens the screen, just looks tired here, while Selleck only comes from a three-day butter that lasts a week. Ellen DeGeneres actually gets away and sees the best of the bunch. It is said that the journey is often a healthier experience than the destination. However, in the case of `` The Love Letter '', it would have been best for all concerned if everyone stayed at home first. I rate this one 1/10.
