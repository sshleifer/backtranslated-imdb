This movie was horrible, it was sorta like accidentally watching a gay porn waiting for the girls, but they just didn't come. I waited for almost two hours for the damn scarecrow .... they just didn't come. Instead, it's just a dumb ass walking through a dead wheat field with a camera. It's a blend of Blaire witch and a bad episode of the twilight zone. And the best part is that from October 23, 2005, they started filming a successor, don't be fooled by the box, even if it looks exactly the same as the first dark harvest, it's not lion gate bought the maize : the movie and had the brilliant idea of ​​leaving it as the successor of the original dark harvest, which I thought was funny ........ The only thing they thought was that they were both in a wheat field was shot. Movie won't deter your crop as the first one stays away !!!!!
