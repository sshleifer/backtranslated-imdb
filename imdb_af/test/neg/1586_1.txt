I caught it on Cinemax late at night ... nothing else was happening, so I had pretty much no choice. Bottom line, horrible plot, slow, wasting good movie and actors' time. In short, don't even bother with this one. It's too bad that we can't give zero as a rating; this one is really not worth it, even a consideration !!!
