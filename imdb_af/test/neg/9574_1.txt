Old bat changes to younger OK, look at girl after drinking a drink. This movie was terrible. The scary. The camera work turned my head. And it features the longest, most ominously boring comic strip tease ever made to film. Piero Vivarelli should be ashamed to fix it. Eduardo Manzanos Brochero should have been blacklisted just to write something so terrible. Don't rent this movie, the only exception I can do about this. If you die and have less than 90 minutes to live, look at this movie cause. it will feel like an eternity and you will beg the Grip Reaper. Come early. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F
