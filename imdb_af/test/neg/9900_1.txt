What is made for TV movie is about every clich√© you can get for a disaster movie. The only problem is that it's not done very well. <br /> <br /> My brain is still insulted by the screens in which Brian Dennehy looks at a computer monitor, looks for weather pattern data and the display on the monitor is stock footage scenes of unrest ala The Weather channels ads. Why look at local news footage from a flushed lane, give insight into global weather patterns? You got me. <br /> <br /> Also, the first two hours of action are some of the worst CGI effects known to man. Look at the semi-truck and the plane that appear to have been delivered to a Commodore 64. <br /> <br /> All the shadows in this "movie" are done with the subtlety of a sledge hammer, the dialogue is forced and I can't think of a lovely character I want to survive in the second half. <br /> <br /> The character I hate most is the stupid woman whose husband is fraud. Perhaps if she lifted her finger every time during the show instead of being a helpless woman sitting all day at the same 10 square feet of kitchen, her husband would not be with the PR representative for a competitive energy company does not sleep. She is so helpless, in fact I want to put her out of her and my misery. I hope everyone in this "movie" dies in the second half.
