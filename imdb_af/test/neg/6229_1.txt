Wow, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, did I mention terrible? You can only tell the DVD cover not to get this movie, but unfortunately it wasn't for me. Well, somebody brought this house to me to watch, and when I looked at it, I just wanted to strangle the person because they used my money. I'll take it back soon, but I can tell it just as I have in mind, because I definitely want to forget it. This movie doesn't deserve to be even terribly named. It's quite awful. Possibly, the worst movie ever. The acting was so, so, so terribly disgusting, as well as the deaths so completely lame and predictable. I didn't even laugh at how bad this movie was, what kind of scare me a bit. Don't see this movie, you are ashamed if you even look at this movie page, and I have EXTREME pity for you when you look at this movie page because you think it will be DECENT. Final word: YUCK !!!!!!!!!!
