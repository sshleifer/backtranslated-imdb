When Jim Wynorski first announced that he would be a new successor to my favorite series of all time, the "Slumber Party Massacre" series, I was ecstatic. I waited for a new installment for literal years. So, production began and many small pieces on the shoot and the actors involved were released until the shoot was wrapped. Then the announcement of a title is changed. No longer will this new successor be called "Slumber Party Massacre IV", but "Cheerleader Massacre". I was a little disappointed, but with a different title it would be a very small price to pay for a movie I had been waiting for so long. I was still seeing the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> Perhaps a month ago, some very sophisticated copies of the movie were released to some extremely lucky viewers who had to watch the movie months before its release date. A few reviews on the net and judging them, began to be terrifying at Jim Wynorski's "Cheerleader Massacre". <br /> <br /> Tonight I got the movie in full length for the first time and I still scratch my head. As I read in another review, "Cheerleader Massacre" is definitely NOT a new installment in the "Slumber Party Massacre" series, but a shooter flickers everything on its own. And a bad one about it. <br /> <br /> Before I get the details of the movie, let me first say what a big fan of Jim Wynorski's movies is. I always thought of him as a true camp genius, with almost every time a winner. Yes, his movies are made on clean budgets and do not contain the top notch, but they are fun. They are what they are: camping movies you watch when you want a good time. From the "Sorority House Massacre II", "Hard to Die," to "Chopping Mall," Jim produced the goods on more than one occasion. One of the reasons I was excited about this movie being its latest project. <br /> <br /> "Cheerleader Massacre" (I don't think) reflects any of the movies I saw creating this director / writer in the past. First, the production was extremely cheap and the film was actually shot on videotape, something I've never seen for Jim. The actors were mediocre, at least, and the story was almost laughing. The killer is also extremely stupid and reminds you of your cute grandfather, rather than an escaped lunatic. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie is full of female nudity. It's a Jim Wynorski movie we're talking about, people. But some of the boobs seen here almost seem to have been done in time. There is a very long shower scene, which includes the cheerleading coach, who appears forever and reflects a grim scene in Jim's "Sorority House Massacre II." The girl even bathed her in the same way. <br /> <br /> "Cheerleader Massacre" is also very cleaved, at least. The opening scene is literally something we have all seen in HUNDREDS of the past. An old and a girl who comes out, on the verge of performing their relationship when ... you guess it. They are hacked in pieces. <br /> <br /> Brinke Stevens, whom I have never really considered a great actress, also gives one of her hardest and forced performances in her little cameo. We're talking here possibly. She remembers some incidents her character appeared to police by the killer seen here, while playing the material of the original "Slumber Party Massacre". Why was the original movie footage used if it was definitely not a new "SPM"? I have no idea. There are also two explosions seen in this movie, which I am almost certain of recovering from other films. <br /> <br /> Not only did this film film PHOTO from previous films, but also the films of other films. . Some of the music used in "Humanoids from the Deep" (which is also recycled for "The Coroner") can be heard throughout the film. There are also at least two more that I can't identify, but I've been using before. <br /> <br /> Having put quality in this movie's horrible play, ridiculous story, non-existent gore / special effects and video camera, I have serious concerns about Mr. Wynorski's career. Has the man who helped audiences with films in the past eventually lose his niche? Only time will tell. Oh, and let's not forget his latest movie. A new installment in the "Sorority House Massacre" movies, now titled "Final Exam." I think I see a pattern here ...
