OK, we got JP from Grandma's Son and Chuck from Chuck. I thought this movie would be pretty well founded on the reviews, and it started out pretty high on my movie scale, but about half way I just dragged on so much I lost interest. I actually got so bored, probably because you can immediately see what will eventually happen; the story is really wireless, i skipped in 15 minutes and missed nothing! This film had to be a short work, maybe about 45 minutes to an hour maximum. It starts well and ends well, too badly the filling is soft, dull, dull, and all but time. Some say they like the music; I don't care for jazz and I'm not going to see movies for their score, I'm going for the story and when it's pulled out ... well, ratings fall into my book. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Good open, very close, boring stuffing. Story was cool, but if you didn't know what a quarter of the way would happen, you didn't see too many thrillers.
