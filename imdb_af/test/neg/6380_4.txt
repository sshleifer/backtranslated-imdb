This show has shown that it's true colors now that the Democrats are in control. It never led the world into IQ, since anyone who thought intelligence was programmed to think one way (which is a scary thing). <br /> <br /> Comedy Central moved it and it turns back to an earlier time once the Democrats have seized power for a reason - because now when the Democrats are screwing up - who are just as regular as Republicans - take Stewart no more shots. Therefore, the ratings fall for both this and the spin. <br /> <br /> Basically, most of the humor is now either paralyzed or paralyzed by Sarah Palin jokes - telling all the ratings that Comedians drop. The facts to set it up speak for themselves. The Jay Leno show that did the same kind of humor is about to be canceled. The ratings for Letterman & Conan and the performances they follow are down. <br /> <br /> So emperor Stewart is not alone. The problem is that if any of them start actual ripples at the bungling democrats, they can hurry their ratings because the best humor is always at the expense of whose power. The Bush years have shown that the ratings for this show & Colbert, & Letterman & Leno were higher. <br /> <br /> O'Bama did one thing, proving that these shows should be willing to take chances of the people in control as they prosper. Currently, the Daily Show & Stewart is soft, but maybe they'll be happy and Palin will be the first woman president in 2012. Then the lame Palin jokes will be grabbers.
