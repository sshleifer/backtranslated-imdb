**** MILD SPOILERS _ BUT YOU KNOW THE PLOT PROBABLE **** <br /> <br /> Woman is raped and decides to take out her anger on all humanity. Oh, did I mention the rape victim was dumb? This is the problem with MS 45, Thana, the rape victim decides she'll kill men, but is there any logical explanation for any of these? Surely the whole movie would be better if we had Thana, give a voice on why she repulsed a man she was inundated with? There is just not enough development for this plot. <br /> <br /> As you expect from a Ferrara movie, it's not a total waste of time. it is much better than I dig your spear and pseudo-intellectuals will have a field day showing the irony of the woman holding a knife like a penis, like the Thana at the end of a deadly spree . But the script is somewhat stupid and underdeveloped and obstructs any serious comment the movie made
