This movie is a cargo of crap. It is quite disturbing to see that anyone can say that this is one of the best films of the year. What can I say? Badly acting, bad action scenes that are really comical in the end. Forgive me if it was a comedy, then I didn't understand it. If it regretted, I laughed at the regret of the tents! Do yourself a favor - go to sleep instead of watching it! Good night!
