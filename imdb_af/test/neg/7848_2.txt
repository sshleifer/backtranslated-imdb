It must be one of MGM's and FRANK SINATRAS's worst movies. An Oddball musical comedy that fails in almost every aspect. Dumb plot SINATRA has tried to continue its fathers' reputation as a KISSING BANDIT. He is no bandit and does not kiss !! He plays the "nerdy" character as well as what can be expected in the dialogue he has to speak. The playwrights are J. CARROLL NASH and MILDRED NATWICK. They didn't have any more scenes together. I gave the movie two stars because the sets and costumes are superior and one of the songs sung by KATHTREN GRAYSON is "Love is Where You Find It" is sensational. Could have had a repirse of that one. Also, a comic type dance number by RIDCARDO MANTALBAN, CYD CHARISSE and ANN MILLER if fun. So for the reasons and just the reasons, it is visible. KISSING BANDIT is part of the Frank Sinatra early years collection.
