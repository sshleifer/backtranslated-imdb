Yup, that's right people, it's undoubtedly the worst show in television history. If you want to embark on a sad, lonely and indecent hack comedian, try to entertain the masses with half an hour of light and tired social barriers that your coward's cousin comments on the Thanksgiving table, then it may be the look for you. It's like an edgy comedy to my friends, but to be honest, Tim Allen like Richard Pryor. Avoid at all costs. Unless you are a masochis.
