All my friends and several other colleagues think this performance is so good. First, I hate this show !!!!!!! I think I may be the only female life !!! I just watched it because my best friend worshiped it and considered herself the Charlotte character! <br /> <br /> First, the whole plot (if you can call it) is about four women SuperSlut Samantha (Kim Cattrall) who Probably, each STD has available and sparrow, brown and green genitals, since she sex is. She will try everything. <br /> <br /> Samantha is not like most 40 women, even in NY, but if the show wouldn't have a kind of entertainment as Samantha (along with some good NY scenery) is the only reason is to look and it is not reason enough. <br /> <br /> Charlotte (Kristen Davis) is a well-dressed higher class NY idiot who still believes the Pince Charming myth! But sweet and beautiful, she is not, it leaves you foolish, she spreads quite often. <br /> <br /> Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) now this woman is stereotypically angry, but feminist. I think in one episode she's a lesbian, but apparently it's not. What a shame she is almost interesting. <br /> <br /> Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is the most annoying character. I swear I thought I watched Twisted Sister Foreman Dee Snider's more masculine look, cross-band, sissy boy, brother! This is a girl who is looking for, cannot live without your love. Hear a puppy? <br /> <br /> This show is stupid and I like to make it because I hear it. of new women's awakening. It's just sad if you are looking for messy, pathetic, addictive people on the road to costly clothing that cosmopolitan drinks and sounds like an annoying 15-year-old on cocaine as if you're a show ..... .......... Just use protection.
