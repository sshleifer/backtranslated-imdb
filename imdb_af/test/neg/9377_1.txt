This is the only movie I can think of that I finished. I was raging with anger about wasting money and time from myself and everyone involved in making it. No wonder Alan Moore refused to do anything with V for Vendetta (a phenomenal movie) after this debacle. <br /> <br /> It's not bad in an entertaining way like Showgirls. It's bad in a way you want to cling your eyes. Plot holes the size of planets. The worst script in memory. Dreadfully acted by decent actors. Visual that should be good, but somehow flop. <br /> <br /> It could have been so good ...
