Stay away from this movie at all costs. I was suckered into watching this movie in a bet to see which one of us knew the "worst movie of all time". Needless to say this one won hands. It is long and drawn out, and has no purpose or plot of what I can collect. A movie about a killer who has been raised from a fetus who has grown outside the womb does not have any place in you. If you are very bored and have no life, watch this movie. But if you keep your common sense, stay away.
