Another son of Sam is definitely not an Oscar winner. Technically, it's terrible. The acting is also not too good. But there is something about it that makes you want to look more (like a car wreck). The ridiculous close-ups of the murderer's eyes are more funny than anything. If you're looking for a fright ... it's not the movie for you. It is very obscure and almost impossible to find. I'm sure there's a reason for this. For a while it is titled HOSTAGE. No matter what you call it, it's still a bad choice for entertainment. It might be good for a MST3000 party or something. Can you believe they would use such a title as another SAM's son? If it didn't write exploitation, I'd eat my hat. I remember when it was shot in Belmont, NC. Many local personalities are used as talent.
