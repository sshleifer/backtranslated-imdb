There is absolutely nothing about this whole piece of waste, and the only thing worse than seeing this movie is seeing it in the English class. It's literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It completely ignores and ignores any themes it may offer, so the story is just really boring. Thanks, the 80s are over, and God saves what man was born as James Bond III.
