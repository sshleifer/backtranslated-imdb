I honestly understand why people like this show so much. A friend of mine watches it and since I like sci-fi, I have been trying to see how the plot of the show is promising, but in reality it's really a very boring show. The only thing that will keep you awake during this show is the video game-like CGI effects and the complete over-exploitation of muppets. Note that I call it muppets because they really look like muppets, not like the strangers they should be. <br /> <br /> Speaking of what; the muppets and makeup effects are terribly overused in this show. You have the man who can best be described as an alien / dwarf hybrid, you have a pale girl who looks like a cute vampire girl, you have a floating potty-mouth-frog-alien ... It feels just very unnecessary and even to the point that you are distracted from the whole storyline from a lost astronaut. <br /> <br /> Each episode is also too much of a single. The creators of this show made it so that every episode feels almost like a whole different show. At least to the point that you see the main characters / muppets again, it is. The whole plot about the main character to come back is too much to push in the background on points. The acting is also very bad. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: If you want good sci-fi, just look somewhere else. It's not even a real sci-fi, as the show is more like fantasy elements with all the puppetry and strange dreams. And if you just want to see muppets, I suggest you look at the Muppet show and feel that this horror of a show has come to an end. <br /> <br /> By the way; does nobody have dejavu's with the concept of a living spaceship? Ohyeah that's right; Doctor Who started that concept almost 30 years ago! This show is like a collection of sci-fi remains. Excerpts and events that have been abandoned for good reason are just to be picked up by this terrible show.
