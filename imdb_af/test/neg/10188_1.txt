This movie was a big bait and switch. I rented it because of Rebecca St James, a popular Christian singer. I met her and wondered what she would do in a UFO movie. Well ....... <br /> <br /> I think she played in this movie to help a friend's friend or friend. My first idea that this movie wasn't what it was supposed to be was when I saw the special effects of the UFO meetings. Wink! As the movie progressed, I noticed how plastic the actors were. It was funny that almost everyone was wearing solid colors in the movie. (There are a few exceptions). <br /> <br /> Rebecca was verrryyy disappointing. She is always found in the house and does not show the realistic facial expressions of someone whose husband has returned. Will she never leave home? <br /> <br /> I had to turn off the movie several times to complete it. I hope Rebecca doesn't believe the message of this movie - believe in what we believe or suffer and go to hell. Jesus spread a message of love and hope. His message inspired others to change out of love, not to fear.
