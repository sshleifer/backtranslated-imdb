Mario Racocevic of Europe is the only user who has made a comment so far and covers the main points of the film. Another difficult movie to buy in the UK. I had to have a Swedish branch through 'Midnight Video'. I went to the post office and bought a title for this and a similar title at SKR30 only. <br /> <br /> This movie goes under many "aka's", depending on when and where it is marketed. I had previously bought "The Bloodyucker leads the dance" (which you will find if you search on Imdb under "people" and input "Krista Nell"). The actor who plays the Earl on his private island in the latter movie, has his words called Italian in English by an actor with an unmistakably sad and rather tired sounding voice. I smiled when I heard the same voice speaking on the English soundtrack as the police inspector who killed the prostitute's murder in the police film. Of course, my choice was to see another outing through the dreadful Krista Nell. <br /> <br /> There are quite a few unconditional subplots in the film of extortion / extortion, messy affairs with girls' moms, a motorcycle hunt that leads to a gangland hit, a gang image by a " client's "motorcycle friends, messy photography, cross decoration by transvestites, etc. that gives a taste to this movie that is summed up in a word. SLEAZE (but artistic sleaze). The former contributor enjoyed this movie, but the low rating suggests that other Imdb fans did. not without explaining their "wheres and whyfores". Personally, I thought there were too many subplots and not enough in the main story and the proportion of these subordinate characters to the central plot and the development of their screen characters. Also, a professional movie editor was needed because some of the screens were too long, made their point, so the movie appeared in places; eg the scene of the dancing transvestite. Krista Nell appeared in a fruity scene with a client, but it is just a vignette and I wanted more of her, the director and the script. <br /> <br /> I love the political inaccuracy shown in older movies (it's 30 years from her making) eg smoking in offices and the way some characters respond to the office! I suggest 4/10 as a more realistic review and I have awarded it as such.
