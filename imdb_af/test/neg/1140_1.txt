The other night I watched this movie on television for the first 30 - 40 minutes and can agree that it is by far the worst of the series. Not one of them is funny, even Randy Quaid can't save this mess. Eric Idle was not funny in N.L. Euro. Vacation, and he's even worse here. The only funny scene is where they are at the airport, and a man dressed as a Santa walks through the camera shouting: "Has anyone lost it?" as he holds a prosthetic leg ... <br /> 1/2 a star from ****
