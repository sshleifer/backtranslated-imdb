The recent death of Stephen Bach, one of the producers of HEAVEN'S GATE, raised the ghost of at least a partial resurrection of the reputation of the cursed film. In addition, the original version, the "long version" has recently been shown on TCM which, in all likelihood, has exposed the film to its biggest audience ever. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie when it first came out at a packed show in a 3rd Avenue theater across Bloomingdales street. I think it was released on Friday and withdrawn the following Wednesday. Maybe it wasn't an honest release, but it was and is a terrible movie. To see the full version recently confirmed the verdict and with more than thirty years of experience watching and writing about movies, I can better why. <br /> <br /> First, there is the dreaded phrase "mise-and-scene" whose definition is so simple at the same time, but so amorphous that it even comes after it is defined. Actually, this is all that happens before a camera. For example, a crowd of extra will be given a piece of action, just to walk on the pavement and a place to start. When the assistant director shouts action, the extra will go through their action. If there is another, take the extra back to the starting point and go back to "action". All the extras do it. Then say a taxi ride to the pavement and the star walks out and embraces another principal while the crowd does extras their thing. This is mise-and-scene. In the theater they call it blocking, but the theater is much more multidimensional. <br /> <br /> The importance of defining mishap and scene is because French critics have developed their theory of the author, the opposite of an author was a metier-and-scene, even more deviant than called a "traffic police". An author was intimately involved in the meaning of a movie and by the directors' work distinguished a theme or themes. The metier-and-scene was basically a company that delivered to him paper filmed on paper. This is the difference between saying John Ford and Sam Wood. <br /> <br /> The second point is how director Michael Cimino is in the position of directors. Cimino first received the first million dollar TV brand for the first time. It depicted a Chevrolet waving in the Grand Canal in Venice. This commercial never appears on any list of the best TV ads of all time and is just because of how expensive it was and how completely exaggerated it was. The effect is like that of a three-year-old girl who came out to entertain a company that gets her biggest reaction when she whistles her dress over her head. Fun for a three year old, embarrassment for a thirty year old. So Cimino was praised early for spending a large amount of money for a few over-the-top images and so he learned. <br /> <br /> His first film, THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT (1974) has a scene where Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges are passengers in a frantic car driving back and forth until it drives off the road and the driver opens the trunk full of rabbits that he shoots one by one. I had the feeling that if the producer, Eastwood, did not enter, the scene would have been until every rabbit was killed. <br /> <br /> What brings us to HEAVEN'S GATE. I think watching the movie on a DVD, like a mini-series, can be impressive. This is because screens with such a dense mise-and-scene are aimed at every scene like an encyclopedia, it is just exhausting to sit nearly four hours of this. It's like sex, at one point it just gets a blow. There is the opening of 40 minutes, which takes place at Harvard. Brilliantly photographed at Oxford, this is something of a non-sequitur. I personally favor the artistic way to unfold a story as opposed to the more commercial _ "Now I'll tell you what I'm going to tell you about" most movies. However, the entire preface adds to just one line - Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt went together to Harvard. Now twenty years later? All the time, money and effort, not to mention all the audience's attention and energy just to deliver this almost useless piece of information. <br /> <br /> Then there's the scene in the street between Kristofferson and Masur, which just goes on with a populous city background extras and horse-drawn vehicles in the background in continuous motion to deliver a little bit of exponential information . It's just as exhausting. There is only one scene after another like this. It's like eating a 30 pound pizza. Then there are these long conversations of inconspicuous details and incomprehensible, inexorable dialogue, which continues and goes on and is exhausting and boring. <br /> <br /> Of course, a single scene looks extremely brilliant. Overall, it's a rich piece to convey laudable articles. Faced with the possibility of fast forwarding through the tedious bits or turning it off when the mise and scenes are beaten, it is basically painless. But don't let anyone tell you it's a good movie. When I saw it in 1980, there was a man who was in front of me at the scene where Kris Kristofferson was on his horse and he turned the other one and then done it about six times. "It's symbolic," he said, "he doesn't know which way to go." It's basically the core of every Heaven's Gate criticism. <br /> <br /> Watch it, if you have to, but be warned, it's not a movie that has come of time, it's a Stinker that will smell forever. <br /> <br /> Historically, HEAVEN'S GATE is inaccurate. I recommend the book BANDITTI OF THE PLAINS by Asa Mercer to the Johnson County War.
