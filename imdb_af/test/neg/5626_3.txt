Let Freedom Ring probably be made with the best intentions, but it sends a strange mixed message into the final product. <br /> <br /> The people at a western town where the railway crosses are overwhelmed by the arrival. from immigrant railway workers, work on the railroad is financed by robber baron Edward Arnold. There are a few farmers and farmers whose land stands in the railroad way and these people are briefly treated by Arnold's hired men. One non-registered man is Lionel Barrymore, whose son Harvard comes a lawyer and is ready to accept the farmer's case. Only Nelson Eddy decides the best way to fight is to go to Zorro. on the bad guys. But unlike Charles Butterworth, no one knows he's the Wasp (a very interesting choice of names that way). <br /> <br /> What Arnold's did was use the proven methods of the eastern political bosses to vote for the immigrants. Nelson's idea is simple, if the immigrants just know the truth about what a bad old Arnold is, they agree with the original settlers and beat the alien urban political machine in their midst. He kidnapped newspaper editor Raymond Walburn and took him and the press to a mountain cave where some subversive newspapers were printed and distributed. <br /> <br /> The railway workers are a real mixed forest immigrant, not the West or the Irish. The Chinese work east as history has it. It's a real United Nations working on Arnold's railroad. The workers are envisaged by foreman Victor McLaglen and Nelson has the trivial task of making a little sense in him as John Wayne did in The Quiet Man. <br /> <br /> Of all the movies that played with Jeanette and Nelson certainly came in history as a duo, which was the worst of what they did at MGM. Nelson is about to be hanged with Barrymore for crimes that are at best unlimited, but certainly nothing to be hanged on. And Virginia Bruce, who plays the Nelson's friend, saves the day with a version of My Country Tis or Tea that the immigrants participate. In the face of an uprising she paid for immigrant voters, Arnold pretty rationally tackled and left the town to build his railway somewhere else. <br /> <br /> I'm not kidding you, it's the end here. What's the message, agree with the settlers and lose your job with Arnold? But somehow you get here? <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wonder if 20 years after the incidents of this movie occur and the town settled in a sleeping water from the west, while some towns where the railroad came there are cities. , that the good citizens of the village did not reconsider what Nelson Eddy did. If they did, they probably track him down. <br /> <br /> Of course, Nelson is in good voice and has a variety of concert and popular pieces to sing, including a ballad for the immigrants written by Sigmund Romberg. , Where else, but here. The song is a warm tribute to an immigrant who has made good in his adopted country. Bad, it didn't have a better place. <br /> <br /> The almost platinum blonde Virginia Bruce, I'm sure called here. And I'm sure Jeanette MacDonald was just as fortunate that she didn't accompany Nelson on this trip.
