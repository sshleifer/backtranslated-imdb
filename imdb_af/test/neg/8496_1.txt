Mr. Kennedy has to stop with bad movie writings. What did he think? It's a movie that's not the "hey, I have an idea, let's start a sequel". If there was a ZERO rating, I would like to give it, but I think I will settle for a generous one. It seems these days if there is a goat that will be made, the performing artists will dig an old hit and run through a set of writers and see what emerges. (Hey, I said "hit and run!" Kinda describes how I felt when this movie ended!) How this piece of waste ever saw the light of day is beyond me. It's filled with unpleasant humor, weird animation and jokes that don't take you completely along a confusion. If you're being dragged into this movie and someone is paying for you .... fine .... but it's still more painful than a brick in the forehead. However, if you plan to pay your own earned money, look for a better alternative.
