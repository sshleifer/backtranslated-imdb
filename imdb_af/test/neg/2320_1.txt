For some reason my father-in-law gave me a copy of this band. I think, because my big uncle, Buddy Baer, ​​was the giant in this movie and my father-in-law thought I would like to see it. I had a child years ago and didn't like it either. <br /> <br /> My son, then two, watched it and was addicted. Every waking moment in front of the TV, this horror video played. I went with the songs held in my head. The two "leaders" were worse than a junior high stage review. The dancers looked like rejections of an Ed Wood horror movie and Abbot and Costello phoned their parts. Luckily I could deduce my son long enough to lose this videotape. Frankly, I think it was The Ring's band. <br /> <br /> To correct another reviewer, Buddy Baer is not the UNCLE of Jethro (Max Baer, ​​Jr.) his father. 0 out of 10.
