The credits at the end read "ALL directed by Shigeru Izumiya". It's an appropriate way to phrase it because it looks like filmed material from several projects is somehow thrown, hardly even trying to make it all one consistent work. It feels more than one of those music fiction items marketed as feature films to pay for those video ads. Right here we lack the marketable music and live performances, except for one scene, which can be marketed as well as a strange music video in Japan. Whatever. <br /> <br /> It makes sense. Visually, it is also not too special, although it has moments (for example, the female creatures with the "bed powder" dead bed and a little morphing) throughout and it definitely has an industrial feel to it. I usually call the effects dilettantish, but what this film does in this regard is baffling more than anything else. You remember the cheap video effects from the 70's and 80's music videos that made them look so dated, like a picture in a picture moving through the screen? There are many of these types of effects here, and without any clear reason. The half of the apparent effort comes in the form of a photo collage. The pictures look like album covers. Whatever. <br /> <br /> I don't know about the subtitles of the version I saw. The Chinese (or whatever those hieroglyphs) sometimes look as though nothing is even said and the English often comes without the Chinese. The English subs talk a lot about life without death (is it possible?), And a mind without a body closest to an understandable conflict between characters in this movie. One man (a scientific dude) says that life without flesh is dead while another man (a metamorphosing dude) who claims his mind is outside his body, now that he has blown the "death powder" in his face and that he now knows the secrets of the flesh and what not; Metamorphosing Dude is visible on the scientist's claim. Whatever. <br /> <br /> Erm, The End - All written by Perception de Ambiguity
