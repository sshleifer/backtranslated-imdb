Another sadistic and ultra-sloppy late 70's / early 80's revenge movie ?? Wes Craven certainly launched a popular trend with his "Last House on the left". Although "Terror Express" is more than a rip-off of other rip-offs, such as "I Spit on Your Count" and especially "Night Train Murders". Storywise, this movie has absolutely nothing new to offer, and the only thing to do for director Ferdinando Baldi was to increase the sleaze factor by a thousand! It's really just a soft core piece that gets a little rough near the end. On the night train of Rome three hopeless imbecile loser run amok. They attract the male travelers and make the women cruel. Things get a little out of control and a travel sentence comes to the rescue of a prostitute still being screwed by the three. It's a very easy movie and there wasn't even enough budget to buy some bags of false blood. These kind of films are generally notorious for the brutal rape series and the discriminatory behavior towards women, but the sex in Terror Express is not disturbing at all. On the contrary, these 'rapists' spend more time pleasing their victims and then getting themselves! The music is wonderful, the dialogues are unintentionally hilarious and the characters are the most ridiculous I've ever seen. The villains are eyelashes and the train passengers are so motionless, they look like part of the set. If you get your exploitation as slim as it gets, it's your movie. But your hunger for blood and controversy will definitely not stop. Terror Express must be in the porn section of video streaming.
