There are some great Canadian movies. There are some crappy kids. Last night I watched one of the mad. It wasn't the typical Canadian movie where it was so different by being arty. This movie was trying to be a kind of Hollywood gangster movie. It was terrible. <br /> <br /> From the start I felt it would be a bad movie. It has some of the baldest dialouge that a movie can have. There was this voice over for one scene and then it never returned. It always makes me mistake when filmmakers just vote when they can't think of another creative way to tell a story. <br /> <br /> I know they are in the Canadian movie industry, I have to support my fellow brothers, but this movie is messed up. The point of departure is something like a Soprano's episode, but not realistic. Some banker's mafia boss dad is on his deathbed and commands the boy to make the business legit. Not so original. And the workers complain about it, but they just take the fact that they will soon be out of work like nothing. To make it legal, they use extortion. Irony. But not the good kind. Then a freak show girl who had a terrible Elvis wig and birthmark covering half of her face robbed the main character and kinda raped him. Anyway, for some reason, like this girl, this guy likes. Then this banker hangs with a hooker when he has a beautiful future wife at home. But he fell to the hooker because the hooker dressed him like a man and made him makeup. She pinched him with a few pictures of him wearing bra and panties. Yet he still loves her. He also has no reason to leave his fiancee, but he does to be with the hooker. <br /> <br /> There was no action or sex for a movie about organizational crime and sexual fetishes. It was like a last night Cinemax porn movie without the good stuff. The sexual scenes aren't hot or sexy. It was too amateurish. The movie had nothing for it, just the lame plot. <br /> <br /> I don't think it was the actor's fault. I think they had a terrible script to work with. The most striking was the ridiculous characters. The bad man's name was Uncle Bunny or something. But the name wasn't important. It was they all were clich√©. The film was all over the film, and fellow filmmakers laughed aloud at some of the movie's "serious" moments. Then, worst of all. It had to be the cheapest end. If you can ever remember playing shoot like a child with either imaginary guns or toy guns. It was basically the end of the movie. But I was more than happy it ended, and I had to warn my fellow Canadian not to waste time or money.
