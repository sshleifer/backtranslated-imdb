Except for the bright looks, this display had little to recommend. The writing was condescending and winding. Without exception, the characters were shallow and unsympathetic. The female characters came from the worst. Reduced to pampered, selfish airbags whose soul ambition to walk around in slippers and stilettos, and try to sack a man. This aspect of the show is all the more curious as the series was produced by two women! The acting was mostly boring and humorous, with the role-playing one-dimensional characters attacking every scene on the same note. This is not quite the actor error. If they had more time to develop the characters and the storyline, a little injection of style and humor added, MVP might have been a hit. What we are left with is something flat and vague unpleasant.
