Return to Sender, a.k.a. Convicted, is almost imperfect. The one good thing about this particular movie was that I was never bored. It is said that the reviews that this movie achieves as a low-budget success did not see the same movie I saw. <br /> <br /> Instead of writing a review and telling what is happening and working and doing, I'll just comment that nothing works. There are plot holes in this movie that you can drive a semi-door. The acting in the film is not very good, although it may be a result of a script that is so poorly spoken that it could be ghost by George Lucas. There was no need for exceptional sets or costumes for this particular movie and everything looked appropriate. Did I mention that there were a few plot holes? By the end of the movie, you wonder how a blind man can be such a good shot with a shotgun, why Kelly Preston trusts Aidan Quinn, why she would fall asleep the night before her client had to be killed, how Aidan Quinn can drive 400 miles for a short while with a car breaking down during the rest of the movie, why not Aidan Quinn with a fifth instead of a bunch of nips, etc. <br /> <br />. With Al said, this is definitely a B movie, and a terrible one about it. The unfortunate thing is that it's just not bad enough to be good. If you appreciate your time, please leave it as a public service message to stay away from this one.
