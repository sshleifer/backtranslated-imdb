Carol (uncovered the "e" who usually appeared at the end of her first name) Lombard as a woman who was thrown out of society because she left her husband for a concert violinist (Roland Drew) who has since been a down and-out alcoholic, and torn between her love for him and the importance of New York crime, Kingpin Robert Armstrong (top-billed). It is almost a summary of what was wrong with the earliest talkies: stiff direction, immobile cameras, staggering and ridiculous slow delivery of lines. At that stage, the audio staff told the directors that their actors were talking every line s-l-o-w-y-y and didn't even start talking their own line after the previous actor had completed theirs. For about five years, it could be an interesting movie, but director Howard Higgin faithfully follows his sound record's dictates and systematically undermines the talents Lombard and Armstrong watched from their later movies. "The Racketeer" was made in 1929, a year which, despite the transitional problems from quiet to sound, gave us some legitimate masterpieces ?? Vidor see "Hallelujah !," Mamoulian's "Applause," Wyler's "Hell's Heroes," Capra's "Ladies of Leisure" ?? all of directors with strong enough wills to tell the sounding board dictators to be filled and of course to speak and act their actors. Sorry, Howard Higgin wasn't that strong; As it is, a quick-acting actor like Armstrong looks through the ridiculous way he said to speak, but one can't wonder where the 50-foot gorilla is when Armstrong needs him.
