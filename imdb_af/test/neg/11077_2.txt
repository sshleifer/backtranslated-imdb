I can't tell if "The Cavern" is a ripoff of "The Cave" because I didn't see it. I saw "The Descent" and it's not terrible, but it's very hard to watch and so is this one. Hard to watch, as in, there is very little light and very fast movement, so you are hard to tell what you're looking at. There are times when I think, you need to be scared, judge the music, but fear what? Bad camera work? Poor lighting? If this is the case, it must be the scariest movie. The story is that a lot of cave investigators go to a cave in Kazakhstan (their home of Borat) and make their descent, but there is (of course) something about it. And what is it? One man says it is a wolf / bear hybrid, it is just before being torn apart, but whatever it is, you can't see. And just when you think (or hope) ends the movie, as the screen gets dark for a bit, you see the two remaining lots (the two women) somewhere in Betty and Wilma clothes wake up and start trying their way out to find. from wherever they are. They drink water and start eating something until they find out what it is and start popping .... and then the mystery of what appears in the cave and you will just be amazed. Maybe, maybe not. Dumb silly .... I think I'm pretty good at cave pictures at this point, 2 out of 10.
