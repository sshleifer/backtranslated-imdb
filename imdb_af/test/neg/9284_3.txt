Martin Lawrence is not a funny man I have Runteldat. He has just too much on his head and he is too angry to leave his words early in the game. He is trying to make fun of critics, which amounts to "f *** them". Then he continues with rather primitive sexual jokes on smokers with throat cancer and it just goes off the mountain. 10/03
