All I can do is the sentiment already expressed by some of the other commentaries. It is the city of God met happy days. The bipolarity of the relentless scoundrel (one minute a relentless killer, the next minute a luv's diaper commercial) is totally unconvincing. You can approach it in one of two ways: (1) A sharp, realistic movie has become juicy; or (2) a juicy, ABC-school special with profanity, violence and animal cruelty. Whatever it does not fly, does it? Why did it receive so much praise? Like others implied, it becomes the "conscience voice" of the west. Show us photos of poverty to contrast with our soft, double-sided theater seats and 44 oz coke, and we'll complain in a heartbeat. But - o - don't forget to make a tuxedo because the bitter pill of reality (embarrassed as it is) is hard for us to swallow. <br /> <br /> I'm terribly disappointed that this movie will receive so many awards and awards, especially if there are much more deserving works out there. All I can say is: beware of any film that receives awards (Hollywood Oscars = cattle, syrupy tops. Cannes Film Festival = beard-stroking, artless propaganda). To find the right jewelry, you have to work hard.
