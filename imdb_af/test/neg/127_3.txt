I love sci-fi and am willing to do a lot. Sci-fi movies / TV are usually underfunded, undervalued and misunderstood. I tried to do it, I really did, but it's good TV slide like Babylon 5 is after Star Trek (the original). Dumb prosthetics, cheap cardboard sets, stylized dialogs, CG that do not match the background, and painfully one-dimensional characters cannot be overcome with a sci-fi setting. (I'm sure there are some of you out there who think Babylon 5 is a good sci-fi TV. It's not. It is click and uninspiring.) While American viewers like emotion and character development, sci-fi is a genre that doesn't take seriously (see Star Trek). It can handle important issues, but not as a serious philosophy. It's really hard to care for the characters here, because they're not just foolish, just missing a spark of life. Their actions and responses are wood and predictable, often painful to watch. The creators of the Earth KNOW it is rubbish because they always have to say "Gen Roddenberry's Earth ..." otherwise people will not continue to look. Roddenberry's ashes must turn into their orbit, as it is boring, cheap, poorly edited (watch it without advertising paths bring this home home), which slows down Trabant's obscurity in space. Spoiler. So, kill a main character. And then bring him back as another actor. Jeeez! Dallas all over again.
