The RIDDEL is written and directed by Brendan Foley in what appears to be the mysteries of Charles Dickens's novels in a contemporary story, but the effort is harmed by the two timelines in which the 'mystery' is unraveled. In spite of a film by well-known actors, who try their best to draw it directly to DVD movies, the end product is a long, boring, amateur rubbish that can only be regarded as entertainment if viewers are fans of the film. like remembering other movies. <br /> <br /> Mike Sullivan (Vinnie Jones) is a journalist confined to reporting dog racing while dreaming of major reporting missions. A series of similar murders include an old friend of Mike's - Sadie (Vera Day) who runs a pub on the banks of the Thames. He has just discovered an old valuable unpublished manuscript by Charles Dickens and has a heart of gold. sandwiches go to such pathetic creatures as an old blunt-sand comb (Derek Jacobi). Sadie's murder attracts Mike to the role of detective journalism. With the help of policewoman Kate (Julie Cox), he is launching the investigation into clues he finds in reading the Dickens manuscript. To disrupt the flow of this rather simplistic story, the use of flashbacks to Dickens's time, because Dickens (Derek Jacobi) tells a very personal story of strange murders. The parallel between stories and the cross-cast between actors may have worked in the hands of others, but the finesse of this kind of venture escapes writer / director Brendan Foley. He ended his story to an end (finally) with a tired Hollywoodesque ending. <br /> <br /> In addition to Jones, Jacobi, Cox and Day, the film has somehow attracted the attention of Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Flemyng, PH Moriarty and Mel Smith: their contributions are minimal but pleasing. It's a little treacle that makes the viewer wonder how movies of this quality ever get funding. Grady Harp
