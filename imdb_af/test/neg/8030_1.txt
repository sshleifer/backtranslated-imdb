It's the one movie I almost walked out of, and my friends wouldn't have been with me in the movie. Normally, even if I don't like a movie, I think it's still worth the trouble. So, you can really claim that it has given every chance to redeem itself. But with the Million Dollar Hotel it was so terrible that I just wanted to end the experience as soon as possible. I think I would not have been so disappointed if this film was made by a lesser director, one of which I did not like so much. But come from Wenders, it was increasingly shocking to see. I know Bono of U2, a good friend of Wenders, who wrote the script on this horrible movie, and I wonder why Wenders allowed him, like girlfriend, like the two. "Keep up the day, Bono", is a sentence that easily comes to mind while you see this mess. Pretentious, disjointed, a mish-mash of every possible contemporary movie stereo, a naive and transparent attempt to get so fierce and brave, with the most annoying characters I've ever seen, especially the leaders, Jeremy Davies, Milla Jovovich and Mel Gibson, none of whom I normally like. The happiest end I would have wished would be that a nuclear bomb was dropped on their collective heads to ease it as soon as possible. Positive, the first five minutes of the movie is extremely good, with an extremely moving U2 soundtrack. But the film's opening shots make the rest of the movie (which takes a spectacular nose-dive from now on) more and more disappointing, as it is a promise of movie quality that has never been delivered, even close.
