Once I read the novel, I do not care, for the purposes of filming, how different it is written, as long as it complies with the plot or at least includes it. For reasons known only to Hollywood, important parts of the story are completely ignored, and another story line added. The reason why this novel has passed the test of time is undoubtedly due to the interactions of both characters and plot as a whole. To interfere with this structure is to destroy the intricate balance of the story line, and thus the intention of the storyteller. Although a matter of opinion, the casting of this film leaves much to be desired. Characters, described as very fat, must at least be made to look so that the character can be credible. The days of slavery cannot be over, or surely, actors of this caliber would have been rebellious in such a tribulation of the story. The face of Marian Halcolme is described as masculine in appearance, ... Tara Fitzgerald's very feminine appearance ring is not true. Again, Laura is fairly described as 'honest', if not 'ethereal', so, with dark hair, she doesn't fit the impression that emerged from the novel. .... Badly done, Hollywood! <br /> <br /> J. Hunter
