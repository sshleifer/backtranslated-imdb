It amazes me that someone would actually consider spending money on such a movie. Really. Let's forget for a moment that the plot doesn't even give a hint of originality. Most of the movies today are based on other films' stories, such a "simple" lack of originality is not such a big deal. <br /> <br /> But I can hardly believe that none of the guys involved in the movie ever got on a plane before it was shot. Because, let's be honest, it would be the only excuse to do something so ridiculous. To be sincere, I think a 6-year-old child with a fake camera with something technical might be much more credible. A few examples follow. <br /> <br /> The scene I really got is when the engines turn off when they recover the plane. When they have to turn them on again, the man on the radio says something like "Ok, press the 1 and 2 buttons on the dashboard". Now, it's not buttons. They should not be pushed, they should actually be pulled up and to the pilot. This is something that only aircraft addicts will know, you say? Wrong. The next scene you can see their fingers pressing the "buttons" ... And of course, the so-called "buttons" do not move at all! Not even a single millimeter! (And notice that I didn't even mention that aircraft engines aren't like cars, just turning the key and the magic happening ... You have to do quite complicated procedures to turn them on ...) Now come on guys ! You could at least do the movements !! Not to mention the hilarious final impact, where the plane falls on every single thing along the runway (Light poles along the runway? What are they thinking?) ... And the wings aren't even cut down! It also happened to me, once ... Except the plane was made from Lego! What about the flight attendant? She is actually so knowledgeable that she knows perfectly well where the "aux 1" and "aux 2" assurances are in the middle of the wires behind the cabin. Should we mention the man who can drive an ambulance _and_ fly a plane behind the ambulance with his computer? And how did he turn on the other aircraft engines? <br /> <br /> Really, I could spend hours with these things. It's the dumbest movie I've ever experienced, and I include garbage like Alone In The Dark and other stuff in the list. Want to do yourself a favor? Don't look at it.
