So, it came here. In the top-rated commentary on this movie, someone says "Nishi is an honorable man". Really? It is a man who mainly kills and kills people in the film. He took a short break to rob a bank. Honorable? How do you want your children to go to school with the children of someone who calls it honorable? Wait, there's more! The person also says "we can tell he is constantly thinking." How can we do it? Well, you know that joke? How do you know when a CEO / politician / lawyer lies? "..." She / her lips move. "Well, Nishi's lips never move, so I think that means he thinks. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's the existentialism to keep the hearts of the cult of victimization. Existentialism badly emphasizes that an individual takes responsibility for the consequences of his actions. Not Nishi. Borrows money from the yakuza. What do they want back then? Kill them. Police come out. Kill yourself and your wife. br /> <br /> Really honorable.
