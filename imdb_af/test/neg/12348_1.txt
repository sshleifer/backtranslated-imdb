I was looking for a documentary of the same journalistic quality as Frontline or "Mist of War" (by Errol Morris). Instead, I was upset at this level and naive account of a very complex and disturbing man and his regime: Alberto Fujimori. This movie should be called "The Return of Fujimori". The director assumes that she has made a "perfect" movie because both pro and anti-Fujimori factions are alienated if it is actually a lot of bias and unprofessional work. <br /> <br /> The movie has little important facts wrong: <br /> <br /> 1) She used the so-called "landslide" election of 1995 in which Fujimori was re-elected with 65% of the vote, as " an example of the massive popular support of Fujimori. But we all know now that it is the fruit of a very organized election fraud. <br /> <br /> 2) The film declares that Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) killed 60,000 people. In fact, the Sanlam Commission's final report states that there were 69,280 deaths due to political violence in Peru. 33% of these were caused by SL. This leaves the other 67% in the hands of the police, military and other groups. The fact that she uses the same misleading information that Fujimori used for 10 years is another example of how horrible this movie is. <br /> <br /> For anyone with some training on Peruvian politics and history, Fujimori is clearly a completed manipulator, a vanguard and unrelenting selfishness. His regime was far from democratic. He is still a threat to Peruvian. Despite these facts, the director Fujimori can tell the story. Not only about how he wants the camera to be positioned, but the narrative and direction of the film seems to be part of his political agenda. He always seems to have the last word. There are no journalistic "cojones", just soft questions and undisputed remarks. Where is Oriana Fallaci when we need her? The director, when questioned at the screen, did not hide the fact that she was deeply impressed by Fujimori's charm and intelligence. Yes, she is definitely by him, and you can tell by watching this movie. Obviously, she has a very difficult time digesting the multitude of facts that, according to his responsibility, refer to the corruption, murder and deception that has taken place. She assured the hectic audience that Fujimori was actually a "patriot". When a few minutes earlier, one of the foremost Peruvian journalists was happy to say that Fujimori was a traitor in particular. She said that despite all the accusations, not a single dollar was found on any bank account on its name and so on. It was like hearing the same gang of relentless thugs who ruled the country for ten years. master. It was a sad moment for journalism. <br /> <br /> This film makes injustice to history. It is an insult to hundreds of dead, disappeared or unfair by the Fujimori regime. No wonder she later acknowledged that all Peruvian intellectuals were friends while the film was betrayed. Unbiased? The words "oportunist", "naive" and "denial" are rather in my mind.
