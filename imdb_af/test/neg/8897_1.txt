My only reason to register this site was to write a comment on this movie. I felt I had to get rid of my anger by writing it off me. <br /> <br /> The movie "Baby Cars" just has to be the worst movie I've ever seen. I really believe the script might be a good movie or at least OK, but something happened. What makes it even more strange is the fact that the cast looks good on the paper. Fail to deliver both writing and exercise. There is too much action, it happens to many things and you can't help wondering why that happens. And then the role players, the actors make such a poor effort that you almost start crying. <br /> <br /> If you have too much time at hand, I'll say you can see it. If not - don't.
