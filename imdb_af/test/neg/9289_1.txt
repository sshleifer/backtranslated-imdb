Martin Lawrence can be considered a talented man, but those days are long gone. Runteldat shows a man who immediately tries to play the sympathy card to his fate but takes responsibility for it when he thinks it will benefit his ego. The sad truth is that at this point in his life his best days were behind him: his half-funny performance was dead in the water after his co-star remained and until today he has a career of voting and godly action movies . <br /> <br /> One gets the impression that this concert film was not made to boost Lawrence's career after his humiliation, but rather a childish attempt to clean the air by both trying to save pathetically what is left in his life. and somehow it turns into something to be proud of at a particular moment in which he has shown himself to earn his fame. Unfortunately, the concert is nothing more than a horribly pronounced Martin who carelessly tries to be jokes, calls up pathos, and then claims he doesn't care about anything, because hardcore. The sad truth is that it is the real public embarrassment for Lawrence. The way he attacked the sad pity, made you wish he would just fall to his stage on the stage, move a gun and just work it over again. . There is no real insight into his performance. Like the childish titles, Martin tries to make his ultimate truth witness his own in his path and fail. He'd better wait to wait for the E! True Hollywood story instead of running on a stage and making a fool of himself for the second time. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the saddest thing about this concert movie - or rather career reward - is that Martin doesn't think about it. What was this movie supposed to prove? Unfortunately, his fame was brief. He was a flash in the pan before the underwear incident and now is the only way he can get work, Will Smith or Pixar. They can call such a concert 'Tombstone' because that's what it is. Martin Lawrence just dies here on stage, and this can be an interesting career. Now? Just a pathetic lace note in history.
