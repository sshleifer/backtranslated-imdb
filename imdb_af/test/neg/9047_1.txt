A snoring I saw this piece of terrible, stinky, worthless, mess in the Cameo Movie House (now the famous Crobar Night Club) on Washington Avenue on South Beach in 1980 or 81. I was 17, and my three friends and I laughed here. terrible, coarse, piece of garbage. The theater was on its last legs and there were mostly drunks snoring and sleeping in place. They didn't miss a darn thing. The worst acting ever. These actors deserve the Oscar for the worst, and I mean the worst role players in the history of the theater. Joke was, the theater showed another Mi Mi Lay (a big name at least!) Stinker ... Barf City. Enough said. If you are under the age of 12, you may get some cold fever. More than 12, you will snore after opening credits. It's just amazing that someone spent a penny to make this movie. And to think, it is considered a "cult" class. Yuk !!!!
