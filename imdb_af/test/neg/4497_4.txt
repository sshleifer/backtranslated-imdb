Photography is complete, the acting is pretty good, but in almost every other department, the Greek Tycoon is an urgent drill. Inspired by the true love affair of Jackie Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis, the film is a glamorous, yet absolutely empty, soap opera of the kind that appears all day on TV. Viewers who embrace the whole "celebrity magazine culture" (paparazzi photos and gossip stories about the rich and famous) will undoubtedly find much to make their appetite here. But those who prefer the movie with a little more dust and craft and sniff, will find the 107 minutes a clash of slogans. <br /> <br /> US President James Cassidy (James Franciscus) and his beautiful wife Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) are on official matters in Greece. A ridiculous wealthy Greek shipping company, Theo Tomasis (Anthony Quinn), sees Liz at a festival in his elegant shepherd's house. Despite the fact that both are married to someone else, there is an immediate attraction between them. Later, at a private party aboard his hunt, Tomasis makes his desires known to Liz. Some later, President Cassidy is killed while walking on a beach. Liz is shocked and saddened by his death, but it is not long before she seeks comfort in the arms of her Greek lover Tomasis. Eventually, the two of them are married and their love affair becomes a favorite talk for the world's newspapers, magazines, photographers and wags. <br /> <br /> It is somewhat amusing to deny the power with which the producers of this movie are claiming to be a dramatization of the Kennedy-Onassis story. They wanted the film to be seen as an original story, rooted in fiction. But anyone with a brain can see where the film draws its inspiration. Even Aristotle Onassis himself knew that the Greek magnate is his love life to get the Hollywood treatment (if rumors are to be believed, he actually has a hand in the approval of Anthony Quinn for the Tomasis role!) J. Lee- Thompson is not really the right kind of director for this type of movie? He is better suited for action nutrition such as The Guns Of Navarone and Ice Cold In Alex? but he bumps the proceedings with an uninspired, professional sufficiency. Quinn is very visible as Tomasis; Bisset looks beautiful as the object of his desires; Francis uses his toothy smile and a facade of integrity to make a credible politician. Their performances are good on the surface, but there is little for the actors to do on a deeper level. Just like Tony Richmond's photography, the movie gives an elegant surface shine, as it moves from one exotic region to the next, but most of the scratches show that there is nothing behind the film's shiny exterior.
