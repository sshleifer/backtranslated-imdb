Wow. I just saw Demon Wind a moment ago, and I don't think I'll ever be the same. It has the power to inspire nightmares, but for all the wrong reasons, actually. <br /> <br /> Never before has mankind seen such a greedy change in make-up because it's not a vague reason. Or, so much, bad zombie (?) Makeup that makes you hungry for the Halloween green marshmallows. <br /> <br /> So much naked old lady, that's the thing. But then there was 'The Shining'. <br /> <br /> The plot here is so amateurish that it actually has almost a little charm, just like the dialogue. The last shot of the movie is just as stupid as it is out of description. It is like a drunken college student with a few pals and decides to throw Bruce Willis type of dialogue with (I guess?) Teenybopper dialogue from some Elm Street movie. The result is frightening and it will be really funny if it is meant to be. <br /> <br /> Oh, hey. I will laugh anyway. <br /> <br /> Hell, come with your friends and watch it. But make sure you are drunk first. Or you may be insane. Especially if you are a college film student. <br /> <br /> Cheers.
