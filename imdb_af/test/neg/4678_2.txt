The name of Bad Company's biggest hit album is called "10 Of 6". You just showed up this album and cut the sound on this movie. Most of the songs played in the movie were from this album. I think parents in the 1970s were probably tired of all the period pieces made over the 1930s and 1940s. That's how I feel about movies made over the 1970s. The characters in the movie look like their audition for Danny Terrio. Why is it that films are exaggerating in the 1970s. The only good time I had was "Freaks and Geeks". They cut the television program. It was exactly like things were at high school when I was there in 1980. I was old enough to remember the 70's and no small town was like that. It was completely youth dominated. There were no reactions to the hippies and to the Philly city center. It was more like the 70's I remember as a child. This movie was very boring and cheesy. Sometimes I fell asleep. I don't know why an actor acting in the 70's appeared in this one. He probably tried to make it credible. Walken didn't even appear until the second half. I think the only real thing about the movie was the "baby boomers" was / is a spoiled lot. All the kids in the movie were spoiled. I don't know what they had against their dad.
