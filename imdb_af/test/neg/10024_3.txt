Uhhh ... so, did they even have writers for this? Maybe I'm picky, but I like a small dialogue with my movies. And as far as slasher films are concerned, only a brand new character development will suffice. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, The Prey doesn't offer ?? And if you think I'm hyperbolic, you just have to see it for yourself. Scene after scene, we just get actors standing around, watching pursued and uncomfortable, leaving by any sense of writing. Apart from the names of each other's names when they are separated in the forest (natch), the only cases where these people say something substantive is when one character explains the constellation Orion (clearly plagiarism of Funk & Wagnalls; scintillating slasher fare, no? ) and another rehashes an old campfire story that doesn't even have to do with the plot (wait, what is the plot?) At other times, The Prey actually has the gall to film his characters with the tree microphone just far enough so we can't hear exactly what they say. So we get the whole scene in which the actors murmur! Deliberately! Seriously, I saw more dialogue in a quiet movie. It is as if the filmmakers were sitting in a pub somewhere in Rancho Cucamonga, and one looked at the other and said, "Hey, I have a very good idea for a greedy cover guard. Whole function around it." And ... well, they did. <br /> <br /> To be honest, The Prey probably had some kind of writer on board. I mean, somebody had to repel the scene and label the newspapers. However, I am fully convinced that this film had no editor of any kind. There are bright breaks, boring tableaux, and zero pacing throughout. The filmmakers have nothing else in the "script" to film, so they fill the running time with exhausting taxonomies of the flora and fauna living in the bush where we wild and crazy teenagers are cut and cut. These insects are all filmed in a completely reserved show in straight, no-daylight and without attempted atmospheric photography. If it feels like a science film, it's because it is. I'm pretty sure it's all natural stock footage. All that is missing is a stuffy narrative from a National Geographic parent. <br /> <br /> More exciting material graciously spared from the cutter floor: a scene in which two men discuss cucumbers and cream cheese sandwiches, and another scene in which a supporting character on a banjo rush away, because what feels like a whole minute and a half! A minute and a half! It is very banjoing to commit to starting celluloid, let alone the final cut of the movie! Ways to go, guys! Brevity and concision are the true victims of this festival. <br /> <br /> In the last 25 minutes, the movie is a bit of steam (relatively), in which much of the massacre condenses and where a Rave-off of Béla Bartók's "Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta "cut in. Vaudeville's big Jackie Coogan makes a fun appearance as a rocky parkkeeper (it was his last role if you could believe it). And there are some nice gory moments, including a splashing neck tear and the aforementioned deapitation. The make-up used for the killer (Carel Struycken, also known as the "Lurch" of the Addams Family movies) is also very effective, and makes him look like a strange hybrid of young Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger. Plus, if you end up with wacky, straight-outta-left-field, watch them cover this puppy. You will take a spit, I promise. <br /> <br /> Usually, I love movies that are at this level of inadvertence, but the first three quarters of The Prey is just as relentlessly boring that they pretty much spoil the rest. Overall, it's a big and bad and boring matter, and although it's not bad, it really should only be seen by weakened slasher finalists. Why do we do that anyway?
