I wanted this movie. The previews seem to be marginally funny, but I thought they put most of the funny things in the previews. In this case they did not just do it, but they turned the cuts so they became much smarter than they were in the real movie. I love John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Vince Vaughn, The Rock, Cedric the Entertainer, etc. So I wanted to keep this movie, but it just didn't look like it. <br /> <br /> I've seen Get Shorty and don't care about it. Too slow and unfunny for me. This movie is definitely not better, and if anything, it is worse. There were many opportunities for some good comic moments, but it didn't take any of them. <br /> <br /> The play was good, but even John Travolta was cut off. Cedric was okay, but he was also ruled to be really funny. Vince Vaughn and the Rock were pretty good and ready to be funny, but they just made it succeed. I wish they had the chance to go through the funny things they had set up, but instead they just went back to the same old thing and back to just put Vaughn and Rock to be funny (but never allowed It really doesn't deliver punchline or comedy). <br /> <br /> Overall, this was a very disappointing movie and I'm glad I just watched it on video. At least it was cheaper than the theater.
