So many good actors, so little worth watching. But with a script that misses so much about what made the book special, I don't stick it to anyone on the screen. Although difficult, the book was one of Grisham's only ones I really liked, especially how it caught the taste of a deep southern town, a slightly different world to a coastal urbanite like myself. I also loved the matter-of-fact, naturalness of what is in the book. In the movie characters a "nobility" of personality is given that looks so silent. The villains and foils are flat and one-dimensional. But as with so much of Joel Schumacher's work, authenticity and authenticity are strikingly absent, and each point must be delivered to the mid-section through sledge hammer. So preachy, stilted, and superficial about such a terrible tragedy, I wish someone would do a remake and get the story a little more right.
