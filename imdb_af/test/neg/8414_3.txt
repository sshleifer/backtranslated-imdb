This movie is a bad movie, but to get any nutritional value from it, I recommend looking it back with Rosemary's Baby. <br /> <br /> There is much to see how different directors can draw different representations of the same. actors playing the same characters. Notice Minnie Castevet (Ruth Gordon) and the fine work she did in the first film, against the horrible version in this movie. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to see the same characters played by different actors. What leads me to wonder if someone who was involved with the successor was aware of the first movie and looked at any of them at Rosemary's Baby before doing so? <br /> <br /> If your interest in movies is purely superficial then you would best avoid this one. I have a lot more to say about this movie, but I really don't want to go there.
