This film has moved far too slowly for my taste. The concept of the story is refreshingly different, as it explores the family dynamics of a mentally retarded family member in a way I haven't seen on the screen yet. But the execution of the concept was flawed. Each character was fully developed within the scene of her first appearance, and one had to endure the feeling that each character was drinking water the rest of the way. That is, each character is uncomfortable in her interpersonal relationships with others in the film, which I have found to be a form of emotional and social retardation. I suppose it has artistic merit, given the irony that the story surrounding a mentally handicapped individual is surrounded by above average intelligence friends and family. However, the acting was well done without exception. I agree with other reviewers that cinematography was beautiful. In the summary, I think the movie has strong artistic merit due to its fine-tuning and cinematography, but it fails at the emotional level due to the shortcomings described.
