Why a movie maker with a record like Wes Craven wants to lend his name to a boring collection of clichés, like this is someone's guess. And if he had put any money on it - all £ 50 being watched by the look - he had to hit the director's door for a refund the moment the movie was released. There are many "Alien" rip-offs and this is one of the worst. Even the reputable Lance Henriksen, with a stupid enough character to let his children run a dangerous government lab, can't save it. As a cure for insomnia, it is a 10+. If a piece of quality film makes - forget it.
