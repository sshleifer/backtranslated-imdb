As one of the victims of the entire Enron scandal, my mother forced me to watch this movie with her. How many times can I say terribly? The writing was so weak, using cliche to cliche. The authors seem to be peering this story with some articles about Enron. When we watched the movie, we could complete about half of the one-dimensional characters' lines and thoughts. I realize it was probably adapted from a book, but was the book so bad? I do not know what to say. Not terrible. The best thing about the movie? Shannon Elizabeth actually kept her clothes on. Other than that, this movie gets a big fat F.
