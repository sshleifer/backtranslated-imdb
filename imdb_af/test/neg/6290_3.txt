KK should be at the singing - this whole movie was a great drill. I cannot understand the malice of the boys and the romance between Miles and KK. The sex scene was also not inspired. The end was terribly unresolved. There must be reason to kill. And the boy's whole voyeurism was strange ... the mother always struggled with the boy - don't you think he'll get some Freudian with her? And why didn't someone teach KK how to talk to collision instead of monotone? <br /> <br /> Only I pay $ 1.00 to rent it. <br /> <br />
