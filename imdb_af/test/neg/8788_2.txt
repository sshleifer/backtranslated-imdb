Hubie - like Stanely's troll from Bluth's Troll in Central Park - has the spark of personality to be the main character wearing a whole movie. We have to keep him because he's nice, but it's about everything he is. <br /> <br /> His character design is unattractive. The top of its head is a type of dome smaller than the pudgy bottom of its head. <br /> <br /> And penguins shouldn't have teeth. I know Iago had the parrot in Aladdin's teeth, but maybe it worked because it made him look like his voting factor, Gilbert Gottfried. Hubie, with his little voice (provided by Martin Short), looks funny with that big set of chompers in his mouth. <br /> <br /> Tim Curry, who is usually beautiful to be angry, does a kind of dense surfer dude accent as the villain (maybe a good voice for a comical relief accomplice, not the so-called threatening head villain). <br /> <br /> The whole plot revolves around the hero and villain's love for the female penguin Marina, who is just as boring as both of her writers. <br /> <br /> The worst of all is pacing. We hold back to the villain to see how he threatens Marina even more - this time in dialogue, this time in song ... Barry Manilow can be a good songwriter, but in animated movies like this and Thumbelina, his songs feel limp and listless - especially the ballads. The only song I liked was the 1930's ish "Good Ship Misery" song. <br /> <br /> I read that the distributor made a few cuts in this film against the filmmaker's wishes, and that could have caused some of the issues - although I suspect the real problem is that they are not cut the rest of it;).
