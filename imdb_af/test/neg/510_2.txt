It is disturbing to see so many people giving shamefully high ratings to this movie. Some of the praise uses such distorted arguments (and transparent agendas that deny a simple love for anything that is critical of the US in any way) that it approaches hysteria. <br /> <br /> Hemelsek is a bad movie, it is fundamentally terrible. Endless scenes using extensive shots that serve no purpose, muddy dialogue, scary narrative, no sense of any theme except excess ... <br /> <br /> The high rating of this disaster is a product of revisionist history and temporary shifts in perception. <br /> <br /> For some perspective, Lawrence of Arabia looks before you look at the Sky Gate. You will see how aimless and lost this movie really is. The "issues" it has tried to deal with are lost in a miasma. <br /> <br /> I have no problem with films that are critical of the US, but when a terrible movie gets such undeserved praise due to that element ... it's worth challenging . <br /> <br /> The movie is worth seeing for two reasons; curiosity and as a warning for young filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I saw it for free at home, thought of torture to be in a theater and put it through ... for 4 winding hours!
