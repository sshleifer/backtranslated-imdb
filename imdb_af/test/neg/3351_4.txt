If you look at the cover and read about it, a completely different kind of movie comes up than you get here. Maybe I read the summary for the other movie called "Mausolem" instead. There were two movies of this title at about the same time, with both plots having the main elements in common. But read things about that movie here I know I saw this one and not that one and that movie is even less what one would think a movie with that title would be. I'll be honest, I expect more from a zombie-type picture and you get it to some extent in this movie. However, there are more things involving the occult and strange powers, as the opening scene of the people being taken away by the writer at the beginning of the film will testify. The movie also has the old theme of children going somewhere, which they should not have a crazy party. In this case it is actually a mausoleum. The other movie I don't think has that important feature that plays the prominent role in the movie and I see the score for this one is also higher, but it wasn't the movie I expected yet.
