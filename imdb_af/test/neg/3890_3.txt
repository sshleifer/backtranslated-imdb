Before I begin, a "small" correction: IMDb says Richard Gere is 180 cm tall. Wrong! I passed him 10 years ago, and he can't be an ant over 165. I'm 183, and he looked like a kid next to me. <br /> <br /> Called "Wheatlands"; a suitable title to fill Malick's previous (and much better) movie "Badlands". This movie shows that not all directors have their main purpose to entertain. In fact, some of them have the main purpose of showing wheat in all its splendor. <br /> <br /> The movie is depressed and relatively unfinished, with the mandatory tragic end. Nothing more than an average and predictable love triangle drama, with the male two-thirds of the triangle not surviving the movie. Price for its visual quality; While it does feel realistic about it, there are limits to how playful wheat fields can be. You can shoot them with 1500mm cameras, for everything I care about, but they are still cornfields. <br /> <br /> Gere, which initially looks like a lower-class factory-worker-turned-Wheatfield worker, is pretty sturdy, while Brooke Adams stays away from the movie and is cool, and one wonders how much she loved one of the two hunks. But for those looking for a movie that displays all the glorious colors of a wheat field, look no further: you've found your dream! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading my "biographies" of Richard Gere and other Hollywood intellectual heavyweights, please email me.
