As a Canadian History major, my first thing to say: HISTORICAL FACTS IS NOT ACCURATE! How can a producer do this? The deportation of the Acadian was not in 1759 when we saw Franklin in London, but in 1755! How can he pass it in the movie? The screens in Londo were also useless. Then for the story for anyone reading "Les Anciens Canadian", you have the story line right there. This is the story of La Coriveau, that "witch". Also add a love story and end a tragic relationship between mother and daughter. Sure, it brought tears to my eyes. But that's it. Then it's probably in Quebec City, but it's mostly shot at the Forteresse de Louisbourg. Of course this is a historic place and it is accurate up to the time, but it was clear that the scenes were not all in Quebec City. Overall, if you are looking for a New France documentary, visit: A People's History, a true documentary about Canda and NEw France's history. If you want a love story that will bring your tears, a story in a wonderful forest, look at New France.
