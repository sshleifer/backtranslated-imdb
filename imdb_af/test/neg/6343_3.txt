I know these types of movies sell tickets and make a profit for the filmmakers, but it just won't be a movie about Vietnam. Vietnam was filled with horrors for the men who lived day in and day out. <br /> <br /> This movie genre, Gen Hackman, is a Korean war veterinarian assigned to train a group of Vietnam Vets cargo for a return journey to that country to a group of US POWs at a camp. to be kept there. These guys include a former tunnel rat, a crazy acid droplet sailor, a blonde brown surfer from California and an inexperienced child (Patrick Swayze) who just happened, had a father murdered in Nam. They first practice at a camp in Texas and once in Nam they found out and lost all their weapons. They are able to find replacement weapons and continue on their way to free the prisoners. Most men are found and rescued, but the patch group is mostly wiped out. <br /> <br /> This movie plays like a video game in which you can find out what is going to happen next and who will pop out behind which forest, and who will die and who will live. Vietnam I'm guessing wasn't like a video game ....
