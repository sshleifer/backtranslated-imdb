USA's AZN TV bought the rights to this movie and the network shows it with the English title THE PICKPOCKET. 1997's THE PICKPOCKET takes amateur home movie style movies to incredible levels of unpleasantness. The movie shows a long line of furious walks from an uninteresting, confused man. This main character, Xiao Wu, not only runs aimlessly. Viewers will unfortunately soon realize that Xiao Wu has an unparalleled talent to look for, and remains dormant near the most unpleasant sounds in China. Clanging empty tin buckets are beaten with a stick - he's there. Every old car in China clings in fear - he's there. A crying baby? Yes, you guessed it, he's there! According to THE PICKPOCKET, China is the most annoyingly unpleasant sounding place on Earth. <br /> <br /> The only element worse than the sound of THE PICKPOCKET is photography. The camera shakes, shakes and shakes a little more. Finally the camera stays silent, but then it falls on the actor's knees and stays there until someone in the crew realizes the mistake and starts shaking the camera again. Most of the shaky film is framed in long, long, long, long shots. The few times when the camera gets a little close, nothing compels to connect the viewer to what happens. <br /> <br /> Photography is dark, faded and often vague. The use of color is - though, there is no sign of intelligence that controls the use of color. Most every shot is 20 times too long. Few movies are so painful to go through. This movie is painful to watch and painful to hear. And then it ends simply. <br /> <br /> John Woo fans may be able to hear part of the soundtrack to THE XUE SHUANG XIONG (THE KILLER) as the main character hangs out of a video store for many minutes. . Anyway, be warned - THE PICKPOCKET will steal your good time.
