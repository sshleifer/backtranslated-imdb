Jack Frost 2. The worst horror movie I've ever seen. Why? 1) The premise is VERY beyond ridiculous 2) The damn thing doesn't even have legs to go on! 3) It escapes after being completely immersed in Anti-Freeze (first film) 4) Get it ... It travels completely over an ocean of SALT WATER to a TROPICAL island to take revenge on the sheriff who is in the first done. film. 5) "Killer Snowballs". I still had drunk enough to see Ginger Dead Man, so from the time of writing, Jack Frost 2 keeps the distinction of the stupid horror movie ever. Even the unity of his predecessor exceeds (if you can believe it!).
