I admit - I was attracted to the hype - and I didn't stop considering the sources. "One of the best exploitation of the year (1999)", shocking "and" a must. "<br /> <br /> Well, I wasted my money, but not everything was bad in this movie. They have at least the gore right, as well as some of the most unique methods of murder seen in a long time, even a storyline (kinda) and that's about it. <br /> <br /> But for an exploitation movie There is a surprising amount of content - but no exploitation - we get gay sex - sorta, we have 3 interracial babies - maybe we have a psychotic Vietnamese hooker - back, oral sex (okay Lets win me) and a female version of Gene Simmons (I don't get that part.) We have a fair share of Capone prizes among the best of the actors in this movie - it's not a compliment. finally we threw a government conspiracy, I don't know - try to kill the revenge / random / theme by joining Jimmy boy to leave the Vietnamese psycho at looked? He didn't Americans have a lock on this type of movie. The Latinos can make the rest as well as the rest. Kudos goes to everyone involved in this achievement that overcomes it and has made a career for themselves.
