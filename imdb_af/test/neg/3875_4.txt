"Return of the Seven" has some good action scenes, and Elmer Bernstein's score is just as exciting. Nonetheless, this is a boring movie because it fails to engage emotionally. Mcqueen's absence makes a very bad impression, and the fact that his character is played by another (lesser-known) actor is strange - in a bad way. The characters have not been developed, so we do not contact them - and we hardly give up when some of them die. This successor is an acceptable but poor imitation of the original.
