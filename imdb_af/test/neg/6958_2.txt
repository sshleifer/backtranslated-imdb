As a true lover of film, I recommend you to avoid this horrible attempt. God knows how funding is approved. This is actually a movie-like experience that results in zero dramatic tension until nothing happens again. The only connectivity is two scarecrows that keep you awake. Possiby is the worst movie I've ever seen and the play of the female head is bound to the criminal intent. One blessing with modern technology, you can look forward and see it at 12x and it will only last 25 minutes, "and you won't miss any of the plots. <br /> <br /> No idea how people are happy not find interesting and some give it high points!
