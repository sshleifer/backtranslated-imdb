Okay, this movie will never win an Oscar. Citizen reed this movie is not ... BUT why should every film be investigated? when was the last time you saw a movie that was funny because it was good, but because it was goofy? No one remembers ravenous king, king of exploitation? <br /> <br /> Well, I had fun. I like the cheese. Just go in for not thinking, and prepare to throw popcorn on the screen.
