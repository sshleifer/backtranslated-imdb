Seriously, I can't imagine how one can find a single flattering thing about this movie, and find it less in themselves to write the glowing compliments contained in this comment section. How many methamphetamines were Bogdonovitch while filming this movie? Was he a bonus to the actor who was spreading his lines with the most speed and least bending or thinking? The dialogue is bad, the plot frightening, even for a "screwball" comedy, claiming that the movie is a tribute to classic movie comedy is about the most ominous thing I've ever heard. The cinematography is among the quality and innovation of the exhibits exhibited by the worst for TV films. The play is terrible (although I feel that the error lies in the director's shot), I mentioned that the direction is so random and impeccable that it defies the definition of the word? The whole thing is a very unique one (even in the very polite world of so-bad-funny clunkers), soul-sucking, wasting two hours of your life that you will never return. Be scared, be very scared ...
