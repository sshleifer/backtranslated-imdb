I wish I had something more positive to say about devil fish, but I honestly can't do much. I can't even get a lot of "so bad things, that's good" kind of moments. Devilfish is not older badly. The plot is completely distracted (Jaws, anyone?), The acting is wood, the characters are uninteresting, the special effects are over, and the score is annoying. Add to that the seemingly unknown direction of Lamberto Bava and you have one stinker of a movie. However, I think the film's biggest sin is its lack of budget. It didn't seem that Bava had much to work with. By 1984, the Italian film industry was in full decline ?? especially as far as genre films are concerned. The money available to Bava was probably very slim. Movies like Devil Fish that rely on special effects have never had a chance to be good. It's not the only Italian movie to suffer from this fate. There were a number of Italian films made in the mid-80s whose ideas and concepts far exceeded what anyone could expect realistically, given their budget constraints. <br /> <br /> But having said all this and considering the film's many weaknesses, I can't rate myself devilishly lower than a 3/10. I even considered evaluating it higher, but can't because I realize how bad a movie is. Why don't I lower it lower? Well, it's hard to explain. Despite the many problems found in the movie, there is something about devil fish that I enjoy inexplicably. It can be as simple as my love for low budget, cute, Italian movies. Perhaps my taste in movies is frightening, but I enjoy what I enjoy. <br /> <br /> The Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment of devil fish is actually very enjoyable. I rate Devil Fish a 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale. The guys do a fine job of making fun of the movie's many bugs. One very sharp observation comes very early in the comments when Tom Servo notes: "Just because you can change, doesn't that mean you should" ?? which highlights one of the many weaknesses in Devil Fish.
