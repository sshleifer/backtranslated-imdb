Produced by Nott Entertainment, this movie is not very good at all. I sat down for the first 15 minutes of the movie before judging that the play is bad, the decisive bad and camera work is bad. As I hear there is a download of this movie floating on the internet, it is "nott", even worth the bandwidth. <br /> <br /> Until the time I wrote this review, the average for this movie was an 8.5, which prompted me to see it and there was an average of 10's for it, who of course voted by liars and shills. This movie is not for everyone. Or parents, if you want to punish your kids with this horrible movie, put them through this one for Halloween.
