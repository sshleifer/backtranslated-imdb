Mickey Rourke is currently enjoying a renaissance ... and honest play for him. I always liked his image and his acting ability in such a prize as Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know what you're going to get with Rourke - mean, gentle, dirty. But this movie gives you much more - and you don't want it most. <br /> <br /> First, this whole thing just doesn't make sense. Rourke is a hard-hired IRA killer who, after the death of a busload of schoolchildren, flees for Ireland for London. He is running the police and his own hosts. He also promised never to kill again. It looks like the bus full of kids has done it for him. <br /> <br /> But when he comes to London, he is tracked by a local gangster. (Bates - looks like his eyebrows and hair came straight down Burton's dummy) to kill his main rival for Â£ 50,000 and a boat trip to the US. Rourke agreed to do so, but was seen by a priest (Hoskins) and confessed the crime to him in the confession to hold the priest's mouth. He figures that it is better than killing him. <br /> <br /> Here is a wealth of things that just don't add up: 1. Why choose Rourke from your competition? As illustrated by a scene in which an employee is pinned to a wall by a pair of swords, it looks like a man in London's guys is hard enough to kill their own. 2. Not only that, but the Mobster gets a man to follow Rourke and see death with his own eyes. Why didn't the guy just kill the rival and make every effort to handle Rourke? 3. Hoskins sees the murder take place and the police let him go - without protection - can I add - to confess? Not at all. 4. Rourke hangs around the church (right next to where he carried out the murder) immediately after the crime took place to go to confession. Why is the police not checking the place? 5. Rourke is especially concerned with the church and Hoskin's blind cousin, for days afterwards, without anyone bothering him. What? He is going and he stays at the place where he has committed another murder? Stupid. 6. The police really meet Rourke in the church to fix the organ and have no idea who he is. Don't they know he's heading for the school bus bombing? They don't even look at him? 7. Why is Rourke killed for you, and then told him to wait a few days to get on the boat? You can think you want to get rid of him right away. Or kill him. One or the other? 8. Why did Bates's brother suddenly rape the blind cousin amid all the guards? Can't he limit himself for a few days? At least until Rourke was safely driven to the states? Ridiculous. 9. Rourke suddenly has inner turmoil after all his years of murder and wins immediately over the blind cousin - even after she knows he is a killer, she still loves him? Again - completely ridiculous. And besides, she falls in love with him in record time - a few days !!!! 10. The whole bomb thing at the end is simply stupid from Bates viewpoint. 11. Things happen in parts of this movie that just don't make sense or just there to help the storyline. Bates' houses Rourke in a whorehouse until the boat is ready to sail and Rourke suddenly shows a moral high ground to respect the whore in the house - but will still be a blind girl bed. 12. Rourke asks a farmer on the boat where Bates is - and the handler practically exercises the entire movements of his boss in less than 10 seconds. It was embarrassing - the man told Rourke much more than he even asked. 13. Hoskin's priest is an ex-army man and we see him hitting three henchmen behind a bar. Overall inexplicable and yet another worthy scene. I'm going to stop there with accident 13 without mentioning Rourke's hair (so fake red it's laughable), his accent (which is fair isn't bad sometimes, but sometimes also a scarce ear muffler), his clothes, walks, looks at the heavens, etc. Nor will I mention the music and the cunning editing style. <br /> <br /> Open - I just mentioned it. <br /> <br /> Overall - a disaster of a movie with an obvious religious imagery (preaching on the cross, preaching from a pulpit) star and director. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
