Leslie Nielsen is usually someone whose movies I really want (even critically placed flicks like "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" and "Wrongfully Accused"). Therefore, the fact that I am Mr. Save Magoo, show it's a piece of junk. It throws Nielsen as the myopic title character, something is planted on him, and he makes a mess of everything. The combination of Nielsen and director Stanley Tong (behind two of Jackie Chan's movies) seems to make this one hilarious movie, but it doesn't; They seem to have only people to do something, and there is no real humor here. <br /> <br /> So, the original cartoon with Jim Backus offering the voice was worth seeing, so avoid this movie. Leslie Nielsen also did much better, so there is no reason to waste your time on it. Also with Kelly Lynch, Stephen Tobolowsky, Ernie Hudson, Malcolm McDowell and Miguel Ferrer. they probably don't want to emphasize this clutter in their careers.
