"This film is wonderful! ... is what I would like to say about this movie. In the words of the film itself, "you are very bad!" I once went to see an unlicensed acupuncture, although it generally agrees with the morale of the movie. <br /> <br /> I'll include a spoiler, but the lack of plot makes it very difficult. Overall, a movie disaster. <br /> <br /> quotes; "You are not a leper at all!" "You're beautiful, and I'm sure you're nice too." "Have you ever seen a naked man's body?" "You can't break a piece of straw." <br /> <br /> Komos in dubbing; Micheal riet x3, harold bishop, steve erwine, benjamin netinyahoo, yoda.
