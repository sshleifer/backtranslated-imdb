I caught it last week at IFC and I thought it was typical of the indie short film: heavy on style, little on substance and originality. Is it surprising that an outgoing movie is an exceptionally attractive (and blonde) boy with 70-year-old hair and too-cool clothes? Plus, this movie in the late 1970s is chic, which for some work (Sofia Coppola's "The Virgin Suicides" occurs) but not for this director. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer compared it to Harmony Korine's work and I agree. Yet, I don't see it as a positive thing (what has HE done lately?). "Bobbycrush" is really just a waste of time and energy for everyone involved. If you see the cable last night, turn the channel and look at something else.
