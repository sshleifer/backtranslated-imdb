It was a pathetic movie. The Alien was decent, but the movie itself has a new meaning to miserable. The plot is something that is done over and over! But this one does the worst! The acting was c ** p, the screens were often too dark to get what was going on. No one has any concern for the main character. The movie was too slow, and the murder tones that were there were foolishly produced and did not look interesting anymore than the rest of the movie. There are some movies that "suck" but can still be enjoyed because of the total scandal, but it doesn't even have it! Whoever made this movie thought they could do something good and they failed. There is nothing to offer this movie, except a headache. Avoid it!
