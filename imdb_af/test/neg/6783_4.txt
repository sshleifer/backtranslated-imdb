I watched this movie with a group of friends at the 1999 International Film Festival of Melbourne and no one had a good word for it. <br /> <br /> I love Bluegrass and Country Music so much, so I'm not "I'm not sympathetic about the subject. But the problem is that it is a very conservative movie - little more than a filmed Mills and Boon story. It's not just that the love story in his heart, that between Reece and Dr. Lily Penleric is more than a little incredible. (Why a male would be attracted to the nostril-flaming Lily is past me and frankly Mike Harding as Reece just seems to go through the moves.) It's simply that the whole movie is too tame and good-natured for its own good. There is precious little danger, dirt or drama. Certainly there is a moment of "excitement" that a school with Lily's younger sister entails, but this whole episode is funnier than it is dramatic (it is just as poorly written and performed). And the film surprised its conservative agenda in the way this subplot is solved. <br /> <br /> Like good old Reece Kinkaid (now, what's wrong with a name like Eberneezer Bumpass?) I ask you! Is the end of this movie credible? Beware of the character this movie had built earlier? I do not think so...
