It amazes me that someone will find Pauly Shore entertaining: he is basically one joke that grows old * Real * fast. He jokes his little vocabulary of "California" and a basic stock of lame. Mainly, he's just stupid. <br /> <br /> That said, I watched this movie because I was sick and there was literally nothing but infomercials, otherwise I would turn it off after 30 minutes. Anyway, the movie could have been good if Pauly could just shut down his play and only played it as a comic actor instead of Pauly. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm sure Pauly fans will keep it anyway - but if you're not a Pauly fan, keep away from these herbs. <br /> <br /> I had to go This comment after I saw another user actually gave this movie a 10/10! (Maybe it was Pauly!) Personally, I gave it a 3/10 because they didn't shoot a mike-in-frame, the camera didn't drop and the supporting role was pretty good.
