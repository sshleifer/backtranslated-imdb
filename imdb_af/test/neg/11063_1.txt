It must be one of the worse movies I've ever seen. In the same way as with Blair Witch and just as annoying. The flickering helmets made things difficult to see, and I think epileptics should watch, because there are moments with strobing that make this movie even more annoying. I think if they were more styling, they could get a way out. Then, if you think the geek can get trumps, it even falls over to a nervous breakdown. Oh, and when is the man having sex realize that when the girl says she can hear something. She can really hear something. One of these guys must have seen at least Scream (where they draw your attention to such things). It is also a great ending when a performance offers so much promise and then someone writes the writing. So sorry I got it weekly at the videoback and I want my money back.
