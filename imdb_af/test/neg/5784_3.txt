Navy Seals is an ignorant, racist and self-confident film that has seen the Middle East conflict as a backdrop for an action movie that is heard for a comfortably sheltered American Middle East. The conflict, as well as those involved, is merely used as a cannon feeder to glorify the photogenic young Americans who are proud of Arabic for the good of 'freedom'. But what's worse is that the movie's action scenes are carelessly dealt with, and that doesn't prevent Navy Seals from even acting as a continuous shoot-up. <br /> <br /> Charlie Sheen's character (Hawkins) is disgusting, offensive, ignorant, reckless and above all racist. He refers to the Middle East as a 't-hole' and to his residents as 'rag-heads'. During the film, the characters of the Navy Seals are glorified by the use of Lebanese natives as gunfire. They undoubtedly kill these people with a consistent attitude. There is even the tasteless murder of a young Lebanese boy shot by Hawkins; Hawkins makes fun of his language before he shoots him while he is still humorous. Besides being tasteless, it must be unacceptable. The film's extreme (but predictable) pro-American attitude is also rebellious. This can be seen when Lebanese-American female journalist Hawkins informs that terrorists cannot be made to speak because "they are religious zealots." Hawkins then delays with "yes, and we're the Navy Seals!" The implication is, of course, that zealots are meaningless alongside US military power. In addition, even after insulting this journalist's racial heritage and treating her as a sex object, the writing demands her inability to resist this disgusting rogue and she still ends up with him because he is an All-American Navy Seal is. It marginalizes the journalist's character by submitting to Hawkins's "superior" pro-American attitude despite his abusive behavior towards her. Apart from the ethics, this plot practice also has little faith as a drama. <br /> <br /> The script is also amateurish. Most scenes are simply merged without any thought for mood, plot or character development. The 'music video' scene at the golf course, for example, is just scary edited eyebrows. And the two scenes where Charlie Sheen plays the reckless hero is also pointless. In one, he jumps off the bridge from the car, just to show his friends how difficult he is, and in the other he drives a trailer on a pushbutton and drives off his car. No scene has a subsequent anti-climax. Both are highly unlikely and have no effect on the plot as a whole. Designed just as a vehicle to showcase Hawkins' inexpensive American American heroism, they are poor substitutes for character development. Most of the other scene development scenes are also badly filmed and poorly written than - in fact, this deviation affects the whole movie. Apart from the African American Navy Seal and his wife, as well as the characters of Michael Biehn and Charlie Sheen, every other member of the team looks unknown to the audience, so when the climatic schools roll around, no one seems to be rooting and anyone's death to to complain. <br /> <br /> In such a movie, the action sequences may save the production. But here they don't. It's badly targeted, badly lit, and shows bad stunts. In fact, their direction is so poor that they are almost incoherent to the viewer, which means that not only the screens are incomprehensible to follow, but also a total lack of fear and tension. Poor lighting only contributes to their impotence. The explosions look fake, gunshot wounds are unconvincing and one of the more daring stunts that a Mercedes crashes over a tank looks just like a stunt that is backlit and then badly edited. <br /> <br /> The end of Navy Seals puts the coins firmly in the eyes of this production. First, there is the compulsory slow-motion "run-of-the-big-blast-it-must-have-murdered" scene with Sheen carrying Biehn on his back. It was, of course, the standard scene intended to be the star of the movie's trailers. Then there is the end when the rest of the Seal team, wounded in the sea and swung, is rescued by a submarine. This submarine has been home for a long time, but of course it returned miraculously. Despite the fact that many of their colleagues have just been killed, with some of them still bleeding, everyone is happy to laugh while America is outraged. Predictable? You can only imagine this ending while viewing the opening credits. <br /> <br /> This film uses the Middle East conflict as a means for the macho-All-American tendencies of the film's photogenic leaders. Arabs are renegade and dismissed, and their battle in the film is used as a means of glorifying US military force against an inferior minority group in a consistent environment. The events of 2001 pointed out that such a smuggling and excess trivialization of the conflicts of such minority groups is certainly not a consequence. The Middle East can no longer be written off as a s-t-hole full of rapids that hit each other (to quote Charlie Sheen here); It is now a place where involvement can lead to serious consequences. Today it is reminded that the effects of such arrogance can manifest themselves very close to home. That's why the Navy Seals look pretty foolish. but it must be good. It is a highly ignorant film whose production value and professionalism are equally suspicious. Navy Seals is ideologically and artistically a complete insult to the intelligence of his audience.
