Boy Oh Boy, stink this movie. This movie is one of the worst pieces of waste I've ever seen in my life. Please, although your life depends on it, DO NOT, and I repeat: DO NOT, under any circumstances, consider this terrible piece of garbage. Just look at this thing when it comes to an MST 3000 episode. That was the only way I could sit through the whole thing. If I had to see it without the show, I would have stopped watching it before it was over. This does have one: A Cure For Insomniacs !!!!!
