.. but unfortunately nobody thought Van was killed to save this doomed production. The only positive thing about him in the movie is his nice singing voice ... too bad the songs are mostly careless and juicy. Why did I hate so much? Well, throughout the film he seemed to have done a lethal Soup Sales simulation - with many worries, bad jokes and way to spend too much energy to make everyone laugh. The worst of these moments was when he "taught" the class - these children laughed at EVERYTHING he did. Heck, Van could read the phonebook or have them look like photos and they probably laughed! Van was not the only bad decision in the film - he was just the obvious one. Of course, after John Gielgud (a beautiful actor) was an Asian, it was ridiculous and Michael Finch's brother Michael York played. The bottom line is that because of these insane decisive choices, the movie is doomed from the beginning ... and the worst of them was the god-fearing Bobby Van. Now in real life he might have been a lovely person and it is sad that he died so young in real life, but with the material they gave him here, I just wanted to rip his tongue to silence him. <Br /> <br /> Now I have also called the songs - egad, those horrible songs !! The original lost horizon by Frank Capra was a subtle delight throughout - and not a single song and dance number in the film. So why did they decide to add a bazillion song that didn't do anything to help the movie? They only served to make it seem like a solid mess - like the original DOCTOR DOOLITTLE combined with lost horizon. The end result is a sickly lovely children's movie - not one that can be enjoyed by anyone over 8. <br /> <br /> Now that you can remove these issues, you have the basis of a decent movie. After all, the plot is beautiful and is still hidden among all the throws. Peter Finch is exceptionally good (though certainly not the equal of Ronald Colman in the original). But since the original was a near perfect classic, why bother with this tough steak. Who wants to blow through the treacle?! <br /> <br /> By the way, this movie is recorded in "The 50 Worst Films" book by Harry Medved. While I didn't like the movie, it wasn't bad enough to merit inclusion in the book. I think it's mostly included because it was such a huge checkout failure and because it was only released a few years before the book appeared. An excellent book - just not one of the best choices for the "holy hall" of liquor.
