First, I'm surprised to see that this movie has a score of 7 on this site. Initially, I thought it might be people in the industry reporting to IMDb and signing the rating. But after we looked at rotten tomatoes and saw that this movie has something like a 76% approval rating, it seems that people have just been immersed in the failed pretentious shit for depth. I mean, this movie is simply awful. The acting is just awful, but the rest of the movie is worse. at least the act gives a few (unintentional) laughs. <br /> <br /> The plot involves a teenage skateboat who is asked with his friends for a murder that happened through a park where they skate. And that's about it. The rest of the film consists of the aforementioned terrible dramatic, terrible dialogue, slow motion shots of people walking, of people's faces, of people who skate, often on music that doesn't fit at the scene. Maybe it's done to be "cool" or experimental or hip. or maybe this is done in the hope that it will deceive people into thinking that it is somehow, but it doesn't work. nothing in this movie doesn't work. It's pretentious rubbish. I can't recommend it enough.
