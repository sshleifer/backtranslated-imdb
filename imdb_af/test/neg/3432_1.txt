I must say, Krasinski is the only reason I even watched this movie. He's fine. But everything about this movie is so far below average that it is not worth viewing this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie has many technical / aesthetic problems: lap choices, frames, camera movements within monologue sequences, extremely bad editing (probably due to the total lack of fluidity in and between shots) and overall horrible acting (except Krasinski). <br /> <br /> It was to theater (in acting and presentation) to develop any kind of exciting moment in this movie ... which is surprising because it's all about a bank robbery, which is at least a little must be exciting. <br /> <br /> How will a movie get so bad and then released, and then spread? <br /> <br /> Kind reminds me of a C film student's pilot project, probably not so good.
