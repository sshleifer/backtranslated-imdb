Silly Disney movie about a college student accidentally discovering a drink that makes things invisible. Not a bad idea and some of the special effects are pretty good. Still, the writing is VERY bad ... all the jokes flop and the acting is common. Everyone tries to be funny and they are not. A very boring, silly Disney movie. But it was nice to see Kurt Russell so young.
