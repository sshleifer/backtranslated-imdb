A young doctor and his wife suddenly expect a child. Both are disturbed over a two-hour memory lapse on the night of conception. Interesting turn on a hardy story. Very good F / X and interesting editing. Jillian McWhirter is excellent in the role of Arnold Vosloo, Wilford Brimley and Brad Dourif. Brimley brings normality abroad. Kudos to director Brian Yuzna.
