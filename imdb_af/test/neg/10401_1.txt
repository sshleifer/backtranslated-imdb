Kubrick may have been the greatest director of all time. He might have made more classic than anyone else. He might have been a perfectionist. But man, was his first attempt ever bad! <br /> <br /> Kubrick has good reason to try to make this movie disappear from the map: it looks like an Ed Wood movie. It has strange narration, inexpensive shots, bad dialogue, ominous music reminiscent of your 50-year-old sci-fi / horror movie. And it seems family members of the movie "Reefer Madness" are insane for no reason. <br /> <br /> Certainly you can see an undeveloped Kubrick there. This is a psychological / horror study of war. The characters are dehumanizing and insane. There are people who play more than one role. There are constant shots of the faces and specific facial expressions of different people. And there are some interesting shots around. But really, it's a mess. <br /> <br /> Of course, I don't discourage you from viewing it. If you do, you will join a selected group of myself and a few thousand people worldwide who have access to it.
