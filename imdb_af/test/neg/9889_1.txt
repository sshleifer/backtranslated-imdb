This straight to the video cheap movie is based on a true story. I don't doubt it. This does not mean it is very interesting (unless you are one of the main characters who have actually lived this experience). A young woman named Angela buys a big, big old manor really cheap. Well, as we all know about horror movies, if you buy a big house, it usually means that it is somehow pursued, shaped or shaped. In fact, the second time the house was handed over to Angela, the wise guy who lived in the house was a moment to introduce Angela to one of the ghosts! Nice old, huh? Angela gets in touch with a psychic and a paranormal expert and tells them that her home is haunting and inviting them to come over and see the ghost for themselves. They come to a feast and sure enough there are talks walking around, sitting on the couch, hanging in the garage and trying to seduce people in the bathroom. A few friends sleep over the night of the party, see the ghosts and vow never to come back home. (Look at the girl shooting "I'm so scared. I'm so scared." Totally emotional. If she was so scared she didn't get up, turn the knob and go away?) The ghosts don't do anything threatening except to show up (and there is no blurriness or aura about them. They look just like ordinary people). They steal celery from the kitchen, move chairs to a lazy POLTERGEIST and give a bisexual female ghost to Angela, who gets it, doesn't look like it! This scene plays like the kind of soft core porn you see on the SPICE channel. (Ummm ... not that I know! Hahaha). However, the actresses are not your typical porn stars. They have to hit the beach and the gym more. When Angela's doesn't kill, she gets angry with them and stands alone in a room screaming. "Why don't you go away? This is my home! Get out!" They do not leave. I couldn't help but think of all the times I heard Sylvia Brown on TV, and if you have a ghost in your home, rationalize the ghost and say, "Look, you're dead. It's time to cross the other side, in other words, come out! "According to Sylvia Brown, as long as you are not hostile and nasty about it, they will leave! This movie seems to cost about $ 50. It has a very cheap feel and bad acting. I could have made this movie with 5 friends and a camcorder.
