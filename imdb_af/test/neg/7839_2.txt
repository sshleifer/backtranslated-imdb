It's not a good movie. <br /> <br /> I can usually sit through a Van Damme movie if I have to, as they usually laugh a bit and have not thought much. This one has no redeeming features. <br /> <br /> It has a clear shortage of plot, humor, acting, direction, etc. An owner stinks at all levels. <br /> <br /> I never walked out of a movie during a movie, though I came close. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
