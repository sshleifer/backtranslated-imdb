See Dick's work. <br /> <br /> See Jane's work. <br /> <br /> Dick and Jane are married. <br /> <br /> They are successful. <br /> <br /> They have a boy. <br /> <br /> They have a nice home. <br /> <br /> They have a Latin housekeeper. <br /> <br /> The housekeeper teaches Spanish to the boy. <br /> <br /> <br /> The boy speaks Spanish. <br /> <br /> Ha-ha. <br /> <br /> See promoting Dick. <br /> <br /> The pompous CEO is a crook. <Br /> <br /> See Dick the fall for the pompous CEO. <br /> <br /> Jane leaves her job. <br /> <br /> Oops. <br /> <br /> See Dick and Jane from work. <br /> <br /> Dick & Jane turn to crime. <br /> <br /> As a plot device, they decide to rob the CEO. <br /> <br /> See the robbery get botched. <br /> <br /> See Dick & Jane fund the company's pension plan with the money of the robbery. <br /> <br /> Yay. See the final credits. <br /> <br /> Well, so you got the plot. In addition, Dick and Jane take care of one scene to the next. One barely connected to the last or the next one. The whole thing is terribly episodic in nature. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey didn't bother to bring his "A" stuff, he just looked bored and lightly ashamed of the whole thing. But all the time, if you pay $ 20m, why bother. Tea Leoni is wild. I think it would be wise for me not to blame for this flop. <br /> <br /> There's just something about Dick & Jane. Carrey and Leoni are not funny and have little chemistry. The writing is not funny. And it's not well plotted. <br /> <br /> But it may be bigger than that. The reality of Dick and Jane may be a little too real. Perhaps it is just not funny that people lose their jobs in an Enron-like situation, if real life is still not happy.
