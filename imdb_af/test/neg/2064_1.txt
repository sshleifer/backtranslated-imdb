Watched it on French TV today and was very disappointed! The movie starts pretty well, but nothing is explained and at the end we are no further ahead than in the beginning. To see the man for the murder of his wife is just not acceptable. You need tangible evidence to convince someone and a minimum of evidence. In this case there is nothing at all, so it is not plausible. Remember the old phrase "innocent until it is found guilty". The fact that a woman disappeared without a trace is no proof that her husband had killed her. So I really don't know what kind of point this movie is trying to make. The outcome is completely illogical and incomprehensible. No offensive evidence is disclosed to the viewer. So honestly, it's a complete waste of time. A movie must be entertaining. This is totally untrue in the case of this one and I suggest it is irrevocably sent to the trash can where it belongs!
