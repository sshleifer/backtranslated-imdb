I couldn't watch more than 10 minutes of this movie. This set the default. I will never again give a movie a 1 unless it was as horrible as this one. I totally agree with the other comments on this film. But, since I am Dutch, I looked at it with Dutch translation. Apparently they didn't have the money for a proper translation, so they decided to babelfish it. With sometimes hilarious results. <br /> <br /> Don't smoke, don't drink, don't use drugs, view Demon Summer. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that the actors (Wow, I can't believe I just said it.) Didn't keep the writing (Was there any?) in their hands while they were shooting. I think they also did a good job on ... Well ... Uhmm ... No, they didn't do a good job at all.
