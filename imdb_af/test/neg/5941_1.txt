I loved this movie! This is the best parody of the Russian theater to date. Whoever other than Sokurov, Tarkovsky could be so brilliant. You thought "Stalker" was slow? Well, step up to the board. "Mat i Syn" makes "Stalker" like "Raiders of the Lost Ark". In no way should you miss this movie! There is no excuse - even if you live a busy life, you can still enjoy this movie fully by holding the fast-forward button on your video recorder. Sokurov gave us the first feature-length movie that can be appreciated in 12 minutes. <br /> <br /> I think the next big masterpiece will come out if someone has the vision and courage to portray a movie consisting of no sound or image - 45 minutes of black , silent screen (was it not already explored in "In the soup"?). Apparently, the filmmaker (and supporters) forgot that "motion" is the first word of a movie. <br /> <br /> !!! HIGHEST SPOILERS INSIDE !!! <br /> <br /> Do you want to reach the heights of genius that this movie has achieved? Here's a step by step guide: <br /> <br /> 1. Find a talented photographer. <br /> <br /> 2. Find some subjects and an appropriate scenic landscape (think Tuscany!). If you need inspiration, look at luxury cars or perfume ads. <br /> <br /> 3. Shoot about 3 rolls of movie. <br /> <br /> 4. Photoshop results to play around with saturation, blurring and aspect ratio. <br /> <br /> 5. Just get your movie camera, movie 40 of the best pictures and let your "actors" mumble their lines off-screen. Don't worry about writing it ahead of time - let the actors say what they want (lines like "Do you want a drink?" And "Let's get something to eat" is really all you need to fill 8 minutes or so). If you can't think of enough dialogue - no problem! Just repeat what they say a few times. If not enough, leave the camera anyway. <br /> <br /> Congratulations, another masterpiece! As a bonus, if you want to spread it over the internet, no problem! The static images will not be compressed to anything with standard mpeg coding. A 73 minute movie will probably be about 2-3 megabytes, even at the highest quality.
