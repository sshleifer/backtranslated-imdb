Every time I think of this movie, I feel physically sick. To read such a good book and to discover later is a movie of it, it was a good feeling. Years later, imagining joining the sci-fi channel and starting it in just 5 minutes! Up goes the titles and then goes out. If only a few things changed well. Everything has changed. Numerous characters are being completely removed from new junk. The main hero is shrinking and outdated by about 30 years, and hilariously his girlfriend / wife is now his mother! Even the dog is reduced to sub-weld abilities. It is really terrible theater at its absolute worst. I'd rather remove my own tennis balls than to put through another horrible show, and I encourage someone to watch it - don't do it. If you own a copy, burn it now and think how much better your life would have been if this celluloid insult never happened.
