Deformed, earlier female scientist kills fellow scientists to steal rejuvenating cell formulas and reverse the aging process. She takes it and turns it into the beautiful, evil Satanic (Magda Konopka) who entices, seduces and mans rich businessmen. <br /> <br /> She is very attractive in the late 60's to mod clothes and manipulates those around her, watching much like the late Marisa Mell of the DIABOLIK movie. Coincidence <br /> <br /> But despite this, it is amateurish and messy without the James Bond pop art that DIABOLIK had. Even the Madrid and Geneva filming stations don't make it up. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is by Manuel Parada and Roberto Pregadio and it is not bad at all, consisting of lush orchestra with a little fuzz guitar use as a decoration. Perfect for one of the European Loungecore CDs that came out in the 90s. <br /> <br /> The Retromedia DVD also uses a substandard grainy color print that is in poor shape, with an explanation at the outset that it was due to the age of the film. Bul! They also didn't bother looking for a better source, or they couldn't get one at all. There are only a few stills of Magda and that's it. <br /> <br /> Messy and arm all over, this one gets 3 out of 10.
