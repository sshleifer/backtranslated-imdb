Based on how little I saw of this show, I don't think I'll ever see it again. It is not even remotely credible and honestly the Derek character just makes me angry. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but do I see such a spoiled brat getting its way back and forth? Why do I want to see it?!? No, thank you, there are many other shows that involve devastating characters (for example Phil of the Future's Pim) where the evil one does not win or if they are not the way they are. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that I think it's a terrible picture to paint about the lives of step-brothers and sisters. Yes, life is not rosy, but one can try to portray a character who is not really angry and wins. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is that you just watch it if you want to see the villain win.
