Last night I got bored and decided to see a movie called 'out kold' that I once bought with a lot of other cheap movies from a video store. Looks like a good old action movie, so I took out the chips and coke and was ready for a relaxing evening. Well, the pain started from the beginning. The main character is a boxer who is the best man I've ever seen. Of course, as the good person, he must be fine, but he is just a vagina! It doesn't really match a boxer with 28 KOs and starts with a pimp job to earn extra money. Even good guys can still be cool. Well, then she got her first fight while working for this pimp. Each punch was clearly missed and it became even more annoying because the sound effect was not synchronized with the bumps. Then there is this totally worthless play of the entire cast, and you have enough reasons to leave this movie for what it is. I gave it a 1 because I have never seen such a bad movie.
