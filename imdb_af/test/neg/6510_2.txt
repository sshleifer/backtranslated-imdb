Typical Steven Seagal prize: that's, it's crap. The plot relies on a series of incredibly unlikely coincidences; There is a large dose of conspiracy theory that would be much more palatable if we didn't know that Seagal literally took it; And again, the bad-movie multimillionaire Seagal tells us all about the ills of The Rich. <br /> <br /> As usual, Seagal's survival relies on the fact that Bad Guys never reaches their guns from the arm's fire, and always keeps a little 'I'm going to kill you' speech for you blowing off a man's head. <br /> <br /> Watch this one just for the worse * Fire Under Here * and notice how the floor covering in Keenen Ivory Wayans apartment is more flammable than a large puddle of petrol. Oh, and look into the final battle scene for the incredible stray head wound, which is probably the most entertaining thing in the movie.
