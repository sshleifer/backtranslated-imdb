To name this film, a complete waste of celluloid will be an understatement. <br /> <br /> The play was unconvincing to say the least, especially from actor Craig Fong, who could not have acted tight. As far as the story goes ... well ... what story? The film is nominally about Harry Lee, a Malaysian Chinese descent who returns to his homeland after trying out every band he took and starting a band. <br /> <br /> The movie has ever had clich√©. you can think of - sex, tension among band members and a bit of racial tension being thrown in. <br /> <br /> The problem is that even with a topic covered by even the most amateurist directors, this movie is everywhere and the whole thing just feels like parts that even the hardest reviewers say. hair is on the point. <br /> <br />
