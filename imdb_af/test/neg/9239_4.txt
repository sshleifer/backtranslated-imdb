(The start may be a fairy tale ...) <br /> <br /> "The Eye 2" is the successor of "The Eye". It's about a pregnant woman who can see spores and spirits after an incident happened to her. <br /> <br /> The sound effects frighten my hell, but it's the only scary thing. Some of the prequel's screens are relatively similar and repeat so the cooling effects certainly cool. <br /> <br /> "The Eye" has quite a frightening and indelible impression, while "The Eye 2" is a forgotten horror-cum drama movie. Don't look at it. Looking "The Eye" is good enough.
