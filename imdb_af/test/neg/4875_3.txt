This movie is not worth seeing, at least not at a theater. The story is hard to follow and understand (it starts with 10 minutes of something 3 years earlier). It's hard to know if this movie is trying to be a comedy or just as bad / strange that it sometimes seems. American sirens and lights on Swedish police cars are just one example. The actions of Persbrandt and Bergqvist are good as usual, but I think Jenny Lampa acting as Jasmin is performing very poorly. Zara Zetterqvist works pretty well, she has not been seen as an actress in Swedish movies for a long time. If you still want to see it, wait until it is released on DVD or shown on TV.
