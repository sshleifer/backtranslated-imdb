The last time I checked out, the Nazis didn't win the second world war - not that you wanted to notice. After all, the Third Reich was pretty big on issuing orders and demanding cold, robot obedience from the population, and that's pretty much what we've been doing together today. But the way the orders are delivered has changed. Instead of being barked in a German accent by a loudspeaker, they are disguised as professional advice and every time you turn on the TV or open a newspaper, there is a constant background, a middle class message from self-improvement, whispering on the wind. <br /> <br /> "You eat too much, you eat the wrong things, you drink, you smoke, you don't get enough exercise. You probably can't even * bite * properly. You'll die if you don't do not change your ways. Your health will suffer. Do you have no self-respect? Look at you. You sick me. I'm sorry for you. I hate you. God hates you. Don't get it? It's so sad, what do you do? With yourself, it's just as sad. "It's the mantra. And it goes without saying that the people who recite it are often portrayed as saints. Last year, the media dropped on its knees to give Jamie Oliver a collective break over his schooling series, in which he campaigned to get healthier food on school lessons. Given the setback reaction, you would be forgiven for thinking that he would have saved 5,000 children personally from the jaw of a slave pedophile. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the series was a great success. In fact, there was only one real drawback: it was not returned. Once you have saved every child in the nation of a certain death, you can't do it again a second time. The only solution is to find a new threat, which brings us to Ian Wright's Unfit Kids (Wed, 21:00, C4), a weekly "issuance segment" program in which the former soccer player and renowned grammar enemy bunch of overweight youngsters force to take part in some outdoor PE. <br /> <br /> It's essentially a carbon copy of the Jamie Oliver show, with more sweat and fewer shots of pupils wasting fresh basil with a pestle: an uplifting fable in which Wrighty puts in his gang of misfits A lean, moderate exercise machine - combating apathy and lethargy, confronts lazy parents and tries to change the whole thing into a nationwide issue that Moms from the Range Rover will dive everywhere, with a sheer holiness between trips to the Conran store. Oh, isn't it just terrible, what is it that they do themselves? Not our Josh understand you: he doesn't eat anything except organic spinach and sits in the lacrosse exercise six hundred times a week. <br /> <br /> Bet, it's a pity, it's heart-warming to see uncomfortable, uncomfortable children changing themselves with a little simple activity ... but there's something about the underlying eating-your-vegetable message that really standing in my craw, if you don't guess. <br /> <br /> What happened to the concept of Choice, you * beep * So a little jogging can increase your life expectancy - so what? It compares just a few years in the nursing home - who does it? And besides, I would rather die death tomorrow than to spend the rest of my life with a bunch of a piece of the planet, with the purpose of healing one another. <br /> <br /> In episode two, video games and The internet are spoken in villains in the war on flab: they make children sit, you see. Oddly enough, TV, which is equally sedentary, and unlike these two activities, actively encourages you to escape your mind atrophy with your body without rolling. It's funny. <br /> <br /> Well, listen here, Channel 4 - instead of forcing children to break or make, how to learn to think more extensively, so they reject the clever, calming nature of apps like this? Or would it be a campaign too far?
