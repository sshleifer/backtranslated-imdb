I never understood the controversy and the movie caused it. Especially in the French and neighboring countries (in Belgium, for example, where I am located), "Baise-Moi" has been announced as the most shocking and most formidable social drama you could ever experience. Yes right! It may be a bit shocking, maybe (how often do you see someone being shot on the ass?) But the weak and useless plot didn't make me sure. "Baise-Moi" is still one of the "blame all that goes wrong on society" movies and they are generally not very convincing. About 99% of people work perfectly well in this society, so why would you blame exactly the same society for the dirty and hopeless acts of two hidden nymph girls? The two main characters and their unhappy lives are introduced separately and in flashes. Nadine just killed her roommate; Manu shot her brother and met the two in a deserted train station late at night. They decide to travel with France and leave a trail of sex and blood where they have ended. Although we are constantly exposed to pornography and violence, this movie is very boring to go through. As the girls always indicate themselves, the dialogues are lame and the people who invade them (and kill) are very uninteresting. If people want to make porn movies, it's good with me, but don't pretend it's an art house. If you leave the curse and hip camera work, all there is to see is pornography. Cool soundtrack, though!
