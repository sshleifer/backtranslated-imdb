It is impossible to make a movie based on such a book as the "Brothers Karamzov" by F.M. Dostojevsky. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks is a good director, but the film is on a very low level. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the movie was the end. Well, let's think of the book. Eventually we got the "guilty" Dimitrij Karamazov. Then they sent him to Siberia. In the end, the well-known epilogue of Dostoevsky, the friends and family makes a plan to save him. But that's it ... a now, the movie takes two more steps and shows us an illusion that ends with the escape of Dimitry and Gruschenka (I think). Just from the moral point, I'm sure Dostoevsky would finish the book with an open end, because one hand he is not guilty of (Smerjakov is the right killer) and therefore he must be a free man. But on the other hand, he goes to his father to kill him. Therefore, he decided to commit the crime. This is a moral dilemma and so the next point is an open end. Well, that's really, it's just not full open. <br /> <br /> William Shatner as Aljoscha Karamazov ... I'm sorry! -> NO !!! <br /> <br /> The other characters play in a good performance, as we expect from such great actors. For the time being, an excellent performance by Yul Breynner as Dimitrij. I think there aren't many actors who can play this part in a better way. <br /> <br /> But as I said at the beginning: This book is not adaptable. It should never be in two hours of film, it is impossible. I think there are some longer movies, so maybe they can do the right thing ... But I just think this book can't be modified. <br /> <br /> So - 3 points: <<br /> <br /> A point for excellent director Richard Brooks <br /> <br /> A point for a great performance by Yul Brynner <br /> <br /> Finally, a point for one of the greatest writers of all time: Dostoevsky
