Okay, let's start with the fact that when a Dutch movie is bad it is VERY BAD. Rarely does something with a little quality (Lek, Karakter) come here in Holland, but not often. Costa! are about 4 girls going to Spain to go on holiday, partying, getting drunk, being laid (you know the drill). It's also about the world of Clubbers or Proppers. Pros trying to attract the crowd in their club. <br /> <br /> I don't know how long it took to write the script, but I suspect somewhere between 15 minutes and 20 minutes because you're watching a lot of random scenes for 90 minutes. Nothing, and I mean nothing is credible in this movie. It's almost too ridiculous for words that happen to the storyline. Suddenly, the movie changes to a kind of karate action thing. With a one-to-one battle with 'the bad man in black' and a clich√© motorhunting through a water tank car (can be more cheese). The words character development and decisions are also unknown to the makers. <br /> <br /> After three days before seeing "Traffic", I came out of pure glory, from a work of art to this. This is the worst movie recording. And don't start with a low budget. Because even with a low budget you can write a better script. It almost seems that the filmmakers were too busy making themselves a decent movie. <br /> <br /> In any case, the chicks in the water at the end made it slightly, but for the rest, don't waste your money on such garbage.
