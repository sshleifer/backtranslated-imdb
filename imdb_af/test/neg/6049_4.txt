Hercules: The TV movie Hercules - A very twisted and molested version of the story about the Greek superhero. Paul Telfer makes a good effort to play this hero. Sean Astin rehashes his Sam Gamgee image by playing Lupine, who is cast in character to make the whole thing a friendly movie. I almost expected him to say at one point: "We are in a bad situation. Mr Frodo, I mean Hercules. An unexpectedly good performance comes from Timothy Dalton (one of the lesser James Bonds) as Hercules' father. Like Paris Hilton, something that just turned me off right away, Unfourtunetly turned someone's original story into a bit of a dark and sometimes incomprehensible story, and the special effects do not help, while the Hydra scene is the original story justice "The Nemean Lion and Harpies are just ... nice. I believe that Power Rangers' creatures and effects flashed at least twice in my mind. And the Golden Hind rushed and generated a lot of computer. My favorite parts of what was originally a very cool story, the movie can't decide whether it's Greek, Roman or American, and it has almost ruined the original story, a classic epic, directly to DVD.
