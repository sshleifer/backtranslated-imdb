It's boring. <br /> <br /> It's slow. <br /> <br /> Where are the nasty and brutal murders? Where is the tension we have to scare? It's like watching Sesame Street without the funny characters of Ernie and Bert or Grover. <br /> <br /> It's really lame. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is the writing ... maybe the direction. Perhaps all of the above made it something rare to erect your eyes. <br /> <br /> I wanted to be scared ... not bored. <br /> <br /> It didn't scare me. It didn't even interest me. I had more fun watching the time in the microwave instead of watching this movie. Don't bother buying it. And if you see it on television, it's not necessary to fall asleep.
