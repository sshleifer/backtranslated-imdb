I watched this movie because I thought it would be a classic Amy Adams movie. Wow, this movie is so bad on so many levels that it beats the imagination. It is poorly built for one, also the writing and the acting is just awful. But hey, even Johnny Depp has a lot of bad movies under his belt. In front of this movie, Amy would sing, and even at that point I think better songs could be chosen. Of course Amy is great to see and if you are a tough fan of her, you will probably see this title no matter what you don't expect too much. I wish I could have found more, but it was just painful to watch. I recommend Sunshine Cleaning or doubt.
