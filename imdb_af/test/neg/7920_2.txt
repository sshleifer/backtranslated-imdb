First, they ruin it with the unique bad animation quality, then they get voices that don't sound like the original. They make so many movie mistakes. When Sasha sings into Count Me Out, the drummer disappears and appears again. Itchy's shirt changes color, its hat keeps changing position, one of the bridges is white, everyone in the background remains fat, halos change colors and appear and disappear. . Even the sky looks different. I don't give a damn if it's a low budget movie, they shouldn't cut the angles on animation. They completely destroyed the first ADGTH. The only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack.
