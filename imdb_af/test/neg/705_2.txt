First, start to say I'm a Laurel and Hardy buff. I read every book printed on them and watched all their available movies more than once. I even got a chance, and called Stan on the phone. He was very friendly and spoke to me for ten minutes. I followed a letter, and he wrote me a letter back. I still have the letter. <br /> <br /> This movie has comedy moments, but Stan and Ollie aren't on their regular form. Stan was seriously ill during production and got worse than he did ten years later. In my opinion, any Laurel and Hardy movie is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> But the ultimate opinion of this movie comes from the great Stan Laurel himself. To quote him, "This movie should never be made."
