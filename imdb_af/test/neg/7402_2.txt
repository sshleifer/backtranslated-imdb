Dresden had great expectations because of its spectacular theme and its high budget. I really looked forward to it and I really wanted it to be good ... but it is not. The only good thing is the special effects done very well, but like in a very bad Hollywood blocker, everything else is different. <br /> <br /> It's poorly written, the script tries to comply with genre rules with standard tension / love story elements, but there is no depth or originality at all. It's lower than average. The next thing: It is also poorly targeted. It has this uninteresting TV-directing style with lots of close-ups and will-be-great action through quick editing where there is no action or tension. The actors are not bad, but there is no show that touches any way. <br /> <br /> I don't know ... of course they are trying a typical TV movie and not a movie for the theater, where it is always good to have edges and a clear visual style. But why are they trying to fulfill typical commercial Hollywood rules? It really feels like the scriptwriter did a weekend class with an American scriptwriting guru and then delivered this mess. Is there no producer responsible for the project that has an interest in dramaturgy / visual style, or simply these simple movie-like moments that make some TV movies? Do they think a TV audience is stupid and doesn't need a high quality movie experience? The Downfall was a great example for a good TV movie, but there was probably an executive or producer who knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this one, rent "downfall". instead ...
