I felt like I was looking at an example of not making a movie. I think the director filmed it in his backyard! There was no real plot. <br /> <br /> Terrible writing. <br /> <br /> Terrible acting. <br /> <br /> The worst production I've ever seen. A few bad CG effects and then the rest of the movies were spent walking around that looked like a junkyard. <br /> <br /> I don't normally write reviews on movies, but have been moved to warn everyone about this. a. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to waste your time with this movie!
