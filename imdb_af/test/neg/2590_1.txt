I couldn't believe how bad this movie was, and trust me, I didn't expect to make a masterpiece of a made-for-cable movie. I just lose it because I love Jane Seymour. I saw her enough to know she was definitely a perfect actress, so I just don't know what happened here. The characters were level, the dialogue stilted, the acting bad, and yes it included Seymour. It was nice to see her game against type, but not in something bad. I noticed that she had a credit for executive producer, so she couldn't get rid of the mere badness of this movie. And oh yes, they played Barry Bostwick the male head. "Nuff said.
