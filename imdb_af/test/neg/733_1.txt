I watched a "Fuckland" long ago. I lied if I told you I remember it in detail; What I remember most is the annoyance that caused me and the feeling of a total waste of precious money and time, not just my time and money invested in the movie but also the director's. <br /> <br /> Suppose, "Fuckland" is a critic of Argentina, which we also (I'm an Argentine), as well as small people who get credit and even boast small, ridiculous victories, and think we Is the best thing God (also an Argentine) created. I'm not going to argue it. This is probably a true statement about a fairly large proportion of the population (the part I despise, incidentally). And even if it wasn't true, it's not my point. The worst sin "Fuckland" was committed to expressing such a statement about its own director. <br /> <br /> The ongoing impression I received was that the director was too busy impressing us to sneak a camera inside the islands to worry about making a good one (even a mediocre movie. Many of the tasks done with a hidden camera are useless. The director chooses to show with a stupid edition of old warfare and his own. And there is no plot at all. <br /> <br /> In addition, this movie proudly offers a Dogma certificate for the opening titles, just to respect the principles (for example, by including the director in the credits - another sign of his pride?) . <br /> <br /> I found the movie offensive, not as an Argentine, but as a viewer. I underestimated. "Fuckland" is just one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
