I will mark this program as terrible if it is not the same network as Arrested Development. Because it is on FOX and is renewed while AD is canceled. <br /> <br /> It's absolutely out of words, how horrible this show is. But let me try to describe it. Take a very low rate Archie Bunker and let him stick out humor that would have been outdated when it went on Married to Children. Then take big plot lines of AD (boy has an ugly, boring girlfriend) and dumb them off so the idiots watching sitcoms can understand them. <br /> <br /> If you see it, I'll be completely lost to you, just like your family. However, if you are a fan, you must love FOX's new comedy 'Til Death'. Looks like real, funny things. I mean, married couples don't come together ... brilliant.
