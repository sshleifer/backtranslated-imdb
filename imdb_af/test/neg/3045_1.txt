What should have been if a routine babigit on a secluded mansion turns into a night of terror, as high school student Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) receives threatening calls from a sadistic stalker while trying to step one in front to stay. br /> <br /> The first 20 minutes of the original movie was pretty good, but it was all downhill from there. The remake takes the first 20 minutes and stretches it in an 80 minute movie. It's a good idea because it removes everything that made the original bad. However, if they wanted this movie to work more effectively, then they needed a better main actor, better director, writer, etc. Rented it. There is no tension, everything can be watched long before it happens and it is a very dull movie, as not much happens. . At least there is not much to go through, as it is less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> If this premise was to work, the main actress should give a realistic show. Camilla Belle gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen and throughout the movie she has read her lines. You get a starring role in a Hollywood movie that is viewed by millions and you don't bother! Why did they hire this girl? Sure, she's pretty, but she can't act at all, but I think it won't matter to the target audience that the movie is likely to eat. The rest of the role play is scarce and forgotten, especially the woman playing the girl, Rosa. Even the stranger was lame and his lines on the phone were not effective at all. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me of the past year, disappointing horror movie Boogeyman. That movie was a bunch of cheap scarce and false alarms and when a stranger calls almost the same. Jill enters a room because she hears a noise, but it's just a false alarm like a cat or a maid. This type of scene happens over and over until up to about 50 minutes finally the stranger appears. He must ever be one of the lambs. He wore no weapons and didn't look much of a threat. The end is bad but it fits the rest of the movie, so it doesn't matter. The film is directed by Simon West and he is really bad at building up tension. He used every clich√© he could think of and the results were not very good. The house was wonderful and I will give the movie credit for it. It was a secluded house, so it was pretty creepy, but it's about the only good thing this movie has to offer. In the end, if you're not a teenage girl, you have to overshoot the movie. Rating 2/10
