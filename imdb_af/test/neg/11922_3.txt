Low Bare. <br /> <br /> Clich√©d. <br /> <br /> Insanity about style to compensate for poor writing. <br /> <br /> Remember when MTV is actually used to use music videos and other shows. Reality Shows? Aeon Flux (2005) is based on one such show ?? a cartoon from the mid 90's ?? With a superhuman female protagonist in black latex clothing. Aeon, played by the beautiful Charlize Theron in this adaptation, is a cold detachable rebel that is as frightening as a liner dancer and as deadly as a snake snake. She must be if she wants to kick the asses of the totalitarian government. <br /> <br /> I love science fiction, but hate the sudden influx of half-century futuristic dystopic technology-exaggerated films like The Island (2005). ) and equilibrium (2002) (bottom of the stack). Aeon Flux has strengthened all the problems in these movies. That is, there is nothing original to show, so they compensate it with the slender style that Matrix (1999) catalyzed. The special effects are therefore sensational in Aeon Flux, which gets it a few points, but the surface scratches and there is literally nothing there. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, all performances in this movie are frightening and some actually hurt me to watch. Charlize Theron's character Aeon Flux is intertwined with the most cheesy tough-chick schtick and it seems that director Karyn Kusama can't really decide where to go with her? Does she have to loosen her or make her more emotional? She doesn't know! Let's go both ways! Imagine you take a shotgun, load it up with character developments of different kinds and burn in a random mess. This is the character of Aeon Flux. <br /> <br /> The movie Aeon Flux presents all the 'mandatory' ideas in a dystopian society - individuals vs. society, nature against science, emotion vs. cold reason, etc. You've seen it before and done better with it. Read Orwell, Bradbury or Huxley, or even watch Logan's Run (1976) or Blade Runner (1982) ... anything! Avoid this malicious, unhindered cheese party as long as you can. <br /> <br /> 3/10
