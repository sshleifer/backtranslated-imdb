* THIS REVIEW MAY TAKE SPOILERS ... OR MAY NOT. THE WARNING IS THE same for everyone * <br /> <br /> Hang it. Just when I thought SCIFI Channel had used all its ridiculous ideas for movies, they gave us that. Actually, the plot itself is nothing we haven't seen in movies like snakes on a plane, deep blue sea, and so on. This means that a monster / animal / threat of some kind ends up in a close environment and a lot of people. In this case, a stranger in a train. Wow. <br /> <br /> I must say, once I saw the thing on the cable, I couldn't stop laughing. No SCIFI movie prepared me for this; It was so incredibly pathetic that I couldn't believe it! The actors are all a lot of stereotypical-genre characters. But since they aren't so familiar, I didn't expect much from them. Except Diamond Phillips. No comment, but I think the guy was desperate to get a job. The problem was something called 'special effects', terribly even for SCIFI channel standards. That model / toy made us believe that it was a real train (not the model / toy helicopter bigger than a train's wagon), the meteorite comes HORIZONTALLY out of space, the 'baby' alien (a doll and I ain 't kiddin'), the regular strangers who look ugly ... while they were static; when they started moving, it was terrible, the explosions (the terrorist blew up LITERALLY! And what about the explosive helicopter! How many barrels of gas was the thing that carried?), the desperate maths used (they couldn't even leave a school problem right!) And I won't talk about that day of aversion, and then I don't know if I should keep laughing or crying. If I remember correctly, I did both. <br /> <br /> It's an ideal movie to have a good laugh, alone or with friends. But be warned; it's so ridiculous on so many levels ... and you need a lot of suspension of unbelief ...
