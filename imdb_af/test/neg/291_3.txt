I heard the stories of the ravers in the movie and it's fantastic, but it's only 1/100 of the movie. The problem with this movie is the cheesiness. I never really got the plot or why the man steals girls. It doesn't make sense, but hey ... why they were in a club was also randomly curious. Many parts of this movie don't make sense, but overall I was interested. It was confusing on many levels. Maybe I'm just not indie enough for this movie, but judging from the B-end scene, they ran out of money, just packed a few things and forgot about the plot. The low budget and so appears. I like the fact that they use little special effects that were bad, but they didn't use anything that was quality. I would say this movie is really bad writing, with good production. It's certainly not as random as many movies I've seen, but the pieces of the puzzle just don't make sense. In bonds I will give exception to the final battle when all the bonds went on my ass in 1950s. Sparks from models and the like. See if you want an unintentional comedy of an action movie. Mystery science theater has a candidate.
