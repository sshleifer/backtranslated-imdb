Once a month, I invite some friends for a "Retarded Movie Night". We look forward to movies that are so bad, it's funny or movies that know they don't have a plot and just show a bunch of cupboards. Last night we were unhappy enough to have Zombie Planet as one of our films. The cinematography is the same as we are used to, but the acting was a different story. The lead role is played by a Johnny Depp / Rob Zombie who cannot play a role in high school, let alone a LOW-BUDGET horror movie. Our unmistakable hero, who couldn't tell if he was a bad ass or a bad coward, was one of the reasons why it was the first movie of 30 that I had to stop at a Retarded movie night earlier. This had the potential for greatness with a big turn on the standard zombie infection, but they took it a completely different direction based on Johnny Zombie. I personally would not recommend it to any of my friends. However, it is a pity that I have invited some last night to suffer 80% of this movie with me.
