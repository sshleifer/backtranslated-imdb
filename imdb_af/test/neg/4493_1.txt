The action scenes were pretty good. But the plot of the movie I must give a score of 1 out of 10. It appears that the producers and director of this movie did not think carefully about it. <br /> <br /> This doesn't mean much value and value to its viewers, except for the violence. The whole story was about revenge. A son who testifies to rape and murder. I would even recommend banning it. Those who watched it just lost a little money. If you think to look at it, look something else. I would ask for a refund if I was at a theater. So for you guys and girls out there read this article. Please don't waste time.
