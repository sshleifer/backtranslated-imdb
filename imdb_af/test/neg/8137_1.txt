Barbara Payton is the so-called, sexy, young, hot Chickie wife of the owner of the fermentation plantation somewhere back in a jungle, much to a cheap studio in Hollywood. Raymond Burr undoes his working shirt with the top button like the dark plantation foreman who wants to blow Mrs Payton with the joint. There is another girl, a kind of farmer-slave thing about which Burr was used to walking, but he gave her the old whore, so the mandatory old old-doo-hag made a good spelling on him and who receive Payton stamp. I watched this only part because it was very awful, didn't even see the star of the show --- what I think is a gorilla that haunts someone in or whatever has changed .... Who cares. I give this one half star out of a possible ten. It's not even campy, just really bad.
