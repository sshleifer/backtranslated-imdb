This movie has some good performances to do - and that's all it does. The lead, especially Pauley Perrette, is attractive. (Although some of the spiders seem to be from a teleprompter.) The material - that's the problem. I feel as if the scriptwriter / director watched Felicity's entire run in one meeting, and sat down to write a script without sleeping. It really reminded me of Felicity - a thoughtful young woman who finds herself, finds love, with a shake-and-see-what-happening approach to the characters and their relationships. Apart from watching Felicity, this movie left me cold. The writing is just awful. It's amazing that the cast can come down, as well as what they've done, as the dialogue is at its best. At its worst, it gets stiff, stilted and amateurish. There's nothing original here, with plotting elements recovering from gimmicks that weren't so brilliant to start with. (Angels and fortune counters? Come on.) For the first half of the movie, I rooted for the actors and hoped to be rewarded for my patience. By the second half I just wanted it to end. My sympathy with the cast, which earned a better vehicle for their talents.
