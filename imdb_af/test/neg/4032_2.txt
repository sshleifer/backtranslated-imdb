I can tell the other comment that no one can ever enjoy this little thing, it's the same way I felt. <br /> <br /> I watched it all the time. I was shocked that someone could make a movie. this stupid! Where does the world come from? I think it's my fault to put through the whole movie, but it was like a bad car wreck, I couldn't look away. <br /> <br /> If you are a child under the age of 8, you may like this movie. Otherwise, stay away at all costs. It's the stupid movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Everything is stupid - the story, the writing and especially the acting, everything! Watching the movie, you will turn off the TV and think "how can a movie be so sad?" . <br /> <br /> These filmmakers (if you can call them) have to work seriously back to their day, none of them have a gram talent, and I doubt you can make such a life terribly useless rubbish that no one wants to see in their right minds! <br /> <br /> Just pulled out BS Don't waste your time.
