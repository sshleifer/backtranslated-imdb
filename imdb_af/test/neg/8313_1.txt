What a huge hope of ominous exchange! Your gods, where do you start with this one first? <br /> <br /> Well, mix a cry that trades (including one bloody stray woman who speaks as if she a) chills cold on ice cubes or b) just woke up after undergoing extensive root canal surgery). It points out that the celluloid has been cut and split using a corner machine, a truly hopelessly choreographed martial art 'action', a letter apparently written by a two-year-old and some of the most terrible and intrusive hard background music ever dedicated to any movie and hey presto, you have Death Machines aka The Ninja Murders (although the surprise, surprise, there's really no real ninja anywhere in this sweetie transvest!) <br /> <br /> In A nutshell, if ever there was a movie-like equivalent of a particularly severe dysentery, it should surely be! Avoid at all costs!
