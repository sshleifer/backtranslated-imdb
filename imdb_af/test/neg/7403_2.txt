This film included three hours, including advertising, on the History International Channel last night. But it felt three weeks. It was not the cheap, dumb and unceasingly funny portrayals of Dresden's bombing. It was not that the film was stripped of almost all the context of World War II. It was not even that the bombing itself was made to appear as nothing more than a major inconvenience to a goofy love story. No, it was the wood featureless characterization that sucked life out of the story. Oh, and the fact that it is possible that a movie is being pursued, Dresden is that movie. Perhaps a better title would have been drained - as Urria Hope would have experienced. <br /> <br /> This is especially the last point that is so annoying. Was the bombing of Dresden a war crime? The makers of this movie believe so. But in the typically emaciated way that the Germans came to reach World War II, they cannot say so without speaking of "peace" and "no more wars", as they are Mother Teresa. And also typical of German obsequiousness towards the British, there is an unconscious attempt to get ahead of British, while all blame Dresden for one person, Arthur Harris. <br /> <br /> Did I say one person? Well, not quite. At the beginning of the movie, there is an exclamation of the leading character, Anna, with whom we are all supposed to sympathize. "Stunned Americans!" She screams as they look so far from the bombs. And a few minutes later, a radio voice warning about the "American Terror Bombing" was attributed to the Germans. <br /> <br /> Note the word, "terror". Have this? It's really the Americans behind the inhuman target of German civilians. No matter the US strategy for almost all of the war in Europe was the "precision" bomb of industrial and war production sites. No matter it was the British who accepted a "bombardment" of civilian targets in Germany in enthusiasm - before the Germans even targeted English. No matter the Americans bombed during the day and had more victims in the process than the British to hit precision targets, while the British bombarded civilians under the guise of the night. No matter the Americans were essentially alerted to the RAF's bombing campaign and kicked and screamed. It doesn't matter that most US officials, from FDR to General. Dolittle, opposed to directing civilians, while Churchill and his generals couldn't wait. <br /> <br /> No, in DRESDEN, both the Germans and the British, except for "Bomber" Harris, we are innocent of a doctrine, it is shown, created by the evil Americans. And just the power and power of a love story between a German nurse and a British British bomber pilot can adequately explain the "truth" of the abomination. Right. <br /> <br /> Yes, to the younger and probably less readable readers of IMDb, the first and yet only great literary effort to give a thoughtful voice to Dresden's bombing was the pacifist novel written by Kurt Vonnegut - an American POW in Dresden at the time of the bombing. I think Germany's ZDF couldn't find a nice nurse for Billy Pilgrim.
