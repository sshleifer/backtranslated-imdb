A bad bad movie ... horrible plot, depends on Bolo Yeung's characters, but maybe he speaks 20 words throughout the movie and has only one battle scene - still in good shape, as he was also in the kung fu classic . "Interesting to see William Zabka (" Johnny "from The Karate Kid) in another martial arts role.
