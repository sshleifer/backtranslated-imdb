Terribly disappointed with the CITY OF PEOPLE after being swept away by the city of God. Lost is the exciting and unpredictable storyline, and instead it is unpredictable with the obvious effort of hearing manipulation by a superficial pretentious production and distribution team. This story eventually felt like a juicy soap opera rather than an impressive indie feature, which was what should have been. This is what happens when distributors try to find a wider audience (ridiculous shots from the Rio coast, etc.) at the expense of a gripping story and characters. I really couldn't care what happened to any of the characters in this movie - they were all so 2-dimensional. In short, sad waste of potential that had to be a slam-dunk because of the particularly inspired GOD OF GOD. Boo!
