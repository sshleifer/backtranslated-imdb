Essentially an incomprehensible B-movie that is mysteriously directed by one of the great talents of the golden age, Fritz Lang. Even with the star names of Lang, Walter Pidgeon, Joan Bennett and George Sanders, be prepared for a ridiculous storyline, bad acting, blatant dumb and miscasting. For transparency I have to admit that I am a fiery non-admirer of Walter Pidgeon, who was fortunate to find a niche in the artificial dream factory of MGM, and somehow worked in secondary roles with the support of Greer Garson and others. He is a wild boar, acting in a kisser, 30s-Ray Milland Madcap comedy, in a role where his life is in danger, and he stays away. Joan Bennett's cockney accent is excessive, but her lacquered hair, perfect make-up and attractive outfit add to a street-like Cockney slum. George Sanders is not able to do badly, but disappears after the preliminary opening, Pidgeon finds somehow pretending to shoot Adolph Hitler. Surprisingly to Fritz Lang, the uneven tone is. I found that the film was uncomfortably surrounded by moments of tension player by light comic interaction. Hitchcock completely reversed the relationship, using comic relief to apply the tension. There is a reason why this movie is unknown. It has not served or driven anyone's career or reputation, and has been forgotten because it is a surprisingly bad movie from such a pedigree group.
