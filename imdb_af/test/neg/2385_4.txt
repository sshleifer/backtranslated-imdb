What we give in this new movie is a "frat-pack" of fellow friends, who now reach the age of 30 (which we all know, of course, regard their generation as the "new 20"). Consisting of four guys and a gall, we have insisted on the following types: seemingly "unemployed" and regular drug users, along with one individual who is successful in work and one trying to be. They are all floating in their own way while trying to find future and emotional happiness. With one, possibly two exceptions, it's people who will definitely never mind this reviewer coming to modeling myself. There is disappointment after disappointment in almost all their lives. Except in the case of one individual (who is about to find it), no one appears in the area of ​​emotional satisfaction in his / her life. And so the only sincere moment in this movie is when a knock on the door gives the person the unexpected and sincere "I love you". <br /> <br /> With only the exceptions mentioned, these people are probably not deserving or worthy that a few hundred thousand dollars are thrown away in presenting their stories. <br /> <br /> PS - Author / director, Johnson, certainly had a problem with gay sexual scenes - without such problems in presenting more prolonged and revealing heterosexual children. Why could it be? <br /> <br /> ****
