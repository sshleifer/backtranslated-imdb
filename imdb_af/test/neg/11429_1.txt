Oh, here it is! A movie spoken by people reminds me of the epic "Trainspotting". OUCH, I was a fool to believe it and OUCH, how my butt hurt after I had to watch this c ** p from start to finish. After the first 10-15 minutes I just wanted it all to end, or at least they could have put some nudity or action or cool acidic music into it to make it worth it ... But no, when I went through was With this I put it in my CD shelf and I hope I'll never figure it out again just to show it to a friend who is so anxious to see that he doesn't want to listen to my warnings.
