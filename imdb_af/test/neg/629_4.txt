I have seen previous films by Cedric Klapisch, so they expect a quality film with psychological depth. Having been an Erasmus student myself and visiting several visitors abroad, I know very well what it means to spend time abroad and mix with different cultures. Yes, it's great fun! As a result, I thought I shouldn't miss this movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find that L'Auberge Espagnol failed to satisfy in many ways: the characters are stereotyped, the events are thin and the story is level. While there are quite a few familiar situations, it is annoyingly clich√© and does not go beyond the trivial events. It made the movie unattractive to watch, and made me add a strong "being-there-that-not-you-have-anything"? feeling. In addition, the film has a solid story. It sometimes looks more than a documentary or 'real' performance as a seriously crafted movie. <br /> <br /> I can imagine, though, that if you haven't studied or traveled abroad, it might be nice to watch.
