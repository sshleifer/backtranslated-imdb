It was by far one of the worst films where Sandra Bullock played in the tournament. Ben Affleck must stay behind the camera and continue writing scripts. It's definitely his forts and acting. I actually spent 54 minutes in this movie before being so bored, I was forced to leave the theater. It's a drill from start to, well 54 minutes in the movie anyway. The premise of "Guess who happened to me on the road to the ...." was killed over and over. Somehow it looks like there's nothing funny or romantic about people cheating on one another. Parents should be aware that it may not be a suitable movie for your teenage years, especially impressive children who can be seen as a hero by Sandra. There is a scene where the authors / producers / directors thought it would be nice to show how "acceptable" it is to smoke a joint .... while driving .... and then have no consequences if caught. I'm not prudent, and I smoked my part when I was younger, but I guarantee you I won't take my teens to see it and they are solid A&B students. If you want to see a good Sandra Bullock movie, rent "The Net" or "Hope Floats" which I believe is two of her best works.
