I have to say that I saw worse Sci Fi Channel originals, but this Nu Image shonker from Yossi Wein was quite a mourn. The big problem with it is that it is simply not convincing, not just its creature, but acting, writing and any attempt at drama. The direction has no flair and the writing of Boaz Davidson and Danny Lerner never really works predictably, often laughing, while delivering less shooters than some of these types of movies, it never offers anything to engage or increase the pulse no. The actors do their best, but with such material their actual efforts have little effect. Matthew Reilly Burke is a blatant watch, Meredith Morton, similar to a blatantly daring love interest. Actually, she was a little less convincing, but at least she was easy on the eyes. The movie has at least the dignity to come at a reasonable pace, but its biggest plus is that the octopus is not completely delivered CGI. So, even if it doesn't look good, there are some legitimate scenes of characters grappling with rubbery tentacles in almost amusing fashion. I also spent time discussing the differences between different representations of the octopus, the creatures' cgi shots as a whole vary over the course of the film, they also differ not only in size, but also in their practical shots, and there are scenes where the tentacle action suggests that the makers left as if they had made a movie about an octopus and only presented their creature as a bunch of different tentacles. The scenes of the creatures that attack humans soon get pretty old, but there are some funny scenes where other things like a boat and a tap are being tackled. Yes, these scenes are poor, but they have broken me. Undeniable highlight, however, is a hilarious sequence in which the octopus takes a New York landmark. The scene may not be much more than a minute, but it's really inspired and worth watching on YouTube. In addition, things are unconsciously all around (a PG level's lack of gore or nastiness stops this one from even pulling into the rubbish's good times). The film eventually takes a turn in the half-gripping disaster movie area at the end. But I can't really give it up because the best shots in the last few scenes have been thrown out of the Stallone movie daylight (which is pretty good by my memory). All in all, it was fun-rubbish and not something I would really recommend to anyone, except that the creatures have the creatures of the beings. Better than a pussy in the eye with a wet stick, but not much.
