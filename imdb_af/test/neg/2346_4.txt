If you can get past the slow start and the bad plays it's worth watching. The story line was pretty decent. The father had a bad temper because he was unemployed and he barely got his child, except in the summer because his former wife arrested him. The father was very angry and frustrated most of the time. The monster in the story wasn't too scary. The film breaks the sample consistently so strongly. The one scene in which the filmmakers do this is one of the times when the child is in the basement and the monster is going to attack him. When the monster goes to attack the child, his arm is trapped in a steel cord attached to a chain. The monster is about a foot away from the child's face. Every time in the movie, the monster is strong enough to break or break anything. Yet the steel trap and chain keep him back to get the child! More than likely, the filmmakers have done it for shock factors because no one wants to die of one of the main characters. Movers just wanted to frighten us to think it was possible for the child to die. Instead of breaking consistency, the role-players had to replace the child with someone they could have!
