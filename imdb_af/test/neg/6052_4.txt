The problem with this movie is that it is trying to set up a 6+ hour movie in 2 hours. The result is clear. It seems to be forced, unclear and too simple. <br /> <br /> The only plus is the start. It explains well why and how Hercules was born. The rest of the movie was ... just mumbo jumbo composed. It has a potential to be a big movie like LOTR if it is not forced in 2 hours. <br /> <br /> The acting is also not very convincing. OK, not everything is bad. But most of them are. Special effects are stupid and look like they were made ten years earlier (although the 1st sample is pretty good). Overall I give it 4 out of 10 for the reasons I described above.
