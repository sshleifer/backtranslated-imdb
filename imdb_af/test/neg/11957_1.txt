It's a very horrible movie. And if you think you've seen another horrible movie, just like this one, you probably have. You probably made Scarecrow 2 in 2003. Yes that's what I said, Brian (the director) stole the movie idea. And not only did he steal it, he could really make it worse. I bet the actors were afraid to tell people what they were actually in the movie. I must also mention that the director tried to make the cheesiness by showing so many tits. Also the kissing scenes are composed like a porn movie. In fact, it's probably all that the director has ever seen, and tried to create a decent movie that will never work.
