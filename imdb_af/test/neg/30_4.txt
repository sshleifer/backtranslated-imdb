Rita Hayworth is sometimes just cute and for me the only reason to watch this silly movie. Despite the exaggerated 1940s lipstick, Rita was one of Hollywood's all-time glamor women. In fact, for a few years I can't suggest a better-looking person, except perhaps Elizabeth Taylor in her forefront. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the show's co-star, Gene Kelly, doesn't play his normal favor, at least the kind of guy we all know about him in "Singin 'In The Rain." Here's Kelly's "Danny McGuire" much of the time. Phil Silvers, also on TV at Sgt. Bilko loved being so stupid here as "Genius", you'll just listen to his dumb jokes .... and they're stupid. <br /> <br /> The footage is good with good Technicolor, which looks pretty good. You also get very nice women here, not just Hayworth. Unfortunately, the story isn't that much. It centers around Hayworth and decides on a career choice. Along the way we get the normal loose treatment of marriage and we get an insulting stupid. All in all, an unmemorable movie, except as a showcase for Hayworth's beauty.
