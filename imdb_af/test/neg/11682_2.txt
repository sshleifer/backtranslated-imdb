Hmmm, not a patch on the original Shaw Brothers. The battles are average and look very clunky. The story line is what is expected of a 70-year-old Kung Fu movie, confusing and brave. Stupid voices for women, in clear English accent for men. I turned it off early and I love martial arts flicks. Get the original, she's so much better than this average movie, don't be deceived, I bought the wrong movie I wanted was the Shaw brother movie. I just started commenting, I just do foreign and martial arts films. It's just the beginning of my movie collection. Personally I own the most modern martial arts flashes. Hope you don't waste time watching this one, it's for the hard fans of 70's Kung Fu.
