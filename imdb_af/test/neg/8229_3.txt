It's not a very good movie, but it's the best Troma Studios movie I've ever seen. Lloyd Kaufman - the "brain" behind Troma - is not worried about a good plot or even a moderately entertaining movie. His main concern is something strange. And his definition of bizarre often reflects my definition of terrible theater. <br /> <br /> In this film we have the title character Luther - whose favorite pastime is not Baseball but biting the head of the chickens - receiving his release from lock. The board considered that he was rehabilitated despite the fact that he did not speak - he sounded like a chicken - and had a set of razorblade artworks at his disposal. Of course, once Luther is released, he goes to death, first at a grocery store and later at a farmhouse. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$$$ (Much violence in this often tasteless Luther sinks his razorblades into a poor elderly lady waiting at a bus stop and then spends the rest of the movie the mother and daughter on the farm terror. <br /> <br /> NEWS: $$$$$ (Stacy Haiduk makes some notable skin in his photo, as former Lois Lane (I can't remember which Superman edition she was not) give us a landfill followed by a skirt in bed with her boyfriend - a guy just not 'I have any chemistry with Ms. Haiduk. The extensive drama recording in the DVD extras gives the viewer quite more of Stacy. She's quite something. <br /> <br /> STORY: $ (Forgettaboutit !!! Whitey Styles' script may just be the worst ever written. The way Luther is released from the asylum, throw all credibility out of the window Enue is something a preschool student can write and the actions he writes for his characters border on absurdity. Spent ten years without human contact and completely forgot how people respond in certain situations. <br /> <br /> WARNING: $$ (The movie belongs to Edward Terry who actually does a decent job as the Geek. He is pretty deceptive in a dumb farming mode. Joan Roth as the mother does a wonderful job, but Haiduk and her boyfriend's lack of chemistry made their roles uncomfortable at best.
