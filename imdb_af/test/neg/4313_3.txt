I have read the other users' comments and I am fortunate that someone compared them to the original released by Kamal by Perumarzhakalam in 2004. <br /> <br /> The original has a stiff story and no loopholes as described above about Indian Govt not proper records, or even bad shoots and bloopers. <br /> <br /> The story is wonderful and compassionate and well described by others. But, unfortunately, Nagesh is his own story, it is a sad thing and is nothing but plagiarism. <br /> <br /> I think he's touched by Bollywood's so-called "inspired" syndrome. <br /> <br /> At least he must give credit where it's due. <br /> <br /> I liked some of his older movies, but now I suspect any of their originals were original. <br /> <br /> Here is a link in IMDb for the original masterpiece. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425350/#comment I recommend everyone to see the original, even with subtitles if necessary, to know what class direction and class performance is all about.
