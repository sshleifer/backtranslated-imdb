J Carol Nash and Ralph Morgan star in a movie about a crazy scientist in love with a pianist's daughter. When his advances are sworn, he injects the father with a disturbing disease so that she will be forced to come to him to get a cure. <br /> <br /> God is terrible. It is boring and boring and you will nod down before the pianist is compared, I was on the edge. Yes, it picks up as soon as things are put into action, but it is one of those old movies that are better remembered, then seen again. <br /> <br /> If you have to see, it comes in <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
