Good !! The film has Catherine Zeta Jones in it. It's a Hallmark television movie. It comes from a Thomas Hardy novel. This has Catherine Zeta Jones in it. She is by far the only one in the movie that performs better than in my high school theater class. Oh yes, this has Clive Owen in it. I'm not British, it means almost as much as a Thomas Hardy novel. Except he was in "The Bourne Identity" and I liked it. It's just about the whole people. It really was all there. I get repetitive, but I like CZJ, so I put it to the end. The computer tells me that I don't have 10 lines and I still count them. I always count 11, but maybe it doesn't like my style, but it's also my opinion of the movie.
