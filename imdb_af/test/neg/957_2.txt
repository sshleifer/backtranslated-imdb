POSSIBLE SPOILERS - <br /> <br /> I love Dennis Quaid and I love Meg Ryan. I look forward to seeing them together, being married and everyone, I wanted to see their on-screen chemistry. Okay, it is said, I think the fact that they are actors, their display of the screen does not need their performances, especially with this writing. <br /> <br /> How stupid a professor can be to glue himself to anyone I don't remember the original, but I can only assume that O'Brien was probably on his leading lady handcuff, probably on a lake inevitable way. If I was bound to someone, I'd be pretty angry. The loved one I would have had would definitely disappear quickly. Meg didn't even show a little annoyance, but a little surprise. Dennis will have to kick me and scream. The whole part of the movie was so awful - especially Meg must go in the bathroom (# 2) at night between dumpsters. EWWW. No f **** ing way! <br /> <br /> What's with Dennis sucking every suspect in the movie. Sock first asks questions later. Not once, not twice, but too many times. I could count if I was so inclined. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of the movie was Nick and his family drama. Too bad, it couldn't have become the plot anymore. The supposed off-screen drama that leads to this tragedy. I think it could have been written without distracting Dex's quest. <br /> <br /> My guilt lies with the author of this script. Unless the director and others diverted it so much that it was not recognizable. <br /> <br /> I won't even come in real reason, poor Dex is murdered. How ridiculous it is. Even when Dex confronted the real killer and the reason was explained, a real "movie noir" moment was bored on the screen. Oh, _____ has happened. O. (yawn) "Dex even says it's a foolish reason for a triple murder. Oh the tension, you can cut it with a spoon. <br /> <br /> As someone other than Dennis in this movie , I should give it 1/2 star (just because I really saw it worse), but in this case 1 1/2 stars. <br /> <br /> For Dennis and Meg stars, see ANY OTHER.
