What is night vision? Well, according to the star (Williamson), let's see ... one packet owner tells him: "it gets dark outside" what he answers "it makes for better ........." night fish. " What does it mean in hell? In fact, what in hell is this movie trying to say? It has plot holes that you could carry through the murderer's bus. Not to mention a police spokesman, Robert Forster sleeps through this bizarre effort to pay at the ceremony craze and a killer who is killing his videos. That's all I remember. <br /> <br /> The movie took place in Texas, had a few car hunts, and a clich√©d finish. Maybe if you see this movie with their eyes, can it be good? After all, without seeing it .... it would be better ..... night vision. Did it make sense? Nope. And not this movie either.
