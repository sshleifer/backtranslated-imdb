This movie was terribly not only the plot was poor, but the acting was incredibly bad, and sometimes pathetic. Many unrealistic dialogues do not speak to people in real life and there is no emotion or feeling in anything that is very monotonous, except for the almost indistinguishable whisper that is constantly occurring. Even the editing is bad, the clips are terrible. The camera work was messy and shaky on close-ups, even swinging back and forth during conversations. There is nothing positive about this movie and George Katts has to work on heavy machinery or anything he doesn't have to talk to other people because he clearly doesn't know how to do it. How did this movie win / nominate for awards, oh my god !!
