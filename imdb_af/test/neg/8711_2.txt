The only reason I give a second star is for the first half of the movie. It was a good version of the story. I enjoy seeing some fictional characters adding some color to a well-known story. But the second half was terrible !!! Yes, there were violent aspects of this story. But the authors of this movie chose to include only the violence and forget about the good things God did for the Israelites. By the end of the movie Scott looked as if he was receiving messages from the big giant head instead of talking and hearing about God. This version had some major problems with deviation from Scripture. And great surprise, there are no favorable deviations! Their depiction of Moses as this screaming naked lunatic who did it all against his will is completely false. It showed a Moses who had to shout to let God speak. TRAFFIC Scripture says God spoke to Moses all the time and not just to anger. They received the people's complaints, but did not show that God was speaking to Moses in Sinai, in an audible voice that the followers could hear and believe. (Chapter 19). They also forgot the pillar of fire and cloud that led them day and night. <br /> <br /> What was the whole Joshua thing? The just peace that Jew loves that will not fight until Moses threatens him? WRONG (He was known as a great warrior) What about the great speech Moses gave to the army, they told God they helped them enough and now they were alone? WRONG (They only won by God's help, as it was shown in their own scenes, while Moses lifted his staff) And what was it to look at Ark of the Covenant? Instead of transferring it with gold, this movie was on a tight budget, with little gold chips attached to it! Oh yes, it was a "cast calf" not a straw one with small slides. Someone forgot that they had come out of Egypt with a large amount of golden tribute from the Egyptians. You won't know about this sorry-looking forest. <br /> <br /> By the way, the part about those who kill the Israelites after the golden calf incident, says "men" and don't mention women and children who are the movie. Pleased to show the viewers. Oh yes - Manna wasn't the only one sent from heaven - don't forget the birds for meat. The Bible also mentions that Jethro brings Moses his wife and children and then Jethro returns to his own land. It does not say that Moses gave up his family. <br /> <br /> If you don't know the true story, read Exodus to yourself. If you know the right story, you will hate this version.
