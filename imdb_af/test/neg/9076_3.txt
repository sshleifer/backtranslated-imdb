Other reviews talked about how honest this film is, especially in terms of male frontal nudity. Well, those who have seen Grande Ecole with his often naked actors and expect something similar, are in a great disappointment. In addition to a few seconds in the recreational space of the judo team, the two lead a side-to-door shower of a grand total of 15 seconds. The female lead has comparable short front moments. Many of this film's marketing is aimed at the gay-male audience, but those who even expect a hint of homosexuality between the two male leaders (best friends having a three-way relationship with one of them) will be most disappointed. There is not even an indication that one of the people is interested in the other, or even hardly aware that the other part of the menage is a console. As a movie, Douches Froides is particularly strange; the viewer gets very little sense for who these three young people are, how they feel, why they act like they do. About one hour of the original track has been removed; Perhaps this is why the finished film looks frustratingly undeveloped. Stick to Grande Ecole, a French film that delivers more than its promises.
