I think many friends of people who acted in this thing should come and graduate it because I tell you, it's just awful. The acting is worse than soap opera, the effects are like something you would see from a 1970's Doctor Who episode. The story is, there is no story. And they still use the same 2 minute song over and over and over. And the werewolf? It's like the muppets they used in Wing Commander, the giant cats, remember how bad they looked? The werewolf is so bad. Seriously, the man who corrected this thing is horrible and should never be guided again, except perhaps his son's school play, but even then he must pay the audience to see it. Ghostwolf is nothing but a bad joke.
