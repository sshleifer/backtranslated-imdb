I watched this movie just coz. David Dhawan is expected to be another entertainer. <br /> <br /> Bad bad returns by David Dhawan. He made many funny movies in the past that didn't make sense, but none of them was a crap bag !! What a waste of talent and beauty was it? Donno why actors agree on dummy movies like this. <br /> <br /> There wasn't a little practical in this movie. The movie is under par and does not justify the standard and potential Bollywood at all. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth watching in this movie was Katrina, but we don't have to watch a movie like this to see her! Being a remake of Hollywood movie, it is clear that Bollywood directors can't even make a proper remake. I see it as the worst ever movie I've ever seen. Awful 1/10
