Mr. Costner again dragged a movie for longer than needed. Apart from the enormous series of abuses, of which there are very few, I just didn't care about any of the characters. Most of us have ghosts in the closet, and Costner's character is realized well in advance, and then forgotten until much later, during which I don't care. The character we really care about is a very brave, well-known Ashton Kutcher. The problem is that he comes down as a child who thinks he is better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a mess. His only stumbling block seems to be winning Costner. Finally, if our stuff is beyond the half point of this stinker, Costner tells us all about Kutcher's ghosts. We are told why Kutcher is driven to be the best without prior clipping or foreshadowing. No magic here, it was all I could do to prevent it from turning on for an hour.
