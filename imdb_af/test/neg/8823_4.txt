"I didn't laugh so hard, since Grandma is trapped in the wringer," said one of the pencils in this hilarious quasi-spoof of all the Val Lewton and George A. Romero running movies we got, depending on you personal taste) over the years. <br /> <br /> In this story, a young couple plays a ghoulish prank on the rest of their troops, one ghostly night, they visit a cemetery. Their artistic director, Alan, suggests resurrecting the dead by performing a highly stylized ritual. <br /> <br /> Too much screen time has been missed; The amateur dialogue includes lame witticisms, melodrama and other kinds of unnecessary filler commentaries (and can't stop Alan laughing that annoying ... far too much!). Once the action comes in (which comes close to the end of this movie), it's worth the wait. <br /> <br /> I saw this one on a local television program from the local station, which ran so many movies like this one. Only this one scared me at age 13. But then again, you can go through it to the bitter end ... ... which is probably why very few people still wear striped hip-huggers.
