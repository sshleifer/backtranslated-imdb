try hard to fit into the scary space comedy genre, this movie falls into two of these. It does happen in space - but it's not funny or scary. The plot is unfortunate and the one joke about the intellect of the computer is being killed. Say Paul Whitthorne as Ethan, Angela Bassett as Fran and Brad Dourif as Al Bert make the best of their ham script. The greedy relationship between Ethan and Al Bert is shown but never explored, while the attempted sexual tension betwen fran and rick is so rough to laugh. All in all, it is a turkey that fits best with late-night TV, preferably while ironing.
