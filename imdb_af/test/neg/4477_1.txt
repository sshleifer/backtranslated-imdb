I was really looking forward to this title. It sounded and looked nice. The idea of ​​someone who makes a cute 50-year-old monster movie might have been a little fun, but instead, this title only worsens. First, there is almost no Froggg in the whole movie that is the biggest disappointment. I need to put drama and dialogue through 75 + minutes of lame to get a few cans of Froggg, which is a bare breasted chick. Why? In addition, the movie has no pleasure. I mean, give me something that is a little more interesting than just a lot of conversations. I wanted to see some hot chickens looking for the creatures in the marsh, I wanted to see some tucked in an urgent need for salvation to his army (Creation from the Black Lagoon). I wanted a few goofy action scenes from the Froggg going to a deadly spree, or it might be a stupid fall. Something exciting! Geez, enjoy it, be creative! Who wants to end up in endless and tiring dialogue scenes in a creative movie? My advice to the filmmakers: Keep going, your concepts are good, but your performance needs to be much more inspired. Be fun with the creature, put the humor into action and most importantly ... put more creature into a creative movie !!!
