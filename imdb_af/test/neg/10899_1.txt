If you just want to, and nothing but torture and torture, you come to the right movie. If you want you to end up at least a splinter of good acting, logic, story, consequences, or even a good guy, go elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I can't help but think of myself, "Jeeeez, are those people challenged spiritually?" For example, after being chased and mutilated, the main actress meets a police officer and spits out her story to the policeman with tears and everything and tells him about the psychopath driving in a yellow truck. The yellow truck pulled up and the officer just walked over, talking to the man and drove the truck without any problems. The actress comes out and says why didn't you arrest him? And then the truck runs over the police officer. After being rammed, the truck on the road stops about 20 feet and just stands there while the actress tries to drag the police away, but he's too heavy. (At that time) At that time, the truck was fired twice over the police leg. The truck then drives off. Why didn't the actress get the gun over me. (Later on, she shot the police twice in the head because the psychopath would burn him alive) Once through the mouth, which did not kill him (Duuuumb) and twice to complete the work. * Roll eyes * Just afterwards she turns away to escape the bathroom that will explode and as she climbs near the roof, she turns around and the cop is no longer there ... OK ... <br /> <br / > Another example, The main actress meets a dressed woman in the bathroom, spits out like a liter of blood on the floor, which covers about 1/3 of the room. (Probably more) After the main actress goes outside to grab a towel, she comes back and everything is gone. : They don't explain why everyone also disappears. Stupid them. <br /> <br /> I like horror / thriller / gore movies, but this one was just too stupid. I lost brain cells watching this dribble and you shouldn't.
