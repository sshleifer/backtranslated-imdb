This is the movie that sounded pretty much to the Hollywood screen saver. At over $ 40 million, the Sky Gate is so poorly designed and executed, it will take a lifetime to break down every area of ​​failure. What makes me really worth it is that it is technically very bad, an unforgivable sin for the money that went through it. John Hurt's opening speech at Harvard is inaudible, such as a conversation between Kris Kristofferson and Richard Masur at the station. Some people think Cimino considered it a "style". He didn't. It's just bad sound recording. The characters are not particularly well-drawn except for the four or five leaders; In the climaxing scene, it's hard to tell who the bad guys are and who are the good guys. Even at that level, it is impossible to enjoy the movie. The casting of Isabelle Huppert as the town is Mrs. A joke, her French accent makes the whole character a scam. The acting is generally stiff, without any scope or depth of feeling; even Christopher Walken is bad. John Hurt's character is the only one with any stranger or vitality (although Hurt, in his 40s, plays a fresh Harvard grade with bags under his eyes, is completely ridiculous). <br /> <br /> I think it's too long, left over. The roller-skating figure could easily be cut, the cockpit is quickly becoming a movie clip. The final scene aboard the ocean captain is straight into the Twilight Zone. With Rod Serling appearing in front of the camera at the end to explain what we just watched, the perfect final would have been. Actually, the screens in themselves are not bad, but Cimino did not get the right to include them, because what he gave us as the "meat" of the picture is so incompetent. The editing is poor, especially in the grand battle climax. At the same point, the same explosion with the same wagon wheel flying out of the blast is used three times. I wish I could say something - something nice about this movie: a wonderful scene, a good performance, even a memorable dialogue, but I can't. It's just one big unholy mess. The only thing I liked was the cinematography and the Montana venues, which are stunning. Even Cimino couldn't screw it. It is a long, boring, bad movie according to all standards. And the people who say it's just because of cost overruns are just a joke. 1/2 * out of 4
