It comes close to the worst movie I've ever seen. The author starts you so that you go with Jasper (Josh Hartnett). When he did absolutely nothing wrong, Sam (Leelee Sobiesky) left him for Kelley (Chris Klein) in a way that makes you angry at Sam. You don't leave what she feels, so her feelings with Kelley aren't really for you, and their relationship is ominous. It drags you in any direction, and it becomes quite tiring and annoying. The only good thing about this movie I saw was the cast. <br /> <br />
