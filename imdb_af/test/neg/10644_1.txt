Hellraiser: Bloodlyn is just such a movie. I believe this is the fourth installment in the Hellraiser series. <br /> <br /> I missed the beginning, and all I remember about it was a few topless women and a boxing shape thing on a computer screen. But using my wit and intelligence (and the Info Button) I soon realized that the villain (Pinhead) was released from Pandora's Box, which I believe is a gateway to hell. <br /> <br /> So anyway, Pinhead somehow comes out of the box and terrorizes the Toymaker's family. And it's about it. Oh, and not call the random torture of different people crossing its path. Yawn. <br /> <br /> What happens mainly in this movie is that Pinhead catches the child and then releases the dog on his wife and then kills a random person. Then the man comes along, blah, blah, blah. Who cares? Why it fails is because Hellraiser: Bloodline is too wheat to be scary. Look at Pinhead's downfall of creatures: a cheese-like dog that looks like it is inside, two men whose heads and bodies are together, (Siamese twins in a horror movie?) And someone who is some kind of princess. (I didn't see the previous movies.) Now look at the main villain. His name is Pinhead. Isn't that the name you call someone if they're stupid? He has pins in his head and hooks come from his fingers and he has blue skin. I suppose he would make a decent villain if he didn't have such a cricket name, and a chorus. Somewhere in the movie two policemen came to him and said, "Don't let us hurt you!" Pinhead replies, "Pain? How dare you use the word! I AM pain?" blah, blah, blah, blah blah. It sounds a little clich√© if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Don't forget the last half of the movie. The characters (and audience) are getting more torture as Pinhead attacks on futuristic asylum attack. Some people we don't recognize (maybe he was in the previous movies. I don't remember him in the beginning of the movie.) This scene is basically one thing played over and over. <br /> <br /> A watch is going to inspect a mysterious noise. <br /> <br /> Another wait: "Oh no! He's off. I'll go and see for himself!" <br /> <br /> After he dies the same thing happens again. <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS) Here's the thing I didn't get. In the film, Pinhead is sent to Oblivion at the end. So how does he come back for four more movies? Are they prequels? Why didn't he die in previous cases? Geez. The makers have to set up an idea for another series. (END OF SPOILERS) Hellraiser: Bloodline is stingy and full of torture, but has little excitement or fright. Don't forget this. Bad special effects with bad things. Everything makes it more of a snooze party than a good horror. Well: Well, some people can enjoy the topless women in the beginning. Plus, Pinhead's voice is pretty cool. I think if you like ultra-violence, you might like it too. <br /> <br /> Bad: None of the reasons above make it a very good movie. The wheat and repetition are pretty bad. And who calls their villain Pinhead? <br /> <br /> Send me a Private Message on this comment.
