Combining serious drama with adequate comedy touches on the best of times. In search of comedy in the Muslim world, it kicked off thanks to a topical subject and a fantastic writing; Not to mention Albert Brooks' excellent bread character portrayal. MAN OF THE YEAR cannot, however, come close together. It wrapped up a messy message with forced jokes and a totally twisted love story. <br /> <br /> The premise was initially very promising. Put up a Jon Stewart-like comedy news man for President of the United States and see what happens. This independent runner is Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams, RV), a successful TV personality that is put under pressure by his audience. Along with him comes his manager Jack (Christopher Walken, CLICK), and his author Eddie (Lewis Black). Due to a very good chance of a successful run, Tom Dobbs wins the election incredibly. <br /> <br /> But did he? Eleanor Green (Laura Linney, THE EXORCIST OF EMILY ROSE) is a computer winner at the company that designed the new software for electronic voice at polling stations. She finds a glitch in the system that is quickly being thrown under the carpet by its owner and his dark lawyer Alan (Jeff Goldblum, Independent Day). Given losing billions of dollars if this word comes out, the company's evil men have decided to discredit and / or kill Eleanor to make sure she never tells anyone. But Eleanor can press. Dobbs comes and eventually spills the beans (this is where the incredible love story also begins to blossom). Dobbs goes on Saturday Night Live and explains everything to the world, removing himself as the newly elected president and ending the careers of those at the computer company ... oh, and saving me. Green's life. <br /> <br /> Do any of these sounds funny? The comedy is inaugurated in the story and is often uncomfortable. Robin Williams blows for a few moments during a debate, but is plunged quickly as the gravity of how he became President comes down to him. <br /> <br /> The message of the movie is interesting and also debates: that special interest holds presidential candidates. I'm sure there is considerable truth in this, and if you want to make a movie about it, you can do it. If you wanted to make a comedy, you can. But Man of the Year is not.
