Divorced single mother in picturesque coastal town finds an anonymous love letter and enables her to encourage her dormant love life. Pet project for actress / co-producer Kate Capshaw, which gives a warm, well-modulated head performance, but this story is so slender and the direction and editing are so erratic that a vague dissatisfaction creeps. Initially, Capshaw's Helen sees several of her friends reading the love letter (an interesting visual joke), but the first person to play with this jersey is Ellen DeGeneres, who doesn't play a lesbian, but because of this gymnast comes down. Different ideas are woven into the hope that one will hold on, and the continuity is extremely weak. Supporting cast (including Tom Selleck and Tom Everett Scott, who usually finish with his shirt) is very good, but they can't save the final act, which is disappointing. Low-key, in a joyful, pleasant way, but it is merely good-natured, nothing more. ** 1/2 from ****
