Randy Bowers (John Wayne) arrives at the Half Way House at the right time to take a break from the trail, discovering dead bodies inside, including a man he was supposed to deliver. Ed Rogers, owner of the business. He is observed by the dead cousin Sally (Alberta Vaughn), behind a hidden room, where she remained unaware during the massacre. <br /> <br /> "Randy Rides Alone" was directed by Harry Fraser. He uses a filming technique here as in other of his films, where he advances the action from one place to another, usually with a rider on a horse. It's done pretty well and looks pretty innovative in this 1930's Lone Star Westerns. <br /> <br /> Pre-Gabby George Hayes is on hand, sans whiskers, and this is the first time I've seen him as a villain. . In fact, it took a few scenes to realize that it was in a dual role. First, he communicated a businessman, Matt the Mute, with pencil and paper, to change only gang leader Marvin Black. Black's gang was responsible for the murders at Half Way House, in an effort to force Sally to sell to Matt / Marvin. Another stacker is also here, Yakima Canutt as a black hooker named Spike. Interestingly, Yakima portrayed a villain named Sam Black in another Fraser / Wayne otter, "Neath the Arizona Skies". <br /> <br /> There is a fair amount of temporary killing horseback riding between the Black's Gang and the Sheriff's posts, such as John Wayne's character maneuvers to expose the bad guys. In the end, he saves the day by securing Sally Rogers's thirty thousand dollars at the expense of the destruction of the Half Way House, where he exchanges a few dynamics for the booty in a safe. Greedy Marvin Black tries to open it with his six-shooter, and the blast is an appropriate end to the villain. In his best "Aw Shucks" stance, John Wayne falls under the spell of the beautiful Sally Rogers, and unfortunately, Randy rides alone!
