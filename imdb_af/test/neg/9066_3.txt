This movie is not as good as I thought it would be. There is no story whatsoever, no characters and some dialogue would have been nice. The gore effects are good and sometimes it gets bloody but nothing over. It starts with an autopsy on a man and when it's about the scene, the girl starts. The music is a classic score and fits the movie very well. They had to make a 90-minute version in which they could develop time for character development, so we could feel sorry for the person on the autopsy table. And some more information about the mortars would have made this movie more enchanting than it is. Don't expect a scary movie, but a nice, fine special effect roll.
