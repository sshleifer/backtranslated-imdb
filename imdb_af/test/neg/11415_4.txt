The key role in Rodrigo Garcia's "Nine Life" comes when Sissy Spacek, hidden in a hotel room where she's a relationship with Aiden Quinn, gets a nature documentary on television, and at that point Quinn shows that such things are going on - Discrete footage is edited in one scene, predators and prey are thrown together to capture the moment - all to force connections where no one actually exists. Characters in the nine shorts that make this movie sometimes spill into each other's stories, but nobody really seems to be able to connect. A woman preparing for a violent confrontation with her abused father is later seen in a hospital room where another woman prepares for a mastectomy. A man who goes into a supermarket in an old girl and sees his life later as host, with his present wife, a dinner for an unhappy couple. Garcia arranges some of his characters in front of each other, but none of the subsequent stories is ever really based on what has come before. <br /> <br /> Garcia's first film, The Wonderful, Has Overlooked. "Things you can tell just by looking at her" also had a short story structure and overlapping characters, but there were fewer of them and they had much more space to breathe and grow. The gimmicky premise of "Nine Dear", that each of its nine stories is told in a single, unbroken recording in real time, never lets the film build any real dramatic tension or momentum. It's also a pretty visually ugly movie. Inside shots are often dark and difficult to look at, while other scenes, especially where a girl speaks to each other to talk to her relentless parents, are being disturbed by the camera work. Given that it is Garcia's third movie and that he has a respected history of directing television, the direction in this movie is quite surprisingly amateurish. Rebecca Miller, as co-filmmaker-child-of-a-great-writer, is focused on Garcia (son of Gabriel Garcia Marquez) on writing and character aspects of his films, often to the detriment of filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Individual scenes touch and even affect. I kissed like Jason Issacs, Robin Wright Penn's pregnant belly. And Joe Mantegna loves his wife while sliding into pre-operation sedation. And Sissy Spacek steals some happy moments away from her life with Aiden Quinn before being brought back with a call from her daughter. But the movie (other than "things you can tell just by looking at her") feels more like an exercise than the real drama. We just look at people.
