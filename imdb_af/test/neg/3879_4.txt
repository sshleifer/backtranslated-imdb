Bhagam Bhag was a waste of money and time great time! I wonder you did Govinda this movie? Govinda ... dude ... your big fan, you gotta make decisions in choosing a movie? I wonder he had any role in that movie. Govinda's role can be given to Johnny Lever. Akshay Kumar steals the show here! Akshay ... push your rock! You've created space in everyone's heart around the world! Lara Dutta, Tansuhree .... your guys deserve better. Paresh Rawal is good at his witty! Overall there was little scene where I laughed ... otherwise I just wondered: "Yes, did Priyadarshan make such a silly movie?" Anyway, we can wait and watch movie.
