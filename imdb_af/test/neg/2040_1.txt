An art student in Rome is ... or something. She has dreams of being nailed to a cross and Satan raping himself. He owns her (I think) and turns her into a sex addict. It's about everything I could take and I turned it off. <br /> <br /> An inexorable "exorcist" rip off. I caught it on the cable back in the 80's and was horrible ... and not in a good way! This movie is supposed to be a horror movie, but is nothing more than a sex movie disguised as a horror movie. There are tons of senseless female nudity and the actress who plays the head must humiliate herself more than once. We see that she is raped by Satan (a sincere guy), masturbating, coming to her own father ... Giving her points for courage. Add to that bad dubbing, editing (the rape scene looks a bit cut), common sense and a story that makes it impossible. The one disturbing row (nailed to the cross) ALMOST works but the bad "special" effects ruin it. It's one of those little horror movies that was so bad, I stopped watching. Skip it.
