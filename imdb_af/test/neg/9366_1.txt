From the beginning, this film is dragging and dragging. Lots of overbearing explain the history, monochrome-acting, boring sets, total lack of any humanity, dyeing or style. The actors seem to be drugs. Potentially an interesting story completely wasted. Surely someone realized how bad it was at some time to manufacture it?
