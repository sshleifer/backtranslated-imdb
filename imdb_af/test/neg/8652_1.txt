Oh my god, WHY, I wasted my precious time on this movie? It's pathetic, waaaay OTT and unrealistic, and one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Yes, MY LIFE. I'm ashamed of Yash Raj movies, the poor guys have to live with the terrible news, yes, they made this terrible movie. <br /> <br /> It's by far the most trashy, sexual eyebrow enhancement movie I've ever seen through Yash Raj Films. I cringe for them, I really do. Along with the terrible play (or NO acting) by Uday Chopra, combined with the lack of talent of "Look At My Boobs" Tanisha, Neal 'n' Nikki doesn't have one thing at all. Even the music is no higher than the standard that YRF leaves. The director, Arjun Sablok, did an embarrassment here. <br /> <br /> Honestly I expected more. Much, much more.
