This film is a perfect example of how to take a fascinating subject, compile 25 minutes of substantive material and stretch it into a six-hour drill that looks like the form a documentary can take as Fox- news decided to make one. Even the participants in this obnoxious obstructive movie cannot hide their laughter from the stupidity of their attempt to show one of the few great times in world history where people take a stand and work to make a better world. If only the creators talked to Ken Burns for five minutes, they could have come up with something light in place of this cure for insomnia.
