Attack on Village 13: 3/10: Let's forget for a moment that Attack on Village 13 is a remake of a classic action movie. Striking on own merit. Assault is a debacle. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the Rio Bravo style scenario. About a dozen people are trapped in a dilapidated Detroit police station (If the Detroit site stops your Robocop hot and fuzzies, it can easily be said to be Topeka in opening credits and nothing would change. In the bush would be more meaningful made them our bad guys; corrupt police. <br /> <br /> Now I know what you think. Corrupt policemen? Was the weekend and drug cartels busy this weekend? Of course it's not ordinary policemen. These guys are right on the front page of the latest Tom Clancy video game. Yup we have body weapons; helicopters; laser sights; night vision protects the works. So we got thirty S.W. members / special forces armed against teeth fresh 4 policemen (drunk do you think it is New Year's Eve), 2 girls in some dresses and half a dozen criminals. <br /> <br /> So how do our heroes defend themselves? Truth is they can't. Everyone should be dead within ten minutes. (Not to mention the characters in the inside has an annoying habit of walking across the windows.) Now, an illogical scenario is no reason to hit a movie esp. A B-style action movie. However, with the exception of Laurence Fishburne and Ethan Hawke, all the other characters seem to be comical relief. (At least I hope they are) <br /> <br /> While Yes Rules and Leguizamo's characters are bad enough. It is Aisha Hind's minstrel show that takes the cake. Rare has appeared a more stereotypical African American character on the modern screen. Her performance looks like a freaky boy in black and dragging ghetto. <br /> <br /> In the original assault a gangster takes over an ice truck and drives around the area and shoots girls in the head. I have since had an irrational fear of trucks. After this assault, I have a complete rational fear of remake.
