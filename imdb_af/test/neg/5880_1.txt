I saw the * star * of this movie on The Daily Show, and thought I might agree (the movie was on Comedy Central, then in theaters). O Vey! <br /> <br /> It makes "Shakes the Clown" look like "Citizen Kane"! Avoid, avoid, avoid at all costs. Not one laugh, not even a smile. This movie will put your face in pimples and your eyes burst like the last remedies of "Raiders". I can't even think of a worse movie, whether it's "Manos" or "Ishtar". As the Pythons watched, run away, run away! Why did anyone light it green unless they used their own money? The horror is that there is NOT one good line, not ONE good joke, and only ONE bad thing ... making this movie. <br /> <br /> I feel it, if properly made, would have been hilarious. As it is, I need a new pancreas to beat so hard. Damn someone involved in this travesty.
