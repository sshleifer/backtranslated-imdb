What I wouldn't do to write this movie again. Extra disappointing because of the big start, Solo Dios disrupts Sabe in a mess of superstitious bull after halfway and ends on a letter so ridiculous, sweet and melodramatic. I couldn't believe I watched the same movie I started. The film has many elements in its favor, such as the chemistry between Diego Luna and Alice Braga, so enticing. I thought the screen would start sparkling, a good soundtrack and beautiful places. Instead of ending up with the melancholy religious mumbo jumbo, the film had to be the focus of being a frightening road movie, with perhaps a few undertones about fate and superstition versus logic that was confused. I understand that the director's full intention with the movie was to make it about religion, but the fact is that it just didn't work and he threw away so many good things from the beginning.
