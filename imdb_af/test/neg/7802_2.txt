While the Twilight zone was a great show, it was also very uneven. With a few great episodes, a few lizards and lots in between. Don't believe the stingy fans - there were a few stinkers and it was definitely one of them. <br /> <br /> In a plot intended to be an attack on Fidel Castro, a close lookalike (Peter Falk in many makeup and a beard) gets a magical mirror that Allow him to realize who all his enemies are so he can liquidate them. While I believe that Castro is a rogue and dictator (and tens of thousands of refugees and political prisoners will confirm this), it is wonderful how this kind of preaching episode actually makes audiences laugh at American efforts to marginalize the creep and actually make Castro look ok !! Think about it. Serro and company wanted to hurt Castro, but instead it was just obvious, preaching and stupid. <br /> <br /> It's really bad - almost laughs badly when it's seen today.
