The movie starts out relatively well and looks somewhere somewhere when an African American passenger fails to airline. There is one scene in which his pet is sucked into the engine and it's really a sad thing. But the way it is portrayed makes it hard for someone to find out if it was an attempt to ruhum or a tragedy to reflect on the degree of negligence? After this point they clearly went out of ideas. If you stay long enough, you will soon be treated to one of the worst movies ever made. It's basically a highly racist series of smoking baptism, toilet humor, styling every segment of the plane to reflect American American pop culture and virtually nothing else. You would think the only 3 white passengers on board would lead to some hilarious effects, but none of the same happened. They were basically just added to show how badly they could be treated initially and could later be taken up in the hood if they were worn. Avoid.
