How can they take such a beautiful animated jewel as Don Bluth's All Dogs go to heaven and bastard it with a charming, cheesy, memorable sequel. The ghostly music and wonderful characters are gone, now replaced with tough animation and an imaginative plot. <br /> <br /> The benefits: Charlie Sheen is sometimes fun like Charlie, but he doesn't have the pretty tough old-fashioned attitude. live by Burt Reynolds. I especially enjoy the songs "I'll always be with you" and "It's too heavenly here." The Cons: There seems to be no connection between this and the original. In the beginning, Charlie is chums with Carface, but waits for a moment. Isn't that the same character that was responsible for Charlie's murder and kidnapped the lovely little one he loved? I think all the changes in Heaven, but why isn't Anne-Marie even called? If Itchy make it to Heaven, will Flo and Killer not make it either? What about Annabelle's whippet's voice? In the original it sounds feminine and charming and in the future it sounds like a snake, bitchy, parrot. The new characters are not that big (except Sasha). And the animation is better compared to a generic Saturday morning cartoon. The constant cartoon-like humor is flat and unfunny and the "heart" does not work when compared to the original, having such a moving impeccable touch that makes me cry every time. <br /> <br /> All dogs go to Heaven is one of my all-time favorite movies. How Don Bluth allowed this successor to be made is beyond me. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: Not all persecutors go to Heaven.
