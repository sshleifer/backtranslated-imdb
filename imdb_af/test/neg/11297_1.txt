* Hannibal SPOILERS * Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is back ... for filming a movie! Now he is in Italy and appreciates our food (including people like Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini)), but comes back to the states for Clarice (Julianne Moore) and even the score with a former victim, Mason Verger (Gary Oldman). <br /> <br /> Let me tell you, this movie doesn't deserve to be talked to with Silence of the Lambs and Manhunter because it's really quite completely BAD. <br /> <br /> I mean, the scene near the end when Ray Liotta's tap was opened and forced him to eat part of his brain juice? WTF? Then why was the HELL all so irritating (including Clarice)? And why didn't the story go anywhere? I suppose this is the "teen" chapter of the Hannibal series; terrible, stupid, frightening and very embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it, especially if you love any other Hannibal movie (SOTL, Manhunter, Red Dragon, Hannibal Rising). <br /> <br /> Hannibal: 1/10.
