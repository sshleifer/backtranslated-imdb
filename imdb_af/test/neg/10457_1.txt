If you're like me and you sometimes enjoy horrible movies (I think it's kind of slowing down at a car accident), you can't do better! The plot is immobile, the special effects are hilarious and the acting is the worst you will ever see! 4 THUMBS DOWN! WOOOHOOOOOOOO !!! Seriously, I have no idea how the director and the "actors" can sleep at night! It's painful, yet hysterically funny, to watch and I strongly recommend it to those who want to punish themselves for something. If you can see this crap without wincing, you're a better man than I will ever be! I wonder if the manufacturer of this garbage has any idea he gets himself (and his money) in!
