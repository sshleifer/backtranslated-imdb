The appeal of this movie must be the artsy Euro style because there is absolutely no dust. A lot of things are going to look somewhere, but it never gets there. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to comment a full 10 lines because this movie is such a completely empty experience. . There are many pictures of a cemetery, some very low zombie effects, some flashes of surrealistic humor, and a weak, existentialist end. These elements undermine one another. Just when you can enjoy the creepy mood, there are some folly with bouncing heads or zombie sex. To prevent you from shouting with boredom, you associate with the minimal storyline - and disintegrate into ridiculous illogical. It was as if someone had taken some half-baked B movies and threw them into a blender. <br /> <br /> What comes out is usually a movie * about * meaninglessness - and * not * a good one. It will be clear that the category of art lover is impressed by the fact that emptiness is seen as indistinguishable in depth. Everyone else should be well-off with this terrible mess.
