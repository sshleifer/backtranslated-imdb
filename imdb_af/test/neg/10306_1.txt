I'm very open minded. I look at all kinds of programs at the end ... good or bad ... just to give them a chance and learn about the good things and bad people. This show had the potential to be good. But my God, what were the authors, casting director and director thinking? The role players are terrible ... with the slightest exception to Meryl (Mimi Rogers), and Darcy (Joy Osmanski) is occasionally given good lines with the best performance of the lot. <br /> <br /> The rest of the throw kills the show. This is the same story line in each episode. Sam plans to do something. His boss disrupts these plans by awarding ridiculous work projects. Then the foolish ways try Sam to accommodate both in a way that is mostly stupid and has no real intelligent humor. This is every episode. It becomes very tiring. <br /> <br /> Season 2, they cut the eyecup. The 2 "hot" girls in the show are being written out (yet the brother stays explained to me, please explain the decisive cut). I can see why they wrote them ... they had no significant role, but they didn't add anyone better to replace them. <br /> <br /> The crazy Derek Tricolli character is continuously shown in season 2. His play (with everyone else) looks like many poor sitcoms from the 80's ... might have been funny ... but painful now. <br /> <br /> The show could have been so much better with some good writers and some people who had any talent to perform. This show is missing everything. Production quality is the only good aspect of the show. It is wonderful in that respect. Unfortunately, the content is painfully sad. <br /> <br /> My god. FOX, was there really nothing better to choose from? I like performances like "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" or "30 Rock". The bar needs to be set up by programs like this that actually assume that the audience is intelligent and does not constantly float on themselves, with all their brain power to continue breathing.
