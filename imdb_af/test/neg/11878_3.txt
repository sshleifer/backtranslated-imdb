Wesley Snipes the latest straight to the video movie is a confused mess, reminiscent of Steven Seagal's latest works. The writing is terribly written and does not account for the low budget it is and tries to be clever for its own good. Unfortunately, Snipes have fallen in the fall to have an ADR voicemail that does much of its dialogue, and a whole narrative that comes through points in the movie every time. It is sad to see a Wesley Snipes talent who makes garbage like this movie and delivers a hassle and boring performance, and hardly bothered to produce his own dialogue. It's a bit of a joke with Steven Seagal, the fact that he doesn't conduct his own dialogue, but that's not something I expected from Snipes. Perhaps it is thanks to the manufacturer, Andrew Stevens, who used to work with Seagal, or director Po-Chi Leong, responsible for Seagal's epic bad out of reach. <br /> <br /> The plot involves shady civil servants, terrorist coaching soccer teams, incriminating disks, and a lot of missing money. Oh and biological weapons. Now how they connect, I don't know, but what I can tell you is the deadly slice that is hard to grasp and like many of these DTV movies it likes one turn too much. The plot is also uninteresting, it plays cards with people who have shadow for one who is in offices and dark corridors. It's all kind of "We can put out a seat for the sad bastards watching this movie!" The pace of the movie as such suffers, because the film does have some good action scenes, despite the dull character of the performances and the storyline. As an example of how a DTV movie has successfully placed a story of a winding nature, I give you Dolph Lundgren's director debut, the Defender. This movie had its share of twists and turns over complexity, but the movie has a final hour of almost complete action, with Dolph under beloved terrorists. The plot points are told, in the context of action, on the move, while death is avoided. The movie doesn't stop telling us what's happening, it doesn't break the pace. As such, although the plot was a little over, it was more in vain because the action never gave up. The explosions like too many of these films stop everything to give us a winding through who's bad, and who doesn't, before it is inevitably shifted in pulling the back turn at the end. These movies often suffer from pacing issues. <br /> <br /> Snipes himself, as I mentioned, is pretty narrow here. At first, he is dressing up a camper, as he is covered with some arms dealers. Initially he seemed to enjoy himself, but unfortunately the rest of the movie saw him and she occasionally voice, double sleep, through the role. Snipes only come alive when he is encouraged to kick ass. However, there are some good action here, with some quick and crackling martial arts and some beautiful teams. The movie also contains a decent car hunt. Silvia Colloca is a co-star and she is not much of an actress, but she is beautiful, with a costume screaming "look at my cleavage!" The rest of the roll throws in and out with clich√©d and uninteresting roles. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, snipes have had better projects from now on. He also named another team with Mario Van Peebles, Hard Luck, then he will do Chasing The Dragon, director Chris Nahon, who did Jet Li's Kiss Of The Dragon. Finally, Snipes apparently makes Toussaint, a biographical drama, led by Danny Glover. The future suddenly looks better for Snipes, but we can remember that he paid very well for his DTV movies, about $ 7 million, a movie, possibly more. It is also funny to consider that of all these DTV gods Dolph Lundgren do the better movies, with the enjoyable Defender and the extremely violent and beautifully done The Russian Specialist, and what does he do more on a fraction of the budgets of These diabolic offerings from Wesley and Steven Seagal produce. * 1/2
