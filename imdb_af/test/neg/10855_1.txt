It's probably the worst and most disappointing movie I've ever seen. I spent four years at two universities and know that there should be a good film about the experience. It is not so. The "acting" is god terrible and the plot does not exist. <br /> <br /> Here are some incidents of my one year in homes. <br /> <br /> 1 Unknowingly came a transvestite. 2) The best friendship of two girls - one with big breasts and the other with the nickname "the brick". 3) A couple who shook too much. 4) The boy who gets all the girls 5) The boy from Northern Ireland who is very difficult to understand. 6) McDonalds in bed 7) Curry every night for a week 8) Student bashing, some of my friends ended up in hospital 9) The discarded joint that started a fire. 10) The Flood 11) The boy waking up on his floor to see that every piece of furniture was taken from his room. <br /> <br /> And if I can get that list up in 5 minutes and from real life, I'm sure some scriptwriters can do better, much better. <br /> <br /> And for a movie named after a Sleeper song, where is the Britpop soundtrack?
