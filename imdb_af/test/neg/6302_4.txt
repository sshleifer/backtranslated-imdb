"Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" is always portrayed as a masterpiece of the Australian theater. I found it disappointing. The lead actors are wonderful. Terence Stamp is beautifully obsolete, Guy Pearce has to do more comedy instead of the dull roles he picks and I was a fan of Hugo Weaving since I saw Oberon eons ago. The cinematography is great, but if you've ever been to Australian overseas, you know that the sky is so clear and light so brilliant that it shot at the movie equivalent of a Box Brownie and it would still have been spectacular looked. <br /> <br /> So, what's my problem? Well, three things. First, there is no sympathetic female character in the whole movie. A woman who has to earn her life, shoots ping pong balls from her private in a street cellar, deserves our sympathy. Tick's wife doesn't get much better treatment. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the scene when they sing "I will survive" to a group of Aboriginals is offensive. Trying to pull any kind of parallel between the battle of dragon ladies and trannies and the almost total destruction of the Aboriginal culture, which I accept the scene is supposed to do, shows a historic understanding worthy of Paris Hilton. /> Last of all, and the biggest mistake in the movie is that it's just not funny enough. Did Stephan Elliott talk to a dragon queen when he wrote the movie? Anyone who knows a drag queen (or three or four) knows that most of them are rapacious and they are not afraid to use it. Now I can understand that a lot of the queen of drawers was more likely to have refused the movie, but Elliott could have collected enough "material for the kiddies" to complete his film. <br /> <br /> So all in all a waste of a good idea and a good role.
