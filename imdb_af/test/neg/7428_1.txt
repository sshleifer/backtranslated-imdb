I got this thing off the sci-fi shelf because I remembered being the first of the series when I was a kid. I rented the second one and it was a decent B-sci-fi. This one was unfair. The "special" effects on the cars look like something my 4-year-old cousin could have done. The two assistant female cyborgs were so horrible that I literally ran around the screen every time. The plot left so much to it that it made me sick. I don't know what anyone thought when they agreed to be part of this movie, but I'm sure they did better to leave it at 2 movies. The movies in this series go from good to fair to terrible. I just hope no terrorist groups have access to this movie, as it makes an excellent torture device.
