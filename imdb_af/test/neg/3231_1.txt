I couldn't agree anymore. The book is one of Dean Koontz's best novels and this film is a total transvesty. I watched about half and then threw the tape into the throw away! I have no idea what the idiotic director thinks of making this piece, but I'd rather try my eyes with a sharp stick than to see this inexorable movie again! Everything about this movie is just wrong. First, the main character of an old marine is changed to a high school KID. WHY ??? Secondly, the love of his life in the book becomes his mother in the movie! I bet Freud would say something to it! LOL. The dog is cute enough and the best thing in the movie and completely wiped out! Also a main character helping them in the book betrays them in the movie. There is really nothing good to say about the film, except that it is relatively short at least one and a half or so. If someone hasn't seen the movie yet, do yourself a favor! READ THE BOOK! It's so much better than this useless waste of time!
