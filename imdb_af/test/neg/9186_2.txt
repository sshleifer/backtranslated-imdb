"Wagons East" was a huge disappointment to me. But the saddest thing about this movie is that it was John Candy's last movie (he died just before the recording was completed). There are only a few layers throughout this western spoof, and for a comedy that doesn't cut it. If you want to see a turbulent spoof of Western movies, the answer is clear. See Mel Brooks' classic "Blazing Saddles". Or if you want to see Candy in much better material, see "Summer Rental", "Spaceballs" or "Uncle Buck" (just to name a few). These three movies (as well as others) show us what a great comic actor was. Unfortunately, "Wagons East". What a shame! <br /> <br /> * (out of four)
