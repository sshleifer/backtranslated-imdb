The first 1/3 of this movie I loved and thought it would be one of Truffaut's best movies. I loved the plot where a pen married a man halfway through the world - eyes invisible. Especially when this woman seems to be fraudulent and responsible for the death of the OWN pen so she could take her place! She then cleaned and disappeared the man's big bank account! I was really addicted and wanted to see more ... <br /> <br /> Then the movie fell apart and just got stupid! In spite of her coming from New Caladonia (an island in the Pacific) and he from Reunion (an island in the Indian Ocean), when traveling to southern France, he almost immediately bumps her. Hmm, .... chance is 187,000,000 to 1, but he finds her. Then, instead of killing her or surrendering to the police, he forgives her - even when she admits what she did. Okay - it's hard to believe, but okay ... but then he helps hide her from a private detective by killing him !! No one is so stupid! Yes, the character Catherine Deneuve plays is pretty pretty, but come on people - it's just stupid. Plus, if he only wanted her as a sex object, why would he do it for a woman who is often fresh and completely selfish and angry. <br /> <br /> Because of the very ridiculous plot, this movie does not deserve such high ratings! Unless you're a strong Truffaut fan, try another movie - even one of Truffauts - just NOT this one.
