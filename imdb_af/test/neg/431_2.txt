It's a title looking for a movie. It's a pitch that sounded rewarding to a studio CEO and the rest was condemned. When this film was made, there were two more things CGI didn't do well at all: people and fur. Furry people were therefore not destined to look good when delivered by the computer. This is the only example I can think of where the effects for a well-financed successor achieved a huge jump-back landing behind that of the original movie. For the record, the design of the werewolves does not help. The filmmakers apparently couldn't decide between quadruped and biped, trying to both do and solve with a creature that looked equally uncomfortable. The transformations are anatomically nonsense and the end result with a relatively high forehead and short snout looks like a cross between Ron Perlman and a hyena. But back to the crass part. It is a movie that only exists to pay into his ancestor. I'm not a fan of Landis's original movie, but son, it looks good in the light of it. If you thought some of the Landis humor had been forced, try some of the sobering efforts here. The bubble gum scene, the looks humor, the dog that ... you know, you just have to see that piece yourself. Thomas Everett Scott is on vacation in Europe with friends and decides to take a break from the actions of the "ugly American" and bungee jump of the Eifel Tower in the middle of the night. This causes him to save a young woman (Delpy - July it is not only worth a star in America. Ask Rutger Hauer) to jump her to her death. She seems to be part of a cult of werewolves that have plotted ... I'm not sure, something only. stereotypes, gaping plots, a tangled end. It doesn't matter, the studio just thought the title would probably mislead millions of fans of the American Werewolf in London to surrender their cash. For the most part, happy to say, they were wrong.
