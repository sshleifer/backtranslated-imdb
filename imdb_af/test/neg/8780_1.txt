I remember very well the bad pressure that this film had because of the producers' court order against Clayton Moore using the name "Lone Ranger" or donating his black mask to personal appearance. Quite apart from any consideration of the film's quality, it was the absolute height of the proximity to arrogance and stupidity of the producers and their lawyers. And I suspect that the lesson was well learned after this film was thought, which is widely regarded as a kind of karma for the jerks responsible for the court order against Moore. <br /> <br /> In recent times it has become the use of reviving a legendary movie or TV project, inviting the original stars or stars for cameo appearances, and rightly so. Show respect, your idiots! And even if they get their nose on the prospect, what happened is at least the offer made. It has been shown positively that movie producers, studio executives and entertainment lawyers are not too stupid and arrogant to be taught by the example.
