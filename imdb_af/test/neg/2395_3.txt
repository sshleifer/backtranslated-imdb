Love and human remains directed by Denys Arcand is an abysmal pathetic film, as it is quite different from the kind of films he has made through his career. Making another movie is not an offensive matter. It's tricky that the fact that if a movie of a master is apart then it is a very bad event. The movie starts off on a good note, as tension arises. But as the film progresses, it's just a useless attempt to create something significant, as Arcand shows us half a dozen oddball, whimsical characters whose lives are related. Homosexuality and Lesbianism have no consequences here. What is even more troublesome is the sense of guilt associated with the characters who are rather in a solution to their feelings towards each other and sexuality. Such a movie will be of interest to some who want to see another Denys Arcand movie. All in all, there will certainly not be many taxis for this movie.
