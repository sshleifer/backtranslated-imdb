OK, what was this story again? I'm afraid I've never read the book and honestly said it was one of the most confusing movies I've ever tried to watch in a long time. I get a little confused about the number of flashbacks between the nurse, the patient and the man with no thumbs. The film didn't even really explain what they were looking for in the desert until they found it; or even how in the world everyone knew each other to come together. <br /> <br /> Having recently seen the "Pride and Prejudice" movie with Colin Firth, I tried to study his movie career by watching other movies of his, and definitely, other than " What a girl wants, "I don't find much where he played in it, it was good. I'm definitely not saying HE wasn't good. He is really one of the best actors I've seen in the modern film, but the content and quality of the films he plays has a lot to be desired. <br /> <br /> The English Patient is another perfect example of where the director, writer and crew are just too close to their subject to see that the viewer doesn't get the picture ?? literally. The whole movie was to show Ralph Fiennes as a dramatic actor with long periods of emotion that was a drill. Nothing is really explained and each of the subjects from the beginning looks like a psychoanalysis evaluation! <br /> <br /> Kristin Scott Thomas's character seems to describe erotic stories standing in front of a completely masculine audience and other men than her husband; Colin Firth, who plays her husband, doesn't necessarily have all his marbles in place and is supposed to be a secret agent ?? I think; and Ralph Fiennes walks around like a Roman Mr. Darcy (sorry, Colin!) He thinks he knows it all. The rest of the cast is thrown onto the four winds while the plot is walking. <br /> <br /> The subplot of the nurse's mental stability (Juliette Binoche) and her motives and involvement with Naveen Andrews is another confusing element that leaves the viewer with a careless taste. But of course, the viewer still sees how the first two characters (Thomas and Fiennes) finally had sex for the first time. What was the attraction? There was no chemistry and no buildup. Just a slap, thank you, thank you! <br /> <br /> And isn't it romantic that Fiennes has become a traitor who helps the Germans give cards to the desert? (sarcasm) <br /> <br /> To describe this movie, I just have to say, "How to impress your gynecologist with your mammograms and cheat on your lovely, adorable man who loves you." <br /> <br /> The final incredible part of this plot is to find out how someone will choose Ralph Fiennes about Colin Firth. Firth had very little opportunity to demonstrate any of his acting talents ?? In fact, when I watched the movie, I thought it should have been one of its first. The scene where he waited for his wife all night might be the only two-second clip worth the movie. With that I have no interest in looking at it again. <br /> <br /> The best scene I liked was the plane crash where Firth tried to get them all out. He missed it badly! It would have saved an extra twenty minutes of even more fruitless film. However, air conditioners were very neat.
