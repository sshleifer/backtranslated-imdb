Funny funny how commentary for this movie was consistently down, now add mine. I think the writing could be saved by better acting, and the acting by a better writing. Together, it was difficult to look at, and I did not shine on such topics. <br /> <br /> Sigourney was the best part (I thought the relationship between her and her surviving son was almost the only new thing this movie offered), but even she went. Can't blame her, who knows what is needed, is left on the cutter floor by the director and / or editor. The whole movie has an "okay, that's good enough, let's move." Feel at it, if I know that more of the actors and the mini-dissertation had to be exploited, which had some good lines and some interesting themes. <Br /> <br /> I don't think it counts as a spoiler, but a perfect example is the scene where Sigourney marched to her son's supposed tormentor's home and looked at her face and thought "it is the face of someone who is overreacting what it is like to see someone living in a mobile home" and sure enough, the next shot, which we intended, is sure, bully lives in a trailer opposite a beautiful house like hair. <br /> <As many other posters have pointed out, there are so much better movies with similar headlines about similar divorced families who have hit the notes better - "Celebration" is probably the best example I've seen.
