Solo starts as a team of American soldiers going to Soth America to blow a rebel line. They are a robot called Solo (Mario Van Peebles) who can use any weapon ever made is fifteen times stronger and ten times faster than any human being. Anything goes wrong, and Solo refuses to kill innocent civilians, what a mess. Frank Madden (William Sadler) is not happy, back at base and General Haynes (Barry Corbin) commands Solo to be closed and reprogrammed. One of Solo's main guidelines is restraint, so decide to escape back into the South American jungle where Colonel Madden and his men are filed to recover it ... <br /> <br /> This Mexican American co-production is directed by Norberto Barba & one must say Solo is terrible. David Corley's writing was based on Robert Mason's novel 'Weapon' and is one clich√© to another. Robots were popular at the time Solo was made in Hollywood and at the box are Solo rip-offs such as Robocop 1987), Universal Soldier (1992) and the two Terminator flashes, as well as the same institution and basic story as Predator (1987). It is the ordinary waste over an emotional robot that becomes a sense of humanity while it is around people. Initially he doesn't know what a joke is, or why one person will look after someone else, but eventually he develops emotions, sounds like Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) to me. The character is poor and Colonel Madden in particular is given absolutely no motivation to hate Solo and why he would kill other American soldiers and not obey orders to destroy them. You know I saw it free on cable television last night (thank you, I didn't spend money on it) and I watched it in the TV guide and do you know what it said? My TV guide described Solo as a 'dire sci-fi action with Mario Van Peebels', which, when I think of it, is a perfect description of Solo. In less than ten words, my TV guide hit the nail on the head, I mean it's a sci-fi action movie, that's probably Mario from Peebles' stars and it's definitely dire. Enough really said. <br /> <br /> Director Barba does nothing special here and the action scenes have no real excitement and the sci-fi elements are virtually non-existent, except the fact that Solo is a robot. So the army loses Solo & Colonel Madden sent to get it right? I'm not funny, but wouldn't the army have a 'self destruct' mechanism in Solo in the case of such a thing? Surely Solo would have at least had a tracking device inside, so that the army would at least know where it was at any given time? I'm not funny, but these people can come with a running robot soldier, but they're not smart enough to realize that a tracing or self-destruction device might be useful if something went wrong? The violence is soft, there are some OK-fight scenes, but it's really bad stuff. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie looks good and makes it proficient, it's actually shot in Mexico. The makers of the Dolph Lundgren action movie Agent Red (2000) modified Solo's footage in this film. The drama is poor, Van Peebles was the perfect choice to play an emotional robot. William Sadler deserves it better than that. It was just a few years before he stared at the fantastic Die Hard 2: Die Harder (1990). <br /> <br /> Solo is a very bad sci-fi action movie, which is actually a big rip-off of big budget Hollywood sci-fi action movies like Robocop, Universal Soldier & the Terminator movies. Not recommended and I will start and pay more attention to my TV guide when it comes to watching movies ...
