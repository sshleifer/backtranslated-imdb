'A Comedy of Biblical Relationships! 'Those hyperbola masters, the movie writers, again; The 2003 successor Bruce Almighty, barely scarce. The only thing that causes my interest in this movie over the total indifference is his dogmatic Christian undertones. Sorry, make it overones. <br /> <br /> Steve Carrel, ignoring Jim Carrey's good sense of refusal, plays Evan Baxter, the smuggling news anchor from Bruce Almighty, who has just been elected to Congress. With a new life in Virginia and the stress of moving the size of the Acropolis into a home, the pressure of all the change takes its toll on his family. His wife (Lauren Graham), who apparently flew in from Stepford, and three sons (Jimmy Bennett, Graham Phillips and Johnny Simmons), doing a silent job of looking sad at a piano accompaniment, are praying for the family to approach and will almost become. Out of debt, so does Evan. In what has to be the biggest shock of all time, God (Morgan Freeman) is actually acting, but does the very troublesome "work in mysterious ways" all about the place by telling Evan to build a Noah-esquire ark in preparing for a great flood instead of just giving him a pool table or an X box or something. And in eternal divine deity he also forces Evan to wear a beard, long hair, and put on threads and sticky clothes. Now, again in the day I'm sure razor was hard to come by, so the beard for Noah was inevitable, but I'm almost certain it has nothing to do with spirituality. The same with the clothes; A massive construction is definitely being made more difficult by such impractical clothes. Couldn't God have some steel wire boots and a hard hat for the poor guy? Apparently not. <br /> <br /> To paraphrase Bill Hicks, I find the idea that God is a bit disturbing to us, and so Evan makes him every battle of the way. And who wouldn't? God gets him fired, drives his loved ones away, makes him a stockpile, and actually threatens him. Of course, God seems to be right, and the rational, hard-working family man who has become finer by himself is forced to eat a large piece of bittersweet, humble tart. It is almost as if God is left alone, and Evan must give him patience and humor. What kind of message is that? <br /> <br /> Evan Almighty has a highly commendable environmental change, with the underlying theme being that the federal government is blind to the damage done to the world around us. It is also the first film ever to offset its carbon emissions and it must surely be seen as a landmark performance by a Hollywood studio. If it wasn't for the trite, patronizing banner of American Christianity that was high above it, Evan Almighty could be an unsatisfactory family movie, with a commendable environmental record. But with its confused religious dogma and inexorable "blind faith" message, it stands as one of the most tolerant films of all time.
