If you watch a Seagal movie, you expect good action. You expect to fight, not just a lot of shooting as in this movie. And: you expect a pretty simple story. OK, I can live with a more complex story, even if it's a Seagal movie. But this one, that is, I don't know what to say. It is very, very confusing indeed. At the end of the movie, I had a lot of trouble figuring out what had happened. And I know I'm not the only one. The story lacks so much information and is so full of plot holes that it's almost impossible to keep up with what's happening in the movie. There are a lot of people in the movie, people always change the parties, and they often switch places. Awful. I just don't understand why it seems Seagal is making a kind of prosecution on this one.
