It was one of the worst movies I ever watched. The story was about a woman prisoner who was sent into space to try and save mankind, but what it actually seemed was that the prisoner was actually aboard a spaceship with a nimfomanian lesbian commander. All the story was about how to have sex over and over. There was no need for all this material - just to create a soft porn movie. Of course we had to have the heroin of the movie for about 2 minutes. I don't know what it all has to do with the real plot of the movie, unless I assume that men should see it. I only gave it one out of 10 because there was no other rating. Don't waste your money or time - it has nothing to do with science fiction, but rather a movie for young adolescent boys to look at. The creature is just over halfway through the movie and looks like the stranger in the movie with Signorney Weaver. Poor excuse for entertainment.
