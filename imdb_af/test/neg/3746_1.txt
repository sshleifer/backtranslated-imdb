I walked out of the movie after 30 minutes. I left two friends through a big fat cup to endure the rest. <br /> <br /> As soon as the movie opened, I thought something was wrong and it wasn't long before I stopped. I want to hide under my seat and get embarrassed. I'm not one who has a problem running out of movies, but they usually had some redemption functions, but this one suffered from a catalog of bad directing, bad acting (bar 'Bruno' character and the impeccable Jean Rochefort according to my friends), terrible editing (in terms of theme and meaning), horrible soundtrack and image correlation that seem to be an art to putting the wrong peace of music on the image and scene at the wrong time. The worst crime was his total independence and unbelief (a consequence of the said atrocities). Why was it so terrible? I don't want to waste my time anymore. I want to say, go and see it for yourself, but I don't want to fill out the suitcase of this project more than needed. Oh, the show possessed a redeeming feature: My friend climbed over the rows of seats and hooked his umbrella over his arm trying to support him - more patos, tension and entertainment in those few moments than in the 125 minutes of this unfortunate effort.
