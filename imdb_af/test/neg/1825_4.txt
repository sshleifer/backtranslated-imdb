I actually watched it for the only reason it was supposed to have Third Reich references in it. It turns out to be a beautiful mindless and predictable slasher movie that is apparently made to appeal to feminists or something. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you something, if you have a whole movie waiting to see the attractive female head, The last thing you want is a "tasteful" finished sex scene with annoying camera angles that show nothing. Her busty friend also didn't find her hair, but we saw many men's stumps and bald hair and guys with their shirts. And in the end, our heroine twisted the scallop and villains of the villain (apparently the famine) and she struggles easily (uh huh) while her male love interest is tied up and guarded. The funniest part was when she picked up a chair and swung it to the man and it broke over him. Now it would be about as much as she could do to lift the chair, let it hit a person with enough power to break it! It looks ridiculous, basically brushing it against him and falling apart. If you want to do this kind of "roll turn" waste (which has already been killed), you should at least make it acceptable. <br /> <br /> However, there was one good bit. The bad guy got the best of her malicious friend, taught her a lesson to be such a tramp and to sleep. This is not exactly what feminists want. <br /> <br /> Very stupid, really. Not that American bracts are generally much better, but you have to wonder why they bothered. It didn't bring anything to the genre at all. <br /> <br /> 5/10
