I sit here writing this review and the movie is not over yet. In fact, I just checked in and there are still 45 minutes to go. But no matter, it's not necessary to see it to the end. I will just write and laugh at this review as the movie plays in the background and stumble upon a kind of suspiciously horrible conclusion I don't care to ever see or know. <br /> <br /> What do I count hostility to this movie? The characters are not credible. The plot is not credible. The pretentiousness of the movie is sick. Basically, every element of the movie rang fake. Obviously, Buscemi thought he'd added something to the decades of movies, which had already explored the well-driven themes of dysfunctional families and the apparent meaninglessness of life. Buscemi, however, was badly wrong, because this movie has nothing new. It is very difficult to be depressed, but fortunately no one can really be depressed by it, because it is clear that no one like this exists in the whole world. However, what is depressed is the knowledge that somehow this film has been named as a number of undeserved awards. Disgusting !!!! Bottom line: Stay at all costs away from this worthless movie.
