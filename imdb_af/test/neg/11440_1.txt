WOW, I will hate to vote, but someone who has this movie should have any higher than I just have an IQ. which reaches incredibly low depths that stretch out of time and space and connect to the planet "Hopper-a-retard-for-making-this-movie". WOW this movie STANKS. Fred Ward's capsule looks SSSSSSSTTTTTTTTTTUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPUPPPPIIIDDD! I actually considered sending Fred Ward, a little money in remuneration for the unfortunate hairstyle he owns in this horrible movie. Of course, Jodie Foster didn't have much to work with, but still runs a terrible performance. Joe Pesci, oh my ... Joe Pesci (who is secretly not thrown) plays the ULTIMATE stereotypical Joe Pesci movie character, complete with the murder death and constant use of the F word. You will not believe your eyes. Dean Stockwell, looking at him in this mess, made me feel bad for him because I actually thought he was drunk or temporarily delayed in the film. Jon Turturro had made himself drunk when he agreed to be with Vincent Price, Bob Dylan and Charlie Sheen. I know what you think, GREAT WASTE! I know, and it was the WORST good movie I've ever seen. Dennis Hopper leads and stars, and does equally badly in both areas. How the man could have targeted EASY RIDER and then it's far beyond my excellent imagination. His exceptionally bad hits-character accent is beyond the kingdom of terrible, and only equal to the hilariously bad ending. They (Hopper and Foster) are the most uninteresting couple. I believe I have ever come to the world of theater in my exposure, and you will be sorry that they will be lost and eventually bruised by the end. What exactly are the two of them that are filled with that action? I don't know, but I know that if I ever meet Dennis Hopper, I will be delighted to be responsible for this celluloid waste. Join me!
