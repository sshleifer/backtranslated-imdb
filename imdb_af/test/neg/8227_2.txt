In the former hometown shot by a few college kids, this movie is around a freak called "Luther". Luther, recently announced to us by an arguing parole board in one of the nicest scenes of all time, is running on the local Kroger grocery store at an old woman's neck with his metal teeth. <br /> <br /> Luther walks to the farm where he eats a guy, steals a car, an old woman's ties, and is chased and killed. Oh, and the chick of the SUPERBOY television program is getting naked.
