I agree with what so many others have said about the level and objectionable nature of this film's investigation into racism. It is to me that so many people are being deceived by his prosperity. I would like to comment on the Matt Dillon character as an example of what is the most embarrassing of this movie. Here we have a man who - unlike the film's underlying message that "all of us are a small racist", raped a woman in public effectively and humbly disgusted her husband and deliberately let go of a move what he knows will lead to his arrest or even death. He does all this after transferring the couple without any legal cause, but because we understand they are black and rich and he is a sore little boy who is now the police and can do as he likes. This behavior is not a small racist. This behavior is angry. It is my misfortune that this extreme racism is being held along another's behavior - spitting her paranoid stereotypes on gang violence - to illustrate that everyone is a small racist. Later we were fed on Dillon's poor old father and how black people drove him into the poor house. Is it supposed to explain or make this behavior worse? And is Dillon's character meant to save himself by committing the utterly unmotivated and incredible, laughing accidental act to save the woman he sexually assaulted all night? Please. The fact that so many people feel a kind of self-congratulating admiration for this movie makes me sad about the eagerness of our understanding of racism and our apparent lack of commitment to condemn and end it.
