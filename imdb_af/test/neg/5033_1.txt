I switched it off within the first five minutes. It is very sick and disturbing. The moment I switched it off, the beautiful white horse was loaded to the butchery and the skull was stained by a small tube instrument. This creature lay on the floor in a state of shock before it died. The narrator said the animal died instantly, it didn't. I disagree with graphic realism towards animals, insects or any living creature. I was very disappointed to see only Eyes Without a Face. It was a brilliant movie and this short film was attached, which spoiled my night - since I couldn't hurt a fly, I never thought to watch this wild documentary. /> <br /> read other reviews on this page, I noticed that they used words like aesthetic - it is not art or beauty. I can imagine that the documentary would be very articulate and profound, but not aesthetic.
