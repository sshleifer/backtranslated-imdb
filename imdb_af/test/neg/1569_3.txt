George & Mildred - The film lacks the talents of his TV writer John Mortimer, who brings the golden cut and pressure of George's class war to the Fourmiles. <br /> <br /> The plot is cut from standard spin-off cloth hit hit man / wrong identity - and has as little tension as there is laughter. The producers had to take a leaf of Rising Damp (also 1980), which was also bought to the big screen after the TV series had run down and kept much of the story in familiar surroundings. <br /> <br /> Yootha Joyce died in 1980, but she should not be remembered for this creaking piece of work that was contaminated as she was through her illness. Mildred doesn't have the sharpness of her TV incarnation; cut aside and tolerant looks largely at Georges' lack of libido. George's sputtering unbelief also gets lost in the more elaborate sets. It is not to say that they wanted to shout a lot. The budget for these movies seems pathetically small; A restaurant they go to is clearly a new half-house with candle lights that decorate the front door. <br /> <br /> For fans of the 70's British comedy or those who just want to repeat an old TV partner of their youth, this movie can't add to the experience and they just have to go to the first four TVs. series on DVD.
