This movie will make me much more of a voice from me in general and I will talk about why, but in the first place it is receiving four stars and should stay on four stars because of the directors' ridiculous portrayal of rape and sexual assault. Not far in the Oyama movie, sexual assault becomes a woman he had saved earlier. And while being briefly crushed by his actions, this posture lasts only about five minutes before loving worship moves into her role and carries her character through the rest of the film. I know many people will argue that it is not so important in a kung fu knock-em-up, and as a fan of the genera I can't say it's so unusual, but it doesn't stop to be completely tasteless. time I see. <br /> <br /> What I will say in the movie's defense, however, is that it is somewhat refreshing to see martial arts, or even action games of any kind, offering no real hero to the viewer to get behind . Oyama is portrayed as a rapist and killer; a social wiped out whose only student is completely unbalanced before being caught by the police. The final shots of the movie leave one with the feeling that Oyama himself is ready for a big break and no longer looks for the woman he had earlier attacked him and since then followed him with a puppy like devotion has. <Br /> <br /> Whether or not it is the intended message of the movie, can't help but feel a bit hopeful that Oyama could be on the verge of suicide by the time the movie is over. This is a rare emotional treatment of the martial arts genre and it is interesting to see a movie that shows you that its violence should not be celebrated. If only Karate Bullfighter had treated the subject of sexual violence better, whether by involving more emotional depth and recognition between the two characters, or leaving it all together, it would have been a much more interesting film.
