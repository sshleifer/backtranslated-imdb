Don't get me wrong. I really love the "arena-martial arts genre", and I'm getting more and more surprised at how many movies like this there are. This one is one of those, and it's not even close to one of the best. With Mathias Hues in it, I thought it would be good. However, he can't save this movie, and to be honest, he wasn't very good either. Just don't pay attention to what other people are saying; The battle scenes in this movie are not good at all. I really know what I'm talking about, since I've seen so many movies like this. There are also a lot of scenes that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot at all. I think they just added to make the movie a little longer, except to manifest the bad man, because uuuuuuh ....... bad (as we didn't know).
