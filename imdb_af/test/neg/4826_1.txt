I don't know how people can see it - the only people who like to watch it are those who have no feelings and emotions, and enjoy watching people die, burn homes, car accidents, babies die and members what every week. This is the most absurd thing on television and I still don't know how it goes in the ratings. It's so depressed. I can imagine the authors sit down and say, "Who will kill us next week" or "whose house will we burn in a few months?" <br /> <br /> It's the most depressing, absurd and most stupid thing on TV right now, and I can't understand people's motives to see this depressing hope shit
