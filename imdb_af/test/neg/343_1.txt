This is OK movie if it is done by high school children for their friends. It is far below the limits called "professional". There is no plot, no actor play and visual looks like you see through the plastic film. I was so glad I had FF button on me, 32x really works well. I understand that everyone should start somewhere, but it should not be a reason to bring it to the public. If you are concerned about quality and budget, "Open Water" was made at $ 60,000 and more than half went to the man who provided safety in the sea and trained sharks. And the movie looks 100 times more professional and it was an indie movie event.
