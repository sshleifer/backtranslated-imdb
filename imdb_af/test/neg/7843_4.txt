This movie must have done well in the box, to give Gator the budget it deserves. This film had no budget, needed a manuscript and a better end. There are flashes of brilliance in this movie. The boat ride, Burt, the average machine, and she spoke to his parents. You can say Burt is a Southern, not an actor. This movie shows how Gator would be, Burt's best movie. Too bad, this movie didn't have the same funding and was done on the Rush. 10/04
