Guided by the same Jin Ishimoto that Neoedision and flixer.com (a once-promising online movie community) are temporarily deployed from the internet because of its direct style and method of filming on its next film, GIRL'S BEST FRIEND <br /> <br /> The Hole suffers from this "watching me, I'm a filmmaker" style of film filming that becomes the approaching standard in today's Hollywood, to the detriment of content. <br /> <br /> The HOLE is actually starting out with a unique concept, but the concept and promise of engaging content is soon destroyed by the "look at me" direct style of movie entertainment. <br /> <br /> There are a few funny moments that still shine through the look, but it's a painful short look. <br /> <br /> How sad it is when the new breed of "filmmakers" chooses not to be a servant of the story, but rather a dominant on and off screen. Very, they do not care, as long as they handle their studio, beach house and new car, content and presentation are secondary issues. <br /> <br /> The real sad part of this is Hollywood embracing the "look at my" attitude so much that the whole aesthetic filming changes. Instead of presenting a story in a straightforward way that sets the story first, today's directors become "experimental", ie "look at me". <br /> <br /> Is this me or am I the only one really put off by Sena's opening minutes of SWORDFISH. This movie rose above Sena's direct efforts to watch my movie. Unfortunately, this short film by Mr. Ishimoto not. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 rating from Elec Tv.
