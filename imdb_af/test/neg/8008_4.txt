I think the saying of this movie is too much is not what the movie does. The twists are not the problem with the movie. The story is pretty clever and could have been very cool if it was filmed properly. The big problem everyone is complaining about in the film is that the film isn't just fascinating enough to let people follow. The movie was shot badly (at least compared to its genre brother Lock, Stock). Worse: the characters are (although often well-behaved) just flat. The characters don't have enough time to introduce enough to get the viewer involved in a single one, let alone understand them. Oh, and the places are just awful: places-person (I didn't bother to see the credits for your name) - get another job (maybe still photography or interior design)
