The big mistake in this Spanish slasher / shocker is within the script. For the first half hour it is a good attempt to build a tension and an atmosphere of fear and fear. We even get some good murders! Then it goes completely downhill and becomes a whole catalog of "your basic slasher clich√©s". I must admit I was disappointed because the trailer promised so much more. The last thirty minutes consist of some murders and many run into an abandoned monastery. It should have been so much better (although the final scenes in the flooded room are pretty good)! <br /> <br /> First, we have the dialogue. It's mostly terrible (there were quite a few giggles here and there when I saw it) and just enough elsewhere. It is also barely audible during many scenes, drowned under the pressure of sound effects and the soundtrack (how it might not be such a bad thing, mostly the stupid rules we have to listen to!). There is one rule in the whole movie that refers to the "I know what you did last summer" -movies, indicating that the filmmakers wrote it all as one big joke, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> And the end ... well, some will hate it, others will dig it. For me it was mostly a question of the former, because the final twist does not come from anywhere! If the audience was given some clues to the girls' spiritual status, I might have thought differently. It also throws all logic out of the window because the killer could never have been to some of the victims! But as an avid horror fan I learned to live with these contradictions in Spanish and Italian movies. <br /> <br /> But everything is not bad. The film has a great budget feature, mainly due to the excellent cinematography (the screens of the past really shine here), sharp editing and an atmospheric soundtrack. Although most of the actors are pretty bad, Anita Briem is an exception, making the most of her work. Real screen presence! <br /> <br /> And as I mentioned before, the murders are great for fans of such things and they are usually accompanied by very good special effects that include images of water (but the "water theme" tends to Finally, getting tired.) <br /> <br /> To end this review, it's a nice movie in a "bad-it-good" kind of way and it's also enjoyable for the eye. But don't expect too much, because it doesn't deliver as you probably think it will, based on fan and plot descriptions.
