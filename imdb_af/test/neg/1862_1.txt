This movie was so terrible ... I want hell out of who ever made this movie ... I was an original fan of all the ghoulies movies ... but when I saw it, I just start crying I couldn't handle it .. There aren't even ghoulies in it ... like the original creative monsters ... it's so cheap cheap ... I mean, come on a witch ... it's a bull, no one wants to see the witch ... they wanted to see what the movie was about ... "GHOULIES" I mean you are me right or what? That's us, we looked at the others. Now we really have to put this horrible storyline ... It lets me eat my own khaki after Spaghetti Monday!
