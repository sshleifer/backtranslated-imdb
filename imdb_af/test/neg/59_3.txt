Not as I went, I expected a lot, but at least I was hoping for a fun, dull, big budget. It's not even that. This item is in the bottom half of all the vampire movies I've ever seen (and believe me, I've seen many of them). Bad acting, zero characterization, little or no thought, almost non-existent plot (and that's where you can drive semi-trucks through the holes). Sure, it has action and is hard, and has more action, and more noise, and blood and action ... These things alone do not make a good (or even half-way) movie. Beat me how some people can say this is the best vampire movie ever made. All I can assume is that they haven't seen much. I suggest I see near Dark.
