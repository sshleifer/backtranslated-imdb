*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS INSIDE *** <br /> <br /> What a long and mostly uninteresting movie! Who were these characters? Why didn't I care about them? If I go to watch a movie for two hours, I want to care for someone or something. <br /> <br /> We know that Salvatore dreamed of the wealth found in the new world. In addition, we have little of most of his family's hopes, fears, etc. Learned when they started an adventure in the unknown. <br /> <br /> And why was Lucy even in this movie? She said little; we didn't know much about her or what she did (was she forced to serve men in exchange for the fact that they could manage the ship?) or what her plans were to reach New York. For those who can imagine that she needed to highlight the point that a single woman, anyway, was cultivated, not only in this country, I say it's not enough justification to give her so much screenplay time . That point could be made in five minutes, with Lucy as a momentary character. <br /> <br /> More questions: Why was the twin brother of the boat not the family? We heard from the brother, and some closing at that point would have been useful to give the cohesion. How long was the trip from Italy to New York? Given the conditions on the ship, it makes a difference for the viewer if the journey lasts five or 10 or 50 days. (Someone said something to see a week a week a week, but I thought it was when they were already on the road.) I needed these details to better appreciate what they had gone through. <br /> <br /> The only scene I really liked was when the boat, filled with passengers, left the harbor. <br /> <br /> If you choose to rent this movie, do it by remote control; You may need the Fast Forward button. <br /> <br /> Finally, I can suggest that the right information about the times and circumstances for immigrants is provided - especially during the slow stretch of endless shots of the countryside, people walking, etc. - This movie might have made an interesting public TV documentary.
