When I saw this movie, I could only think: What a disaster! No, I'm not talking about the volcano, but about the movie itself. I've seen a lot of movies, but it's definitely one of the worst ever. I don't care if a volcano erupted under L.A. possible or not. Maybe it's not, but even if it could have been a good movie ... but that's for sure and I'll explain why. <br /> <br /> I don't know how many lava flows from an average volcano, but what I do know is that the volcano in this movie together looks like Vesuvius, Etna and Mount Pinatubo. I don't think there was ever so much lava flowing from a volcano as we see in this movie. I'm sure the director had a lot of money to spend on his movie, but I'm really wondering why he spends it all on the special effects and not on the script and the actors. I'm not saying he should have hired a top throw, but it's really the opposite of what I'd call good acting. Their performances are so incredibly poor that it makes the whole movie even worse. <br /> <br /> And what's wrong with the script, you're probably asking yourself. Well, can you tell me who comes up with the idea that people stand a few feet or even a few feet from the lava without being burned or hiding? Or do people sink into the earth when the flow of lava is not even two feet high? <br /> <br /> I'm sure I wouldn't be proud of writing such a manuscript, but there are Hollywood writers who are spectacular but don't care as long as they pay good money! Very good money !!! <br /> <br /> If you watch the movie, you will probably agree with me that it is one of Hollywood's worst disasters, worth a mere 3/10.
