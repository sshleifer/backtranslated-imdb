It has been a long time for me and my wife and I not to see such a boring thriller. It is definitely NOT a gripping story and it is so slow that we almost fell asleep. It may rather be a very low budget TV crime series. There are some ridiculous scenes like the one where mafia boss Pirano wants to see the jury lady in red clothes or another mafioso can't stop thinking about her. Well, maybe it should have been a romantic thriller, but believe me you won't miss anything. We gave 4/10.
