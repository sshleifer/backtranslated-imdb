"Chupacabra Terror" is rescued from a '1' by the presence of Canadian cutie Chelan Simmons as the heroine. She is a pleasure to watch, front, back and side. Otherwise, what you have here is your standard monster movie, John Rhys-Davies plays the captain of the ship carrying the monster. And the very relentless monster is simply a man in a suit. He commits about 100 senseless, gory murders, at least, so the body count in this one is pretty awesome. Formal, to say the least. I love the moment Simmons dishonestly tells someone who is chupacabra: Goat Eater! Oooohhh ... scary!
