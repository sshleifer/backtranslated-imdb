This is a huge disappointment. The biggest problem is the acting one. Sylvestre le Touzel is pretty poor like Fanny, and the rest is not much better, everyone is very quiet and unnatural. Also, the camera is very 1980s, ie cramped and jumping, compared to, for example, the P&P of 1995. <br /> <br /> The script is, if anything, faithful to the book, and there are some worthy expressions that should have been cut. <br /> <br /> In all respects, it is far below the recent movie version, which, while taking great liberties with the book, is far more faithful to the spirit of the book and much more enjoyable.
