I recently found this film on one of my husband's VHS tapes (the empty variety he uses to record things from the telly). The movie looks like it was last shown in the eighties and I don't remember seeing it since. It is not (on my knowledge) released on DVD or VHS, although I will browse for a copy. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of three young people: two girls, one on the verge of puberty and the other a lot younger, and a young boy who, with their mother's brother and his young, dumb Irish wife went to live. His wife also has two brothers who live with them. The uncle of the children is an unpleasant control freak that forces his young wife to wear a silver band while watching a puppet show by him and her brothers in his toy shop. <br /> <br /> The oldest girl and one of the Irish (the younger) develops a love for each other while living in the same house. The girl helps her aunt in the shop while her brother helps his uncle to make things in the workshop. <br /> <br /> There are many very disturbing elements in the movie. There is the uncle's treatment of his wife as a kind of stupid (literally) possessed (illustrated by the collar) while Irish dancing, drinking and enjoying some forbidden love. Interestingly, I've seen more and more explicit themes played in other Hollywood movies today. <br /> <br /> Wondering whether the British film industry and the BBC have a kind of hidden agenda. <br /> <br /> Yet, despite the fact that it is not a children's movie, there are many playful, magical moments in it and one Irish man does beautiful paintings.
