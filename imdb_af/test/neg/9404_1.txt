Pacino, and Maconadump really hit the mark with this stinker. I swear, I am an avid filmmaker and fan. At one time or another, I was a fan of most people in this abortion. Until now. The story crap The acting crap (Rene Ruso Major League was good) The plot crap The subplot garbage The teen tries to relate to sports junk <br /> <br /> I have promised Romy and Michelle's High School reunion twice a day for the next seven days if my punishment does not drop this colostomy from a movie after 10 minutes. I was out of town for a seminar, and this pile of mung costs me $ 9.99 and 2 hours. I'm deceived. This director must be in prison for fraud. <br /> <br /> Come with me if you have other review questions. I'm always right.
