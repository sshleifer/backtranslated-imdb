Derek Jarman has shown us time and again that the dialogue is not his strong suit. He is a painter and painter. His films are almost always visually beautiful, but about as exciting to look as paint that is already dry. Watch his movies in fast forward, the really quick setting you can only get on DVD. In The Tempest, Jarman does very little with the writing or the characters, using them as just a grid to hang a very long and well-constructed cinematographic frame. He even goes so far as to contradict Shakespeare's original script to reach these terribly slow and lifeless scenes. There is none of the romance, magic, slander or urgency that the writing asks, little spontaneity, and the character of Caliban is particularly reduced to a shaky and insane idiot kind, similar to Gaveston in Jarman's Edward II. It's too bad that it's just about the only movie version of The Tempest available.
