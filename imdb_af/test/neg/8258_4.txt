In "Red Letters", Coyote is at the whirlpool of a college professor writing to a female prison prisoner and getting more than what he has negotiated. There are two reasons to watch this movie. Kinski is one and Piven the other although it is difficult to shine their sparks in such a complete direct disaster. Everything is wrong with the "Red Letters" ... winding, mean script, camera, editing, and most of all that is subject to Coyote, etc. Battersby took a story with potential and it didn't change in a seriously flawed and amateurish movie.
