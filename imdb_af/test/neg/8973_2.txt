O Gawd. I want to travel back to Monogram Studios and suffocate someone in their 2 room front office for this messy musical. It is one watt above plateau for 60 of its 61 minutes and then it actually shows (for the one-minute minute, spread in the second second over the hour) that there is real life talent that is poorly photographed. I just don't see the point of making this movie really easy, which can be energetic and actually funny, and be the main cause. The strange storyline shows a fiery vaudeville lover, Grace Hayes, pushing her blowy way into a college, where her gear bag boy is rich college clown. She's going to fix his playboy ways, no matter what. Her real life boy (stranger) Peter Hays plays her screen son. His real wife plays her secretary. Talk about nepotism. I suspect that this talent package was almost the raison d'etre for Monogram to produce this background music produced by the resident Schlockmeister extraordinary Sam Katzman. As with other Monogram musicals, it just looks like a reason to film recent new furniture purchases and light fittings to point to other studios that Monogram Pictures are 'striking' in their B-ways. Take a look at SWING PARADE OR 1946 for the true proof of this: they built this great nightclub series, and then found an excuse for film actors and musicians running everywhere. Story? None. Anyway, ZIS BOOM BAH is more BAH and BOOM. Where was Gale Storm and Mantan Mooreland when Monogram really needed them? You are probably at the gate of the PRC. Pictures wonder if it seems safe to go in there. The Junior Jive hepster, Roland Dupree, boasts his teenage boys around two wobble dance numbers, especially in the grand show finale in the new and expanded shop / club. The usual crumpled curtains hang loose on the back wall, and the play of mashed drapery even has one dark headgear that is turned back and forth like any amateur sequence elbows past the previous one. The choir girls and their very striking partners in this final look just like Monogram office staff borrowed (from typing and carpentry) for the morning of filming. They have absolutely no dance talent and are so ordinary on the screen ... All the girls look like they're all called Joyce. There is even a costume calamity where they wear warm trousers ... just on one leg. It's all so awful and fun ... and actually annoying if one more sees through the parties, ZIS will actually be FUN. The one peculiarly interesting thing is the dialogue between Grace and her son-in-law: it is so casually delivered that it actually works in spite of the writing and logic. She has a lot of life as presence that is the only thing that makes the ridiculous story somewhat compelling. The Dupree child is the right star. He can actually do something ... despite the fact that he looks like an outdoor Liberace tap dancing teen ... You read it right.
