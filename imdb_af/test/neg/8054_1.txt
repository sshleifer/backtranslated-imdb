Awful is really everything you need to know. Think of all the things that can be bad about a movie. And then try to make a movie that is bad in all these ways. You will have made "Vacationland". The state of Maine should feel insulted: it is far too fine a place to serve as the backdrop for such trite, senseless, boring shock. I am a romantic, and I always want movies about two people who find each other to succeed, and I have tried hard to find the good in this one. It was difficult; very difficult. I couldn't find a splinter of emotional connection among any of the characters in this exercise, in humdrum dreariness. Except maybe in one or two of the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Maine IS a good holiday country; this movie is not.
