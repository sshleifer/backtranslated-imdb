Unlike Terms of Endearment and Steel Magnolias, I felt the movie theater very disappointed. I started with the characters and their complex mother / daughter and father / daughter relationships. I even cried. But I had no sympathy for the characters with the end. The final action did not seem in line with the mother's character. So, although the play was pretty good, I thought the movie on a whole was disappointing.
