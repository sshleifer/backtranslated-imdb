I live in Mexico City, so I have to suffer the trailers for every piece of garbage coming out of all these dumb Mexican filmmakers. You want to admire a Mexican man for making good movies? Look at something by Guillermo del Toro (especially The Devil's Backbone), or maybe Alfonso Cuar√≥n (though I really don't like his movies, but I respect them). <br /> <br /> Mexican filmmakers often produce some of the most horrible ostrich ever (Por la Libre, El Segundo Aire, American Visa), but this is one of the lowest points in Mexican movies ever. If you respect your brain, please avoid this **** at all costs. Watching video from a wedding or watching Britney's reality show will be more intelligent. It has more IQ than everyone in this 'movie'.
