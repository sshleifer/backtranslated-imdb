This is the worst work ever of Daniel Day Lewis ..... I can't believe he made this horrible movie that same year and my left foot ..... please stay away from this movie .... this is a movie just for the Argentine people as a curiosity ... The plot is impossible to understand ...... The author believes that in Argentina all the people speak in English ... Of course, the Patagonia a great picture frame for shooting the movie, but it's not enough reason to see this movie .... I just repeat if you're a big fan of Daniel Day Lewis, or if you're south of Argentina want to see, part of the patagonia, and you don't have enough money to travel yourself .......
