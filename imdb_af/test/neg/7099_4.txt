On the scale of 1 to 10 I gave it a 4. I thought the movie wasn't very good, with too much violence and not one character. <br /> <br /> On an erotic scale I give it a 6. Many of the sex scenes were toned with an underlying ugliness. I always enjoy nudity, and Nancy Travis and Faye Grant come through, but the sex scene is more humiliating than erotic.
