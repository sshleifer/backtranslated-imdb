The reason I gave this movie a 4 was for a few reasons, but this movie wasn't that bad. Firstly, the editing I found was sometimes poor, the writing (or what one had) was not very good, and if it wasn't for Nunzio La Bianca, the play would be crazy. but everything that is set aside (ha ha i know she like the whole movie) is not so bad for an extremely low. , low budget film. If they got more money, have a little better actors (but those were intimidating, so it was good) and a little more detailed mini-dissertation, this movie would be great. Someone has to tell me that this man was greatly influenced by Walter Hill by the warriors. I mean this movie is exactly like that. Anyone who has both seen those movies will agree with me.
