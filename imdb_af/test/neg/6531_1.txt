I walked out of this movie and I did it only once with the Australian movie Sweetie almost 20 years ago. After about three minutes, I felt that the camera had killed a man and could not believe that this movie was actually shown to anyone and what was said - for two independent Spirit Awards. What ???? No matter how realistic the dialogue can be (I will NOT use the word "man" again!) -Who wants to listen to these conversations? I'm not going to the movie to be irritated, but that's all I have. The only good thing I got away was the realization that if this movie could make it to Sundance and other festivals, anyone could. Well, wait, this might not be a good thing.
