My extreme tolerance was overwhelmed by some of the choices in this really good time warmer. <br /> <br /> When the "romantic" intervals were natural to get me out of the story and in "How-and-why-the-movie-maker-/-what /?" mode, you must see that something is missing; restraint and palatability, I think. <br /> <br /> Brian Brown is a skilled, empathic actor - usually. I think he doesn't like the project or the people, and it shows. I remember nothing the other man did. Can't even imagine his face. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, having fun is not good; some of the vignettes and twists are fun and even ingenious. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie (buy $ 2,00 from the rental site) against the author's advice; I understand that he was requested to remove his name from the credits. Matters of pride, I bet.
