This is the kind of movie I wonder why anyone would consider doing it from the beginning. It's the kind of movie I can't understand how people put money into it, how the rental store can put the DVD on its shelves. This is the kind of movie I'm guilty of leasing it. <br /> <br /> There are good class B movies, and I don't reject the genre. When they are good, they get the interest in the action, they have written characters well enough and acted well enough to care for them. The effects in some of these movies support the film in many cases, and you may like to find the originality. Almost nothing is true in 'Coronado'. The subject and the writing are at the level of cheap comics - just a click. The effects are cheap - and I don't care that the film is a low budget - you can do a lot with a low budget, but you need talent. There is so much continuity and other directing errors like in ten other movies. You don't care about the characters, you don't laugh, and at the end of the movie you'll wonder if the parody is deliberate or not. The only quality I could find is the scenery, there are a few good places, which are worth a better movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10 on my personal scale. The worst movie of the year so far.
