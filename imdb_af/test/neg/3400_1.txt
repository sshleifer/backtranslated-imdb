It was as if someone was trying to make a terrific video game and documentary at the same time. The historical aspect was wonderful. All the others were horrible, the stuff for the directors other movie every other minute, the video of the real ghost hunt was edited rather than a scary movie rather than an investigation, they had home music and sound effects that would lead you. of what happened. Thank you for wasting 2 hours of my time! When there was evidence, it would fly! Most of it was just people talking about the place. The episode of the Ghosthunters show that went there definitely destroyed how this show was. I'm so upset with the sci-fi channel to play it, I didn't watch it as it was broadcast.
