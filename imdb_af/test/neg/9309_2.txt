This movie was a poor movie. The plot was poor and the comedy they were trying to deliver did poorly. The accidents seem predictable and predictable. I thought the actors tried to some extent, but with this movie it was so lame. It can go that far. One of the worst movies I saw and didn't recommend to anyone. The only accident of Mr. Accident was the release.
