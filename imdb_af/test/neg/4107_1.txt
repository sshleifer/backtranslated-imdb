A SOUND OF THUNDER. One of the greatest short stories ever written. By one of the oldest Grand Masters of Fantasy, Ray Bradbury. What a wonderful story. <br /> <br /> But what a foolish movie! <br /> <br /> In Bradbury's short story, a Time Safari company, big game hunters offer the opportunity to get back in time and kill dinosaurs. Rule number one is: Stay on the road, a floating metal walkway that ensures no interaction with the prehistoric environment. During a hunt, a man walks off the road and accidentally becomes a butterfly. When the hunting party returns to the present - the world as they know it has changed dramatically. While paradoxical in any time series story, Bradbury's story was a quick jugular stroke, a parable of the ripple effect. <br /> <br /> A thunder sound was published in 1952 (according to Wikipedia, the most published science fiction story of all time), and illustrated Chaos Theory, Darwinism, and The Butterfly Effect (which was only in the 1960s by Edward Lorenz). In Bradbury's story, the wonder of time travel is overshadowed by corporate greed, which in turn is overshadowed by the mortal danger to humanity's existence itself. <br /> <br /> While in the movie a sound of Thunder (directed by odd Peter Hyams, CAPRICORN ONE, 2010: ODYSSEY TWO), a bad actor clutches time and again through their time slot fix errors, like an excellent version of BACK TO THE FUTURE. The movie has nothing to do with Bradbury's powerful story, except the initial push of the time visiting the prehistoric hunting party. Strange freedoms are taken with Bradbury's story - baboon reptiles, plants that surpass Chicago's concrete, time-waving waves around the city, CGI insecticides - for which Bradbury has to sue the filmmakers' trousers and underpants and haired hair. <br /> New writers Thomas Dean Donnelly, Joshua Oppenheimer and Gregory Poirier should start a Big Balls Agency thinking that they can actually add elements to a Ray Bradbury story that will improve it. How do these guys run in a straight line with balls so big? Ben Kingsley is the corporate owner of Time Safari, with a hairpiece as bad as a haircut, Edward Burns is his main hunter, Travis, and Catherine McCormack (who was Murron MacClannough in BRAVEHEART). The scientist has the best breasts. <br /> <br /> I may not be able to relate the hundreds to thousands of ominous stupidities and asinine pieces of dialogue, but here is just one talked by David Oyelowo as a kind of scientist. He refers to the Pleiades star cluster, "The Seven Sisters, they look like stars, not them, but each is a whole galaxy." Uh, no, idiot scientist, they're actually, oh stars. <br /> <br /> The three morals rewriting Bradbury's story forgot that they knew nothing of physics or astronomy. Or write. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is Catherine McCormick's chest stretching against her hidden one-size-to-small-leaf. <br /> <br /> - Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).
