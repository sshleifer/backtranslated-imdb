Why spend a moment through this awkward and self-conscious movie? Occasionally, after an hour of boring plot and amateur action, we start a bit and a bit of the big band swing that Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, alone and together, made the big musicians. Sometimes - in a jam session with Art Tatum, with Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra that Marie did, and a conception, Jimmy Dorsey and his band, Bob Eberle and Helen O'Connell, sing "Green Eyes" we have a complete song. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie is in the public domain and the DVD transfer is just as bad as the play. My copy has only four chapters. This means that you can get arthritis in your fast-forward finger to speed through to where the good things are. The swamp you move through is Hollywood's version of the two Dorseys' lives and battles. Tommy, beautiful on trombones, and Jimmy, excellent on saxophone, couldn't stand each other. In 1935 they finally split, with Tommy starting his own band. Each one had greater success than they did together. They reconciled when their father died in the forties, and that is where the movie ends. They later succeeded in tolerating each other in the orchestra led by Tommy, as the big-band era disappeared in the fifties. Tommy died in 1956 at the age of 51, thrown into his sleep for drinks, pills and a large meal. Jimmy died of cancer in 1957. Jimmy was very talented and of all accounts, a pretty easy man. Tommy was extremely talented and of all accounts, often an overwhelming jerk. But good music makes a lot of mistakes, and the Big Band sounds the two that helped to define the swing era. <br /> <br /> They play themselves in the movie, and we see them evolve from tussels to (grown-ups) to grown men who fight and gesture on each other. The film is busy not only with their two parents, played by the Hollywood Irish click, Sara Allgood and Arthur Shields. They just want their boys to come together, but also with a great story in which a romance between Janet Blair, a childhood of the Dorseys who becomes a vocalist with them, serves as an almost full-time mediator and author , and William Lundigan as a piano. Blair is not bad at all. However, if you want to see why she's never gotten the star, she's probably been watching the movies like that of her studio. No wonder she left Hollywood. Lundigan simply takes up space. <br /> <br /> How bad is this movie, other than when we can actually hear the Dorseys game? Well, here's a song written especially for the movie and given to Blair to warble. It is called 'to me'. <br /> <br /> For me ... you are the rose of a rosary ... the rise of a rising sea ... the glow of a star ... <br /> <br / > The roses of a rosary? The movie doesn't get any better than that, and it can't get any worse. Still, if you like the Dorseys and if the price is right ... well, afterwards, I still won't buy it. The highlight, for me, is Eberle and O'Connell singing "Green Eyes." You can see it for free on your Tube. There are also quite a few of the Dorseys. I wish I knew.
