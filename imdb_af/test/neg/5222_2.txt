OK, I'm 26, so I was through all the action heroes 80's hype, and Chuck Norris with Seagal, Van Damme and the rest of the guys were my childhood, fighting the bad guys and shooting dozens of bullets of one net around ;) A couple of days ago I saw the ad of this movie on TV. Chuck Norris threw some fireballs from his fingers. Whoa! "It's a must-see movie!" I said. And indeed it was. Just a lot worse. It is very difficult to see all the movies - filled with some religious thoughts, ridiculous zombie-like monsters, serving Satan, all the idea of ​​a plot that is in a forgotten community that represents all humanity - that is a load of Christian fundamentalist wet dreams. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against Christianity, even in the movies, but this one has no taste, it has almost everything connected with common sense, Chuck Norris plays an angel , whose job is to look at small town, where Satan lives?!?! The whole plot is so straight and boring, calling it sotiness (yes, it is no longer stupid, we are talking silly like ... like a delayed kid's joke) makes absolutely horrible movie, as far as I suppose the older people are very devoted to the Catholic Church, because young viewers are almost every scene laughing. Technically it's wrong, the fx is worse than the ones you've seen in TV series in the early 90's, the plot looks VERY stupid, actors can easily be exchanged for cardboard steps, and call the music I've heard played so far. a childish piano. I saw a lot of movies, even the worst (those of the IMDb list) such as "Space Mutiny" or "Manos - Hands of Destiny," but apparently did not compare me to this ridiculous, horrible, terribly acted quasi movie that some students bring prank films to my mind rather than ordinary production. Avoid it. Avoid it at all costs. There is even nothing to laugh about. Chuck Norris officially completed his film career.
