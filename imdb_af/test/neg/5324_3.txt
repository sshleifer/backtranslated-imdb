I actually saw the movie before reading the book. When I watched the movie, I was upset because I wondered why Dean Koontz made such a bad book / movie. The movie was confusing and didn't flow at all, it was messy and made me rock on the TV. I couldn't touch the characters at all, so I didn't care about what happened to them (usually I like the characters because I have their personality or problems). Then I read the book and loved it. I read the book regularly again, and the film collects dust. I wish someone would make a Koontz movie that follows the books of his books, then the movies won't suck so much. DO NOT BE THIS MOVIE, IF YOU SHOULD FILL YOU!
