The only thing more crowded than that of the movie is his writing. Flatliners are the ideal display for Joel Schumacher's glorious, flamboyant, lack of talent. The plot is completely illogical, but super fake ponderous and everything is art-directed within an inch of his life in the most clicked, overheated way. I love how the co-op room is a hollow vaulted marble mausoleum, illuminated in red with large Rembrandt paintings hanging from the walls. I love Keifer Sutherland driving a canvas-backed jeep. No one in Joel Schumacher's movies lives in an unencrypted way. It is always an alternative universe where everyone is young and painfully hip, but hip is rigorous and obsessive according to a hypo-idea of ​​the middle-aged billionaire child. And holy crap! The part where Baldwin's brother # 16 dies and comes back, and then all the women are sleeping with whom he slept with whom "I'll call you," and "I just need space", is the funniest friggin thing in the whole universe !!!! What kind of a world do we live in where Joel Schumacher gets to keep people throwing money from him? "Flatliners" has shown me to review the man's whole oeuvre just for the kind of high quality yuks contained therein.
