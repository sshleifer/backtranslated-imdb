This movie was so poorly acted. What was Jeff Bridges' emphasis, awful and incredible. Was it supposed to be French, Scandinavian? The writing was lame. To have the heroine travel over the grave of her boyfriend while walking off the Jeff Bridges character ... are you joking? How convenient Jeff brings his dirty kick into the house after he has bodies in his lawn. Don't these people just think of calling the police? Okay ... I'll get you in the car, why not? Duh! Why was Bridge's daughter obsessed with the fact that her father had a relationship, is her mother sick or boring? I didn't see the original, it would be hard to make myself after I saw this movie.
