The most obvious mistake ... terrible, terrible writing. This movie had a potentially good story, but it was devastated by bad dialogue, continuity problems, things that were never explained, yawning plotholes, sub-plots that went nowhere, and just stupidity. Not to mention the awful, clumsy director of Sandra Locke. Not even two major performances could have saved this movie. So it didn't matter that Devon Gummersall and Rosanna Arquette did horrific acts. The thing is, they are better actors than this movie will believe you. The best of the Arquettes, Rosanna Arquette (Silverado, After hours, Desperately Seeking Susan) has fine moments - such as a wonderful scene in the beginning when she painfully pulls her handcuffs - but according to her standards gives a total poor performance. And Devon Gummersall (Dick, when the trumpets fade, and the brilliant My So-Called Life) is much worse, which, without any conviction or emotion, is what-so-ever happens. But I won't blame the actors, who were good in other roles. The writing is terrible, and the bad direction doesn't help. Do me a favor ... avoid this movie.
