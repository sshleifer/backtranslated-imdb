Directed and written by renowned / infamous Edward D. Wood Jr., with a pseudonym (Daniel Davis) starring Glen / Glenda. This is an almost radical documentary on transvestism; Wood itself is a transvestite with a fetish for angora jerseys. It looks more or less like stock and an incoherent Bela Lugosi is used to stretch this strange and uncomfortable movie after 67 minutes. Police inspector (Lyle Talbot) is seeking relief from a psychiatrist, dr. Alton (Timothy Farrell), to better understand the emotional and mind of transvestites. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast: Delores Fuller, "Tommy" Hanes, Captain DeZita and Wood's sister Evelyn. Note: Farrell also acts as a narrator. And Fuller later helped write songs in the Elvis Presley movies BLUE HAWAII, KISSIN 'COUSINS & KID GALAHAD.
