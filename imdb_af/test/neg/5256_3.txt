This movie was highly recommended, but I don't know why. However, I'm not really an Adam Sandler fan, except in 50 First Dates where he leaves his usual evil man routine. Damon Wayans is a sub-captain and Adam Sandler is the man he claims to be friends for a year to breast-feed him. Of course, Sandler is angry about this betrayal. Be angry and sly from the king of variety. They end up in the game and of course they get back to a big misunderstanding (Sandler shoots Wayans in the head - he survives so he's Bulletproof). Should I continue? You will work out what will happen if you look at it anyway. When our DVD player stopped (hey was $ 80 out of the supermarket OK?) It was noted that the player knew the movie was boring and refused to play it.
