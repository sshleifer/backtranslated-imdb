It was one of the biggest bits of shit I ever had to watch. I mean seriously. How would someone else feel if they were in Woody Harrelson's shoes and your wife even thought it would be a good idea to sleep with the other guy, even for a million dollars. She was the one who talked about it in bed and said how good it would be for them, as he could build his house or whatever with that money. Woody never fully agreed to this until she talked about it. How can you trust her? Who would even consider it if they were married? I don't care how desperate they were. It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life. Then he flips out on her. Apparently he had no right to trust her, except that his wife just slept with another man who was extremely rich and attractive. Oh, wait, then he must apologize to her after she filed for the divorce so she can be with the man she slept with. Of course Woody has no right to tell her or trust her, especially after she still has Roy Hobb's ticket in her wallet. Then, at the end of the movie, she is so in love with Woody and misses him so much that she won't leave Hobbs until he has made a little foolish tale to let her go. shiny thank you Hobbs ???? Do you hit me asleep? Was she under contract as his sex slave or something? I mean what the ox? Oh, wait for it to get better. She sniffed him so passionately that she came out of the car. Yes, she's not a whore. Oh, thank you for letting me go, let me go out with you with a view to good cute. Smooch smooch, smooch though I'm still married to a man I left for a rich man. I have never seen such a piece of shit in my life. How the hell should we feel good after that terrible end? What was this movie supposed to represent? Nothing came out of it! It was the most sensible movie I've ever seen in my life. Two pathetic desperate people. If I were Woody, I would tell her to drown herself in the water they were close to. Apparently he had no self-respect. What the hell was Roy Hobbs thinking about taking this terrible role. I feel like fucking after I watched it. This movie was so bad, it was seriously laughing. I want to have those two hours of my life that I messed up to look at this piece of ****.
