Well, the hero and the terror are slightly below average in my opinion. Yes, Chuck is a true martial artist and kicks a little in this movie, but it's pretty slow and the acting in my opinion is mostly subpar, although I think Steve James is doing a decent job. Like my friend Ryan, I was confused about why the psychopath preferred to go to the theater, rather than going to Norris's friend. Until then, the killer had just killed women. Oh, well, I think it wasn't as predictable as I thought. Definitely a movie you can pass on.
