This movie is bad, so bad that my mom, who barely can stand the "tension" of Disney's Snow White, has covered the whole movie. My first warning should have been that it was in the $ 5.50 bin at Wal-Mart. But I actually got some good movies in that bowl, so I can't blame it for this debacle. The second warning should have been when the cashier was on the DVD, it was actually $ 3.88. Again I was never one to ignore the cheapest. This movie is definitely not for people looking for something good to watch, and it is certainly not for everyone who enjoys bad movies from time to time. If you have background noise while doing something like playing cards with some friends, get it, but if you are looking for something to actually look at, don't even bother. It was really disappointing because there were many good actors. I felt like I had a chocolate version of Willard.
