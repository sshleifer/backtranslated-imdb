If you struggle to sleep or just want to go out in the afternoon, but just can't stick out, pop in this movie. The only neat thing about this movie is the electric aircraft. In addition to that, prepare for some sweet szzz. It makes the minds of how big name stars such as those in this movie can be part of one of the dull movies I've ever seen. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll finish my nap.
