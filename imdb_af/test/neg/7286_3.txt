Hey there. I watched the first part when it came out, and I don't remember having such a bad impression on me as this one. <br /> <br /> First, the animation is limp, wood, not worked, lacks naturalness - I understand the style was of an "Atlantic" type, but it can be done with the usual Disney finesse . See "Tarzan" to see what I mean. If I didn't see the DISNEY logo in the beginning, I'd never say it's a Disney movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the plot was more like a PC game style, such as a good old quest. Not that it was bad, but it lacked a story that links the viewer to the characters and their goals. This was at least unprofitable. The movie is meant for kids, but it was sometimes childish. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the music ... I would say it was improper, but fit the whole scene with the plot and animation ... <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it was a kind of entertainment, just a kind of project by several student animators, just to fill in the score for Disney movies. Sorry to hear from myself, a great Disney lover ...
