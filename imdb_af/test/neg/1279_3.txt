Some people think Sweden negatively: too neat, too clean, too serious, too organized and too northern. A people has been tortured by their own religious fate and history, sometimes leading to depression and compulsive hands. It does not have to be a problem for a filmmaker, for example the late Bergman showed us that under these circumstances kinematic is possible. Bergman used his identity as a starting point and did not explicitly comment on this identity as such. <br /> <br /> However, Andersson does the opposite: He only comments on this identity and disciplines his people to the bone: In his world Sweden is equal for hell on earth. But he doesn't take it any further and for me it's just not art, but just annotation. Despite the extraordinary amount of time it took to make this filmmaker severely constrained, he could clearly not leave. <br /> <br /> Compared to his previous movie Sånger fra andre våningen / Songs of the Second Floor, many progress has not been observed either. The intention was that it was more accessible, but the difference was minimal and the few scenes trying to please a larger audience were not the best in the movie. The same absurdism and minimalism still applies, there is the one-shot camera position and the (lack of) action before this shot. Yes, the silence is well done, some of the screens actually work and the color and positioning are wonderful. But is it an interesting movie? Think in a negative way, it's a theater background. <br /> <br /> Andersson's background as a brand of advertising shines through the extensive setup, but I find his movies as empty as those ads. There is a message about humanity, but it is trivial and without much depth.
