Scary Movie 1-4, Epic Movie, Date Movie, Meet the Spartans, Not Another Teen Movie and Another Gay Movie. To make the "Superhero Movie" the eleventh in a series that has spoiled the parody genre conveniently. Now, I will admit that I have a soft spot for classic people like the plane and the naked gun, but you know you've milked such a franchise if you can see the gags for a mile. In fact, the only thing you can really do to see this disaster is the incredibly funny but massive sale Leslie Neilson. <br /> <br /> You can say he needs the money, withers or he intends to go off the ship like a good Capitan. In no way does he bring down this genre, but he does not help it. But if I feel sorry for someone in this movie, she is decent actor Drake Bell, who is put in a great deal of embarrassment. However, those who are by far the greatest amount of torture are forced to put 90 minutes of lethargic bile no worse than herpes. <br /> <br /> After disaster movies on airplane! The closest rifle and Hollywood horrors in Scary Movie 3 and 4, producer David Zucker, set sights on the superhero genre with this anarchic comedy pointing everything from Spider-Man to X-Men and Superman Returns. <br /> <br /> Shortly after the bite through a genetically altered dragonfly, Rick Riker (Drake Bell) begins to experience an exciting transformation. Now Rick's skin is as strong as steel, and he has the power of ten men. Determined to use his new forces to fight crime, Rick creates a special costume and accepts The Dragonfly's identity - a fearless crime fighter aimed at keeping the streets safe for legitimate citizens. <br /> <br /> But every superhero needs a nemesis. After capturing Lou Landers (Christopher McDonald) in the midst of an experiment, he developed the power to extract the life force from someone he met and become the scab. The goal of achieving immortality is to gather as much life force as possible, as the noble Dragonfly strives to take off its archeology and realize its fate as a true hero. Craig Mazin writes and writes this low flying spoof. <br /> <br /> With Tracy Morgan, Pamela Anderson, Leslie Nielsen, Marion Ross, Jeffrey Tambor and Regina Hall. <br /> <br /> Hell Superhero Movie can earn merit in being a hell much better than Meet the Spartane and Epic Movie. But with great responsibility one of the worst outings of 2008 comes so far. Laughless but a little less annoying than meeting the Spartans. And in the same sense much more forgetful than meeting the Spartans. But maybe that's a good reason. There are still some of us trying to scrape away the spot the Spartans encounter from our memory. <br /> <br /> My Final Judgment? Avoid being one of the people who enjoy such car accidents. Like Date Movie and Scary Movie 2, but not quite as bad as Meet the Spartane or Epic Movie. Super Villain.
