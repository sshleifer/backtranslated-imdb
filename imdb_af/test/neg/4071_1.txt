Aghhhhhh! What a disappointment. A very good hunger like Antonio Sabato Jr. and nothing but embarrassment that comes from his mouth. I came to 95% of the Dialog! It would have been better to make the character dumb! How Antonio Sabato and Michael Pare can talk those lines without losing control of a bodily function is beyond me! If Michale Pare's character only suggested one or more sentences with the word 'Men', I think I would have thrown the iron through the TV set (I love multitask - especially to get bad movies). Must be a lean year for both of them to sign up for this movie. Washing cars for a life will probably look good to them. And the bad guy ... if he was so bad, he not only shot all those rich college kids instead of promising toilet breaks. Even the title was a misunderstanding. A 'Crash Landing' means that the plane actually crashes and not just land without a firearm or injured person. Instead of landing safely, the plane had to crash and burn just like the writing. <br /> <br /> THIS MOVIE IS A STUCKER!
