Serious disappointing performance by Brad Pitt and QT, the plot is very superficial and crippled, and unless it is indirectly planned, this movie actually captures the Nazis and depicts them as honors and shows that the Jewish people are deceiving, not promising and bloody evil. (The following contains SPOILER)) Hitler, along with the most notorious Nazis, is attending a blunt plot, less film about the murder of 300 Italian soldiers in a small theater theater in Paris, is incredibly ridiculous. The Nazis laughed and heard every murder in the movie as if they were watching a basketball match. The deal is coming to an end. What is really scary is that the movie earns good reviews and is ranked among the top 250 films in the 40's. will not be surprised if it has harvested many awards, including Oscars. The movie is just a silly ass for the Jewish people, but hey reconsidered, it doesn't even do a good job. it throughout the Nazi Jewish conflict and a pure insult to all who have fought and suffered the Nazi tyranny.
