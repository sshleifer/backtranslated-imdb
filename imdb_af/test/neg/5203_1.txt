As a big fan of the original Operation Delta Force, I thought I would pick up this movie. I thought it couldn't be bad. Here's a list of things I've learned to watch Operation Delta Force 4: Deep Fault. <br /> <br /> - The Delta Force, despite being the elite in US armed forces, is mostly bodyweight men in their late 30s and early 40s. <br /> <br /> - The Delta Force, despite being the elite in US armed forces, bears standard police outreach pistols or AK-47s on their main missions. <br /> <br /> - The Delta Force, despite the fact that US soldiers are the elite, has not learned that during solid missions, wearing bright red ski jumpers and running around in open spaces, you do not like the eye will remain. <br /> <br /> - If you drop a Molotov cocktail into a tank, it explodes externally like a grenade. <br /> <br /> - If you are hit by the quake, you can run away, although the smoke caused small breathing problems. <br /> <br /> - You can die from one standard shotgun, but you can also live, despite being hit several times by a sniper rifle, and a few times by an AK-47. <br /> <br /> In the hand-to-hand battle, Delta Force members, despite being the elite in the US Army, are frequently pumped by railways. <br /> <br /> - If bad guys get you on a slow train, there's nothing to worry about - among the 4, they can't figure out how to get an automatic weapon to fire automatically, anyone from 5 meters with at least 50 attempts between them. <br /> <br /> - If you are short on actors, just reclaim them - the bad man of Operation Delta Force 1 plays a good man called Mac in Operation Delta Force 4, and the man who runs Mac in Operation Delta Force 3 played, now Skip Lang, another good guy. <br /> <br /> - It's not right for the Delta Force to be an unarmed terrorist, even if he is trying to reload his weapon to kill you. <br /> <br /> - Grenades explode with impact on the ground when thrown by members of the Delta Force. When thrown by non-Delta Force staff, they explode exactly at the point where Delta Force members threw the grenades back at the bad guys. <br /> <br /> - Tanks can drive faster than standard trucks. <Br /> <br /> - Military and personal armies use exactly the same helicopter used by the UN in Operation Delta Force 1. <br /> - When a helicopter arrives, a bad guy in that helicopter can not see you if you do not face light. <br /> <br /> - Shoots several times in the chest will cause minor damage. If you knead the person, they will kill within 5 seconds. <br /> <br /> - The Delta Force steals old-fashioned cars around when they are abroad, because the US military does not provide any means to transport them. It can also explain why they have caught public transport. <br /> <br /> As you can see, it's not really the best moment to make movies, but it's good to laugh.
