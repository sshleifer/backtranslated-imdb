It's the absolute show in Nickelodeon's history. First, no boarding school has a sushi bar, flat screen TVs, and gives each student a laptop. This makes the show so unrealistic and boring. The plots are senseless and incredibly boring. The actors are so bad, it intends to take my own life. I hate the fact that Zoey is the most popular girl in school, and the most beautiful and smart, and gets the best grades without doing any work. She never has real problems, and every guy wants to date her. She is so perfect. There is no such person. I also hate that everyone will do anything for her, and everyone chooses her for every team or club. It is so irritating. Quinn is so offensive. Her experiments are pathetic, useless and fake. Chase is such a wimp. He says he loves Zoey, but if he tells her it will ruin their friendship. How pathetic. Michael is trying to be funny, but he never reaches anything. Nichole is so beautiful and screams a lot. She is never seen working or studying, but she is a straight A student. Lola thinks she's an actress, but she sucks (Excuse my language). Should I say more? I do not think so. For your own good, stay away from this show at all costs.
