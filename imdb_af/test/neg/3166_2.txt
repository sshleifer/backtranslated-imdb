It's Valentine's Day and we decided to stay in, have a nice dinner and watch this movie on TCM instead of going out. We are in our 40's - 50's, love romance, and are both "softies", but this movie just bombarded us (it's hard to think it was named for Oscars, but I think it was then). The cinematography was beautiful, but the movie as a whole is mostly terribly dated. Jennifer Jones's character has become so many references to her that Eurasion starts counting us and after a while we giggle every time she says it. In addition, the "theme song" has been playing continuously through the movie and we couldn't wait for it to be over so we could see the evening news.
