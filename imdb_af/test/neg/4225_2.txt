I think the cards were stacked against Webmaster because from the beginning it was the itchy feeling, as something was wrong, but I couldn't really put my finger on it. Then it hit me. Named. For a while, they either have most of the lines either as voice over or off, with just a little hint here and there, until it has become painfully clear. It is the kind of dubbing that congratulates on the nerves, with nothing even remotely funny about it. I hate copying, but at least, wrong places, badly bought martial arts movies tend to have a sense of humor about it. <br /> <br /> What I wanted was a movie about a hacker doing real hacking and things. Perhaps like a back of the table of movie hackers (it's about the person trying to keep them out instead of the people trying to get in). What I got was a badly written, careless way of killing murder with some bad pursuits, a so-called fearless hacker who was neutered without his little ego and a director who obviously didn't know how to make a camera to deal with. I just wanted to get in there, grab the camera from the guy and shoot the thing myself. The editing wasn't much better. The acting? Well, if the chief hadn't had such a bad manuscript to work on, he would at least be viewable. The main bad guy was also ok, but pretty much everyone was joking. Dubbing didn't help but the acting was pretty bad, even taking it into account. <br /> <br /> Before I get any worse, let's do some good things. Well, one or two. Despite the rudimentary graphics, I'd rather enjoy the cyberworld stuff, how little there was, and would rather watch a movie mostly, in and around it as the lukewarm environment in the 'real world'. The forgery of the thumb print looked as if it was cool, but was ultimately unusable in the scheme of things. The heart gadget, which reminds me of Guillermo Del Toro's Cronos, was interesting, but if a plot device was ripped directly from the pages of Escape from New York, it was terribly remarkable in the long run. There is one point where the bad man is unconscious and our hero is right there. Why didn't he try the bad man's thumb pressure (since the heart device was thumb activated)? Still, some interesting gadgets and cyber stuff, if they could only be used better. <br /> <br /> Now, who's daring to compare Blade Runner here? Both films take place somewhere in the future and there is some sort of romance in that kind, in both films. There is an investigation into a murder, but I've seen a movie with a murder in the middle that is nothing like Blade Runner or Webmaster. Identity, for example. It's about where the agreements end. Period. There is no comparison, just as there would be between Blade Runner and Hackers. Ridley Scott is a brilliant director with a great understanding of art and knows the basics of movies, such as where the camera should sit. Webmaster is cheap and not just because of the budget. It's inexpensive because of bad writing, and because it takes the easy way out more often than not (such as writing in a character that barely appeared in the first place to eventually save the girl for her Get point B without herself, so that he can do his thing. Very convenient. Whether the attempt at sympathy factor for a character, we have no need to care, or things like the car that is set to just enough stall for someone to get away.). <br /> <br /> It's trying to be hip, it's trying to be exploitative, it even tries a spinning end that is not the least surprising, and it's trying to be exciting. But a lot of close identical pursuits, poor writing, editing, horrible shot, bad acting, etc. Don't make an exciting movie.
