"Don't be greedy" sum up the depth of this movie. All the rest of the baloney is big budget window dressing. The film rotates by hiding the ball annoyingly and revealing too much. None of the potentially interesting plot interfaces have been developed, but the trite ones are hashed and rehashed to excess. <br /> <br /> The charm of DD, as others pointed out, was in the schizophrenia device, the humor in the dust of the film, and most importantly, the acting. There is plenty of wood in the box to attract a huge hill of martial term. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the suspension of unbelief during this mess is the sly question, "Why would a technologically superior force be able to take over? Government should do any tests?" a movie.
