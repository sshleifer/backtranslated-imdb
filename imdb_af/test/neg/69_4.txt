"Witchery" may just be the most incoherent and sadly written horror movie of the 80's, but fortunately, it has some competing features such as fantastic gore effects, an exciting musical score and some tremendous decisive choices. Honestly, the screenplay is not one of the sentences, but who cares when Linda Blair (with an exploded hairstyle) still owns a girl owned by evil forces and David Hasselhof portrays a brave photographer (who doesn't seem to he is laid) in a film that constantly contains bloody voodoo, pruned lips, upside down, ominous gangs and an overused but really creepy tune. Eight random people gathered on a deserted resort island along the coast of Massachusetts. The young couple are there to investigate the place's dark history; The dysfunctional family (with a pregnant Linda Blair, even if the father does not seem to be and his place of residence) believes that the hotel is being opened again and that the nice female architect is only labeled for casual sex. They are forced to stay in the ramshackle hotel the night and then suddenly the previous housewife ?? an outdated actress or something that always has a black dress? Start performing them in several intrusive ways. Everything is somehow related to the intro sequence in which a woman accused of witchery jumps out of a window. In any case, the plot is definitely of lesser importance in an Italian horror franchise that begins as an unofficial spin-off of "The Evil Dead". The atmosphere is sometimes disturbing and the makeup effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film. There is something very morbid and disturbing about the stare at a defenseless woman hanging upside down on a chimney waiting to be roasted.
