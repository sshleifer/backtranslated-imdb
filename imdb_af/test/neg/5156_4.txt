This movie has roaches like super-meat killers. It may have been the first movie where cookies were the primary killers, but not the first movie where chicks are murderers. "Damnation Alley" had a scene with killer cockroaches and "Creepshow" had a story they had. In this one they are the star. Not as good as it could have done, it doesn't kill everything in them. However, I can be wrong at this point because I haven't seen this one for a long time yet. The cockroaches have gone killer and this very strange research lady is in town to study them. Yes, she's pretty strange, because at one point she's holding her hand in a box on the killer cookies and she is like "They bite my hand," and she says it in a state of ecstasy. There is also a super big roach near the end of this one, as in so many insect films. Not a good movie, but worth checking out on a night you're bored with.
