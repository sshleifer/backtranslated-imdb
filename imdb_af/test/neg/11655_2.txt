I'm not surprised that this movie did well at the Hamptons Film Festival. It is a shallow movie that will make a good career on level people. Two actors pretending to be actors in a relationship fighting and looking for a lost dog. The film is allegedly investigating the dynamics of the relationship, but the relationship is too small to earn any search. This couple has one dimension: their fight, their plague, then they make love and fight even more. There is a short moment of gentleness that reveals no reason that these two would be involved, given their poisonous and fleeting relationship. Beautifully shot, excellent score, but without any merit in writing or characters, this short is the same.
