I know many people like this show and I apologize for people who think this show is great, but it is the worst show ever created. Sure, I'm sure I'll be a big fan of this show if Jeremy Clarkson wasn't there. I mean, I think cars are trying out and doing things like seeing a car knocking a plane is great! But Jeremy Clarkson is just pathetic. Here are the reasons why I hate this man: He thinks it's cool to measure speed cameras that measure your average speed by measuring your distance and time by driving 200mph in the road and then resting for two hours. . He clearly thinks he's better than Richard Hammond and James May. . He has my best friend, says pathetic things. . He screams for children just to take a picture of him. I'm sorry top gear, but Jeremy Clarkson is a freak.
