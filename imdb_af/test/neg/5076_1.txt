The movie "Chaos" is known as Gleick's 1988 pop science statement of chaos theory. What did the book or anything related to the contents of the book deal with the plot of the movie "Chaos"? Nothing. The filmmakers apparently look at the book (of course, without understanding about it) looking for a "theme" to unite the series of everyday action sequences that come on the brisk series of events that replace a plot in the movie . In this regard, the movie "Choas" looks at the Canadian attempt "Cube", in which prime numbers function as a device to hide the audience so that the ridicule of the plot will not be noticed: in 'Cube' a lot of prime numbers being thrown in for viewers to reflect their lack of understanding due to lack of knowledge about primes: the same approach is taken in "Chaos": decoupled extracts from Gleick's books are thrown to make the actions of the bad man appear in the movie. This is, of course, an abusive deviant treatment of the audience, and any literate viewer of "Chaos" who can stand to pass the entire movie becomes confused. How can a movie be made so bad? Rewriting in a novel, the story in "Chaos" probably won't even be past the literary agent's secretary's desk. How can (at least) hundreds of thousands (and probably millions) of dollars be thrown away on what can only be regarded as a waste of time for everyone except those who took money at home? Regarding what is in the movie, each view is enabled. For technical glitches, it will be surprising if more than one task is used for any one scene. The story is uniformly pointless: the last time I saw a story, it is the production of a literal eight-year-old. Among other major shortcomings are the following: The bad guy gives tips for the police to follow. He has no reason whatsoever to leave such tips. Police officers do not wear or use radios. Dupes of the bad man have no reason to act with the bad man. Let me strongly recommend that no one see this movie. If there is any other movie you want (or even just don't hate) watch it earlier.
