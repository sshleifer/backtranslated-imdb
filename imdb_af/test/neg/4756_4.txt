I love B movies, but I like to be aware from the beginning that I am watching one. I can't believe anyone can make such a film about strangers and predators so bad. <br /> <br /> Aliens and Predator are AWESOME. This movie made a big joke out of them. The creators did not take this film seriously at all. I'm disappointed with how the Strauss jerks dealt with this movie. They made a mockery of wonderful characters. It was as if they were serious in the beginning, then their writers grew up and gave up. Almost nothing was persistent, the main characters were terrible and were not strangers or predators. I'm so ridiculously sad that no one else takes more Alien and Predators seriously. These characters are icons of American pop culture and the creators of this movie had no respect for the original films. They should not be allowed to enter cash on the names of the previous films and they should be ashamed
