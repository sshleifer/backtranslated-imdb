The worst movie I've ever seen. The sound quality was bad, the cutting of the screens was worse and above all it was not logical and it had no speed. <br /> <br /> I first learned, "Oh no, I don't want The trail proving that poor Patrick was an innocent killer." But it was even worse. Typically in this American movie you get a superhint or no hints. I want many little tips that will lead you to the killer. The audience is not involved. And now, if I don't get any tips at all, you can expect some 'he / she-the-killer' sweeps. And that's not all. ah ... It's hopeless, let's put an end to it ... <br /> <br /> In one word: Disgusting. <br /> <br />
