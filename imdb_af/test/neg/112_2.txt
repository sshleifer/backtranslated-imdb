Now, I love Italian horror movies. How cheesier they are, the better. However, it's not cute Italian. It's a week-old spaghetti sauce with rotten meatballs. It's an amateur hour on every level. There is no tension, no horror, with just a few drops of blood being scattered to remind you that you are actually watching a horror movie. The "special effects" consist of the lights that change red when the ghost (or whatever it is) is, and a rope pulls up and down beds. Oooh, can you feel the cold fever? The DVD quality is that of a VHS transmission (which actually helps the movie when it hurts). The dubbing is among even the lowest "bad Italian movie" standards and I gave it one star just because the dialogue is so hilarious! And what we discover when she finally looks at the attic (in a scene one minute and the night the next day). Well, I won't spoil it for anyone who really wants to see, but let's just say it's not a very "novel"!
