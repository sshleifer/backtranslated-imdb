And so it started with "Shreik" a call from horror movies, then our Scary Movie, a real good attempt at a new kind of genre, has the illustrious call. but .... now we have: Scary Movie * Scary Movie 2 Scary Movie 3 Scary Movie 4 * Date Movie Meet the Spartans Not another Team movie * plus much more (really funny movies marked with *) <br /> <br /> and ..... Super heroic movie .... it seems the people who make these movies don't yet understand what makes the joysticks funny. Using the rip-offs of other movies in a funny way is good and good if done properly, but not many producers want to know how to do it. Scary Movie (1) did it well. The following successors were then horrible because the franchise tried to play over, but it was redeemed by Scary Movie 4. Not another teen movie was good because it used the spoofs well ... and his credit is I'm sick of teenage movies. However, this film plays like a bad version of all this. It relies on folding stick. It will even make the 3 stooges, which violates the image of Stephen hawking. And when people get bored (and the producers know when it should be), we are treated to Pamela Anderson in a huge pack. . To conclude, spoofs must be about making an original mock-up of an original movie with an original storyline, not the accidental taking of rightful movie on the story of a real movie patch. <br /> <br /> ... I shake at the idea of ​​"SCI-FI MOVIE" and get my seppuku knife ready
