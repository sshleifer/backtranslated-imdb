This show is what happened to The Screen Savers after G4 got hands, from a useful source of computer-related information to a show that had the highest point of moving a miniature web server on someone's posterior. /> <br /> As G4's ratings dropped, they got away from their original target audience, gamers, to generic hormone-driven young men, who added eye cakes to staff and a sex ad segment. Now even the gamers have initially turned the show off in horror. I'm looking forward to the show's, and the network's overwhelming, overdue and well-deserved demise.
