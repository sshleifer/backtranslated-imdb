George Sluizer's repetition of his own superior film is a total waste of time. Why was it even attempted? Kiefer Sutherland plays Jeff Harriman, whose girlfriend (Sandra Bullock, who has only a small amount of screen time) is kidnapped at a service station by Barney Cousins ​​(Jeff Bridges). Now Barney is portrayed as a kind of guy that no one will trust in a month on Sundays - he runs over Frankenstein's Monster, but without the sympathy, and Bridges's play is absolutely horrible. Sutherland comes across a little better than his character detective using the new love interest Rita Baker (Nancy Travis). <br /> <br /> A major problem with this version of 'The Vanishing' is the obvious need to cater for Hollywood audiences by avoiding the dark end of the original movie. Here's the end happy that forced and unbelievable and completely destroyed the story. But by now the damage was done, as Jeff Bridges turned the bad guy into a big laugh.
