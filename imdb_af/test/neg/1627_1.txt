Cave dwellers, or The Blade Mater, or whatever is called, are in one word: VILE! I saw it on MST and I not only laughed at the big running commentary, but at the indecent movie show shown. Sunglasses, tire tracks and where did Ator get a hangover? Then they lift some shots from another movie, showing Eagles Dare as Tom Servo. To show how good this movie really is, look at the scene where Ator and Thong have to fight invisible swords. Or even better, look for the giant snake dressed like a snake, that Ator must struggle! And what exactly do the scenes do in the credits with the movie?
