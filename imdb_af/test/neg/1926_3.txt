To be honest, it was a few years since I looked at the bile dedicated to celluloid known as "Lord on Earth", so forgive me if my memory of the movie is a bit sketchy. I'll keep to the main points that bother the soul of the unlucky viewer. <br /> <br /> Scene One: Chris Klein, after being thrown out of the prep school (because he looks like a 17-year-old - yes, very credible), gives what I assume is his valedictic speech ... after a field. Let me repeat it to you - a field. I think we should be moved by the combination of shame and eloquence that he doesn't express. Klein has the delivery and facial expressions of a cardboard cutout. He is a decent piece of cardboard, but little. <br /> <br /> Scene Two: After some red-eyed and teenage piranias, Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett, do some damage to the local dinner, which he is forced to. to rebuild. Of course. Because who better to help with construction than a random moron that crashed into it / burned it in the first place. Better still, let's say that a random moron goes into Josh Hartnett's girlfriend, Miss. Sobeski, the girl he desires for ... her equally timid delivery? <br /> <br /> Scene Three: Chris Klein's character echoes Leelee Sobeski's character and decides to call her various body parts to the states on the eastern coast. My soul is crying. Really, how can this scenario appear well? Surely you have to alienate a few million people if you think their home is equal to Miss Sobeski's more ... erm ... female areas. Secondly, the name of her breasts to New York and New Jersey ask for confusion about the fact or not. Sobeski is actually unreliable. <br /> <br /> Celebrating scene: Leelee is in progress. She fell off. It gives her ... knee anxiety. "We always knew it could come back," said her father (?). Right. Knee Cancer. From emissions. Maybe I missed something. As I said, it was a few years. Certainly I missed something. Don't I? For the love of God, please tell me that the girl did not shrink KNEE cancer to fall. <br /> <br /> That scream you just heard was that my soul died.
