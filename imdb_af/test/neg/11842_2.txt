We all know that the world is full of dodgy, rip-off horror movies. Some of these may be fun to watch because of their stupidity, terrible effects and iffy dialogue. But Raptor, who was in the same league as the equally senseless Carnosaur series, can't even have a delight in it. It's done so badly, it's really unbearable, even if you just watch it with the intention of having a day without brain at home. Where do we start? Well, the sets are pretty dead. My old drama group has created more realistic stages. The genetics laboratories seem to be from a university, and it looks equally incredible on the outside. (Even for cover, why would you place yourself near the civilization where people can hear the dinosaur) while the doctors lived? I do not seem credible at all. Next in the complaints list are the creature effects; Well, what can I say? Absolutely sorry. Also, it's worth mentioning, the woman's tits should be called an effect. Both of the main female characters had such a clear job of boobing, and this puts the characters down, because one woman is a respected police officer, while the other is the lovely innocent daughter of the village report. However, the acting is by far the worst tragedy. Eric Roberts can be apologized for at least trying to give his role something. That's where it ends. Corbin Benson had to have killed his costume designer, because his shiny performance looks even more pathetic, while the female chapter is so bored (though, with this movie you can release her). The other character I will point out is the girl who allows her tits to do all the plays in the "racial" sex scene. (Ten minutes of endless repetitions of her bouncing on top of a few blocks). <br /> <br /> All in all, and summed up as one. Don't bother, don't do it.
