There are many so-called anti-war / anti-govt. policy films around now that start out as a mea culpa and end with 'our poor boys become hell out there, let the world sympathize with them, it's not their fault' - kind of things. I was half scared that it would be another in that style, even if it covered another subject / aspect of the same subject. I almost didn't look; For that reason, I hardly wrote this review. What did we get here? An Egyptian is being tortured to a secret off-shore center, on American orders, but it's another Egyptian who has to do the torture, not an American: "Look, our Americans have clean hands," and the Egyptians are bad. many anyway so let them hurt their own. Oh, and the goody had to be an American with a conscience: indeed, many Americans have them, but here the concept is misplaced. Yes, we all know that it is called an extraordinary issue, and it started in Clinton's time and is now being used completely out of control. Otherwise, it was very hackneyed and nervous to really condemn the US because it was partisan of torture; as if the makers were afraid to go the whole way fearing they were so unpatriotic or unobstructed (look at the message board! Anyone who apologizes, gets a face of heavy verbal artillery). Torture is a terrible thing, whether someone is guilty or not; In the 18th century, FrederickII, King of Prussia, abolished it for convicted killers. Although I have to say, a life sentence for a child molester is much less than I want to see. Well, how about torture? This film didn't really bring its horror and hopelessness. If you're under torture, the capital letters come out carefully. You won't say anything, even if it's not true, even if you didn't do the thing you're accused of, hoping that if you say AMEN, WHEN THIS IS PEDDLING, IT WILL STOP. DO NOT DO IT, BUT YOU SHOULD NEVER LEARN AND YOU LOVE THAT YOU DO IT WHAT YOU ARE THAT THIS IS YOU THAT YOU HAVE THAT YOU DIDN'T DO IT. Another thing that the film didn't bring enough was that the devastation remains, indescribably delightful, and that feeling remains with your whole life. It somehow changes people inside. How do I know all this? Don't ask. <br /> <br /> Re-edit: Two Things: The Arabic used in the movie was not the Egyptian dialect. It's worse than putting a movie in New Zealand with locals, as the characters and everyone have American accents. Also, the terribly little preacher who instigates his ignorant hearing of violence, told them things that were unfamiliar with that religion, which had to be brought out. And it is also not stated that any ninomold can become a mullah / imam; He does not need any special qualifications, and this is a hiatus that needs to be put right. Many are acceptable because of their fundamentalist views and the United Nations' big ally, Saudi Arabia, finances so many of them. Thank you for this space.
