This movie has very few good points, the special effects and acting were definitely terrible. But it was a movie made on a low budget so you didn't expect much from it, it did laugh a bit (I doubt it was meant :)). The scene where the old woman bends up and falls to the floor, puts it to her nose and goes to CHUPACABRA! In a very silly, gritty voice was priceless. All in all, if you have nothing else to look at and just want to laugh at a really crazy movie trying to cash in on the success of the Blair Witch Project, then grab the others, who don't bother.
