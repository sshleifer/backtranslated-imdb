The best throwing movie in the history of the theater? This one is a strong contender! Why waste so much money for such a useless, useless job? The only difference between the HItchcock classic and this poor imitation is color, wide screen and Leila's Walkman! A movie that is supposed to generate excitement and fear leaves me completely indifferent. <br /> <br /> No, you're going to tell me I would encourage the young generations to see the original baldash! This "psycho 1998" is a huge spoiler. <br /> <br /> They could have done something else, for example by throwing an actor closer to Bloch. s Bates, an obese man. They satisfy themselves with an unpleasant rehash! A pok on it! And long live Alfred Hitchcock!
