The performances are better than the ratings I gave to this work, simply because I would not support a movie that tells a child or mentally challenged person how to get, cook and inject drugs into their bodies . <br /> <br /> This is a disgusting movie that serves no purpose in the world, but to emphasize and try to legitimize the narcotic lifestyle. It carries convincing actions that add to my dislike. What did these people think? I couldn't enjoy a movie like this. It's enough to make someone who has never done drugs, think about it and those who have redeemed themselves and persuade themselves to return. I'm surprised it's not every clean junkie who sees it falling off the wagon. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good about this "movie", which is more than a how to get out. drama. This is the hallmark of what is wrong with Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Completely disgusting. <br /> <br /> It's a 1.3 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy:.
