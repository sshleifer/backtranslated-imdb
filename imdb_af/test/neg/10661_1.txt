This movie should be the worst movie of 2007, it was just really bad and I don't think I've ever seen a movie that is just as bad, I mean it doesn't really make bad Hollywood movies, do they? Hamish should really sing rather than acting because he just can't act. He was just as bad. I thought he was so bad in the movie that he made Mallika Shera like a better actress than him. her performance, she plays the same role in every movie, god it's just as boring to see her, i mean what do men see in this woman? Yes she has a god body, but where is that talent ???? I haven't seen it yet and at this rate I don't think I will ever want to. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Hamish falls in love with Ria, now this 15-year-old girl can act, my god was the best actor in the movie and she doesn't look like 15, she seems to me 21, but her performance was brilliant in the film. bless her she was really good, i hope to see more of her in the future. So Ria falls in love with Himash, but her father wants her to marry someone else. A typical bollywood movie, it's always a hiccup (can only happen in a bollywood movie) and the two will eventually marry. <br /> Well, I would give the music 10/10 It was great, what made the movie a hit, the songs were really great and brilliant. The only thing I can say is to buy the music and not watch the movie.
