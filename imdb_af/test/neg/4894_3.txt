The "Ballad of the Sad Café" worked hard on his image, but when it came to the crisis, it stood in its own self-made fabric. <br /> <br /> One can't say the image. hard, but if Vanessa Redgrave's Amelia John Wayne or even Clint Eastwood had to fight, my hard-earned dollars would have to go to Redgrave. Her depiction of Amelia was so close to perfection and consumed with more detailed dedication as most actors are willing to give to any multi-million dollar contracted persona. Redgrave gave Amelia this psychological sign which was a mixture of her own unique voice and a hard-earned south-facing woman. For the average viewer, it can be considered annoying, but if the film progresses, has it become her? Miss. Amelia, who changes these stages of beauty in a while. It was Redgrave's performance, as well as her interaction with the other characters, who left this movie alone? but not the longest. The others who followed her show were needed, but not star. As we were over, the smaller characters pictured each set of designers hired for the post-Depression South work, like the billboard. The image was needed to set the scene, but the characters of the village had no other purpose. Take for example Rod Steiger's vision of an old, wildly-spoken preacher. His screens alone will question any viewer as to the validity of this undisputed toad. The main two players around Amelia struggled with charm for the wonderful top-scene moment, but because of the lack of direction ?? it just seems faded. The most absurd of the two (although both high under the dubious common sense) is Cork Hubbard who plays Amelia's "cousin" who one day appears. His character has never been completely defined, he does not have a real motive and his loyalty remains uncertain. He does not play an important role in this film outside to force us, the viewers, to question his common sense and honesty. Can you create a character by simply sticking out your tongue, beating your ears and bumping your chest and head? Finally, is there the other side of the absurd? Keith Carradine. Callow's close-ups of this plagued man build character, but our lack of understanding between him and Amelia causes his purpose to faint. These were the characters, like cliché Southern as they were ?? some went ahead and tried to create an absurd period, and I can't argue that they failed. <br /> <br /> Where "Ballad of the Sad Café" did not rise above, it was in cinematography and narration. This film was about Amelia, and her need for other souls in her life. The audience's level of comfort with the arrival of her midget cousin was entertaining ?? One cannot help but wonder if he is honest or simply a trusting man who tries to loosen a warm heart. Cork Hubbard's character is never completely understood, but we accept him with short shots and Amelia does small things. It is his idea that changes from a precious businesswoman to a bona fide cafe owner. The problem is that director Callow never really takes us to the dramatic level between Cork and Redgrave? Is the man crazy or does he represent Amelia's family? I needed something from Callow who brought these two from the David Lynch esquire relationship. Then our pool gets even deeper with the addition of Carradine than Amelia's "love interest". Using the back-spring-back technique, do we see the two bets, but never their love? which draws Amelia's wrath against their love into the world of madness. Why was Amelia so angry? Why was there no connection between Carradine and Redgrave? Why was it even in the movie? With the lack of focus on the relationship between these characters, the ultimate scenes between the two did not make sense ?? Throw in Cork's choice and it just goes completely uncollated. While there were some nice choreographic scenes that Callow created, the inability to transfer his characters from point A to point B. I lost focus, interest, and my care for the characters dropped when I didn't understand the ultimate question? "Why?" <br /> <br /> Overall, "The Ballad of the Sad Café" started with a bang, but ended with a very small crack of a crackers. My emotional feelings of this movie turned up and down, and eventually decreased further, mainly due to the lack of understanding of the motives of the characters. Redgrave did a phenomenal job as Amelia, and while the other characters (beyond the random Steiger) tried their best, I just didn't understand who they were. Their motives were so confused that when the emotional end finally came, I was apathetic. Director Callow seems to be missing out on screen entry that allows us to understand the dynamic relationship between all our main players. Callow created some beautiful scenes where faces seemed to overlap the landscape, allowing us to focus on Amelia? or Carradine, but nothing is explained or developed. The movie played with anger, discovery, happiness, flashback, anger, anger, anger, fading. Without the comparative connections, it changed from leading film to actors playing parts before camera. It was a pity, because "Sad Café" had the promise, but it just couldn't deliver. <br /> <br /> Degree: ** ½ from *****
