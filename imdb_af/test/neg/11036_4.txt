A predictive but - in varying degree - viewable collection of mostly useless "stories". <br /> <br /> But we're starting from the top. <br /> <br /> Kaurismaki: If you've ever wondered which Finnish love / romance was like, maybe this dull little stranger is an indication. Muffled feelings, non-emotions, apathetic faces and a very depressing prospect of moving from Finland to Siberia! I think the follow-up to this story will be: "For Our Honeymoon We are moving from Siberia to Greenland". Of course, Aki had no idea what to write for this little movie, so he just made a half-claim-no-story that found him around a band that he especially loved (or maybe it's his friends ), because we get them to watch and listen to their music more than the two main characters. <br /> <br /> Erice: First, I've never heard of this old one? And now I know why. Beautiful black and white photography and almost nothing else - if it's not boring, it can be considered an asset. But you will be amazed at how many film critics and film students love boredom in the movies, and I recommend Erice's 10-minute snooze festival to the two groups of humanoids. Herzog: Not a movie, but probably a cut from his documentary on tribes in South America. It's not a short movie, but a report, but predominantly dull the first two entries, is Herzog's little refreshing and has some interesting moments, and as nothing else in the film's pretentious "time" concept does not fit. <br /> <br /> Jarmusch: As it is almost expected, this once-interesting movie maker (with the brain of a peanut, a talented idiot savant) still means a fool of futility. He was lazy and couldn't be bothered to write anything interesting, even for his own movies or a collection like TMO. The only bright side to watching a dumb veggie actor spend 10 minutes in a trailer is that she is played by the beautiful Chloe Sevigny. Otherwise, skip this nonsense. Oh, and VAT: I don't believe a young actress listens to classical music; was Jarmusch being surrealistic by letting Chloe listen to that kind of music? Does Lindsey Lohan look like opera? Maybe Drew Barrymore is a jazz fan? Who am I to say they are not? <br /> <br /> Jim Jarmusch is a moron. Oh, right ... I've already mentioned it ... <br /> <br /> Wenders: Here's the real shock of the whole movie: Wenders can actually make something good !!!!! All I've seen of this over-rated charlatan has been boring and useless so far. However, this short story is done with style (! Atypical) and is the best part of the movie. It makes one want to see more of it, though the story has a decision. <br /> <br /> Spike Lee: Oh dear Lord ?? What can I say here? Lee lets anyone look talented in comparison. Like Herzog, doesn't he choose a story, but submit a report? and a left-wing political propaganda report on it! CNN, but in black and white, and unilaterally, of course. Of course, "We Wuz Robbed", the delayed title of this little sleep inducer, is about how poor, gullible and infinitely idealistic Democrats WUZ ROBBED by Bush and his EVIL EVIL team from THIEVES. This is by far the dumbest and worst entry in this movie, and I had to use the speed button to not slumber. Spike Lee is really a product of affirmative action. God knows how many really talented (black) directors never had a chance to make movies, because this pretentious and unpretentious little round still has the opportunity to make them. And he gets it wrong every time! Now it does take some kind of talent, right? <br /> <br /> Kaige: The Chinese story has a firm condition. It's okay, nothing more. <br /> <br /> All in all, there are many and much better movies to spend your time on, but if your time is not as valuable (as it seems to be my own) You can watch this little movie . <br /> <br /> "Ten minutes can certainly be an eternity in the hands of the theater's anti-masters. Time is precious. - Fedor Miklowitz, 1588
