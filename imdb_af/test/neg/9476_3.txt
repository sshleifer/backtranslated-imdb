Now I watched it when I was hungry on Sunday and my aunt and uncle were one day with my 2 cousins ​​(one was 11, the other 9). We held onto the TV and passport to Paris just started. My cousins ​​both said they sometimes watch two of a kind and I said they could see the movie if they liked it. Since I was not able to get up, I just stayed in the lounge with them and finally watched the movie! I must say, as a person who is not interested in such televisions or movies, I really enjoyed it. It had to be the alcohol, but I admit it will probably only attract more girls between the ages of 6 and 13, but it was a movie to pass the time. There is always a movie or a show you don't think you want, but for a laugh you enjoyed it.
