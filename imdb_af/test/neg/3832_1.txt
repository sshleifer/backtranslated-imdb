This movie was very disappointing, and for a few moments it didn't fly. More than anything, it was just flippin 'stupid. The music was freakin 'bad and the plot played like a BYU combo game? very predictable (avoid racket embarrassment, a late match of touchdowns, a short rally and a loss). In essence, the half-comic Will (the film's fetcher) and his believer confuse brother Danny (we just call him a democratic), treat Kirby (the movie's "Sweet Spirit"), the third member of their unlucky Mormon "son band" , like a crap until the man and dad figure of the movie (stage manager, Jill) has a conversation with Will and straightens him. Certainly, Will's personality changes 180 degrees and he is immediately the adult and self-confident leader of the group. It would be a nice, maybe funny, 10-minute road show gig, but the fact that the movie lasts 93 minutes really sucks life out of you when you look at it. My advice ?? take the money you normally spend to rent this show, or burn it in your fireplace or rinse it in the toilet? more entertainment with much less time dedication. If you want to see a better movie of the same genre, get Saints and Soldiers? Not a comedy, but an infinitely better performance (actually, Kirby has more funny things in Saints than he does in SOP).
