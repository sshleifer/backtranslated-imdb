This show is just another bad comedy that will probably be canceled after two seasons. It's not just that the jokes are sexist / racist / homophobic, they aren't funny or cliché. In the first episode, the Father said something according to the words, "I wish women did not go out and find employment and have the same rights as men blah blah". It really helps attitudes, huh? Then he made the fun of his son and said he was strange. Which parent says their child is strange? So overall this performance is boring, inexplicable, offencive, clichéd and mostly not fine. Yes American Dad's offencive. But it also makes you laugh and of course takes the micky. That's the difference.
