The film tells you to be conscious and conscientious. It also destroys any and all things, the Bible claims it is true. For people like me, the first episode was interesting and the second was disastrous. This is called "blasphemy," and that is, if you are a believer. It is sad to hear that many people think of it as a good successor to the Bible. However, the film shows many things and subjects that can be interpreted as a cinematic version of the "Revelation". Some of us think that such things should not be abused. One good thing about the movie is that it strongly encourages ethical awareness and makes you consider your actions twice. The director just seems to forget that some people are already just based on the fact that they believe and love as prescribed in the Bible. Why are you trying to change it unless you are the devil yourself?
