At least it is with this episode. Here we have a time traveler, the Professor of Gilligan's Island, no less, going back in time until 1865. What does one do - why, of course, Lincoln is saving! There are not many interesting variations arranged on this old theme. As another reviewer said, this episode is particularly careless and unsteady, with little to suggest that "the professor" is really back in the 1860s. Budget constraints are clear, and the direction is solid. John Wilkes Booth adds a spark, but it remains a very flat production. We often feel that we are on stage, waiting for something smart to happen. There is a small quarrel at the end, but I emphasize minor.
