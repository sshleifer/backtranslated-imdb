I know that this show liberated many women in the late 90s and early 2000s, but come on! You have a shutter, a buzz kill, and an over-analyst. This show really made women look. I can't analyze Carrie's analysis of every little thing on this show and it really killed me. Also, Charlotte's gossip about her non-existent prosperity, hurt my ears and Miranda's cynicism was a complete buzz kill. I mean, can't she just be happy? Samantha was the only cool one on the show and the only one worth watching. There was also a good episode when Nathan Lane was on the show, but it was the only one worth watching - the rest of them were almost the same. The humor was drier than a bucket of sand, and not very interesting plot line. All in all, not a very good show and I'm glad it's over.
