Talk about acting ... !!!! not only by Govinda, but also by Salman and Lara. The direction was terrible. For the first half hour you would want to turn off the movie because this movie is a real stinker (note my words. <br /> <br /> I love Govinda in some of his comedy roles such as Haseena Moon Jaayegi, Jodi No. 1, Akhiyon's Goli Maare and Jis Desh Mein Ganga Rehta Hai and does not compare with any of them, and Salman Khan should not have comedies! He sucks, he does not know how to do comedy. Comedy role he did was in Andaz Apna Apna, which was brilliant alongside Amir Khan. <br /> <br /> There was so much 'too foolishness of folly' in this movie that takes you out of the DVD and burn it so that no one else in your home ever sees it again.
