Idiots are camping and acting like idiots before they eventually die like idiots, yes Camp Blood (or if you want a terrible, weaker than bad pun that fits a bad movie as a bad movie, "Camp Bloody Terrible") , so bad it is actually pretty depressed to look. And it has all the ingredients to be a perfectly bad movie ... <br /> <br /> Awful acting check. Bad dissertation. Tacky effects-look no originality whatsoever double check. <br /> <br /> It doesn't even try and is made possible by every predicted clich√©. For example, the movie opens to some who have sex in the forest, so of course they are killed. <br /> <br /> One of the most disturbing things is that this movie has actually grown two successors, how and why the idea only hits. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this one.
