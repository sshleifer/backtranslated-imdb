I had missed part of this movie ... I asked myself who was it? And when did it happen? It seems to be jumping around, but I kept watching for the fear that I was missing something and it will be explained to me. I loved Lonesome Dove, but this movie doesn't make me feel at all. I loved all the actors, but what happened to the rest of the movie? It made me go "what"? at the beginning of each part. As far as the landscape - I thought it was good. It made me feel like I was browsing through a book and leaving pages out. The end also confused me a little, although I imagine the boy was waiting for his father and was meant to let you wonder if his father would eventually come to his son and be a father since his mother had left. I'd like to read the book just to see what I missed the movie. I don't expect this one to win awards.
