I was very disappointed with this movie. Ms Engels, who says she's a fan of the original movie, seemed to have taken a big piece of artistic work and turned it into a flattened "ho-hum" that you've already had a long baby production has. I tried to keep Meg Ryan's Mary Haines, but she was just boring. She didn't show anything about her husband's relationship. There was no emotional struggle, no deep hurt. In the original 1939 film, Norma Shearer's Mary Haines betrayed, shocked, vulnerable, confused and angry. The 2008 production was more about a false sister theme, (Actually my wife's words) and didn't let you tear The only performances worthy of being that we are of Debra Messing and Bette Midler. (I wanted more of Bette.) There was really no protagonist in this movie. The Sylvia Fowler character had too many subthemes on it. And Crystal Allen had no fire. The memory of the departmental marriage became warm with Annette Benning and Miss Mendez Luke. The pace was also slow. Of course, the 1939 version had to be updated, but it wasn't. The reason why the original version worked so well was that the characters had "man" problems. A topic on the go that is not outdated. The magic of the original movie was that the movie was over both sexes, never seen the men.
