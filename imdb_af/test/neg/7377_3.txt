This show was performed directly in the country with a wide variety of works. I first saw it in Provincetown production the first summer in P-town (2001). It was remarkable enough, banned in the overwhelming gay resort (the resulting codes have since been changed). I saw it later in the off-Broadway, long-term production in New York. Oddly, the production of the P township was much better than the New York one, fuller, better, more enthusiastic and funnier, but it was only in the 2001 show; Subsequent efforts to clone production ("Bare Naked Lads" in 2007) were definitely second-rate. This filmed production features a Los Angelos production cast, which is not the best, as suggested by other commentators. I'll find it somewhere between the leading 2001 P-town production and the third-class "Bare Naked Lads" P-town show of last summer.
