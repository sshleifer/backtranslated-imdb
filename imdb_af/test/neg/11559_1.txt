After watching this movie, I couldn't help seeing the parallels between it and another movie called America 3000. Both were very bad in the mid-1980s post-apocalypse disasters on celluloid. Clearly, false sets, woodworking, and stupid specimens appear in both films. The only difference between the two is that the main villain here (played by Angelika Jager) has a very heavy emphasis. Avoid this one unless you watch the MST3K version. Joel and the bots barely save this turkey.
