Think of a very low rent version of "Heathers," and you have "Pep Squad." It takes the movie in a nutshell. I have to give credit wherever credit is payable. The film has a good visual appeal. I like cinematography, I like the wild color schemes, I like the costume designs. But without good acting, a movie has no value loss. I'd rather see a movie with a small visual appeal, with good actors and sharp dialogue (ie "The Brothers McMullen" or any Edward Burns movie). The actors repeat their dialogue in monotone or shout out as if they were in a bad soap opera. That's why I'm not the mainstream actor. Let's look at it, most actors who are mainstream are mainly for a reason. If they are not "big" actors, they are at least competent. People bad Leo DiCaprio, but then was the last time you saw a movie where he started the dialogue as if reading it from the page? It's a pity, because the director seems to know him well when it comes to misses and scenes. At the same time, I can't quite praise Steve Balderson (the director). He wrote the script, which contained some terrible dialogue. He may also be slightly racist, as there is a black principal in the film, which is a highlight of African American stereotypes.
