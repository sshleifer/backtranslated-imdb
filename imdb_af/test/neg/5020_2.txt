First, I want to say that I leaned on the political scale liberal and I found the film offensive. I watched the whole doggone shame of a movie. This movie brings low to original ideas. Yes, it was original, so my 2 stars instead of 1. Are our writers great that they can only achieve it? Acting was terrible, and the characters were mostly untenable. The main character in the story had no good qualities at all. They made her in a bad guy and I didn't see it at all. Maybe I missed something, I don't know. He was the most earthly, relevant character in the movie. I didn't count any money for this garbage. I almost wish PETA will come to the rescue of this horrible, offensive movie and form a protest. Disgusting this is all I have to say!
