Why is it that virtual "x-rated video game" women can talk through their mouths, but virtual fighting champion Dante should use a combination of telepathy and dramatic facial expressions? I feel like they need to throw someone who looks more rogue (Michael Bermardo's big brown eyes do not exactly fear in the hearts of good.) Anyone except maybe throwing directors who consistently cast him as a villain or a fortunate "bad boy." OR they just had to use his voice (and move his mouth), and perhaps give him a costume that won't let him stick out like a sore thumb when walking in the street. (But of course this is the future and we have to accept that bad fashion becomes the norm.)
