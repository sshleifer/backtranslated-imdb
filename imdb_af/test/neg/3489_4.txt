The "plot" of this movie contains a few holes that you can drive through a massive truck, but I don't think it's always the highest priority in horror. Two elderly sisters in England keep their brother in the basement for over 30 years. Now he escaped and started with a deadly spree, with the emphasis on military armies close to him. "We just thought we were the best for him," they continue to repeat and ?? odd ?? All the army officers love these women and do not doubt their sincerity, even though 5 of them died. I do not know if the revelation near the end find tension? or boring! In a way, this movie reminds me of `Arsenic and Old Lace '. In the black comedy classics, two half-wise brothers and sisters also encourage their younger, younger brother, but they kill it. However, the old ladies in 'The Beast in the Cellar' are no less crazy. The "horror" in these early 70's is very amateurish and inexpensive, but there are some beautiful attempts to build the tension. Too many "old ladies" talk about the good old days, but this is rarely something you are looking for in a horror movie with such an attractive title. Flora Robson, recognized by classic movie buffs, plays one of the sisters. She pictured the Queen of England's legendary Errol Flynn swashbuckler movie, the Sea Hawk.
