I was from Australia and love the series. I didn't expect much from the American version of Kath and Kim, but I thought I'd see the first episode to see if it's really that bad. <br /> <br /> Well, what is there to say. It's nothing special. Selma Blair is OK as Kim and actually has some good lines, but Molly Shannon is not a good Kath. The good thing about Jane Turner's Kath is that when she speaks with all her funny accent (like when she says Yumor or Noice), it sounds like she's just the natural way she speaks, but if Shannon has the accent, she's clear that she is acting and trying to be the same as Turner. And the show misses Sharon or someone else to laugh at us, because the Kal and Craig characters in this version aren't really funny. So far, only the first episode has been sown and this is clearly not up to the standards of the Aussie version, but if it is a standalone television program with a different name, not being compared to the Aussie version, it may be considered a little better. But if nothing else can be done on a Sunday night (or Thursday night in America), you can do a lot of damage if you see it, or better than you use the Aussie version.
