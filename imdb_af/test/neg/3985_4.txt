I watched this movie shortly after watching Moonlight & Valentino with Elizabeth Perkins, Gwyneth Platrow, Whoopi Goldberg and Kathleen Turner. There are many similarities between the two films. They both have good roles and good acting. They both have stock characters from many different sisters, an offensive stepmother, a female friend / confidant, an emotionally unavailable father, a dead mother, and a surprise lover. Both films have the characters experiencing life-changing realizations and both films suffer from a kind of "love-winning" sentimentality. They both add a little titillation to Cameron Diaz in black lingerie and a partial snapshot of Gwyneth Paltrow's naked. <br /> <br /> Both films look as if the authors of the works on which the films are based did market research. and said, "Okay, there is a market for stories about relationships between women, so I'm going to write about two sisters with an offensive stepmother?" In other words, instead of the drama arising from the truth of the relationship, the relationship is invented to suit the dramatic situation. It looks like it's forced, the characters don't really look like, the relationships are incredible. <br /> <br /> The resolution of the tension between the characters is simplistic, with simple excuses that shed the years of aquarium, and makes everyone feel warm and vague forever afterwards. It's just not really. Romantic fantasy. <br /> <br /> The characters in In Her Shoes are a little more overwhelmed than Moonlight & Valentino, especially the stepmother part. Sydelle Feller is so angry that it is difficult to believe that the father would stay with her or even marry her. <br /> <br /> If you like Moonlight & Valentino, you'll probably be in Her Shoes as well. Enjoyable performances in both, in fact, bring the actors depth to their parts that go far beyond the confronted sentimentality of the scriptures.
