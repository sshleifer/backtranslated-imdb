"When a Killer Calls" is an unusual nasty slasher flick, with some very unpleasant and disturbing sequences. The decision has been made clear in trying to remake "When a Stranger Calls" to try to cash in almost by including - almost word for word - the calls from the movie. They seem very forced. <br /> <br /> In addition, the filmmaker commits the cardinal (all too common) sin to the heroine's friends being repulsive. So, for the start of the movie, we really love the babysitter (a good credible work by Rebekah Kochan), but then she's joined a standard teenage friend teenage friend and the mood is ruined. <br /> <br /> The movie kind of works, but it's probably much more unpleasant than you expected, so be warned beforehand.
