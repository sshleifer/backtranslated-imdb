The movie starts well, it's going to be a thing. About 1/3 in the movie goes downhill. Carrey begins obsessively about the number 23 because he sees it everywhere. Approximately? It's no reason to go nuts and start writing about your body and walls. <br /> <br /> The play his son plays is bad. From the start, as soon as he hears of his fathers obsession, he jumps on the train and is hysterical about it. Absolutely incredible. I hope I never see this kid in another movie again. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is a waste of time. Take another. Boring piece ... good. The number kills him? Give me a chance. I won't spoil the end for you, but let's just say it's disappointing. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
