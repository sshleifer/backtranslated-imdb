Her balanced appearance was completely inappropriate for the role. Her face remained too white, chopped her, cleans clothes, etc. (and well suited, especially her father's old hat and dress in the scene where Inman comes home) for any sense of accuracy. It would be one thing if the production allowed all the other actors to stay clean and perfect, but she was the only one who didn't get messy. There has never been a stain on her powdery cheek. Should we believe she was the only person in the Civil War with a bath and a mirror? She probably looks like the only one they used. Tweezers too; I mean, what's with the eyebrows? She looks absolutely mean! <br /> <br /> The love story was unreliable. She just went to the guy because someone told her that he said he thought she was cute. So is she going to tease him, then flirt with him several times, and suddenly it's a love on an equal footing with Odysseus and Penelope? Please. <br /> <br /> I needed to know better than expecting something better from the man we brought the English Patient. My response to that one was the same as Elaine's signal: "It sucked."
