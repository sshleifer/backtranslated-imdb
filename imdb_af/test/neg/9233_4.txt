I understand the aim of the director to tell stories that are not stories, but the way he tried to pass time (the few joggers, who first run with each other as if walking with a step (sic! ) To jog as the man alone ...) and to link the "adventures" of the characters (the final scene, with the girl climbing a mountain and seeing the big black man on another cliff and then the boat Seeing with her previous employer saying, "Oh, a boat!") was terrible. At the same time, I like the way he portrays the middle class, even in an excessive way. I think it's a lousy movie. If you want to see it, do it as a film school student, and try to see technical issues and issues. It will help a lot.
