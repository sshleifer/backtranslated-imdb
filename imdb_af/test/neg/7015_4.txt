In 1967 I saw an outstanding musical at the Winter Garden in New York City where Angela Lansbury stepped up as Mame. But did Hollywood give her the head? No Lucille Ball great as Lucy was given the role. She killed the movie. What a mistake There was no chemistry, because there was on stage Bea Arthur and Angela who were twosome when they sang. It's too bad, a producer does not place these two today
