It takes place in the 1920s Harlem. A black owned nightclub has to deal with gangsters and corrupt policemen. <br /> <br /> Terrible vanity project for Eddie Murphy. It tries to mix comedy and drama and fail at both. The comedy is simply not funny and the drama is boring and bad. You think a movie with three comedy legends - Eddie Murphy, Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor - will be great, but it's not. There is a ceaseless curse and the OPENING scene has a young boy who killed a man (it is considered OK). We also broke down the beautiful Della Reese to play a madam. One of the "comic" highlights has a long, indifferent and terrible evil battle between her and Murphy. A boring, offensive and stupid mess. Not the worst Murphy movie, but very close. A 1 all the way.
