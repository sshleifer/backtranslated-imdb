This "movie" will give me nightmares, I'll wake up in the sweat and shout: "I didn't make this movie, don't make me guilty!" I honestly think it would be more entertaining to watch a fat guy who looked basically in his mother's cellar for an hour or two than to watch this shit. I understand that money is stiff, but what is hell, they think, there was no thought, plot or effort in it. This movie needs a warning. "Please love God, don't afford the drama section to the local JC." On another note, it's the smallest characters I've ever seen, and I've seen movies with Hitler in them. So take my advice the next time you even think about renting this, just pop a few hundred Adivl and let sleep come.
