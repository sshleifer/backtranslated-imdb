The film begins in Latvia just after World War II. As a history teacher, I knew that multinational troops occupied much of Russia during this time. There was serious concern about the spread of Bolshevism and the troops were apparently there to protect their nations' interests. However, sometimes they flew missions or had armed conflicts with the Communist army, as the nations concerned wanted to see the so-called "Whites". However, the whites were deeply faxed - some want the return of a tsar, some want a republic and some want something in between. Due to these mixed goals and a lack of real links by foreign armies, the entire expedition was doomed and left the USSR for only a year or two. But what I didn't know was that German troops were also involved. It surprised me as they only lost the WWI and were not in the best shape to confirm such an expedition. <br /> <br /> It's the backdrop for the movie, but it's also about a pro-communist rich lady and her bad love for childhood among German troops. She repeatedly threw her at him, but in each case he withheld her. So she sublimates these desires through various matters. Although none of these sexes are graphic, this and the underlying reason why the man is not interested is a rather mature movie and one that I will not show to younger audiences. <br /> <br /> While the environment for This movie is interesting, the overall movie is as gray and lifeless as any I've seen. I do not recommend it unless you are an incredibly patient person or you are really in well-known German movies. I especially warn someone who is suffering from depression, as it will undoubtedly be worse. The simple fact is that there are so many better German movies waiting to be seen - such as MASTEL MARTHA, DAS BOOT, MOTHER COASTERS GOING TO THE SKY, WISH OF LOVE OR ALI, WE ARE THE SOUL.
