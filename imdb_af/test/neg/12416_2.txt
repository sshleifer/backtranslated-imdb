Probably the biggest thing about wild rebels that hurt the most is the hero. He wrote LOSER about him, but it didn't stop him from "getting the girl." Probably one of the world's worst racing drivers imaginable, he decides to quit chasing after crashing his car. Well, his new job is still going on, as a number of biker types choose to drive their off-road car because they commit crimes. There is nothing that really offends you, even the situation he is thrown at is pretty stupid. Eventually, at the lighthouse scene, you'll wish Rod was murdered with all the bikers. Get it: He was shot twice, once in the arm and once in the leg, and still runs a bit on the stairs. If only Jeeter had a better goal ... <br /> <br /> Avoid this one unless you watch the MST3K version.
