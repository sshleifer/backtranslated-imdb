1st watched 12/26/2008 - (Dir-Eugene Levy): Corny comedy murder secret with very little laugh. The film appears to be based on an earlier Italian film of the credits, but was rewritten by two fairly popular American romantic comedy writers. But this one by Charles Shyer & Nancy Meyers doesn't cut it compared to their other efforts. The story is about some downward Americans played by Richard Lewis and Sean Young. They bump into a lost dog and hope to make a fortune in reward money after seeing an advertisement in the newspaper for the return of the dachsund. When they try to give it back, they see a hand protruding from a garage door at the women's residence they believe is the rest of the woman's body to give them the money. They freak out and, instead of contacting the police and telling them the truth, make them runways from the scene that are expected to be set up for the murder. The other characters in the film were previously met here on a train and hung around in a Monte Carlo golf resort that did several things to be drawn into the story. The other role players include character actors John Candy, James Belushi, Cybill Shepherd, George Hamilton and others. After police found out about death, they started questioning the main characters and of course they had to work by throwing lies to find out what really happened. Neither of the earlier mentioned character players can bring this movie out of the mediocre state, despite a few funny moments mostly offered by the Belushi / Shepherd couple. It's not a terrible movie, it's just not that good. There are lots of average movies out there and it's just another for the pile. Try it, maybe you'll like it, you probably won't.
