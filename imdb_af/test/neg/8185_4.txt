At the opening of the San Francisco Silent Film Festival, I was very excited to see movies that are not well known historically and well. The guest speaker who opened this film has a sense of hype toward the dark, and how this movie is underestimated. The sci-fi part of the film was very interesting and fantastic for his time, but I do not know if it was the result of the fact that it was shown directly after the Brilliant 1928 "The Wind" or if it appears that Russian filmmakers are taking to which Russian novels are famous (hundreds of characters, entangled plots), but I know for sure that the dramatic parts, as in parts of the Earth, had absolutely no meaning, were boring and within twenty minutes I was lost. Maybe it was the play, but I was convinced why this movie was unknown and underestimated. It's boring, there's no plot or basic story and the play is terrible. This is certainly not a "Battleship Potemkin", but I will say that Russian films do not really make a good effort to see what life is like in Russia.
