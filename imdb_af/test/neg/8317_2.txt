I don't know what neighborhoods the people who wrote the rave reviews for this movie live on, but I'm glad I wasn't there if they didn't comment on the cartoon of this thing. Okay, we're learning to suspend our unbelief in movies like the "The Hard" series, but to see how little Jodie still has a street gang, with a Glock, as a NOVICE "All she needed , was a bald head and a torn T-shirt and she would be Bruce Willis. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Jodie has blinded the executive manufacturer to what a joke and waste of her money would be. Or she lived a kind of fantasy where she is the only blonde and everyone else is a dark brown or Hispanic. Even the dog is black. Little Blondie is the only good one and (except for a black police officer) everyone in town is a little minority to get her. Has your fear of your acting talent declined so far that you think the only way you can be noticed is to be the only bright spot (literally) on the camera in a dark, dark and gloomy environment / movie / cast? Apparently she thought she was in the wrong movie ... The Dark Knight. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous plot holes, furniture robinous, free-spirited ("Look girls! Now you can do that too!"). Spend time with your family instead of looking at this mud.
