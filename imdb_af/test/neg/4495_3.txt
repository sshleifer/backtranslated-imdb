I am ashamed of myself that I actually went to the theater to see this movie when it was first released. While I suspect that his spectacular portrayal of the Aristotle Onassis and Jackie Kennedy story was done well enough, it was a movie that never had to be made first; So, my low rating. <br /> <br /> The film chronicles the story of a rich Greek business guy, Theo Tomasis, who wins and wins the lovely young widow Liz Cassidy from a murdered US president. Sounds familiar? Yes, everything except the names. <br /> <br /> The cast should not be faulty. Anthony Quinn plays the Greek tycoon to perfection and at least it is a bit of comfort. He just read that Ari himself asked Quinn for the role. Jacqueline Bisset is, of course, beautiful and sophisticated in the (for all purposes) Jackie and James Franciscus all have the American appearance of the President. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen this movie since it came out and I don't want to see it again. I see a fair bit of bad language and some common crudeness. Otherwise, I think it's a sensational and so-called intimate look at the jet environment of the rich and famous, aboard their yachts, beaches, pools, etc. Yes, the paintings of the Greek islands are spectacular, the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> It's kind of good, I think. There is no end to TV movies about the Kennedys, which I confess to occasionally vote, and not to my credit. It's basically just another. Much better to allow Aristotle and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis to rest in peace.
