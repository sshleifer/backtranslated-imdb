Did the first travesty make money? This is another sequel (in the sense of another case) for which nobody has asked. But we did receive it anyway. The successor is like his predecessor, totally brain-dead. It's also nice disgusting (remember the dinner?) To think I felt almost sorry for Ritter, Yasbeck and Warden. Do they need the money so much?
