I can't believe this show was good. First, J.P. Manoux is a terrible job of filling in David Spade's and Pacha's voice, too deeply compared to John Goodman. The theme song is so annoying and the plots of the episodes are so stupid! The only good thing about this show is that Eartha Kitt and Patrick remain Warburton as the voices of Yzma and Kronk. This show is a waste of money and a waste of time. Half of the episodes are copied from the movie. In my opinion, the Emperor's New Groove was one of the best children's films in years, but they were completely destroyed by Kronk's New Groove and this show. You should watch such programs as Spongebob, Fair Oddparents, Danny Phantom, or Kim Possible, but not this show.
