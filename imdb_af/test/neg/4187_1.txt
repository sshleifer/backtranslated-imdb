Well, throw me sideways. I haven't seen a home movie that's so bad since the 13-second or half-CASTE. Someone has to take this man's Sony Handycam away! This movie proves that just because you can make a movie on your camcorder for $ 20 doesn't mean you have to do it. <br /> <br /> I remember one of the things Robert Rodriguez wrote in his book, "Rebel Without a Crew" was that when you don't make a budget drawing, you should use whatever assets you at your disposal. Rodriguez says you have to make an inventory of all the places and props you can beg, steal and borrow from your friends. Robert Rodriquez was friends with the mayor of a Mexico town, so the mayor shot him for free. What you got in EL MARIACHI was a movie that looks much more expensive than the actual budget. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the director of this movie has a copy of that book, and he took it to heart. In this case he was apparently friends with a man who owns a wheat field where they set up a haunted house every year. Looks like a pretty good place for a scary movie, but it's hard to keep a wheat field for 90 minutes interesting. Not a single installment of CHILDREN'S CHILDREN series spent more than a few minutes in the grain field. Hitchcock spent just about ten minutes in one in NORTH BY NORTHWEST. Take a tip, fella ... Mealfields don't make a sounding theater. It would have been good if the director had more friends with more locations because this thing is pretty boring after the first 15 minutes. This movie looks like it's about $ 30. (or whatever it costs to enter the maize field). <br /> <br /> Apparently he couldn't even find someone to act in his movie, so he threw him. Big mistake. Here's a thought, if you really want to make a movie, get an actor. So, as far as assets are concerned, the maze of maze seems to be the only thing the poor man had. Maybe he thought it was enough. In fact, I'm going to go out on a limb and say I know he thought it was enough because the movie, just before taking the prestigious honor of being the successor of DARK HARVEST, is simply called THE MAIZE: THE MOVIE. Maybe it's already planning the MAIZE: THE MUSIC OR even THE MAIZE: THE MINI SERIES. <br /> <br /> Our Jack-of-All-Trades (and yes, the Master of Nothing of those words is definitely not appropriate here) play a psychic father who can tell when bad things are going to happen. Think of the character of the DEATH, but not everywhere as a good actor like Christopher Walken or even Anthony Michael Hall. Psychic Dad has a premise that his two daughters, who are at the maize maze with mother, will be killed. He hurries to save them. From then on, the whole movie is spent watching Pyschic Dad walk around in a maize field, looking for his two daughters. He finds the two little ghosts of THE SHINING, and he helps solve the mystery of their murder. <br /> <br /> Shoot on a $ 200 Handycam. The director throws himself. Modified on iMovie. Improvised story. If it's not enough to keep you away from this maize-like wheat catastrophe, consider it a final warning ... The WHOLE MOVIE takes place in a wheat field, cook and ghouls. Here's Ghoulie Guru's hint on how to save money and still feel you've seen this movie. The next time you see a wheat field, the car stops. Take a flashlight and run in there for 90 minutes.
