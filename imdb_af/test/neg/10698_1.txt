Norris plays a Chicago police stumbling upon a devil's pupil? Who wants, well, to create Armegeddon. He eventually kills the creature by getting it, throwing a sturdy, golden 24-inch spike, not very sharp, about twenty feet, hard enough to penetrate the chest. Unlikely? So is the rest of the movie. Much of it consists of CN and its sidekick driving cars and talking nonsense. The Israeli (or Arab) child is apparently humanizing CN. OK. Do not work, make no sense, and promote the plot, so-called, not one piece. Also, no police officers are invited from the country to interview other police. It is ridiculous as a starting point. The whole thing is bad. Unfortunately, it's not as bad as being entertainingly bad or campy. Just plain bad. But - one can see how Norris tried to find his way to the successful Walker: Texas Ranger series.
