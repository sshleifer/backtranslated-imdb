If someone thinks it's a good sporting movie, it's probably the only sports movie they've ever seen. There are various aspects that a sports movie can take. Whether professional or college or high school. Examples of sports movies I liked (and I didn't see much) are Jim Thorpe: All Americans, All the Right Movements, Any Given Sunday, Eight Men, and Rocky, among others. All those movies had a little more than just regular sports. Whether it was a man's turnout and then a greatness, or a man who lost a dream through the actions of an offensive coach or the effect of money on professional sports. There is not much content in Hoosiers. It didn't even seem like the movie had a beginning or an end. There was no character development, everyone was forced on us. I can sum up this movie by quoting a very bad coach: "Go out and try to earn more points than the other man."
