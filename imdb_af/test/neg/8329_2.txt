You can't think of a movie about turbulent sisters who can eventually kill their employer, but you will be wrong. <br /> <br /> There is no plot. There is no character development. There is no redeeming visual beauty. <br /> <br /> This movie is a waste of time. Exploring how the relationship between the sisters develops is nil, their sexuality is nothing but grotesque, the class relationships are overlooked, and the employer is a stupid caricature. <br /> <br /> Ponderous silence and period clothes do not make equal depth of meaning.
