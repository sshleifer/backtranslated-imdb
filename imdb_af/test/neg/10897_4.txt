A young woman, Nicole Carrow (Jaimie Alexander), and her boyfriend, Jess (Joey Mendicino), become targets for a bad serial killer after stopping for a "break" at a quiet off-road exit. <br /> <What a terrifying chiller has been in more capable hands, is evident from a confusing, ill-considered mess under the sloppy direction of John Shiban (who also wrote the script). There is a great deal of juicy violence, a short nostalgia, and a lot of confidence in the movie, but the silly script leaves the viewer with so many unanswered questions that you can't help but feel disappointed. <br /> <br /> On the surface, the movie plays like a standard clich√©-ridden 'killer-on-the-loose' movie, but Shiban (an ex-author for the X files) throws in a subtle supernatural elements that indicate that his purpose was something else entirely: a ghost story, with the rest ceasing to act as a home to a fiery ghost to punish sinners. <br /> <br /> Reading on the movie, watching viewers' theories here on IMDb and watching the extras on the DVD, some platelets start a bit more sense (though, even with the benefit of extra information, there are still many questions that have not been answered). In my opinion, any film that requires this much exploration to understand itself (only partially) is not very good.
