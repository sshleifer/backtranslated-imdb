I remember remembering to watch this movie on TV for a few years. It was so bad, I can only remember the scenes that just killed me. The only plot summary I can give (without a pampering) is a high-school children's home photo. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler warning starts here ...) When the movie starts, a man's run is being rushed by the "Demon Cop" when the man is really being missed by a Halloween costume . A car appeared out of nowhere and hit the man running. It sends him over the top, and what does the driver do? Watches the man as he falls, comes back in his car and drives away. What kind of heartbreaking will it do? At least I would have asked if the guy was good. <br /> <br /> When a black man faced the Demon Cop straight, he later told reporters: "I didn't look closely at him." My sisters and I were almost dead with us then. <br /> <br /> Then there's a scene in a alley where this girl with an afro pull, a machine gun from her teenage Weeny small purse. It may not be FIT !! I can hardly remember screens. Maybe it's because they were so bad. <br /> <br /> Cops in the movie can't even jump a fence, and the play is like wood, it makes woodboard look like better actors. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie brings shame to Hollywood, much more than any other flop. You have to see it to believe its juicy cheesy plot, of which it has nothing, as far as I can say.
