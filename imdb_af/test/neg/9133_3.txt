Koyaanisqatsi's peace and beauty was a strong confirmation of the natural world. In Naqoyqatsi, we are assaulted by images of the synthetic, the competitive, the violent and the digital - the destructive constructs of our culture. <br /> <br /> Some freedoms are taken with the images, with posterization, disturbing, and very slow motion. The connections between the rows are impractical, if any. Naqoyqatsi is defined at the end of the film, a missed opportunity to put the images in context. <br /> <br /> The movie is hard to watch, the quality of the archive material is uneven and the most redeeming features are its theme and Philip Glass's hypnotic score.
