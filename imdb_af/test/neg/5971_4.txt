After watching Darwin's Nightmare, you should have the impression that Tanzania is a living hell. Its population is quasi-slaves that deliver the best fish to the well-fed Europeans while the fish bones are transmitted to the hungry population. In return for the fish, they get Western-made weapons, which are eagerly waiting for the unemployed population, because the fact that a soldier is the only source of income. <br /> <br /> So everything is dark with trade than the incarnation of evil and the source of all misery? Not quite. Fortunately, Darwin's Nightmare shows only the dark sides and quite the positive aspects of the game. In fact, the documentary tells virtually nothing of the economic and ecological importance that the victoria monarch has for the region. <br /> <br /> For Victoria Lake countries, victoria is the second to the third most important source of income. Wages in the fishing industry are well above average. Tanzania has prohibited large trawlers from ensuring the work of thousands of fishermen. The neighboring states have reached agreements to maintain sustainable level fishing. Cities at the lake benefit from the taxes the fishermen have to pay for every kilogram of fish caught and the taxes on the exports and profits of the factories. Furthermore, Tanzania has banned the local traditional fish, which continues to play an important role in feeding the local population. <br /> <br /> By ignoring these positive signs, the documentary reverses the badly needed Western consumers and investors and threatens the African situation. <br /> <br /> For further reading I can recommend two articles written by the German alternative wing newspaper on the subject: http://www.taz.de/pt/2006/09/02/a0013. 1 / text print http://www.taz.de/pt/2005/03/17/a0151.1/text
