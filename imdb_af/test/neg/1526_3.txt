A modern scream movie? Yep this is. <br /> <br /> The hippies, peaceniks and environmentalists gathered to give us a fear movie. I didn't recognize it when I watched it just 2 years ago, but it was a fear movie, but that's exactly what it is. <br /> <br /> There is no difference between this film and the films the Nazi made about us in ww2 and the same movies we made about them. It is pure propaganda and speaks only to those. who believe in aliens, 9/11 conspiracy, forged moon landings, peak oil and great environmental awareness. What I can say is this movie, push buttons, ask you questions and finally forget about it. It's a scary movie. When your scars come into your homes, shut down your doors and supplies for that core winter we all know, when forests evoke the Chinese in the nuclear war.
