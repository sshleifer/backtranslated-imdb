Yes, the movie is not an art, but the first time I watched it, I was 10 years old. My parents were out and I stayed home with my two brothers. It was May 1970 (I know this because I got a note about the cycle of horror movies that had one network.) This is one of the most lively memories I have with the guys. We finished everything in one bed and covered it on the head! Our very first horror movie! We've been talking about it and laughing over the years. It was horror movies. Today, horror movies are always the same. Or was it better if our kids enjoyed enjoying the plot and the role and dialogue? Most sure it was. But for me it's a good movie!
