I tried. Lord help me, how I tried. But there are just a few people who are almost incapable of creating quality. Brett Ratner, Uwe Boll, Britney Spears, and Asylum. To their credit "The 9/11 Commission Report" looks like an honest effort by the company to continue in a more sophisticated state of storytelling and film making. But for all purposes it comes down as another real movie in their gallery. At the opening, the indemnity informs audiences that all the names have changed, but the names of the terrorists remain relatively the same. A man named Mussaui tries to learn how to fly a plane. With a cold grimace that immediately makes someone uncomfortable, this "sheltered" agent can learn how to fly on a small computer. And you have to wonder, not how he could easily get into this program, but how these people didn't even ask questions; because this scene is so far-fetched in his presentation, and the actor playing this man is very top. And you can see that director Scott is trying to imitate Paul Greengrass with a bright granular photograph followed by a terribly dark and annoying tutorial that tries to take away from Greengrass's gung-ho guerrilla film techniques . <br /> <br /> You may feel that Scott mimics the Greengrass's realism technique, but it is left rather half-way. Meanwhile, the film of less "a Traffic" comes off, and more a discount on "Law & Order" in which we receive the indemnity notice that informs us that the names have changed, the logo has almost the logo and the nine twenty minutes of the actors pumped and discussed politics. <br /> None of them is ever as compelling as it is trying to be. And when the film seems to be trying to be an adult drama, Scott stands on his old failed sexual scene. Scott's new movie seems to be really considered a low budget "Munich", but it is not, and it is right for every opportunity to be entertaining. "The 9/11 Commission Report" falls flat, which is because it is limited in its efforts to imitate other films. <br /> <br /> While appreciating the ambition inherent in the camera, this new perspective of events that arise until 9/11 is flat and dull. Hard as it may be a low budget "Munich", it's just as entertaining as a normal Dolph Lundgren movie you want to find on Cinemax.
