The only interesting part of this movie was jazz and reggae New Orleans relapse. It is trying to be one of those movies that has two struggles that the heroine must overcome, one of the past and one of the present that convincingly transgresses her. The acting is bad and the direction is even worse. I'm not surprised that it went straight to the video. The end result of this film does not make anyone happy or convinced, including the actors themselves.
