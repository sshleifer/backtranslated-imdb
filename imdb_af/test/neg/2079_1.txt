This 2.5-hour dilapidated snow party seems to be one of the poorest excuses for an adjustment. which clearly has a budget that allows stunning location in Greece, the money could be better spent working out a coherent script with character development and motivation clearly set out; especially since the bill has already been put to the trouble of doing so. the depictions lacked passion and direction, and the viewer debated whether or not they had to worry about the demise of the protagonists. Which is another point - the main character of the original work, prosperity, is not mentioned in this version, despite the fact that most other characters' names are used. magic and magic are also remarkably absent from this particular piece. In fact, all aspects that made the stage version of 'the storm' full of wonder and intrigue sucked completely out of this complicated version about a self-absorbed, turbulent ass who can't figure out how to care about anything beyond the blur of his wealth and power. about everything, an infallible effort in the best and a brutal arm imitating the intended inspiration.
