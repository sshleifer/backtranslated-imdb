I will never return the three hours of life that this movie stole from me. <br /> <br /> The movie is basically a psychedelic drug trip disguised as a major creative process. I want to know what they were when this film was made. <br /> <br /> It is also the most historically-inaccurate film that exists; 2001 came and went without any of the events or predictions taking place. <br /> <br /> Characters are unattractive, design is simplistic and everything simply goes without any sense or logic. <br /> <br /> And the end is probably the worst: it's supposed to be thoughts, but the only thought in my mind is: "What is the F $ * K going on ?! " <br /> <br /> I want to say to anyone looking for serious entertainment purposes, avoid this movie at all costs and choose a sci-fi movie that does NOT catch their own @ $$.
