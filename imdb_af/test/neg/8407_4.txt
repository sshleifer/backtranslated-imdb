Um ... okay, it's very poor, if compared to the first movie, the so-so-critically acclaimed Rosemary's Baby. In fact, it's a pretty poor movie in general. Yes, there are some redeeming features, but I'll reach it later. <br /> <br /> Well, it's been a while since the last movie ... actually it was very eight years I believe. Rosemary is still trying to escape with her child and influences him in a good way, rather than abandoning him for the evil future that the covenant (or "tribe", referred to below) has explained to him. When she runs down with him and comes to an empty bus, she comes up and pulls her child with a hooker. The hooker calls him to grow old, where Satan tries to take possession of him because he has his evil heritage in every way. <br /> <br /> Of course things are not as planned, and then there is the end that I would be seriously ashamed of not seeing it, as it heard there was a sequel to "Rosemary's Baby" ! Well, when I was about 11, I saw the masterpiece Rosemary's Baby and then read the book order. Thinking this movie was an adaptation of it, I found this movie and got it. Am I right? Well, somehow, yes ... I'm a real fan of this "franchise" and can say I've seen the successor, and I have an idea of ​​what happens after the events in the first movie ( talking about both This film and the "Son of Rosemary", Ira Levin's own book order, has not yet been adapted to film. <br /> <br /> Rut Gordon, who played Minnie in the first movie, becomes a A few times in this movie, but why-oh-why is the covenant so different? The knife Rosemary has fallen into the first movie that stays out of the ground, but Minnie pulled it out! I said earlier. They are now walking around in slips that sing "Hail Satan ... Hail Adrian ... Hail Satan ... Hail Adrian ..." and so on and so on. The Gothic building is now like " a house with two floors on a lawn in the middle of nowhere, it looks like a little pretty suburb home or something! And the child himself is pretty normal, with his eyes he won't be "cat-like" down he gets angry and kills someone or something in vain. <br /> <br /> As far as the play goes, it's pretty poor on all parts, except for Stephen McHattie, who plays a very big Adrian. Pattie Duke Astin, who replaces Mia Farrow as Rosemary, must have one of the chosen WORST performances to ever be captured on film! It's so bad it's almost not even funny ... when she shouts "OH MY GOD!" and cry like the fifteenth time in the movie, you're just like, "Okay, it's no longer funny," and then by the time she's gone and the movie is only twenty minutes, you're like THANK YOU , I DO NOT HAVE TO HEAR IT: "OH MY GOD" ONLY LONGER! SHEESH! In the end, this movie has many, many, * many * few redeeming qualities, enough to get it at least four stars. But if you consider it a serious sequel to the first movie, it's almost non-existent.
