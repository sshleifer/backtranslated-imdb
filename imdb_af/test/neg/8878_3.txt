It's not really a complicated story. It's not a mystery or a plot that you should spend time watching because you missed an intrinsic part of the dialogue. To claim a movie must be seen several times because you can get it. A large number of films may apply, but not one of them. That type of movie has substance and it is so far away that it is easy to miss an important part of the dialogue, or a subtle nuance to sketch details that you may have overlooked. Goya's Ghosts does not apply. The main mistake in this movie is an absence of detail. It jumps from one character to the next, and never gives enough substance to any set of scenes to make the involvement of those watching. As a result, you do not associate with any of the characters. You don't get to the point you care about. Whether the main actor is gone, just as the movie looks like it is going to deliver itself, or their actions are contemptuous and you are not inclined at all. Goya's refusal to go very far to help Ines is a good example. His refusal to commit himself further reflects the overall tone of his part. The only characters you may feel short of is Ines, when she is interrogated and then tortured. After her rape by Lorenzo, any focus on her character is pretty much gone. The only other in-depth engagement comes from the best scenes in the movie that are around Lorenzo's invitation to dinner with Ines's family and her fathers trying to force Lorenzo to sign a false confession and get his daughter back. Then, just as things start to develop again, they are away from the movie. I read a lot of the comments here about how the movie did not know what it wanted to be, etc. I found it basically managed not to be much of something. From Lorenzo's return and the accidental viewing of Ines's daughter by Goya, everything had nothing but confrontation. Without much of a storyline, no attempt was made to really investigate the turbulent times in which they lived. The essence of who Goya was, apart from his actions or lack thereof, proved that he was more self-centered than anything else. As far as his art is concerned, the film had the intention of exploring some of the paintings he did, but another opportunity to investigate the responses to this work rather than the work itself. To sum up, the film had no coherence, it lacked the content of history to dive into the historical environment it covered, and finally you felt like you had just seen, was' a series of halted attempts to engage the viewer by switching from one thing to the next without properly entering the viewer in any of them. You can't look like this a few times and expect it to improve with added exam. There just isn't enough time to waste time. It's not a case that you miss something, it'll just be more proof that the ingredients needed to make this movie just aren't there. Like best movie ever made? It's not even the best movie I've ever seen today.
