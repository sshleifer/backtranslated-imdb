I loved Heavenly Beings and made it a point to catch it when it goes on. <br /> <br /> So imagine my joy when I found Love and Suicide while following NetFlix. I saw the heavenly beings, an easy choice, at the top of my rope. <br /> <br /> I watched it, made me comfortable and waited. What I thought was a little preview of a stoned high school student's prank film project (I laughed once or twice aloud and thought "just dropping the beam from straight to video"). Terribly acting, amateur direction, poor dialogue. I usually enjoy low budget films, there is something tangible and real to them, because they can't afford the superficial things to divert from the meat. The play, the direction, the plot, the story. I will compare it to a student who has not studied for an examination, will know he will fail and put his head on the desk and sleep. <br /> <br /> In someone else's hands, the plot will have serious potential. <br /> <br /> Don't expect the wizard or even a cult classroom such as Divine's Polyester or Showgirls, at least there you learn to expect bad acting. <br /> <br /> Love & Suicide has gone from bad, to worse, to the WORST movie I've ever seen.
