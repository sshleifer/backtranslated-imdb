this movie has no plot, no good acting, honestly it has nothing, the same songs play over and over awfully acting and if you can actually sit there and enjoy the whole thing, there is something wrong with you. I wish I could give this 0 out of 10, but I can't, it must be a generous one! ice-t is not even a good rapper and even worse at acting, every piece of the movie is junk, I have this movie on DVD without knowing what it was for the price of Â£ 1.99 and thought I picked up a bargain, I looked at the IMDb rating and didn't take it into consideration, but after looking at it, I noticed that the DVD I bought was a total waste of time, money and electricity. If you have this movie, there are two things you can do, sell to someone who doesn't know or burns it!
