In all honesty I haven't seen this movie for many years, but the few times I like to make parts of it, keep in mind, like anyone who saw it. I saw it as a child at a YMCA Halloween party in the early sixties, and it scared hell out of our children in a fun way. I remember feeling really worried about the unknown thing in the maze. I can't give up, except to say it's surprising to say the least. I vaguely remember the whole audience of young boys who left a huge, terrifying treasure, followed by laughter when the terrible secret was revealed. The end is seen by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentional funny highlights of a movie in film history, yet it is strange to move in a way. You have to see it yourself, it's not easy these days. I don't know if it's available on the home video or not, but it will still make a great Halloween feature for kids and adults.
