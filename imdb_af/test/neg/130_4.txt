From watching the trailer, the movie looks pretty interesting. The production of the movie is also pretty good - they seem to have a good budget and don't look like a cheap movie. The play ranges from good (Joe Morton and Professor Simon) to OK (Kelly Overton and Eva) too bad (James Haven as Don). <br /> <br /> The actual content and plot of the movie is poor. The movie begins as if it becomes interesting and ends with a poorly executed, disappointingly boring, twist. Watch the first 10 minutes and the last 5 minutes of the movie would have made this movie good, but everything in between makes it an absolutely boring movie to watch. It's as if they've made a short film, trying to force it to last longer than an hour by filling the drug with an hour of filler. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is a good hour and half of your life. Otherwise, stay away from this extremely boring movie.
