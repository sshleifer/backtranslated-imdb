Of 15 people I also borrowed this movie. NO One completed it. It was so terrible. ???????? Not good ... Just terrible. She sat in the chair the whole movie. She's in a closet. The chair she is sitting in is nice. I can't think of anything more to say. But 10 lines of text. To print it. My friend Nick thinks it's a good movie. "Because he can give it to his friends," and don't worry about those who called him back, he passed it as a gag movie for 10 years. How did I get it. to get my friends to complete this extremity's terribly horrible piece of shit ... No adventure ... no one could finish it. Please send copies of Guantanamo Bay Cuba, make great Xmas gift.
