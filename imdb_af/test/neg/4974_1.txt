I started watching it, because I was looking for a nice 'background' comedy for me on Sunday morning. Then I noticed it was going to be a road movie and I decided to see it. <br /> <br /> The first 15 minutes were terrible, but I wanted to give it a chance because I never judged a movie. without looking at it properly. Then things started to improve. It looked like a good road movie about friendship. But then the movie started to get terribly predictable clich√© twists and when the movie was over, you felt you were wasting your time. Did it have anything to say? Why did they even make a movie like this? And I didn't expect a modern Citizen Kane, but I still have several ideas on how to improve this movie. <br /> <br /> So take my advice; leave it alone and watch a real road movie. There are a lot of them. I will not look at the directors of that movie by posting their names on this review. <br /> <br /> 1/10
