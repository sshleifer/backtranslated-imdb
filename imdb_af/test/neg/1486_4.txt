There was some good buildup of tension throughout. The cinematography was surprisingly good considering such a minimal budget. We sometimes witness spelling of good acting, but it is quickly uncovered by some rather cute lines. Understandably, there won't be much of an intellectual conversation that sits on the trees while a crocodile steals you. Silence would have been gold here. There could have been a greater strain on tension than a little wiped out. I sat in the cupboard for fear of my brother. "Something tells me there's a slight difference to getting a brother's beating than eating a mighty 15ft. . You decide. Throughout the movie I don't seem to have a connection, or for the matter, sympathy for the characters, maybe that's because they don't develop one in the movie, the character it is. There are sometimes frightening crowds when the crocodile falls on the characters, which are overshadowed by some dubious scenes. In one case, we should be afraid of an ear floating in the water, but later we sit next to a stripped, cowardly look and worry about a broken finger. A definite roller coaster of a movie when it comes to logic.
