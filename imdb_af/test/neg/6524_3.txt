To love the Andersen fairy tails as a kid and recently see some interesting documentaries on this weird, brilliant writer, I was eager to see this made TV. Unfortunately, the experience was nothing more than a disappointment that left me in anger and confusion. First of all, the story / script is filled with inaccuracies and straight fantasies, creating almost a whole new story while suddenly abusing Andersen's fairy tales, presumably selling the crap to suckers like me. Secondly, pretty-boy actor (really ... ever seen a photo of the real Andersen?) Kieran Brew manages Hans Christian as a mental retarded image rather than the brilliant but very disturbed character he was indeed. Although annoying and irritating like Andersen, Brew misses the necessary charisma to create any feelings of compassion so ever. Thirdly. The love story between Andersen and the fictional Jetta (which is actually Henriette, the wife of Edvard Collin) ... Why? This man lived such an interesting life, it should be enough as a base for a big movie! <br /> <br /> I can continue to be a very long list, but feel the safest way to just recommend everyone to spend your time and money on something else instead.
