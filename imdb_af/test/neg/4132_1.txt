It currently plays on SHOWTIME, but will be released as a movie called THREE or released for 2006. Mess-ups include a supposed naked body coming out of the waves at its bottom. You can have fun finding the others. It was a decent stranded, hungry, cold, crazy person video, but it's about it. And of course, what would be a movie without sex. The lady has a nice body and the men are beautiful, but the story is the same as being carried away or a savage is loose type with a little blood. Wonder if the movie studios know they made a big booboo and have already released this exhibition and now release it as THREE. Billy Zane had to wear an upper hairpiece or shave his head completely. Juan Di Pace is great and there are some good sex scenes. There is a voodoo woman who loves the character Di Pace playing and in real life her name is also Di Pace. Not aware of any connection, but probably related or married.
