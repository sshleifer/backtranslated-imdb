Clearly, director, writers and everyone else knows nothing about their own religion or the people who practice it. This film is endlessly flawed and generally a full croquet. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a scene where the rabbi enters the woman's ritual bath while a naked woman is bathing, putting his hand on the head of a woman there and blessing her. This is a complete mockery of the laws. In this scene, some of the laws that have been broken, including: modesty, a rabbi will never enter a ritual bathhouse while there is a wife. <br /> <br /> Improper contact, a rabbi will never put his hand on a woman's head, and not to mention that this is not the way to bless. <br /> <br /> The woman from the ritual bath immerses a naked woman by pushing her head under water, the law of ritual bath requires the entire body to make direct contact with the bath water; this means that no one should be in contact with the person who is baying, certainly not under pressure! <br /> <br /> There was more in that scene alone, like dunking 13 times (where does the concept come from?) Not to mention the rest of the movie was a total scam. It is scary that ignorance shows up!
