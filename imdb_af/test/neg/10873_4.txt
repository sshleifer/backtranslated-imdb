Director / lead Larry Bishop tried to go far too hard with Hell Ride. The movie is edgy, witty, challenging, weird, biting everything, apparently in a Quentin Tarantino / Rob Zombie style. But it's not edgy. The references seem forced. The dialogue tries smart and fails. The humor is never funny. Nice try to set a fiery tone, but we need to care about the characters or the story, as it can pass remotely. <br /> <br /> What you have left is cool Harleys and pretty girls who are tired of a lot of fun. , old and out form "bad boys" that look like an attempt to make a modernized Sergio Leone western. If this movie can make new generations interested in the films of the 60's and 70's, kudos for that. But on its own it is rather boring and irrelevant. I believe there is a place for style over fabric. But this movie is not.
