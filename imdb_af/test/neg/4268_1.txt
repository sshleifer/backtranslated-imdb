Keep away from this one. The worst thing is the terrible story. There is apparently an intention to convey a subtle spiritual / love / friendship message, but it is so pathetic without any substance that you cannot help but cringe. In addition, the majority of screen time is far below the standard story of thieves, criminals and our hero who deals with some strange time travel artifacts. I know you are asking for trouble when dealing with time, but the story is more full of holes than usual. You also have: cheap sets, bad acting and some of the worst music arrangements in the history of the moving picture, overwhelming, inexpensive, sudden and unfounded. All I can say is "Man live! This movie is bad!"
