I think most people will agree with me if I say that the movie Alien set the bar for the atmosphere very well. I saw quite a few movies at the bar, but no one ever crossed Alien's ominous tunnels and darkened halls. The Cave is a movie that is trying very hard to repair the bar. I believe the trailer even said it was as scary as Alien hadn't even been through the movie, even though I felt the least scared or excited about it. <br /> <br /> Now we've got the ball. of negativity roles, I can just explain why the cave's main hook (the atmosphere if you don't pay attention) wastes in my time. I will now say that most of the sets were beautiful and beautiful, but what we hear and what we know tends to ruin what we see. The music for one is terrible. We also get corny rock music or over-haunted house music. Well, it pushes it slightly but I couldn't bear it. The many underwater screens were bad enough (it's a well-known fact that underwater screens are always boring). I didn't need rock music in my ears as they just swung through a cave. It actually produced a lot of unintentional layers, which was then strengthened by the next water power scene. <br /> <br /> Anyway, as I have already mentioned, it was not just the music that killed the atmosphere. The creatures hiding under the darkness are supposed to evoke horrors. I'm supposed to be worried that they will appear and just a look at them is supposed to make my blood cool. The Cave wisely takes a page out of the alien textbook by not displaying the whole thing for a long time, and it just takes a look, but it just doesn't work because the creatures are so lame. I think it would be rude to spoil the details, but they are basically the strangers with wings. <br /> <br /> I think you get the point right now. Atmosphere spoiled. Yet I know many people who will see another movie if it is exciting. I want to say it over the cave, but I will lie. This movie is slow to get the action and once we get there, we are kind of wondering when the thing will eventually call it daily. We've seen it better, with the exception of some neat scenes (the man placed on stalactites, the eel and the rapids), so you really don't get any excitement to watch people from uninspired alien knockoffs in endless tunnels don't walk. . <br /> <br /> No, the pain doesn't end there. We also need to consider the characters and acting. Well, I can't remember a single line of dialogue other than "running!" And the only character's name I can remember is Jack, but it's just because it is placed almost every other line near the end of the movie. Perhaps the actors were capable, but the writing did not allow them to do anything else, then ran and argued. They had almost no background and when someone died, they simply pulled it off. It's pretty sad when you think the CGI is the best performance in the movie. <br /> <br /> Talk about CGI; There are many of them, most of which are terrible. I recommend them to use costumes (at least I think they were fit), but nothing really touches the environment, and so the effect seems to be that most effects eventually look nice. <br /> <br /> So I highly recommend turning The cave is bad and has very little for it. If the movie was a movie for the Slide Channel movie, or a low budget directly after video release, I might have more love for it, but this movie was a theatrical release. With more humor and talent it might be a scary movie, but as it stands, this movie is as scary as it goes in the basement and it's not very good. <br /> <br /> My review of Frider Waves: //friderwaves.com/index.php?page=cave
