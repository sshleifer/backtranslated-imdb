Man stops making perfect movies. The original was a big movie that was over with battles, sex and one of the coolest characters the screen knew in the 90s. The story is credible as if you were in the outside of the south you would know. But here comes this piece of rubbish Roadhouse 2 Last Call. Let's just hope they are serious about the title and never make another Roadhouse again. It does not have the charm of the characters of the original, nor is the story really credible. The story is more of a Steven Segal-type action, even though Roadhouse 2 is a B-movie, still don't click it, as some B-movie action still sells the movie, no matter how cheesy it is no. The only reason to rent, not buy this movie, is that we finally find out that one question remains from the original Roadhouse. Patrick Swayze's character Dalton, is Dalton his first name or surname? Well, I'll save you the $ 4.00 rental. Dalton is his first name as a Dalton Tanner. NEVER MAKE ANOTHER PADHOUSE !!!!!!!!!!!
