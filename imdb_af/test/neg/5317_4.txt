Blindly stupid of former talented John Hughes, who will soon make a movie with the seed of 'Look Who's Talking' when his stars are younger. He regained the 'Home Alone' formula to produce this idiotic comedy, in which a baby made his way to Chicago, while rude kidnappers Joe Mantegna, Joe Pantoliano and Brian Haley tried to catch him along the road that endured very difficult sleep . If Mantegna and Pantoliano can't get a laugh somewhere in your movie, you're in trouble, but the laziness of the movie is best in the scenes where people don't see a baby crawling on the pavement. Full nonsense.
