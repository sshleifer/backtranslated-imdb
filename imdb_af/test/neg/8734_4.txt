Although Embryo could be a potentially thought-provoking study of bioethics, it turns into a stereotypical Frankenstein parable, which spent the monotonous lesson read by the eternal royal lesson that there were a few kingdoms. Man was not meant to enter or study. <br /> <br /> Scientific Rock Hudson is experimenting with ways to prevent miscarriage babies from dying. After success with a dog, he immediately jumps to people who violate medical ethics and any sense of credibility - with the equally unrealistic help of a hospital administrator. His experiment works well, with some particularly unpleasant side effects. <br /> <br /> Although Barbara Carrera is pretty well in her role, and some of the animal training is spectacular, the movie is going to be fantastic. Although a message from the prologue insurers ensures that it represents contemporary technology, the scientific work is portrayed, even for the twenty-first century, far-fetched, let alone in the mid-1970s. Furthermore, the scene where Carrera can find a drug for the side effects of bio-engineering is simply by typing a question into a computer, ridiculous.
