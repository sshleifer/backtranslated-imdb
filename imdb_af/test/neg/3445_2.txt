OK watch, this view is the worst show on nick @ night. I love so many shows on nick @ night and I love them. When this show came to Nick @ Night, I was so bad. It's such a boring performance and it's wheat-like. From all the times I watched, I found one episode somewhat funny. This show has some of the most indecent and stupid jokes ever. This view is bad. Give props to Princes of Bel Air and George Lopez. This performance is boring and not the least clever. This show had to be canceled earlier. I don't think it deserves to be played on nick @ night with some great classic shows. This show is lacking in smartness, good jokes and style.
