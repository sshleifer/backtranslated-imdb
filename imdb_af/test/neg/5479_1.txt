It could be the best game ever !! But the game makers just crawled after 3 murders and the end! This is a combination of Prince of Persia, Hitman, GTA and Age Of Empires II (Saladin). <br /> <br /> Yes, these four games mentioned above are considered one of the greatest games ever made. br /> <br /> You combine the four and you get this game !! It has all the good aspects of the four games such as acrobatic skills, assassins, open world and HISTORY !! For the first 3 killings you feel, this game is the biggest! But after the third, things seem so repeated that you just hope the GAME comes to an end. <br /> <br /> I played it on a computer and the PC version is terrible with glitches and the silly side missions are pointless. <br /> <br /> My advice to everyone. This is a great game, but get it OR for the XBOX360 or PS3. Don't get it for the computer. <br /> <br /> Finally, this game came from the creators of Prince of Persia. The producer is surely warm, but the game is not hot and it is no better than the four games mentioned above !!
