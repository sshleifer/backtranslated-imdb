As a fan of Henriksen (I kept him in the "Millennium" series) and of course Lorenzo "Renegade" Lamas, I at least expected something from this movie. Unfortunately, the plot is predictable, the acting is bad and the computer graphs used for most stunts don't work out. Sometimes they even seem to have caught a few shots of Microsoft Flight Simulator. <br /> <br /> The movies are also sucking. Unnecessary funky camera work in the beginning only detracts (from the cute dialogue) and gives the movie a cheap, made-for-video look. It works in hip hop movies and Jet Li movies, but it doesn't look like this movie anymore. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie 10 years ago. I was then 11.
