The acting was terrible. The special effects, while exceptional, dominated the movie. The writing was pathetic, and the dialogue was incredible. And the foolish little love story between Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck was out of place. <br /> <br /> But the worst offense of Armageddon was the total lack of scientific reality. "The asteroid is the size of Texas," said Billy Bob Thornton. There is 800 m wide! No one in NASA even sees the asteroid destroyed until an afternoon meteorite series in New York? Suuuuure. NASA hires a drill to join the astronauts and practice them in a week? Yes, right. Someone brings a sidearm on the Space Shuttle with them? Yes, it is realistic. And Bruce Willis blows up the asteroid with three seconds to save. How disney-esque! <br /> <br /> How bad was this movie? I rooted for the asteroid!
