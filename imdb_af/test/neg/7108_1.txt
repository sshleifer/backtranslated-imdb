My arm Tank Girl, they ignored everything well about you. Why does it have so little to do with the comics as possible? I would have had a movie that followed the plot, or at least the characters right. <br /> <br /> WHY WAS TANK GIRL American? She is Austrailian, dammit! And she also doesn't live in a post-apocalyptic war zone, she lives in the outback with Booga as a wilderness. She does it because she wants to live that way, not because she has to do it, because Malcolm Mc Dowell plays the git. And why does she look at the children? The only kids in the comics are chased by her, it is terrible that they have made her into a lame mother figure. <br /> <br /> And my poor Jet Girl and Sub Girl! In the comics, Jet is a sarcastic wisecracker and Sub-girl is ... another sarcastic wisecracker with a strange sense of humor. In the movie, Jet is this little thing and Sub is this middle-aged hag. And Booga doesn't look at anything or do anything as he intended. Although perhaps hot roo / human love for the US cash register was too much? The humor was also so lame. What happened to all the things about the Smiths and that brilliant snake they used all the time? What kind of line is "Will it last long? I don't want to miss Baywatch." Even programs for small children can get better material.
