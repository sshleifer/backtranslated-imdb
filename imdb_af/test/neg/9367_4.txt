I awarded this listing 4 stars. They are all for the screenplay, which is slaughtered in places beyond recognition. What could possibly be said? They took one of the most beautiful plays written in the last century and robbed it of his heart, humor and humanity. I really don't estimate the actors, who are probably doing their best with unashamed direction and incomplete characters (because the very complete characters of the stage version cut out their insides and insights). I do a lot of debt to the director, which seems to be finding ways to undermine the writing. There are so many awkward pauses, awkwardly rearranged moments and awkward re-imagined line readings in this TV movie at times, I've ever forgotten to love the play. I am not one of those people who think genius plays are automatically inferior to film (rather the opposite), but this particular genius game is incredibly well-served by this outing. Now I hope they will make a * real * movie of this play. The world deserves it.
