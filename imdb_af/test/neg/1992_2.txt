Coarse and cynical, "The hospital" represents the nadir of Paddy Chayefsky's special mark of celebrating the status quo disguised as satire. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the handy director Arthur Hiller, this ridiculous writing becomes visually ugly, a poor paced presentation that deserves it. <br /> <br /> Only a great performance by George C. Scott in the kind of communities he was born to play keeps "the hospital" a complete disaster. <br /> <br /> Ironically, though Scott's performance, viewers are a disservice. His magnetism keeps them watching when they can turn off the video recorder more profitably, clearing the cupboards, staring at the clouds, or seeing "Baywatch". <br /> <br /> Surely, anyone who is emotionally invested in The setup _ modern medicine seems to get lost - will feel through the uncomfortable payout, where Chayefsky reveals that The System Works is just fine, so stop your Carping. <br /> <br /> While the first half of this movie provides some entertaining black comedy, it seems to be a red herring. But before it becomes clear, Chayefsky gives Scott some good lines as his middle-aged, middle-class, white male. <br /> <br /> Bitter, alcoholic, impotent, Scott says. Herbert Bock alienated those who knew him best, and he had the gall to alienate them. Of course, in Chayefsky's worldview, Bock makes a hippie-chick magnet half of his age. <br /> <br /> Playing a set of adjectives, the long-haired, long-legged, braless and almost-breast-less Princess Rigg struggles in the part of the girl. The British Rigg is overlooked as a southwestern free spirit, but any other actress will also struggle. As the rest of a good roll has disappeared, Rigg can't overcome a script that's not interested in any character except Bock or any banality philosophy. <br /> <br /> For fans of George C. Scott, it's another star turn and worth watching. For black comedy fans, turn it off after the first 45 minutes. For anyone else, don't bother.
