This movie had to be called "The Eyes of Alexander", and they had to complete the Bogart concept completely. The film started with a light-hearted approach to Bogart's legacy and a few comical moments with his operation-oriented face, but after the first 15-30 minutes it is a more serious thriller, where two palm grooves are sapphires, apparently as eyes in a marble. chapter of Alexander the Great, to him, and seen by him, just before his death. So the jewels are of great value not only because of their quality and size, but also because of the tie to the greatest conqueror the world has ever known. Being an expert at Alexander qualifies me to say that it is completely and completely a fiction, but it does make a good movie anyway. So the movie blows on some early folly and stumbles with all sorts of Alexander play on both the foreground and background (which I really like), ending with a dated shark attack (you can't go to a movie ' 79 'don't go 80 without some sharks threatening the public. There is a hunt called Euridice (Alexander's father's young wife), a man named Alexander, Philip, Cleitus, (it's about 5 years since I saw the movie, so I can't remember all the details not), Olympias, some street names, and many others. It was nice to watch the movie just to capture all the background details that the director (of course an Alexanderphile himself) collects. When everything is said and done, the eyes are detected and the camera on them on a bed rolls the credits. Kind of neatly ending. What would have been more fun would be if they had gone the Indiana Jones road and had an action adventure. There were many, very real artefacts that could be used to make it more interesting, or the hand-annotated (by Aristotle) ​​version of the Iliad that Alexander kept his whole life with him, even on his many journeys across Asia ( of incalculable value if found today). Olivia Hussey (my favorite b-movie actress) has been killed too early and had to be the main actress, not the Mum's and the Poppa's. If you can find this movie, it might be worthwhile to find out for the historical stuff, and to see Olivia Hussey early in a very funny deadly humor, but further I will give it something more entertaining. <Br /> Kind regards, Nick
