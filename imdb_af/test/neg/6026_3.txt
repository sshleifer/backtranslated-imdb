I found the trailers better than the movie. They did their job and made me interested to watch UNKNOWN. Interest rates dropped early. A simple premise that lies in the scenery. Five men wake up in a chemical warehouse without knowing why they are there; let alone know how in hell they came there. Confusion and paranoia thus bring fear and distrust. The men learn that an abductor is on his way with plans to kill his hostages. Now the men size each other to try to discern whether everyone is a victim and who can actually be one of the kidnappers. The movie includes: Jim Caviezel, Greg Kinnear, Joe Pantoliano, Bridget Moynahan, Barry Peppper, David Selby and Adam Rodriguez.
