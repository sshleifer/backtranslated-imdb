Strange, often effective hippie zombie movie, starring the memorable husband / wife team Alan and Anya Ornsby, is not as bad as most in his genre, but is still high on the cheese factor. Includes several cellar-cellar zombies, an outrageous camping dialogue, a drama show performance by Alan Ormsby, several gay / kinky tomb robbers, and a slender soundtrack. Woman Anya sits on a thing that is so strange, one has to wonder if she really acted. There are many worst photos of this kind during the era (look for an Al Adamson movie), but it's no night of the living dead. Director / Author "Benjamin" Clark, is really Bob Clark, who developed the purely "Porky's" early 80's teen exploitation disasters. He only acted after one inexplicable movie ("A Christmas Story") to return to his terrible ways with "Baby Geniuses". Weirdo Alan Ormsby later wrote the kinky Nastasia Kinski / Malcolm McDowell version of "Cat People". Moocow says, watch this hippy horror movie out for fun, zombie frolics, and campy dialogue: = 8)
