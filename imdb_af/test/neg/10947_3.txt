The movie was halfway before I could figure out what was going on. It is a dog's breakfast of a movie about four family thanksgiving meals. The cliches and stereotypes tumble over each other. If it's more than ten hours later --- well, it looks like ten hours --- you're riddling about what it's about. I don't want to watch a movie over the dining table. There are plenty of them in my own family. The turkeys look pretty good. The rest gave me digestion.
