I read the 28 most recent comments by several people about this movie and was surprised that no one mentioned the fact that the first victim, who appeared on the bed with the "missing eyelids" as the camera came up and away from her face, blinks! Yes, blink! I recorded it as it came on HBO this past weekend and when I saw it, I actually literally had to repeat it, focusing on one eye at a time to make sure I didn't see things! Of course, after that it was difficult to take the movie seriously, although there were some interesting and intense scenes with Julian Sands. Very disappointed and giving it a 4 mostly due to the fact that the 1st victim cuts in one of the last frames while the camera deviates from the body / face. Sorry.
