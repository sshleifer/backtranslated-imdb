Every time I watch Larry King Live, he rolls out most softball questions for his guests. He rarely gets useful information because he doesn't ask the difficult questions. It comes from her start on the radio. <br /> <br /> King settled on the radio and basically did not change one of the formats for television, except that his talk head is visible. He becomes like a puppy to his guests. And the only time he really gets useful information from them is that they voluntarily or a caller to the show is actually asking a difficult question. Larry is a beautiful, paternal type of interviewer. This means that he should not have an excellent time display on a major news network if you are considering CNN. I'm not doing because of CNN's history. <br /> <br /> Copy (ie Cable) New network has been started by Ted Turner as an alternative to network news by broadcasting news 24/7. Once it started, the only TV competition was NBC, ABC, & CBS. As a result, CNN copied the format of their competition and achieved proper ratings. <br /> <br /> It worked well for CNN until they got competitive networks that were innovative and provided better / newer news coverage. In response to the warming of competition, CNN went into denial and its competitors who ate their lunch and ratings, as CNN wanted to change. It didn't work very long and their ratings started plummeting. <br /> <br /> Now try copyforming the news network again by reviewing itself by copying the main news network format. Unfortunately, this display represents a large part of the problem. It is 21 years old and shows it's very old. <br /> <br /> Sorry to say, King must be moved from the First Time or completely deleted.
