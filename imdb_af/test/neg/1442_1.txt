Everyone I spoke to said that this movie would be good and very strange, so I thought I'd rent it. Halfway through the movie I thought to myself what the arrow was going on and what's the point of this movie. This movie from start to finish is so bad that even the sick parts of the movie don't even bother me. I mean, how are they going to next volcano 2? The return of lava. I mean this movie is so stupid, the characters are so poorly developed, and Eva Englund makes the movie worse. I think he might also be changed into Freddy Kruegur and Ghost people. I was really root for the bad guy to win, that's how bad it was. I mean look at the father is a policeman he doesn't really give up because his daughter is one of the most moments in her life. I mean if my daughter is treated so much that I will do everything in my power to keep the man behind jail. It also seems obvious that Dee Snyders's character would be bad again. It is one of the worst movies of all time with Volcano and 8mm. Don't distract your time, you won't enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Degree If there was no degree on this site, I would choose it, that's how bad this movie is!
