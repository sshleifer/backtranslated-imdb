I ran into Blockbuster to watch some good old fashion action movies. So I watched the action section until this movie caught my attention because the cover had a big fat letter SANDRA BULLOCK. An action movie with Sandra Bullock in it and it's rated R! YAY! Although I will admit I prefer her in a comedy, but if it's something like 'Speed', then I'm sold. Unfortunately Sandra is not in this movie, her role is minor: "Panicky kidnapped girl" (She is fifth on the actress for Jeebus shake!) It was apparently her first movie role (and after watching this movie , I thought so much) Sandra is the only living person in this movie. Everyone may also be a zombie in a B-Horror Flick. This movie tricked me and said Sandra was the lead. . . I fell to Biff from 'Back to the Future' when Marty shouted: "What is it ...!" God, I wish I had looked at it instead. <br /> <br /> Sandra is the only shiny side of this movie, every time she's on the camera, it looks like she is picking up shock tracks and "CLEAR!" Shout. to go to these movies, but it's flat, no matter how hard she tries. More about Sandra later. . . <br /> <br /> The movie is boring. Many Doves. Think of the dull moment in your life and then think for 110 minutes for this moment. For me this is this movie. This movie somehow makes Gun Gun and Bullet time boring boring, so boring that Elephant Tranquilizers get shamed. And this movie's idea of ​​Bullet Time is a close-up of a slow-motion AK that mocks you like the caps that spit it out every second of your life, because it moves slowly. And I knew I was watching a bad movie, because I quickly found myself through "THE ACTION!" The storyline? . . . was there a plot? Music? . . . Even at 80's muck standards is bad, but at least it's the one thing that kept me awake. Acting? Sandra Bullock was good and good. . . ummm. . . move on. Is it good because it's R? No, unless R stands for Ridicules snooze fix. <br /> <br /> And it's really 80s Cliché when a movie with an overhead view of a city (guitar leak or power ball) is stuck and finishes with a gun fight in a grim factory completed with steel roads and different pipes. Both these films meet. At least this movie determines what era it was not needed as Sandra's hair shouted "1980s". "And a movie really gets hammered when you look at an assassin, kill a nerd in the bathroom and put his body in a box, which you respond to saying:" This is probably the most action that weak juice "Another Hammy moment is at the beginning when some secret agents attack a crowd of people and believe this movie thinks people are jumping in the air and falling to the ground when they die. All the scene needed , the Mario death, or perhaps Contra sound effects, but Nintendo may have sued. <br /> <br /> And this is sad when the main action heroes of this movie break down other BETTER movie icons. hero found in a boxing ring ('Rocky' someone?), with a learning dora (not 'Indiana Jones') with an ominous spotlight behind him (Terminator 2nd in front of T-1000) What is really VERY sad is that people on Youtube or Dailymotion can make better quality videos (with a crappy webcam no less) than this movie, I'm serious, Most Rant videos recorded with bad sound and blurry photo are more entertaining than this movie. I can't even call this movie, because it's a very good name. Give me sad memories of this cruel and unusual punishment (a terrible violation of human rights!) The only shining spot in this dark, abysmal abyss is that Sandra's career began to thank. to this movie. But oh Sandra. . . Why did you have to be such a nightmare? The payroll is worth better. The DVD also tells you a little bit about Sandra as an extra, seeing how she is the only one of this movie that is ultimately a home name. What explains why this movie uses her name as bait for unsuspecting movie buffs, Crafty little critter. <br /> <br /> I don't have much experience with bad movies, but I know BAD when I see it. I could jump back from 'Mazes and Monsters' with a good old Bruce Willis Comedy camp. But not even Bruce could get me to this movie. I have another Ed Wood or Uwe Boll to see, but I think I'm now office for them. Because I can't even make a movie worse. . . "GAG". . . "Hangmen. . .
