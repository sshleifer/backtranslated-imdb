While the David Lynch version of Dune choppy, uncomfortable and unfaithful to the novel, it is visually well designed and well behaved. The best one can say about the Sci Fi channel's attempt to make Dune into a miniature is that it is ambitious. Actually, it's almost the only positive praise one can offer. The actors (with few exceptions) seem to recite their lines with the least emotion possible, and the least appropriate accent. The costumes seem to have been designed by someone with a large residue of Mylar fabric on hand and an unhealthy love for blown headgear. <br /> <br /> In part, this miniseries suffers from the shadow of Lynch's already known attempt. It does, however, take elements of Lynch's film that was not in the novel and copy them almost wholesales (ie the Guild Steersman's navigation series), and only encourage negative comparison with Lynch's movie. An attempt. D for virtually everything else.
