Blake Edwards tried very hard to change Julie Andrews' image into this movie. He tried to make her sexy, not realizing she was already. I think they were both a little annoyed that July was not chosen to film her Camelot Broadway success and was transferred because it wasn't sexy enough. Unfortunately, they chose this vehicle to tackle this conviction. It gets to the point where it's almost funny, as Rock Hudson, who we all know, was gay now, kissing July through the movie every 2 minutes. It now seems they are not just trying to make you believe that July was a femme fatal, but that Rock was straight. Unfortunately, they have absolutely no chemistry together and the infinite tonic begins to break out. The other mistake they made with this photo was not to know what kind of movie they made. It's almost three separate movies. There is the drama of July as the German spy tries to get military secrets from Rock. There is an air war movie with lots of footage from WWI vintage planes that are overwhelmed and there are stupid attempts at humor that Blake Edwards seems to think he should insert into each of his photos whether it is appropriate or not. In this case, it wasn't. The only true redeeming feature in this movie is the always lovely Lady Julie and hears her singing in that crystal-clear bell-like soprano. Of course, if you love her, you may have overlooked the weaknesses of this movie. You can always tell that it was a hell better than sitting by STAR!
