I do not remember too much about this movie, except that there was a clear free destruction of luminaires (lamps). Almost every battle scene has included the unnecessary and improper destruction of usable light fittings, even though it is exhibited with cheesy, 70s-style, cylindrical shades to keep the story going. On one occasion, a domestic destruction takes place in a domestic field scene between the brothers in both the living and dining areas of their mother's home, with institutions in both rooms being pulled out. Yet, the most malicious destruction finds moments later in a booklet's office and closes it, but is not limited to, overthrowing a game with a ceramic horse head base that is subsequently disintegrated, and the severe drop of a Cylindrical shadow as an old falls back into it during another fist fight. Later the lamp is also expelled when the man is shot, causing further damage to the plastic-covered shade. <br /> <br /> While this movie encourages a particularly wasted attitude towards lamps, it should be borne in mind that lamps, regardless of their inexpensive construction or gauche, top heavy appearance, are still valuable to the relief they provide . But if you ever feel the need to hit a lamp, I would highly recommend this movie.
