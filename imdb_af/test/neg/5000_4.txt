Zombie movies are hot, I love them. Can't get enough. Why I buy a movie of this caliber, go without explanation, I just love zombies. Surprised, it's really not much of a zombie movie; low budget that I can handle, is annoyed, just annoy me. <br /> <br /> A group of horror movie cliches hold a warehouse / lab / who-know to escape a fire brigade. Panic, scream, low light and (eventually) zombies occur. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for the filmmakers because it's clear they really thought they'd bring something good. a serious, terrifying horror movie. It's not far from it, it's a boring mess of wood performances, cheesy FX, poor lighting, excessive dialogue and editing. Things will go wrong if they take a good 10+ minutes because the characters will ever sit down and start to figure out what's going on. It gets worse when another 20 minutes pass and they are still trying to figure out what's going on. All of this is littered with a non-acting and bad dialogue. <br /> <br /> Finally, someone gets aside (not by a zombie) and hopes just flashing a touch before the characters re-storm emotion that each generates about how much it sucks. I also guys, me too. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, zombies are in the mix, but no one looks more caring. I think there was a little blood and gore thrown in, but I was too busy praying for the credits to look after. And when the screen eventually turned black, I was even more impressed by the pointless 'Cube'-inspired end. <br /> <br /> I will give credit to try very hard, even if it fails. It and the punk chick were very hot when it was completely used. <br /> <br /> Can't really recommend it to anyone, except for movie students looking for 'no-no' pointers. <br /> <br /> 10/04
