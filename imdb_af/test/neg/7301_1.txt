I knew I didn't want to see a quality movie when this title was included in a 'B-degree video night' at a friend's place. Despite the warnings, I was still amazed at how bad this movie was. It was fortunate that many of us were sharing the pain. The film is trying to tell the story of a dark future, of which Hawk (a Mad Max-type character) cut down to a distressed girl. In fact, the plot is a thin hidden excuse for the producers to promote their own philosophies on life (look at the end credits and the "these people aren't really", a fair absence for a real laugh). The film often does not have direction and fails to develop its characters to any extent. What's worse is editing this movie. The movie repeats screens (often 10 to 20 seconds long) to 4 or 5 times in a row. I think this was an attempt to imitate things like Jean Claude Van-Damme's battle order, but if so, it completely fails. The movie is likely to be about 1/3 of its length if we are not forced to look at the main character, its head moving half a dozen before the sun of the sun. Yes, that's all happening in that repeated scene. I give this movie my 'worst movie I've ever seen'. I doubt it will be implemented soon.
