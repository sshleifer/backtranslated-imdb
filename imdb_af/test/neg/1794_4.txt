The heart of darkness was terrible. The novel was hard enough to understand, but if a production company decided to release a movie freely from it, it would all just stick. Not only did those in charge decide to change certain characters and eliminate others, but the acting was terrible and the overall impression I got from the movie was that it was a complete dud. I watched the movie hoping to understand the novel a little better, but it just gave me and my fellow-classmates a complete glimpse. I think the movie is a waste of time, and I was disappointed to see Tim Roth in such a disappointing movie, especially if he has a wonderful movie like Pulp Fiction and Resivior Dogs. Same with the very cool John Malkovich.
