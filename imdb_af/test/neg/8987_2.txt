First, let me say that I don't know who Nora Roberts is. So the book could have been great, but the movie is not. <br /> <br /> I spent all my life in the Peidmont area of ​​NC. I have never heard southern accent as ridiculous as that in this movie. I lived in two small NC towns and Charlotte and Raleigh. On occasion you will meet people with a strong southern accent, but I have never met a town where everyone is talking like a bad imitation of Gone with the Wind. <br /> <br /> In response to Gore_Won of the atheist community. Your comment reveals more about your distorted psyche than it does about the movie. If we stretch our imagination and pretend that there is something realistic in this movie - which is not there - then the truth is that bad people like Tory's father will always find justification for their actions. The author chose religion as an opponent of Tory's supernatural abilities. Your assumption that the true character of the Gospels is a man to beat his daughter is about the most perverse and wrong information I've ever heard. Before you start spitting on the Gospels, first read them. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. The dialogue is flat most of the time, unnatural and incredible. In particular, many of the things Kade said to Tory are inappropriate and do not match the mood, context or way they are said. <br /> <br /> The "exciting turn" at the end of the movie is lame, predictable, and has no credibility. Some also claim that Jacqueline Bisset does a wonderful job in this movie, but the truth is that the bitter mother character is also an old, predictable, one-dimensional character. Is it Bisset's fault? I do not know. <br /> <br /> If you have a choice between watching this movie and a twenty year old Muppet Show repeat, I recommend the Muppet Show.
