Although it is definitely a well-crafted movie piece, it is thoroughly without any entertainment value whatsoever. <br /> <br /> If you're already depressed, this movie will send you over the edge. <br /> <br /> If you feel a bit depressed, this movie will be just one thing in your life to feel bitter. You will feel that it's just your luck to have chosen to watch a movie that is a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you might make it harmless (I don't have VAT), safe in the knowledge that your life is so much better than Jim's. Then you can think that you have deceived yourself, and it is in a much worse situation than you realized earlier. You may feel a little irritated at Jim to bring it to your attention. Maybe you want to blow him up with a wet fish. <br /> <br /> The sad truth is, much like I wanted this movie ... I hated it. Rather, it took a long, unfortunate road on the road to oblivion and then suddenly, without any reason, looked back at itself and then stopped. <br /> <br /> Jim doesn't have an epiphany, at least not one on the screen. Jim has a miserable life and an unfortunate set of options. He discovers nothing that one can meet and fails to make any significant progress on his journey of self-discovery. <br /> <br /> Of course, nobody can write a happy ending to this movie alive. Like others said, this is not a Hollywood story, it is angry and it really is. It's made well. Life is sometimes a struggle. If someone knows "the answer", they do well to shout it from the roofs. Yet I feel cheated because this movie pretends to say something. You feel it's going to say something, if you only suffer a little more, it will have something to say. It will stop you and think. <br /> <br /> That doesn't mean. <br /> <br /> Again, I suggest it is a well-crafted film. And so it can be of value to a film student with a love for eg. lighting techniques of using color palettes. <br /> <br /> For the rest of us it's totally wrong.
