This inexpensive, granular-filmed Italian movie is about some heirs of a shepherd in the Italian countryside who stay home to stay, and then find themselves murdered by spirits of people murdered in that house. <br /> <br /> I wasn't impressed by this. It wasn't really scary, mostly like a cheap Italian movie. A girlfriend, her two cousins ​​and a cousin's girlfriend, go to this big house for some reason (I couldn't figure out why) and stay there, clean and look at the place. Characters come in and out of the movie, and it's pretty boring at points, and most deaths are very rushed. The girl is hit by a car when she flies home after having had a dream, and the scene is pretty good, but then things are getting slow again, to a confusing end when the male cousins ​​come in a strange way murdered, And this strange guy (I couldn't figure out who he was during the movie, or maybe I just remember) go after this one girl and attack her until this other girl eventually kills him. Hate to end, but oh well. The female cousin decides to stay at home and watch it, and years later she shows her plays. The end. You don't really miss anything and anyway, you probably won't find it anywhere, so happy you.
