One of York Entertainment's latest (disaster) movies, "El Chupacabra", is excellent for killing its viewer after blowing on it for two hours. This movie seems to be filmed with an extra video camera that is normally used for birthday parties. The only reason I could say it wasn't, was because of some scenes where the cameraman's shadow is in the frame. <br /> <br /> Just about every aspect of the theater is plagued by this movie, and I'm sure it has put the film industry back on track for another ten years. The actors are delaying borders, often pausing while waiting for the screen to change. The actor playing Navarro not only hits his dialogue, but strikes the Swiss Cheese Plot line with a crooked and curly look on his face. Other actors break the front wall and overall show the acting skill of a 12-year-old child doing a science project in his backyard. <br /> <br /> My friends and I are deliberately looking for the worst possible movies, and this one has us more than we have negotiated. The humorous parts are unsuitable and the rest are hit with horrible clich√©s and plotgate. As one friend so humbled, this movie is the aborted fetus of the industry. I would highly recommend this movie for people like me who deliberately look for these movies, but for everyone else, beware!
