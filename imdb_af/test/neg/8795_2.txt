<br /> <br /> To make this short and sweet: I hope this movie will not be regarded as the original work for the "mercy-asian" of American filmmaking. the acting was subordinate, based on stereotypes, excited voices and exaggerated eyebrows to convey his message. chris chan park does not delve very deeply into any of its characters, allowing them to remain caricature of angry / frustrated / distant / inexorable Asians. These depictions do not make characters mysteriously appealing; it makes them confusing and unsympathetic. I like to think that our Asians are more complex than that. <br /> <br /> I got out of the movie unaware. unhappy that these characters had a lifelong blood brother, such as linking to the length they did to help their mate. unhappy that the main character had something outside a superficial attraction for his girlfriend. dissatisfied that hard-working immigrant parents will not pay for their son's college education. unhappy that all the characters were even needed, namely: Janet, who was sleeping in the back of the car and quickly forgotten. <br /> <br /> The story line, which I actually thought of potential, was not allowed to come into its own for two reasons: 1) flat characters for whom I had no sympathy / affinity; 2) The plot is overshadowed by meaningless non-sequitur scenes, such as the seance / donut shop sequence with Amy Hill that was simply ridiculous and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> I praise park for its efforts because I'm sure it has done a lot of hard work to produce the movie, and I'll even give it the benefit of the doubt. time as a director / screenwriter, but I sincerely hope he will go next time. Just because the film is one of the first of its kind on the Korean American experience, doesn't automatically mean good.
