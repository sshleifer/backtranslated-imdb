I can see what this film was about to do. Unfortunately, it never completes the transaction. The "reality crime" aspect works well and the shots are all first time. In fact, many of the screens are incredibly exciting in a moody way. Especially the silver of the detective talking to the bastard, the scene of the detectives goes through the rubbish, and the father binds flies. On occasion, the few scenes fall into too much dialogue. Instead of showing the viewer, the author treats it too much like a book. But the real problem lies in the editing. The story doesn't flow. It fails to make a whole out of the sum of the parts. Eventually you are confused about what actually happens. Those who want to keep this kind of detective movie like to go along and join the riddle at the same time. With such poor editing it is difficult or not nearly impossible to do so.
