This movie doesn't know what it wants: does it make fun of stock movies in general? Is it satirical? Is it supposed to be a black comedy? It's really one of the worst movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Lori Petty is annoying. There I said what everyone thinks. It's bad enough that she is such a terrible actress (Route 666, Bates Motel), but she doesn't even qualify as a mediocre b-movie actress. Her screaming voice, strange ways and poor comic timing dot this movie from start to finish until you just want to put your head in a rock and end the pain. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs. You'll be glad you did.
