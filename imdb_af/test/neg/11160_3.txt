Arnold fans will be delighted, fans of mindless action will be amazed, and Catholics will only be holler. <br /> <br /> Illogically written by Andrew W. Marlowe and ham-rescued by Peter Hyams, * End Days * gets the terminator from his opened hospital gown (Arnold Schwarzenegger's return to the big screen after his heart surgery), while he blows things in Mysterious ways and blows a Biblical verse, which makes the Catholics shine a little more. <br /> <br /> It is 1999 and the deadly all over the world live in the tensions of their computers that Fritz goes and lose their downloaded pores. Even if the technological stench of Y2K has the New York streets, ex-cop, the alcoholic security guard, Jericho Cane (Schwarzenegger, with the perfuncture "dead-woman and child" stories for the loose gun effect), the theological waters to save the 20-year-old virgin Christine (Robin Tunney) from being defined as ?? waiting for it ?? The Bride of Satan. Dun dah daaaarrrh! Foolishness occurs. <br /> <br /> For every anti-hero there is his anti-Christ. Gabriel Byrne is the devil here? and he is out to party as it was in 1999, on a mission to satisfy Christine with the Anti-Christ between 11 pm and 12 midnight, December 31, 1999? Ironically, in the hour that all pornography will be lost? through which the end of the days will result. Being able to read thoughts, perform hallucinations and use unlimited magic, Satan does not come to speed up the fertilization process by appearing months in advance and rejecting Christine as a teenage model and then the panty-raid easily at the set time. Instead, he appeared on December 28 like a Keyser Soze Terminator and wondered why she didn't welcome him with open thighs? (See commentary above: stupidity.) Here is a movie where nothing makes sense, the moment it is pronounced, let alone after considering its truth or mythology. A priest (Rod Steiger) tells Jericho that '666' is really '999' upside down with a '1' for it. So, wait - * Prince * is the Antichrist? <br /> <br /> Satan Soze strives for Jericho and Christine (J and C, does it?) In the village, do nothing in any way they would actually put down. In one scene, Satan creates Jericho's wife and child to ask him to reveal where he hid Christine. But if he can see so deeply in Jericho's mind that he is busy with his family with enough nuances to inspire nostalgia, why can't he see where Jericho did not hide 10 minutes ago? <br /> <br /> Satan can speak an assassination without a tongue, but he can't unjam that assassin a semi-automatic weapon. And when Jericho shoots Satan at an empty range, Satan is polite enough to open his shirt to close the wounds. Jericho won't worry unnecessarily about Satan's health - not sanitary to open bullet wounds? Almost, instead of owning yourself in Jericho to come close to Christine and rape her, Satan uses so much unnecessary energy on side projects (cruising the tongue-motorized man and blowing up Jericho's partner (Kevin Pollak) and then rescuing him, and then he blew up again, insulting Jericho ridiculously when he could sniff himself into the minds of thinking) that we wonder if a more effective killer / lover shouldn't be on the matter ?? says, Antonio Banderas. <br /> <br /> What I find most valuable about * End Days * is Arnold's brave efforts at The Method: "grief" means scorching his eyes and blowing nothing out of a strange accent; 'depressed' means lifting a bottle on his lips and not blowing anything in a strange accent; "scared to death" means enlarging his eyes and blowing nothing out of a strange accent. There is definitely a pattern here if we can just decipher it. <br /> <br /> In the end, the devil is not sent by the holy men who pray Catholics for delivering apocalypse like this, but from the atheist Jericho. While the crooked men of a rude god despise "faith" and do nothing in their cells, do nothing of Satan who actually walks between them, become the Prince of Darkness by a nullifidian with a big gun and a stranger dispute accent. What clearly says something the Catholics are blindly refusing to hear: that even if the devil existed, those who are unconditionally and unreasonably afraid of not believing in his downfall, let alone that to do. Furthermore, they cannot really defeat him, because only by his contradictory polarity their existence of God is viable. <br /> <br /> For it is written in the Book of Revelation: "And the Prince of Darkness will descend on the earth without a solid game plan and get a virgin on a date that will not be meaningful until the Gregorian calendar of the 1500s assumes the day numbers that will bring it in line with the equinoxes and the Anno Domine syntax that will annoy meaningful people for millennia, at which time Christians will have forgotten the actual date of birth of Christ and the pagan Saturnal festival in its place, and the Prince will do a revolution by means of tight pants and ambiguous lesbian members, I can believe that people are drained of blood and crucified, and the alcoholic built like a Mr. Universe; I can believe that a giant, supernatural monster cannot kill a man who is armed only with a strange accent; I can even believe that the devil must predict a Hokey Thirteenth-Century Celtic Druid ritual - but what not can believe, is the 20-year-old virgin in New York City in 1999. <br /> <br /> Especially around Prince ...
