Those born to Vietnamese mothers and GI fathers often also did not find. The beautiful country is the story of such a child, Binh, rejected by his rural town and struggling to find his American father. The movie starts with a green and wild land, but descends into a nasty sweatiness and boredom. The considerable talents of Tim Roth and Temuera Morrison are wasted in useless and badly-minded roles aboard the rustle plane carried by Binh, and die brother over the sea, with the appearance of stormy sea shots. New York City offers slave labor and clich√© characters. While this is very uneven, the big curiosity of this movie is the final segment. Nick Nolte gets top bill under the cast. I suggested jokes that he would probably just be in the final scene and not far from the truth. As the trip brings Binh to Texas and his father, the movie takes a quiet and tough simplicity. A wealthy society breaks these two men together into a family of father and son. The ninety minutes of the garbage we just watched is rewarded by a deep and subtle performance by Nolte, as they interact slowly. The credits rolled and I was surprised to see the names of Badlands Edward Pressman's executive producer and West Texas native Terrence Malick.
