Sure, you get some boobies, but if that's all you're looking for in a movie, you'll get more miles from youtube. I just paid a dollar out of redbox because I saw Val Kilmer's name. Bad move. Plot didn't thicken, dialogue was undecided, characters were undeveloped. Someone said cinematography was good, but didn't expect too much. This movie became very slow and ended without mercy. Blacklist. I wondered a lot about the movie whether an event or color scheme of things was symbolic. I never actually came back to find out, because nothing was ever explained. No turning. It also left many questions because, as it turned out, I had no desire to hear. One of the worst movies I've ever seen.
