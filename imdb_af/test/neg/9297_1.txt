Comedy? What's so funny about looking at an ugly deadly alcoholic who attends 6 sessions (by the time I turned it off) from anonymous alcoholics? Stand off with a grievous scramble of grunts and murmurs and drunken slurps. Updated with a lashings of Hollywood's religious "God will save you" redemption movement. Another adjudicator called the "Sassy Dialogue" of Tea Leone. Well, I watched this boring movie almost an hour, and I haven't seen it badly - in fact, my 80-year-old grandmother has more amusing comebacks than Tea's character in this mess. Tea is more rocky and shows less emotion than Keanu. In fact, one wonders if she is not addicted to anything. Maybe botox is her face so woody? Save yourself from being murdered with boredom from this movie.
