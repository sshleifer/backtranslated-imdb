It was a crappy, miserably acted movie based on sublimated male fantasies. A shame that is based in Texas, an otherwise excellent state. I would not recommend this movie to anyone and wish it never entered my consciousness because I am so irritated that I have wasted my brain cells, even the slightest attention.
