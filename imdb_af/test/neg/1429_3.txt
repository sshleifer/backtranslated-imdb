Strangeland (1998) D: John Pieplow. Kevin Gage, Elizabeth Pena, Brett Harrelson, Robert Englund, Tucker Smallwood, Amy Smart, Dee Snider (Twisted Sister), Amal Rhoe. Disturbing scenes of torture 'emphasize' this dark, disgusting film about a sadistic psychopath that attracts teenagers into his torture chamber via the internet. Snider (from the 80-year-old rock group Twisted Sister) plays the bad psychopath, which is a bad "twist" (on the Hannibal Lecter). Pena is wasted as one of the victims' mothers. Harrelson (brother of Woody) delivers one of the worst headlines I've ever seen in a movie, and Rhoe proves why it's her only screen credit with an equally pathetic performance. The heavy metal soundtrack is eventually numb, the torture scenes are very graphic and coarse, and the end is struggling. RATING: 3 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence and torture, strong language and sexual situations.
