Having already seen the original "Jack Frost", I never thought Jack Frost 2 would be as absurd as it was. Boy was I wrong! Then again, A-PIX movies have a way of showing incredibly bad stuff, even worse than you would expect. I believe this is the first A-PIX successor, and this could be an indication of what to expect in the future: more A-PIX sequels. <br /> <br /> It's hard to see without laughing, especially in the later parts of the movie in which Jack Frost's progeny (which are actually snowballs with eyes, arms, mouth and sharp teeth) start killing people with the typical comic dialogue and stupid voices to go with it. They are both shown as dolls (with a stick under them to move them) and as computer animation, which I have to say, looks very cheesy. The computer animation surprised me, as the first "Jack Frost" didn't have such effects. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend that you see the original "Jack Frost" before you see this one (both would prefer to watch a group of friends) to get their full enjoyment, and because it would make more sense ('sense' a relative term). <br /> <br /> Only when there is "Uncle Sam 2" ...
