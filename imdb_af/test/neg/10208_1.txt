I worked on this cruelty ten years ago. Luckily for me, no one knows this because I didn't make the final cut. And when I saw the movie in the theaters, I was happy! My agents were promptly driven by the (apparently first-time) filmmakers, rewriting the script daily and changing their arrangements with the agencies on a regular basis. They later told me that, once back in California (we shot in Atlanta), these "professionals" had 4 1/2 hours of footage! Even edited up to 90 minutes, it's at least twice as long as it should be. I found Hulk Hogan surprisingly charming, but otherwise - what a waste of movie!
