Super Troopers were a direct classic. Club Dread, while very disappointing, had moments. Puddle Cruisers have fewer moments. I saw this movie on the shelf of my local video store and saw that it was made by the Broken Lizard group who made Super Troopers. Of course I picked it up. I just found one scene to laugh aloud. A distant cry of Super Troopers. All in all, I was very disappointed. I will not recommend it to anyone unless you have plenty of free time and really need to kill time. However, it is better to play video games, or to watch something that can make you laugh or think.
