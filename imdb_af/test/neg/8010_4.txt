Years ago, "MA2412" the feature tried to be a sort of "local blockbuster" in Austria. One thing is for sure: I hope nobody will ever see this one. Perhaps if you are familiar with the original sitcom, it might be interesting to see what director Sicheritz made of his series. I think he missed his chance and wasted time and money. <br /> <br /> So far, many directors and writers have failed to make a series of concepts compatible with a 90-minute movie (see Alf, Inspector Gadget ...). You can see how difficult it is by looking at "MA 2412". The result of this effort in my opinion is like an endless TV episode (and not a good one). It fails to deliver a plot, the humor is trying too hard and the direction seems very unfocused - as it does for the visual style. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this summary ...
