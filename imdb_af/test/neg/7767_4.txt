I didn't expect much from the movie, it's not all that disappointed. Carrie looks ugly, Mr. Big colored his eyebrows with crayons and Samantha didn't say f ***. <br /> <br /> Charlotte's child was annoying to watch because she was in too many scenes - the title could easily be "SATC: Parents' Night Out." Camera angles were just not as good, especially with regard to Carrie's face. <br /> <br /> There was a sign black woman thrown in whose character did not have a proper outcome and too few appearances by the gay male friends who were in any case thrown in for no purpose. Samantha's back and forth from LA has flown the story, especially when she goes into Fashion Week and doesn't happen. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to be rushing because it could have been good, but scenes have just been thrown in to show different outfits or viewers have a chance to jump back into the show without much contributes to the story of the movie.
