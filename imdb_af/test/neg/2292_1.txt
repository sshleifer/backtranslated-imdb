This movie is TERRIBLE! It makes you disgusting and makes you laugh, but it fails terribly. The director obviously has no sense of slap gore comedy, and the actors are like nothing I have ever seen - lacking both acting and flair of comedy. Even their attempt at English removal is really sad, and the peculiar Swedish accent, where the incoherent dialogue is spoken, is probably the most comical and pleasurable thing about this film. Even the gore, I'm terrible and unconvincing. If you want a good comedy, I suggest you go to classic travel, such as the evil dead series or even the brain death if you have to. We all enjoy a bloody good laugh, but it is ridiculous!
