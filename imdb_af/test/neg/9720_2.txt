The story was incompatible, the acting was not of any call you could categorize. More of a series pilot than a real movie. I wanted to keep this movie, but couldn't find anything to like. Whatever it was that made the lost boys so enjoyable was of course absent here. Although it tried hard. Plot hooks were placed uncomfortably between what could be a dawson-lobster episode with dark clothes, and the story arch went nowhere. Very disappointing to me. The end scenes were special effects driven convenience and how the villain of the story planned his entire scheme. Who was he (or she) trying to kid, talk about naive. Keep up with movies of this kind from the eighties when they had more of an idea.
