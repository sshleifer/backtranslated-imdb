Ugh. Yes, it's exactly like the McMartin mess, or the terrible arrests in Wenatchee, Washington. In the movie, the mother aggressively keeps her baby over and over and over, until he finally tells her what she wants to hear of course. The court investigators and "therapists" repeat the pattern. The interrogation itself is sexually creepy, a relentless repeated assault in its own way. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers throw in a doctor about physical evidence of abuse, perhaps justifying the film's point of view: the two to four year olds never "do things like this". Well, they will ask them as every adult they know. The way this piece is endorsed by such discredited interrogation techniques makes it an exercise in frustration for anyone who knows what is needed to get a successful prosecution in real life. <br /> <br /> (They also add a special arrest incident to the end to "prove" their case - no parallel to this fictional incident ever happened in real life. Can't say more here without to put it in a spoiler, but you will know it when you see it. <br /> <br /> Yes, children are abused, sometimes by paid providers. But watching a movie that empowers the ridiculous, hysterical accusations against so many totally innocent people, looks at repetitions of the trials that destroyed the lives of many children as well as the lives of the accused - I didn't think I keep to the end. It's just too sad, and more made by the writing team's apparent endorsement of the abuse, paranoid, obsessive questioning techniques that have begun - what can we call it? The bonfire of mentalities? <br /> <br /> No one I know has ever been accused of child abuse, thank heaven, but my 12-time grandmother was accused of witchcraft and killed. Mobs filled with what they think is holy anger is just as dangerous as three hundred years ago. Sensational drives like this - "These accusations of Satanic abuse are going all over the country, there must be something there!" "So the jury tells it!" - Eggs eggs. <br /> <br /> And whoever thought it was a good idea to have children under 10, some of them under five, play this role? It is traumatic to see how they deliver their lines; How much more traumatic was it to act on these parts? The filmmakers' commitment to combating child abuse is clearly not apparent. And what did the children's actors think? "Melinda" (unreasonable, at least in the version of the A&E network in 2005, but I think it was Cassy Friel) and Teddy (Brian Bonsall) was great. Professionals or not, they were too young to be exposed to this material, much less to pay to carry it out. Despite the reckless exploitation of these real kids, an "Emmy directing nomination" knew: "Do you know, the Muffin Man", who only showed how good it was in 1989?
