Acolytes offer an interesting mix of original concepts in 'screaming teen' cliché horror with more exciting pacing. In some ways, Acolytes are very successful, but the film fails in many other ways. <br /> <br /> Overall Acolytes avoid the typical archetypes of the naivety and innocence of the youth of endless horror films such as Cabin Fever, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and many other movies where unsuspecting and relatively naive and innocent teenagers, sex, run to scream and one by one is cut off by some monster. Instead, this innocence is replaced by pride, retribution and arrogance. The characters had several opportunities to save themselves from immortal death and despair, but did not do so because of their own personal demons. Eventually, you felt that there were no (and perhaps not) innocent victims. <br /> <br /> As the name suggests, the film is also keen to follow a leader or authority. It is used in a direct sense as the main character as the serial killer would be and also less used throughout the film. Following a central figure is a recurring theme throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers also included many clichés, which I suspect was deliberate and also gave the film a unique mix of depths like eagerness I found intriguing. It may be accidentally played well with the characters that are very shallow at the first appearance, but as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that at least the two main male characters are very complex. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie has many problems. The cinematography, which is typically considered high, is rather sophomoric and over-styled, using formal 2/3 approaches too rigid. Many transitions that I felt were also overstated. The use of symbolism was not only vague but also widely used. <br /> <br /> The plot was poorly planned and relied solely on incorrect information to achieve a rather hokey twist, which was poorly resolved and left the viewers. confused. Methods used to solve the climax are cheap and uncomfortable, motivations are unclear, and large plot points remain unlimited. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie's relative originality, themes and thesis are lost in a maze of poor technical execution, over-styled images, blurred motives, blunt and unnecessary symbolism and cheap twists are only lacking or kept completely wrong information. <br /> <br /> If the movie is performed better, it will have been excellent. Acolytes, however, receive only two stars in my opinion.
