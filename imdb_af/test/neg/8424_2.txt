Forget a fearsome documentary! This movie is really an out-of-out comedy about a 40-year-old pornstar whose purpose is to sing young songs. The only problem? Colton Ford can't sing! And the movie cuts off if it's obviously ready to burst into a song. Still, Ford and equally brief boyfriend Blake Harper are excited and primitive and running around in their tank, which is determined to make dreams come true. Even harder is "manager" Kyle who apparently has the IQ. of a turnip and whose collagen-inspired lips look like a bee that put it. How can grown men be so self-confident? Bwa ha ha! As far as the documentary is concerned, it appears that the filmmakers do not have POV and the film is poorly structured and very uneven. Very little background information is provided on the three clues. Such an inclusion would make the three look like something other than aging Western Hollywood stereotypes.
