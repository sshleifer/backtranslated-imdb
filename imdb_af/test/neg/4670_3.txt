I remember remembering that I would love the film and the director because of the role, the subject and the director. <br /> <br /> Sitting in the theater and laying my seat, I was like a clumsy schoolgirl as my anticipation for the opening scene. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with the opening and felt that I would really love this movie. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie and feel that anything giving away can be seen as a spoiler, please stop reading. I'm not going to give anything really important, but it can be seen as such, so that's the warning. <br /> <br /> Spoiler can be included below, beware. <br /> <br /> I think the first scene that was really ridiculous for me was the Russian space station. I mean honestly to fill a shuttle without any real advance warning, and then just to show that the station is so fragile that a simple little mistake can explode the whole thing. <br /> <br /> While all of this is possible, it was a way to be above me. I am not sure if it was just the situation or if it was the cheesy action, the stupid view of Russian technology, or just the campus attitude of the scene itself. <br /> <br /> It just got worse for me afterwards because then we endure what was 2 hours of continuous super-hard explosions in space ... you know the place where there is no sound because it's a vacuum. <br /> <br /> But the coup mercy to me was honestly the rifle scene. (spoiler possibility) - Earlier in the film, we see Bruce Willis breaking down their land vehicles (the vehicle they will drive to drive them in and helping them drill) when told that this is what they will be using. He takes off and complains about it because much of what is on it is heavy and not necessary for what they do. <br /> <br /> So, as we roam the asteroids, we see that they have chosen to add a massive gatling like gun to the vehicles ... you know, standard NASA prize is putting on heavy weapons have all the space missions you know, strangers or something. <br /> <br /> I can have the explosive 2 hours, the dull Russian space station burning scene, the cheese love scene near the end, the Bruce Willis character is nothing more than most of his other past characters, but the Steve Buscemi gets angry and shoots the spacecraft's rifle all over the place and causes destruction / damage and it threw the whole thing on top of me. <br /> <br /> Save your money and time and avoid this movie. If you want a good meteoric movie, see Deep Impact. If you want a fun movie with great special effects, see Space Cowboys, but no matter what, avoid this movie.
