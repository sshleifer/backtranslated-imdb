Movie title - Tart <br /> Date of review - 5/26/02 <br /> Year of the movie - 2001 <br /> <br /> Stars - Dominique Swain, Brad Renfro , Byou Phillips (rare), Melanie Griffith (rare) <br /> <br /> NeCRo's Rating - 4 skulls from 10 <br /> <br /> May spoil <br /> <br /> Plot <br> /> <br /> An "elated" Dominique Swain wants to be in the "in" group and so she leaves her real friends and joins them ....... many annoying rich people talk. Acting <br /> <br /> I think I had what I wanted in that Dominique was ok, but man, the rest of the role, except maybe Brad Renfro, was bad or at least not interesting or fun. I know some may say the others were good because they made me hate .... trust me .... I like unlikely characters, but this group is unlikely because they can't be convincingly bad people. <br /> <It shows that the only other people I got were almost in it, and that's Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips, but the little time they had was good. Melanie might have had 2 lines, but at least he had a good character, but small. <br /> <br /> Violence and Gore <br /> <br /> My thoughts were constantly attacked by terrible dialogue and very annoying characters, that's enough violence! ok, there was one blowgeoning with a rock that was good. <br /> <br /> T&A Nudity Factor <br /> <br /> Hahaha, they couldn't even add in any nudity to help spit this movie, probably. because no one wants to wear their body for this crap. If they want to uncover themselves, they should do it in a movie where they will be remembered as their character and not for "oh, I heard she was naked in this one." <br /> <br /> Overall view of the movie (review) <br /> <br /> ok well I know I'm proud of the person who can hold the most if it's not nearly all movies, or find a little good in it. Well, this movie is one of the few that I really struggled to find something worthwhile. The problem with this movie is that it is so annoying. I already have a deep hatred for attitudes of sneaky rich people and it has not helped either. All this movie is really just a bunch of rich people depressed and stupid at the scene. I can't emphasize the annoyance enough. This movie tries to regain the proven and true "In-Group" plot, which can usually be done with little effort. <br /> <br /> Why didn't I take a picture from the movie or the box? Well, I felt that this movie didn't deserve that glory, so I decided to give a picture of why I rented it, and that's none other than Dominique Swain. Yes, I was furious too by her in Lolita and thought she was so good that I decided to look her out in any movie she was performing. At least I keep my promises and yes, I have seen the majority of her movies, minus some hard to find. She is a great actress herself and I will actively defend her, but the man chooses her from the crappiest movies to die for. This movie and smokers are both in the same boat of crappiness, but at least Smokers had a cool idea for a story. and even some real screens. <br /> <br /> Also, the DVD box is trying to trick you into thinking this movie also has stars by placing Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips on the front of the box. If there is one thing I make of a movie, it's a movie that names the stars on a box of patch to make you think "wow, it has ____ I wonder how good ___ is in this one I ___ in that movie and thought she was great! "just to have the big names in the movie for a total of maybe 10 minutes between 2. Bijou actually had a part that meant half something. Melanie, on the other hand, has only two rules .... Admittedly, I don't like Melanie much, but it's about ethics and not star action. <br /> <br /> From all this mess though props have to go to Brad Renfro to join in for a good performance with Dominique. Brad may be a very evil child in real life, but at least he can act. So the only reason this movie gets skulls is because I have what I really wanted, which was Dominique Swain and Brad Renfro. I also had the added pleasure to see underlined actress Bijou Phillips making me more like her. So even though I have been severely irritated throughout, I have come up with a few positives, although this time was very difficult. <br /> <br /> I recommend you to see it only if you have seen Lolita and know how good Dominique is or if you are a horrible fan of Brad or Bijou. Uber Melanie fans will be very depressed. Also, if you're a fan of crappy movies like me, don't assume it's a guilty pleasure, because you'll feel guilty for the money you are going to buy or rent. <br /> <br /> Some movies are "so bad they are good" as the saying goes. What they forgot to add was "so bad that they are good (to succeed)." <br /> <br /> NeCRo
