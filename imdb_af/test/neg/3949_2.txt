I wasn't very excited to see this movie in the first place, but a group of us decided to see it on the opening night. I felt like standing up and going out and trying to get my money back in this movie for 20 minutes. I felt that the movie was very boring, uninteresting and not true in many aspects, including "gambling". I tried my best not to fall asleep in the movie, as I watched one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. The scary movie series was scarcer than this movie. The sad attempt to make a Gothic girl, a overworking businessman and a 15-year-old geek, and a random guy in a video game that kills you, is a bad plan to start. Then they try to throw in a very dreadful love scene, where the main character kisses another girl after saving 10 minutes after his girlfriend was murdered. The theater was packed when the movie started leaving just over half of the people before it was over. If you have the need to waste just 1 hour and 16 minutes of your time, you see this movie ... make yourself clear.
