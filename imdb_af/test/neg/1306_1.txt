Well, as the head suggests, it's not the very good movie I hoped for. I thought it would be wonderful with Mr. Proxy man himself, but tragically. From the start I literally lost interest immediately when 2 women were just making tea and then suddenly showing that there was random water coming under the door, and then a little flooded by the route of the house. It's hard to believe they aren't 'noticing the rising water level outside or at least hearing it. Sorry that sounds like a rant, but it really cuts my gears and touched me. Most of the plays were poor and the story tried to copy almost every click for every disaster movie, but just failed in that sense. CGI was poor, I could do a better job using ms paint, which was also poor, and in the end I didn't mind about one character !!! Don't waste your time, no wonder it's released straight to DVD. Well thanks for reading xxx
