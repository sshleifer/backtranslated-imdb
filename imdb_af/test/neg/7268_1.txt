What the hell is that? This was my first reaction to this movie (actually my first reaction included more curse). This is not Star Wars! Star Wars is space battles, this movie has nothing. Star Wars is the Force, this movie has only a delayed witch with a magical ring. Star Wars is a light battle, this movie doesn't have a battle worth mentioning. Star Wars is humor, this movie is not. Star Wars is a galaxy far, far away, this movie has HORSES in it !!! Besides all this, how did Lucas get the crazy idea of ​​leading a five-year-old baby !? Big, big disappointment. Do you like Star Wars? Don't Watch This! 1 out of 10
