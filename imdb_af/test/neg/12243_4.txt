This movie is a nonsense / spoof comedy, in the lines of The Airplane of Naked Gun, but it doesn't even come close to these two because it has originality and a bit more intelligent jokes, rather than just throwing the same old easy jokes. <br /> <br /> You can find some references to other movies, from the top of my head I identified Dodgeball and Rocky, so you can have fun trying to find out which movies <br /> <br /> The movie also gives you the opportunity to laugh, but nothing that can cause your injuries, so nothing really funny. <br /> <br /> I looked the iPod's character in some ways though some of the jokes were with him the standard comedy 101.) I think this movie (and most of the nonsense / ghost comedy) hangs off the mood you are in, so if you think you will laugh To watch any joke this movie. If you are in a serious mood, forget about it (re-look) instead, it will definitely make you laugh
