The kiss bandit was the third and final movie Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson played with MGM. The first two were Anchors Aweigh and it happened in Brooklyn. And in both Sinatra they woke up and lost Grayson. I think the third time is the charm. <br /> <br /> For romance, but certainly not for screenplay. Sinatra plays in his forty's movie again the beautiful, small snooker only this time in torpedoes. In the field of Tyrone Power laid out in The Mark of Zorro, Sinatra plays the son of a man who was a hotel owner and bandit the night. He left and left California for an education and returned to take Dad's place, but only in the hotel business. And where he teaches the hotel business, Boston. <br /> <br /> Of course, some of Pa's former gangsters, a little old and paunchy, led by J. Carrol Naish, have warned him to lead the gang again. But Frank's did not only cut out the excessive life. But he makes a good impression on the governor's daughter, Kathryn Grayson. <br /> <br /> Someone should have put it to Sinatra at MGM to throw it into the bad reviews he received in Miracle of the Bells. Frank is in a section that is more suited to Red Skelton. But as it was a musical, I think the brain confidence at MGM thought Kathryn Grayson should have a singing star. <br /> <br /> In fact, the best number in the movie is for her, Love Is Where You Find It. Also Ricardo Montalban, Ann Miller, and Cyd Charisse do a dance specialist who is nice. Frank's songs are nice, but nothing spectacular. <br /> <br /> In later years, Sinatra will disclose with the mention of The Kissing Bandit and with good reason.
