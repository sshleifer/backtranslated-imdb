Let's start by saying how much I like the TV series. The nature of the class war was always a worthy subject, but the TV series used it better than most. The chemistry between Yootha Joyce and Brian Murphy was always electrifying and the authors wrote almost completely flawless episodes every time. In my opinion, it's the best British sitcom from the mid to late 1970s, approaching the appearance of RISING DAMP, ROBIN'S NEST,. and so on. With the ON THE BUSES series completed a few years earlier, GEORGE AND MILDRED became the next pride and joy of ITV (or ITV 1 as it is now known), and enjoy a four-year race on the channel. <br /> <br /> However, the film is absolutely terrible in almost every respect. The general essence of the TV series is almost completely stripped of the authors of this mutilated movie (who will immediately notice anyone is not the same as those who worked on the series). As one commentator has already pointed out, Mildred has no more than the offense of the sharpness she had on the TV series. <br /> <br /> Instead of focusing on the class war with the Fourmiles it was the basis of the TV series, the plot writes the Fourmiles virtually after the first half hour. The plot, if you can call it, consists of George and Mildred on vacation to a hotel and mixed with gang members. First-class talent in the form of Stratford Johns, Kenneth Cope, David Barry and Sue Bond are all wasted here. Most of these are well past their highs and everyone looks very ashamed as if they know very well that the only valuation to hang is a salary (which probably won't be much). <br /> <br /> The jokes and gags in the movie (if you can call it) are very much dependent on the traditional British farce, including faulty identities, embarrassing situations, poor time frame, characters losing control of what is happening to them and general confusion. And all this fails. As another commentator pointed out, it seems as if the authors of this movie have never seen an episode of the TV series, and rather made up something that looks like a CARRY ON skirt. The scene where George is stripped of Sue Bond's character is especially out of context. <br /> <br /> A puzzle around this movie is the BBFC certification provided. 15. Just why is it rated 15 when all there is to see is harmless, non-vulgar entertainment? <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, the era of sitcom spin or came to an end long after this movie was released (shortly after the sad death of Yootha Joyce). And the company behind this movie, Hammer, known for producing high-quality horror movies back in the 1950s to the mid-1970s, soon disappeared into total darkness. <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie is an almost total washout. My advice - Skip it and stick to the TV series. You will not miss anything, I assure you.
