What are the current mistakes with American movies? Hollyweird is making films that men like women and women act like men. The idiotic male director and writer of this movie should explore their heads. The main problems with this movie are the extreme extreme feminist portrayals of the generations. <br /> <br /> In the bars of the bar, Eva Mendez and her friend, sneak out of the beer bottles as you can find sailors on oil. tanker does this at a pub in Iceland. Mendez always kisses every girl she sees. She also provokes provocation in every scene, but curses as a man. She gets very emotional when she fights with Will Smith for a while while trying to defend all women of bad guys everywhere. <br /> <br /> The men are no better in this movie. What we see is a bunch of idiots trying to do something they can to win a date. The males in this movie are getting sexual favors or unable to speak clearly when they come face to face with a woman. Men in real life do not act this way. <br /> <br /> What we see in this movie is a culture product that went wrong. Everything is flip-flopped. Churches act like girls, girls act like guys. All these things are done while the extreme predictions of the generations are much part of the story. Men are so soft and stupid, but only most of the time interested, while women are considered macho and overgrown, but only as a veneer for their emotional uncertainties. <br /> <br /> This movie would be great if it wasn't suggested to the audience. The content is not the culprit. This is the way the content is presented.
