Arrived as a romantic comedy by the early years of World War II, it fails to deliver. The problem is that while it is beautifully photographed, it does not have a consistent story line or narrative. Beginning as a murder mystery, it offers no hope to its actors as it has been through recent history meanders. Depardieu is wasted in a trivial role which he obviously does not like to play with. Adjani can't carry the picture. The hero is not; Of course, an imitation of a Hitchcock "wrong accused" role has no balance. Not heroic, comic or exciting. <br /> <br /> It could have been a good movie. I am reminded of "The Lady Vanishes" that combines tension, romance and comedy into a serious film about fascism.
