Where do I start with this movie? All I know is that it's a mess. Be the script, story, or actors. First, this movie is very disappointing from Salman Khan who gave us a fun Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge and Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega. Second Rani gets really annoying, appearing in every silly movie since Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (remains Saathiya stopped this nonsense). The story is stolen from The Wedding Singer, but ruins the funny movie. The dialogues are missing. Maybe I laughed here and there, but entertained? NO !!! Salman Khan was tolerant in the above movies, but here he is insane. His character is poorly written. One minute he is poor and the next moment you wonder how he is poor. Rani Mukherjee looks like an ordinary jain and has taken no trouble. Luckily, she was relieved of her career with Saathiya because his career was at this time. Pooja Batra has a little charm here with her look, but that's not enough. Jackie Shroff is wasted. Kashmira Shah's beauty and acting ran away from her because she chose such a terrible writing. Raveena Tandon looks nice, but does not perform much. Mohnish Behl receives the award for the worst (supporting) actor (they need Razzie because there were terrible movies in India). He says dull dialogues, dancing terribly, looks weird and is not in its ordinary form. Just to tell you, there's more to throwing that is also terrible. If it wasn't for Raveena's wonderful beauty in Aa Meri Life Bana De, I wouldn't give the movie a point. Otherwise, the dance by Salman was terrible. Pooja Batra was like a wind in Savariya, otherwise I wish the costumes were given a makeover and the rest of the role play (and their monkey dance) was blown away from the wind. The good song of the album was O Priya O Priya, which doesn't have a good picture. The same goes for the halfway decent title song. Otherwise, this movie (and the rest of the songs) is a no-no for everyone.
