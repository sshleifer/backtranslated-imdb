This show is perhaps one of the most boring, most unknown shows I've ever seen. While the humor was subtle, and I'm all for the subtle humor; The jokes were just not funny. <br /> <br /> The show is about two Kiwis in their mid-1930s living in New York and trying to start their music careers. <br /> <br /> I saw the one episode where Brett left the other Kiwi during a cup. Well, that plot idea has potential; but I felt that half of the episode was just filler, and the other half was really important to the story. <br /> <br /> What I mean, they kept explaining how the one left behind was betrayed and had a lot of distrust for the other man. I have one piece of advice for the authors: name it once for the idiots who can't point it out, as he acts, and go ahead. <br /> <br /> And I found the characters annoying. . The character left behind by the other, Brett, was overly innocent and naive, the one left behind in this monotonous and robotic voice. <br /> <br /> A third character, who was the band driver, was apparently incompetent, but he was the one character I liked. He is also the one who deserves the show a one-rating. <br /> <br /> All in all, a show I never plan to watch again.
