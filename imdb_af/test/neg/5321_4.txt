The 1977 animated live action hybrid version of Gulliver's Travels (or rather 'Travel' as he gets as far as Lilliput) has not received much of a release, and it's not too difficult to see why no. Michel Legrand comes up with some catchy songs, but they inspire lyricist Don Black just like: "Simple fact remains / no one here suffers from growing pain." Richard Harris once again survives in his passion for excessive make-up, relieving the glance of too much foundation this time to hide the fact that he is at least 25 years old, but at least he (perhaps inappropriate) reduced its bigger tendencies for a show that mainly consists of patronizing whispers. The Belgian animation just looks slightly better than the early morning French children's television, but Peter Hunt's movie is not that bad Real models for the animated characters move back to Max and Dave Fleischer's 1939 version while a few moments of Swiftian satire remains - though definitely aimed at the youngest children.
