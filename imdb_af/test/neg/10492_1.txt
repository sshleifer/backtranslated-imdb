Imagine how it was for John Agar. One of Hollywood's attractive front men. Married to Shirley Temple for five years. He finds himself so movie. I remember him in "Tarantula" where he was not halfway. Unfortunately, there is nothing to recommend this movie. The monster is stupid, uninteresting and incompetent. The police are boring. The teens are boring. The plot is stupid. People are running around. There are events that do nothing to promote the plot. There is dancing going on, and then there is no attack. There is an idiotic love triangle that nobody cares the least. It's not even champion or shame. It's just worth nothing. Agar may also be a post. He gave nothing to do.
