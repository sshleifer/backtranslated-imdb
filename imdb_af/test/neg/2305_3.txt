Jacqueline Susann wrote several novels that all include sex and melodrama, and some of them are actually made in movies, including this effort. They all have the distinction of being some of the worst movies ever made. Story about Robin Stone (John Phillip Law) and his rise to the top of television by mercilessly counting on everyone around him. He is a playboy of the worst kind using and then every woman throws his beds away, including the wife of the IBC network president. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** Greg Austin (Robert Ryan) is in charge of the television network IBC and once his younger wife Judith looks at Robin, she doesn't waste time with him in bed. Greg gets sick and needs time and that's where Robin comes in and starts trying to run the network. In the meantime, a model called Amanda (Jodi Wexler) in love with him is killed. When Greg returns to work, he tries to get rid of Robin by using the moral clause in his contract when rumors about his relationship with Jerry Nelson (David Hemmings) is a gay fashion photographer. <br /> <br /> This is by Jack Haley Jr. management. He was still a very successful producer in both television and movies, but it was only his second film as a director and the material he had to deal with looked right over his head! The script comes from Susann's novel and it is likely why it looks like a cross between Alfie and The Valley of the Dolls. I think the reason why her books can never be translated well into film is because the filmmakers made the terrible mistake. to take her stories seriously instead of the tongue in the cheek. With that, the laugh that comes out of it is unintentionally especially during the completely ridiculous fight at the end of the movie that begins when Cannon refuses to return the slave bracelet to the gay characters! Hemmings was a very good actor, but his role here is completely over and it carries one of the worst bearings in history and uses the term "chic" in every other sense. Law was not the original choice, but another actor who was thrown had a serious accident and the law entered and delivered one of the more wood performances on this side by Miles O'Keeffe. The movie's screenplay suffers in two different areas, as both are foolish and terribly boring and will test the patience of the viewers if they choose to watch it. One has to wonder what the outcome would be if a director decided to film one of Susann's novels and not take it seriously, because the attempt is pundit and ridiculous.
