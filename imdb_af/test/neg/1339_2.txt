Seen this movie last night. I don't usually care good or bad, because I think movies are like books, because there is something for everyone and everyone is different, taste different, yadda yadda. This movie was bad. By the end I thought, oh my, it tests my patience. How many women really look and live when they hit a rock bottom and if I can only borrow cash from my mother and design my dreams to live dreams - yes, life will be great! I was out for a nice chick day with my girlfriend (my darling guy likes watching movies together and I knew it wouldn't be his thing), something light and easy on the senses, but it was a bad movie. We are intelligent and interesting movie viewers and this movie was not so. Annette Benning is a great actress, she has her own. Not bad. Not bad.
