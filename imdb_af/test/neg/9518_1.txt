I look forward to seeing it at the Sydney Film Festival. I left the theater, like many others, before the end of the credits because I couldn't sit there anymore. It was badly shot, the sound sucked, and the play was worse than an episode of The Love Boat. Now I know why this movie could not find an American distribution company to release it in the United States. It screams from a low budget high school production.
