I was very disappointed with this series. It has very cool graphics and that's about it. The level of detail it went through was minimal, and I always felt that the audience was ashamed - there were many that seemed to me: "It's very cool, but we're not going to explain it anymore because you Let us show you nice photos to entertain you. "The host will drop interesting sounding words such as" spatulas "and" super-symmetry "without any attempt to explain what it was. see Wikipedia. <br /> <br /> I also know a lot about superstrings (for a layman) and I found their explanations were intricate and could have been so much better, they could have chosen much better examples to explain concepts But the examples they used were confusing and further obscured the subject. <br /> <br /> In addition, I became so sick of the recurrence that they could easily divide the series into one episode if they had the repeat Cut out the clips of the Quantum Café about 8 times. The host still said the same things over and over and over. I can't remember how many times he said, "The universe is made out of small, small vibrating strings." It's like they are trying to brain us up to just accept that "superstrings are the best thing than sliced ​​bread." <br /> <br /> Finally, the show ends with an unpleasant feeling of a competition between Fermilab and CERN, clearly biased towards Fermilab. It is supposed to be an educational program on quantum physics, not whether the US is better than Europe or vice versa! I also felt it was part of the most condescending: "Audiences must see conflict to stay interested." Please. Give me a little more credit than this. <br /> <br /> Overall, 2 thumbs down :-(
