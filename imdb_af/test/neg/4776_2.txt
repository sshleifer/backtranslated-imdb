The movie started A few tourists on vacation in Mexico with a good time decide they should go on a hike. They uncover some hidden paths and end and this great temple like the fort. Angry villagers appear and try to scare them off, but because of the language border people are shot and the tourists end the stupid thing. It seems that the plants are evil bloodthirsty things that the residents will not be close to, so they guard the temple so that tourists cannot get away. There are a few scares in this movie, but nothing really makes sense. I mean it's PLANTS! Do not do not buy or rent. Wait until it goes out on the cable.
