So, after the initial disappointment of the first Final Fantasy movie, which seems to be the parable of the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy: Advent Children released him for a warm reception and now a dedicated fan base. And the reason for the movies' success is understandable, as it has lush graphics, fast-moving battle order and some cool like full-featured characters. However, if you did not play FF7, it is likely that you will not enjoy this movie, as the storyline of the game goes on without prior explanation and probably gets lost from the plot, even if you played the game. Secondly, there is no character development, without prior knowledge of the game, your opinions on the characters are limited to 'cool' and 'not cool'. Of course, for FF7 fans, the movie is almost guaranteed to be entertained, at least for nostalgic reasons, and it's cool to love all the characters you've grown from the game rendered in stunningly wonderful computer animation. One last complaint, the film, at least in my opinion, was trying to scratch too much in less than two hours and therefore looked like half an hour or so. If you're playing and enjoying FF7 if it's a valuable look, though nothing too special. If you haven't played FF7, it's best to play it first before watching this movie.
