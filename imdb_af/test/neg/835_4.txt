ANY GUN can play (2 out of 5 stars) Overall routine "Spaghetti Western" played the old "Kookie" on 77 Sunset Strip. The plot is a bit confused about some stolen gold coins and several armed men of dubious motivation to track it. This is one of the "sad" western ... which means a lot of real "comedy" efforts ... and some very horrible music during most of the action series (you can't say it is Ennio Morricone's work) . George Hilton plays an abundance hunter called 'Alien' ... but he doesn't leave much of an impression ... he doesn't have the style of Clint Eastwood or Franco Nero, who can do a lot with a sparsely written character . The ending is a complete homage / parody of the end of "The Good, The Bad and the Ugly" ... although it is almost amusing enough to be considered a "parody". The highlights of the movie are the first 5 minutes ... What are the actors performing after Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and someone else (Is he supposed to be Eli Wallach? Franco Nero? It's not very clear. ..) confronted by stranger. It's an amusing joke for fans of Sergio Leone fans and spaghetti western aficionados ... but I don't think anyone else will see the point.
