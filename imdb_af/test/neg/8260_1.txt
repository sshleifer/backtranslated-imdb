Okay. so i went into this loving RuPaul. I still love him / her, but think a little less. This is a gross movie showing many male genitals. This is a spoof of the black exploitation of the 1970s and is deliberately done badly. The only funny part about it is that all the voices with that of dragon queens, even the voices of real women, ran. It's about the top, not stopping, laughing your back, it's made such a silly, bad movie. I will never see it again, but I appreciate what the filmmakers are trying to do. There is no score on this, but it will be R or even NC-17. RuPaul did much better work.
