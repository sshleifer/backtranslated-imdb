Sometimes I think there is a room somewhere in the office of the "Life" channel's office complex where the author's hang-out hangs on the wall with a big wheel, like the Big Six in casinos. The latter has many places where you can even win money and less for higher amounts until there are some who pay bigger money. <br /> <br /> But I portray the channel's wheel with about six different genres on his wheel, with two of them, most appearing, called "The Psychotic Neighbor" or "The Husband with a Hidden Past or Secret or Both. " "Life" movies have some repetitive story lines, and these two seem to be the allest. <br /> <br /> The "Cade ..." category can be a long-time spouse, but some appear, or an event occurs, that the good woman was once a hooker, one of the couple were involved in some deadly act long ago, or something else in one background, other than suspected - etc. or, as in this movie, one of them entered marriage with the most ominous goals. <br /> <br /> One constant, in all their genres, is that the man or other male is usually inconsiderate, and slow to have any idea that goes into hell until the climax, or at best, very late in the proceedings (unless the man is miscarried). This is not the case here. <br /> <br /> Whether the referenced miscreant is the "neighbor" or as in this presentation, "the woman", is always fascinating how easy, successful and effortless they proceed with their bravery. deeds. They manipulate a lot of others, beat them as needed, take on different objects, and do not add more deceptions than you can - with unfinished success until the end. <br /> <br /> The main actor here, like many in this channel's movies, is an old hand. I noticed another movie in which he stood, titled "The Perfect Neighbor." <br /> <br /> Finally, the refugee "perfect woman" in this movie sends those on her way with more skill and ease than the most experienced and capable "button man" in Don Corleone's family could gather. And I can only imagine that Jack Nocholson's Melvin Udall character of "So Good As It Gets" with his massive OCD tribulation can advise the anti-heroine to help deal with the obsession that the basis of this was opus.
