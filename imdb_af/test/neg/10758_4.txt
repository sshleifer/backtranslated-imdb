How anyone can praise this raw movie version after seeing the amazing WATERLOO BRIDGE with Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor is not understood. <br /> <br /> MAE CLARKE's Myra is far from the role of VIVIEN LEIGH in the remake. She plays a common American girl with a Brooklyn accent and the "Yes" reactions are a bit torn if one expects a less coarse character. DOUGLASS MONTGOMERY (invoiced in final credits as KENT DOUGLASS) is unlikely as a soldier beaten with her, no matter how many times she has dropped him. BETTE DAVIS didn't share a role in a bit. <br /> <br /> Their melodramatic confrontations during the last twenty minutes of the film are out of conviction (exaggerated bits of the story) - even though it's a rougher version of the story when the sound was just a few years old still acting was the anger. <br /> <br /> Just awful. And it suddenly ends when Clarke loses her life during a bomb attack on the bridge. The end. <br /> <br /> It has none of the beautifully shaded performances in the 1940 MGM remake, including a sterling supporting role. Instead, this one is mounted with low-budget production values ​​(and I mean a shoe-string budget) with no subtlety at all. And there's no pre-code braveness in the scene where Myra tells the aristocratic woman why she shouldn't marry her son, Roy. She simply said, "I picked him up on the Waterloo Bridge." Explanation about. Nothing fat there. <br /> <br /> Summary: For once, the original isn't the best version in any way. VIVIEN LEIGH and ROBERT TAYLOR have never been crossed as Myra and Roy in the soft, up-to-date 1940 movie class.
