The previous review is pretty much on the target, which Altman was NOT with this movie. I haven't seen it since its original release, but I rarely spent two hours in a theater feeling so miserable and disappointed as I was with this movie. If a predictive community theater tried a sci-fi version of an Ingmar Bergman movie, it could come that way. I can't bring anything that made Altman a "1", but it's probably the backbone of a career that had remarkable highlights and lows. I would have walked, but as a paid film critic I couldn't. (Remember next time you are jealous of film critics.)
