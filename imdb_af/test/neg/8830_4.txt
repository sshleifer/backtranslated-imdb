It's a good blueprint for a study of corporate power and the dichotomoy between the required public life and the need for privacy. Robert Taylor was placed by corporate chief Burl Ives as a surrogate son to replace him as head of the corporation. He sends him to England to negotiate an agreement where Taylor is both amazed at the ethics and morality of the men he handles and manages to fall in love with a refugee while he is on it. He came back by hand, his duty did to him, but he told English about his motives in English. He tries to marry the refugee rather than the boss's cousin and so begins Ives's attempt to discredit the refugee as a suitable woman for a corporate executive. It could have been gritter, nastier and less romantic - the amount of time spent on the novels separates the film from the points it is trying to make about corporate ethics. <br /> <br /> Somehow, the costume design was nominated (undeserved) for an Oscar - all the business packages and the two women in the film dress conservative - studio politics are at work again, no doubt. <br /> <br /> However, what is the excellent black and white CinemaScope cinematography - it deserves the Oscar nom. (This was MGM's first 'Scope movie in B&W'). <br /> <br /> Not as good as it could have been, but not terrible.
