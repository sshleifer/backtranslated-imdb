Deaf acting, weak writing ... worst Spanish movie in years ... I was <br /> <br /> attracted by the (naked) beauty of Paz Vega, but as an actress <br /> <br /> she is useless, you can hardly understand what she says. <br /> <br /> There is not much coherence about the story. We've heard it <br /> <br /> but if it's a "modern Carmen". We find some changes: The French soldier is now a basic soldier. -Merimee herself is a character in the story. Carmen is a dangerous "bandolera" in love with a well-known <br /> <br /> "Matador" and she can speak fluently basic ... Can anyone understand this mess?
