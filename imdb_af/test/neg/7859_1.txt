"Heaven Can Wait" is a crushing drill and a candy, misogynistic lie. I can't imagine anyone, but film students today. Don Ameche is in virtually every scene, and while having a brand new voice that undoubtedly contributed to his successful career in radio, he doesn't have the charisma to carry this movie. Ameche plays Henry, a womanizer. Lubitsch wants to make Henry's sexual incontinence rich and amusing, and therefore he sets Ameche to play the part as finely as possible. The combination of Ameche's lack of charisma and Lubitsch's insistence on gentleness leads to a main character who is deadly boring and totally icky. You will not spend any time with this man; He made you sleep. You won't leave him alone with your daughter, regardless of her age. Something grumpy would happen. <br /> <br /> The movie's appearance is pretty boring. Scene after the scene consists of static, excessive, diorama-style shots of boldly dressed Gilded Age-padded shirts and bustles that lean in excessively busy, Victorian stables. There are so many ruffles and frills and curls, so much lilac and air blue and pink, you need Dramamine. <br /> <br /> This movie hates women as much as hardcore porn, but it offers hate with a candy and a lovely bow on top. The contrast between the content of the message and its delivery is ill. In one of the film's most hateful scenes, an elderly woman is sent to hell because she is not physically attractive.
