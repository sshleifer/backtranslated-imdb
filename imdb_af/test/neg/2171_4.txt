Elderbush Gilch was a great disappointment to me. I heard how great it was, how important it was. It just didn't hit me. It has a darkened story line, plus some moronic and sadistic indigenous American characters who are urgently offensive by today's standards. While most of D.W. Griffith's films have depth and intelligence. This one feels more like a formula-baised program picture. <br /> <br /> I loved Lillian Gish and Mae Marsh in the birth of a Nazi Role, plus the performance of the battle scenes was pretty good. According to future Griffith cameraman Karl Brown, the audience sat and cried in their seats as soon as the cavalry ran. I didn't feel anything. And experience me, I watch Griffith's early work at Biography. This movie is just not what it was. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is that it has a lot of Griffith's touch on it for all its mistakes. He handles his main players quite well, plus the scene where the Indians surround the cabin, reminiscent of the climax of Birth of a Nation, a far superior movie that will send shock waves over America about a year later.
