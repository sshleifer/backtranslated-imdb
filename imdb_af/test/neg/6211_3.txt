Let's talk about the story first. It's a copy of the movie "Hitch" with an added Indian flavor to it. One man, who is a love guru, and another man who is apparently a sucker when it comes to ladies, and how it seems to be struggling, becomes a charmer using the love guru, forming the story. Salman Khan is the love guru, and Govinda is the lame man. <br /> <br /> Now comes Salman Khan all over the movie. He's trying to be funny, but misses a lot of time. You can see that Salman screams the whole movie, no real acting is seen in his performance. Govinda couples to Katrina Kaif (Oh, my god, she's one girl. A real beauty) is a 50-year-old man in real life, and Katrina is a girl in her early twenties. In the film, Govinda looks like Katrina Kaif's grandfather. What a pity! Come to the movie. This movie feels like a B-Movie, and a poor imitation of the movie Hitch. Where Hitch looks like a movie with a purpose and depth, this movie is level and aimless, nowhere is justification or clarity. <br /> <br /> Just forget this movie because it's nothing but boring, typical Bollywood fare. Actually, I give 3/10 because it's the lowest I go.
