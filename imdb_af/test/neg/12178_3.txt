Lamb. Lamb. Lamb. Ultralame. Will I continue? There is one, I repeat * one * funny scene in this whole, protracted, amusing amateur hour special of a movie: A father's father's dangerous father knocks someone with his beer arm. That's it. The rest of this shockingly mediocre pile of nothing, consists of the usual brand-bored Swedish "actors" who deliver a dialogue that goes in one ear and the other, a banal story, messy direction and, little, trouble was called. Nepotistically cast Fares is as charismatic as a chartered accountant and his nose rivals, even those of Adrien Brody, in terms of pure ridiculous grace. Torkel Petersson should only work with Lasse Spang Olsen. Fortunately, the rest of the cast is easily forgotten, while Fares' humongous, titanic nose will always haunt me in my dreams. <br /> <br /> Joseph Fares helps ruin the Swedish theater. Don't support him and his nonsense. Jalla Jalla is the comedies Arnold Schwarzenegger performed, and Kopps would have been much more respectful if it was a Youtube video, and Zozo was merely the most pretentious, pseudo-touch rubbish ever unleashed by a Swedish director. Wake up and smell the roses: Swedish movies can be so much better than that, so stop as if it is fun to see that Fares's movie is worth watching just because they are good at being Swedish. Please.
