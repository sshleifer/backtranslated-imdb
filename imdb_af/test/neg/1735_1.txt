What really showed me about this movie was how little the plot made. So many characters were introduced randomly, it was like I think Tommy Wiseau's "THE ROOM" would again be featured on the Disney Channel set. We had the wise older couple who kept hanging out where "Jane" worked, and told the same story about how "soda" they brought together, or Jane's Mom / Stepmom / random crying woman who would all appear at random . /> <br /> Aaron Carter's play is definitely the highlight of this movie. I actually looked forward to every scene in which he appeared. The editing is painfully bad, with scenes that don't make sense. The "Jane" character is really annoying, moon over and moping about "J.D. McQueen." The scenes with the "Music Awards" are more depressed than anything else. And the end of this movie is surreal.
