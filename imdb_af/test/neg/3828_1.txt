I can hardly find the words to describe how much this piece of garbage has insulted me. Why is it that American filmmakers are always out to experience Jamaican as a bunch of backward-ass babies and, worse still, throw people to play Jamaicans that sound completely ridiculous when trying to imitate the accent? We are not all extremely dark, we are not all walking around to walk or do work or protection, we are not naked in our homes and we do not practice VOODOO !! We are doctors, lawyers, architects, businessmen and women, musicians, actors and filmmakers. I'm sick and tired of watching all of these Jamaican depictions as a bunch of dreadlock wearing Rastafarians, doing nothing but sitting all day, smoking on a beach or shooting guns in the air. (If we don't live in our tree houses). Yes, we wear clothes. Yes, we have electricity. No, weeds are not legal on the island, and our chances are better than English! The worst is that it is not just my angry and bitter, it is real answers to questions that most Jamaicans who traveled abroad were asked at some point. Read a book before you imagine how it is in another country and worse, decide to make a movie about it. <br /> <br /> WELCOME TO JAMAICA! The country where we do everything, kills white people and beats our bongos drums ... Tales from the Crypt officially made me sick, along with the whole crew of people who worked on this garbage, especially the author.
