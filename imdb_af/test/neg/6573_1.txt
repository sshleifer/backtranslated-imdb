... once. "Manos, the hands of fate." It was worse than that, rather worse: but it had one thing: it had beautiful women in legacies pushing each other - about 20 minutes. It has a fat 45-year-old with 3 tits and a tail, in a cantina scene cloned directly from Star Wars. Not to mention an obese, blue seducer Uhura, her thick legs and ass hanging from some kind of insane bird costume, in this Method acting Mess. She always wanted to act in front of a "prisoner"? She had meant the poor slobs that had exhausted $ 8 and hoped to see another "Wrath of Khan", or at least a "Voyage Home." Captive is right. I wonder how many people in the theaters tried to split their wrists as they exclaimed: "Mom, stop it. "<br /> <br /> No doubt about it," Final Frontier "is not just an unfortunate disaster, it's cruel and unusual punishment. It's Star Trek from hell. This is Shatner on mushrooms - or maybe" n peyote This is where no one has been before and wanted him to never have in the first place an overview of "Hemelspoort:" It is as if Gene Roddenberry sold his soul to the devil for the success of a TV series, and the devil just comes to collect. "<br /> <br /> And not even I started a drunken Kirk and a grinning McCoy singing" Row, Row, Row Your Boat " , as their lovers were in a kind of demented gay fever dream. Then we have the Hideous Dynamic Duo from Sulu and Chekov, strolling through the forest ... probably heading for a Barry Manilow concert. Then there is Laurence Luckinbill as Spock's brother ??? !!! Yes, right! Surprising how these relationships we've never heard before suddenly crawl out of the woodwork when we need a new plot line. And not to forget that Spock falls in the air when he falls from a cliff in Yosemite. Sure. He picked up Kirk and saved him one foot away from the ground. Where Do You Get That Fine Rocket Shoes, Spock?
