What can I say? It was a horrible movie to watch. I'm not usually very critical of gay theater in general, as most are usually low budget, but I really did put it on the wall. I mean, is gay theater happening? Did gay producers and directors learn nothing about Gus Van Saints and Ang Lee's films? To just sit through the whole movie was to be in a dentist's chair and withdraw my wisdom teeth. I kept praying for moments where I would feel any kind of connection with any of the characters, but it never happened. Most of the characters' performances were not very convincing. It was like watching one of the poorly produced TV movies at a local TV station. I can't tell you how disappointed. This was the performance of this movie after being a great fan of Tori Spellings. Other works and directors last worked on "Last day saints." It was definitely not worth the wait. Definitely, a few hours of my life, I'll never come back and definitely won't buy it on DVD.
