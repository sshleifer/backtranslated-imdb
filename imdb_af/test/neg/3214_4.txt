Nothing I don't like anymore than a kung-fu movie that laughs. This is the main reason why I can't stand Jackie Chan (or his gauntlets). He wasn't always a clown, I have to add. "My young aunt" is slapstick martial arts of the worst kind. It's a perfect example of how the subgenre was brought to the mud by endless stupid antics and childish behavior. Unless you are 5 years old, I really don't understand how anyone can find this kind of movie funny. But humor is indeed a very subjective thing. Personally, I think this kind of approach had permanent damage to the beloved subgenre. I thought leader Dame Kara Hui was very good here. But I had such a hard time sitting through this one that I couldn't enjoy her good performance. If you are not all foolish, enjoy it. I know I didn't.
