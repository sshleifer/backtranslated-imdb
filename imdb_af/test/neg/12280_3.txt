Essentially motionless action movie has two good guys (Fong and Roundtree) blast against two bad guys (Mitchell and Pierce). Fong may be the most uncharismatic action lead of the 80's, Roundtree's small part is far from his "Shaft" days, and Cameron Mitchell adds another shameful role in his career, one next to his laughable turn in "The Toolbox Murders "(this man was one respected actor once, now he came across wearing flowers in his hair and complaining about people blooming on his mat). Only Stack Pierce acts with some dignity. As for the violence, don't worry: most are done too badly to offend anyone. (* 1/2)
