This very forced attempt to fuse Robert Altman and Quentin Tarantino (which is very overestimated) is not informative or entertaining. The character development is arbitrary and incredible - especially in the final scene of the boefies and the boy, as other reviewers have noted. Also, some humorous moments aside, the film is not so funny (black humor or otherwise) as the director seems to think it is.
