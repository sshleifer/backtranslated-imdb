Dire! Gloomy! Awful! Laughable! Disappointing! <br /> <br /> Right, you're trapped in "The Cave" with a few "hard" men and a woman or two, you are being systematically killed by something, and you will still not hear naughty. Grown Up Words !!! A 15 Cert here in England and you can tell it! <br /> <br /> The Egos of the "Macho Men" were just too much, succeeded in the bucket, I'm going to be sick. <br /> <br /> This movie should never be exposed to daylight and kept ironically in the darkest, deepest hole in the ground and forgotten forever. I have a feeling that this description is not the first time to push his head off a hole in the ground. <br /> <br /> Just like the movie The Cube, it looks like a good concept, but is just late at last post at good. </ span> <br /> <br /> These comments contain Spoilers in order, it calls the cave. <br /> <br /> Thanks Bruce.
