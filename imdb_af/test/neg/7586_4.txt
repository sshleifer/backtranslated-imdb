I usually won't waste my time criticizing a useless movie like this. However, I am away from work this week, so I have enough time to swing into meaningless trivialities. To start, let me say that I regularly enjoy non-commercial, non-mainstream, non-US cinema. (Feel free to click on my user profile for a supportive filmography.) It has been said that there are many bad movies released in countries outside the US. Trust me, I have been tortured by hundreds of them. "Lost In Beijing" is a particularly bad movie. <br /> <br /> The opening half hour is an impressive, non-stop exhibition of moral degeneration. This film offers some classic morals that are on the same level as Kim Ki-duk's "Bad Guy" (2001). <br /> <br /> 1. Women actually enjoy rape; 2. rape must be glorified, praised and respected; 3. feel free to rape any woman you want, because while "doing her" she will eventually begin to satisfy and reach orgasm; 4. If your wife is raped, make sure you print her rapist for a lot of money, but if he doesn't pay, just hit a woman's wife repeatedly. 5. If your wife is raped, screw her down and break down the next day while playing the role of the rapist, and try her with lines like, "Does he love it so much?"; 6. If your husband is a rapist, just accept it; 7. After being personally raped, you become related to your rapist and hang out with him as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> How can anyone in their right mind care about any of these characters? They are nothing more than a bunch of degenerate who not only live their lives in a careless manner, but actually spit and support each other in their meaninglessness. Don't get me wrong. I am very able to enjoy movies that depict lifestyles and morals that contradict my own. "Ichi the Killer" (2001) and "Moonlight Whispers" (1999) are very interesting portrayals of sado-masochism. "Strange Circus" (2005) is an extremely distorted drama on child sexual abuse. "Marriage is a crazy thing" (2002) is an outrage at traditional marriage. Even religious films such as "Running On Karma" (2003) and "Samsara" (2001) occasionally entertained me. The difference is that those movies actually have interesting psychological content and character development for them, while "Lost In Beijing" has virtually nothing. It is known that people with unorthodox thinking exist on this planet, but without any kind of character development or psychology behind the deeds themselves, you end up with a superficial exposition of contemptuous behavior. Why, Bing Bing, is finally getting friendly and taking care of her rapist? Why does a woman's rapist accept his behavior unconditionally? The filmmakers never bothered to tell us. Even the obvious composition of rich and poor classes was unceasingly pregnant and ultimately a mere situation. It all feels too tiring and forgetful after the dirty opening has slowed down for half an hour. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers here seem to confuse their moral ambiguity with complex characterization. The reason why you can't choose which person to root is because it's not properly developed. Don't think this movie has complex characters just because it's not clearly defined. On the contrary, the reason why they are not clearly defined is because we know nothing or what they think. This is hardly a positive feature of this movie. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, camera work and acting are pretty good, but everything just gets dimmer and duller than the movie progresses. You can do this next to the trash, such as "Turning Gate" (2002), "What Time Is It There" (2001), "Irreversible" (2002) and the aforementioned "Bad Guy."
