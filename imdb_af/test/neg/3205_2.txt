It's a shame for the name of all the lovely and smiling Critters saga. Why do the authors feel the need to make the movie unbearable to look at all quality standards. The Critters are cute and rich as always, but deadly behavior has been transformed into that of a murderer baby. They are not so scary, horrible, some who are backbone and funny as they were previously portrayed in the movies. I loved their porcupine shots, but now it's hidden as if it were repeated and boring. And what's with the murder and not eating. I thought this movie would have been cool, but everything was so wrong. Why Ug should be angry and murdered by what Charlie is known for. This movie makes me sick. Shame! Shame! DISGRAAAAAAACE !!!!
