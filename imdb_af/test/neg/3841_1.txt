I would like to start by saying I will not see this movie again if they have released popcorn from solid gold and the ticket has given me eternal life. This movie was terrible. I can't give it an honest rating, because there are no negative stars. The acting is absolutely terrible. This movie is a travesty based on the classic "The Dangerous Game". If you want to torture yourself for 90 minutes, rent something like Gigli. At least, J-Lo offers a better scenery, Ben has to watch the women watch it. I'm not upset about the $ 7 I paid to see the move, I just want to return the 90 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> "Can you give me my time back?" Samuel L. Jackson, Changing Lanes
