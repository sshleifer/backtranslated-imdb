I really got, Shorty, but this movie was quite disappointing as a successor. First of all, Travolta does not look like Get Shorty's Chile Palmer. He has half estimated this performance, as he did in all his more recent movies. He's not at all, or he has the presence of him over him, which makes him a little root in the whole movie. Travolta seems to have rolled out of bed and decided he was good to act in this movie. The plot was just not exciting or clever, actually there are no highlights. The only thing that entertained was watching Christina Millian and The Rock was funny. But anyway, long story short, this movie was trash and I had to force myself to get through it.
