The plot here is simple. Land boy, Lem (Farrell) goes to the city to sell the wheat crop, falls in love with a waitress, Kate (Duncan), and marries her and brings her home to a hostile father and a group of women-hungry maggots. There are shades of them, what they wanted, and MICE AND PEOPLE here. The court services, which take place in two long rows in the restaurant, consume the first half hour and are slow. Lem is so weak, he lets his father abuse his wife, suggested by Mac (Richard Alexander), one of the magicians, to get away with him. Duncan and Alexander are the only good things in this boring pot boiler, which lacks the insights and the spectacular beauty we expect from Murnau. Farrell's character has no backbone, so we wake up to a "real man" (Mac) to take Kate away. With audacious skepticism, the film lost its narrative progress. The father's conversion at the end of the film is unrealistic and incredible, which makes for a confrontational denial. This movie is only for the fans of the stars and only the director - general audiences don't have to bother.
