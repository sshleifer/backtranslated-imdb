I attended the premier last night. The movie started with a bang (perhaps due to pre-premier excitement). The audience laughed about 15 minutes, then most of us spent the rest of the time. This movie cannot be compared to _Spinal Tap_ or any of Guest's work unless you want to say _Sons or Provo_ is a very wrong thing. It just got flat, it was dead, it was painful. The story went nowhere, the jokes were slender, even if you were a Mormon and could get all the inside jokes, it felt like a waste of time. There were two redeeming features: Kirby's scene was mocking! And the songs were very clever (just for an LDS audience). So, my recommendations ... Avoid the movie. And if you're Mormon, buy the music CD.
