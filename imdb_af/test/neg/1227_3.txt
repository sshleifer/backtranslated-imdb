I'm rarely motivated to write a review, unless inspired by the quality of the movie. In the case of Comanche Moon, I was so uninspired. I had the need to warn others how bad this TV mini series is. Here are some thoughts. <br /> <br /> The Indians: They came as they were in a Saturday Night Live Skit, which made fun of how Indians talk. When McMurtry writes dialogue in his novels, it reads so interesting; I'm not sure how they ended up with what they got. <br /> <br /> Gus McCrae: Looks like Festus of the old Gunsmoke series. Acting is OK, and the ways of Robert Duvall's McCrae are right, but the look is a sheer comedy cookie. <br /> <br /> Clara: Maybe you can use some dirt or sweat next time. Already in Austin in the summer before air conditioning? I promise you women don't look like that. Do you think they never saw any of Dearwood's episodes? <br /> <br /> Gov. Elisha Pease: Once again when they are in the Governor's office, it feels like a Saturday night Live Skit, and the shit is on the bomb. <br /> <br /> Woodrow Call: Call is the most reasonable character, of course, he speaks so little how can you screw it? But hi, how about the hat? <br /> <br /> Blue Duck: See above and include the fact that he is not even a little scary. They had to get Javier Bardem to play the part. <br /> <br /> The Rangers: Straight from "Oh Brother, Where Art You", I expected George Cloony to come up and break into a song. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I'm too early because the miniseries aren't complete, but I doubt I will look any further. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't expect anyone to have the surprising sense of lonely pigeon, but I look at it and they don't feel like the old west at all.
