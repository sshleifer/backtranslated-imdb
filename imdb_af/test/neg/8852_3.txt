I was so excited to finally watch "Pulse" after receiving it from Amazon, and I must say I was totally disappointed. I think maybe I was prevented. I set expectations by his supporters who simply couldn't be satisfied. Having loved other Asian horrors, I thought I knew it would find a place in my heart. <br /> <br /> The story was slow, painful. I'm a diverse fan of horror. I love the brutal, bloody madness of "The Devil's Rejects" and I love equally the steady, growing macabre of "A Tale of Two Sisters". "Pulse" offered very little of any spectrum. <br /> <br /> Along with the slowness of the plot, it was also astonished. I had no idea why characters are doing what they did and how they would help. The director seemed to have flushed the plot in a sentence or two and the rest was improved by our actors. Unlike a story of two sisters, who also have a very difficult plot line, "Pulse" gets very little clear at the end and I felt frustrated, confused and unimportant in the characters' efforts. My final statement about the plot was his contradiction. Initially, the story seemed to be about the ghosting world and their escape medium is the internet. This is a damn original idea. I like that. But as the plot rises drones, plots and inexplicable events that bring their heads in, it seems the director has switched to an apocalyptic story (as evidenced by the end) that was not yet clear enough to perform. <br /> <br /> I realize the threats of the shots and the setting was deliberate to make the viewer dark and isolated, but the dimness of the movie was only enhanced by the grainy, shady environment. I would admit there was a certain sense of surrealism with the movie, but it might just have left my attention in and out. <br /> <br /> The actions of some characters are also a bit ridiculous, and perhaps if I was more surprised by the story, I could suspend more disbelief, but I was also as unmotivated as some of the characters. As I mentioned earlier, the logic behind what certain characters did was absent and contributed to the incoherence of the plot. Perhaps it was a result of the summary of the plot that the characters are making dubious things. To be honest, I don't really care. <br /> <br /> The acting was decent. Certainly nothing outstanding, but nothing terrible. No outliers on either side of brilliant or ominous. <br /> <br /> Now I will cease to sound so sour and mention that there were a handful of nice moments. One at the end, especially if more of it is kept, I would have enjoyed this movie (almost) completely. I thought when the site was shown, it was pretty disturbing, as well as some of the haunting encounters we had with two main characters. The things that continued between these terrible actions were just too dark, amazing and "WTF" for me to really appreciate. <br /> <br /> Now for something related to the DVD itself ... Magnolia's "Pulse" release comes with captions, yes, but the captions are off. They are not told at the right time of the character's speech. It may sound nit-picking, but it bothered me a bit and it could save others. I think it's the only North American version of the movie, but you also have to handle or watch it. Double click (NO WATCH DUBBING !!!) I tried to keep the movie, I really did. I asked this movie to live up to the hype ... but unfortunately it became flat for me. If you are looking for other creepy Asian theater, I can recommend 'Audition', 'Shutter', 'A Tale of Two Sisters', 'Strange Circus' and 'Marebito'. All that is more is my palette.
