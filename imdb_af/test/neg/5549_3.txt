Herschell Gordon Lewis, a low-budget painter, reaches a new layer (even for him) with "The Gore Gore Girls", a "movie" (snicker) that contains all its technical brands: poor recording sound, poor lighting and OTT gore. It would be tolerable, even a little charming, if the movie had at least an interesting plot ("Blood Feast" in all its ridiculous glory is a good example), but "Girls" is a total snooze. Overall unlikely, private investigator Abraham Gentry (Frank Kress) is recruited by a newspaper reporter to find out who is killing off-form strippers (you will stop caring who the guilty one has been before these two). As before, the appeal is not the plot, but the creative methods of blood loss (including a girl's cloth harnessed with lumberjack) and the occasional flashes of the risqu√©vel ... but it's just not enough to raise. the material above medium.
