I don't know what was worse, the viewer's dope or the stars in this movie that look like dope. Should I believe this woman raised this child for seven years and never noticed the child was a little dark? Must I believe her mother, her father, and her husband never once said. Hmmm, this kid looks a little dark? Should I believe when the courts ordered the mother to see the adopted parent records, Lisa Hartman looked at this wow on her face, when she told her mother, Christopher is half black! What! You really think so. So the grandmother and grandfather not only watched and looked silly, but it was never even called it, but I think we should be surprised and say ... hmmmmm omg he is half black! Totally silly movie, almost embarrassing even to watch!
