If you ever heard the word, "the book is always better than the movie," the heart of darkness is no exception to the rule. I believe it was much easier for me to understand the details of the novel about the movie because I read the book aloud with my English class. We discussed each paragraph in detail so that I understood the concept fairly quickly. I couldn't really understand the plot while watching the movie. It could be because there were no discussions in class, but I suppose that is also because I couldn't paint my own pictures in my mind about the events of the novel. If you are the kind of person who believes in the familiar saying, leave the Heart of the Darkness movie out of your to-do list.
