OK, so my summary line is a cheap trick. But the movie is full of them and it gets ridiculously praised, so ... <br /> <br /> I got this one on TV (uncut, as TV shows all movies here, it's for your Americans who might say I didn't. It didn't like it because I saw a TV version - luckily it's just an American thing, and had no idea what it was. I switched on, caught the last minutes of a show, and the movie started. Within a minute I begged it was a comedy, starting with the particularly ridiculous clich√©d (yes, it's a bad movie inside the movie, but I know, but trying to interest the viewer! T even know why I didn't call channels). And yes, indeed, the movie was a comedy, even though it was an unintended one. <br /> <br /> Marina Zudina is nice enough, but gosh, what a terrible thing! While throwing a stranger in the role, it is clever enough (she doesn't talk like that, but not sorry), but sorry, Marina's dumb play doesn't mean Harpo Marx is put aside. Her play is incessantly funny in many moments, just looking at her as she draws an X in the air while being knocked down by the killer. He wants to kill you, it's not time to play Zorro. We get a lot of the "run up" things that overpower tension, like in the worst slashers, and things like pulling a carpet and a bad guy shooting the other. Ugh! Will Hollywood ever learn? Yet the best / worst pearl has a guy in a bath and in a bath, and I've never seen anyone killed in a bath, but I'm sure you can't do the blue cartoon rays in real life don't see. , do you? And how about the trust of an old man, because he says he is a police spokesman, and doesn't ask him to show your credentials? OK, so he seems to be a real policeman. But still, not to ask for the badge does not make sense (plot-wise, we can always think that the credentials might be ominous, or he could be a crown. Screenwriting 101). And how about the big twist? Don't tell me you didn't see it coming 200km away. <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for poor old Alec Guinness and his useless supplies came. Now I think about this, what's the point of giving him a "Mystery Guest Star" credit ... in the END titles? The movie is over, and there's no more secret. Everyone and their brother identified Guinness. Even non-film buffers will recognize the "old guy of Star Wars", even better this way, so we can pretend it's not the late good actor. <br /> <br /> People now compare it to , of all people, Hitchcock, I suppose John Hitchcock should be the milkman, because let Sir Alfred feel ashamed to see it, let alone do it, and it gets a 6.8 / 10? It is Bottom 100 material! But then we are talking about a rating system that can make The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King look like the third best film ever made (see Top 100). .. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
