Shakalaka Boom Boom is a rip from the movie Amadeus. I personally judge Amadeus as one of my favorites, not only because it is about music, it's my favorite subject, but also because it tells us the true story of a musical genius that is not only remembered for the vast works of beautiful music he did not produce during his lifetime, but for his own self-destructive nature and his tragic death at a young age of 35, which was virtually untapped during his lifetime due to the politics of some people, especially Saliere, the Italian composer , which was jealous of him. <br /> <br /> Personally, I was shocked to see Shakalaka as the director always cut most of the screens of the movie Amadeus. I see the worst kind of plagiarism in this movie and I am skeptical about the kind of movies Bollywood cherishes day by day. The movie is a disaster, the two musicians in the movie give you no sense of realism, the film is tasteless, meaningless and total failure on every score. The only person making an impact is Bobby Deol, who at least knows how to act. Otherwise, the whole role looks like a lot of amateurs. <br /> <br /> The irony is that while watching the movie, the first screen in the movie says that all characters in this movie are fictitious and that any deal with anyone is purely coincidental that is a blatant lie, because all agreements are very clear and it is very meant. I wish I could Darshan and Co. take court, not just for copyright infringement, but also to maim a beautiful artwork.
