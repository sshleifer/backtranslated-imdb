Well, how somebody can actually think this movie is wonderful is so far beyond me ... I can't even understand how anyone can find this movie remotely, the only character that goes for it is the evil supernatural game designer, and it gets old after a while. This movie is so predictable, the punchlines are not funny, they are forced, you see better in the red light district, and the story sucks it is so predictable, you know exactly what is going to happen. Even the characters do not respond as they should, try to go to the hot chick your boss is at work and tell her you will beat 2 crazy chicks with whom you live together at the same time. Her reaction won't be. ) "Okay, let's go to work again." I didn't even laugh at this movie, and I wish I had never seen it or spent 3% renting it, because it's not even worth it. Adam Sandler produced this movie, I lost all respect for him. All his movies are the same, his comedy style has grown old since the Waterboy came out. If I knew Adam Sandler had it before I rented it, I wasted my time on it. This movie is as bad as it can get from every aspect. Ace Ventura was not a clever comedy film, it didn't have a murderer ... but it was original and it was hilarious. I don't beat the movie because it has "low level" humor, I beat it because it sucks, it's a piece of Hollywood shit. If this film is submitted to a production company and you do not have 'ADAM SANDLER', it will be thrown faster than a used condom in the garbage. If you want a good movie about pot culture, see Cheech and Chong, or Whitecastle. If you rent this movie, all you will get is a generic 14-17 year-old comedy with hard rock music at every possible cut. It will scratch your eyes and turn your stomach and comedy that looks like your stoned friend who eats McDonalds for an hour and a half. Don't do this .... for the love of God. This movie sucks, treats it for what it is and looks past all the Hollywood glory behind it. ..... Hercules in New York was the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's actually so bad that it's good. Rather, it was a very expensive movie that sucked as much, if not more.
