Chuck Jones' "Smell-Kitty Kitty" is the cartoon that Pepe Le Pew introduced to the world? sort of. There are some important differences between the Pepe we know and love (or hate, in the case of some people) and the character in this cartoon. For one, the disguised cat that Pepe amorously strives for 'Fragrance-Kitty', is clearly masculine. Also, Pepe is exposed as a fraud whose real name Henry is at the cartoon's climax, his French accent falling away when his wife and family arrive. Pepe is not even the main character here, the focus favors the mission cat who disguises himself as a skunk to scare his enemies. In general, the storyline largely follows the regular format of a Pepe Le Pew cartoon, but Pepe's aggressive courtship lacks the usual wisecracks and straight to camera addresses that make him such a great character. He is also not as attractive as he would be and rather uncomfortably animated. In fact, 'Scent-Kitty Kitty' is a pretty ugly and clumsy looking cartoon. The main source of appeal comes from his original concept at this stage before becoming the template for every Pepe Le Pew cartoon that followed. This subsequent development has denied any fragrant kitty of any impact and for modern viewers it seems like a rather dim Pepe Le Pew with a strange surprise ending. As a child I hated Pepe Le Pew. As an adult, who can appreciate her more sophisticated, verbal, and humorous humor, I love the character and most of his cartoons. 'Smell Kitty' makes me feel like a child again!
