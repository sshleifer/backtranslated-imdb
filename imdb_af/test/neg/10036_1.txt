Are you joking? It's probably the worst, amateur movie I've ever seen. The game was horrible, the acting was worse than terrible and sorry, the man at the picnic speed loading his plate full of food was nowhere useless and the demonic maze and room-cousin who drove Drew was nothing more than comical. When I hit the Bell Hitch, I wanted to believe. I read some literature about it and thought it was possible to be a probable story. But this movie just destroyed it. Ric White (Director, Author, Lead Actor, etc.) takes himself too seriously and I think he gives himself a little more credit than he deserves. Do yourself a favor .... save this one.
