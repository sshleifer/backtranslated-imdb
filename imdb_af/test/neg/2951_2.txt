We're waiting in line to see the good girl, an excellent movie with Jennifer Aniston, advertising a lady with this cheap mock-twenty dollar bill, MANNA FROM THE HEAVEN. "Come and see this movie!" she said. "You will love it!" <br /> <br /> She then introduced us to the director of the film. Now it had to be our first idea. I mean, in how many cinematic situations do you have the director of the movie in the lobby praying to see it? "Is this a Christian movie?" I asked, not really to care for one way or another. I love Jesus. No shame about it. "No!" she said defensively. What a little shit. <br /> <br /> This movie is BAD. So bad. And it's not just because of the obvious Christian agenda, but because of the terrible dialogue, which varies between wood and overstated and the obvious shortage of an editor. The movie is far too long. If it was an hour and a half then I might not have had to visit the suicide prevention center after I saw the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm actually lying. Look, after an hour of this rubbish we sank into SWIMFAN. At least with SWIMFAN we know it's garbage before we enter to see the movie. We know how to strengthen ourselves. And SWIMFAN has warm semi-naked people. The only thing half naked in this movie is the despair of the stars, whose obvious shortage of essays is nothing but hidden. And the actress who fades the nun? It is called a personality. Get one. <br /> <br /> Those thankfully thanking for ticket sales in the lobby told me that if I love my GREAT GREAT GREEK MARRIAGE, then I will * love * (their emphasis, not mine). MAN OF HEAVEN. Right. More like, "If you like GLIT, you'll love MAN OF HEAVEN." And Mariah could actually perform better than any of the clowns from this movie. If it's not an insult, I don't know what is. <br /> <br /> I've had enough lying. Look at movies, but don't see the bad people. This is definitely one of the bad ones. MAN OF THE HEAVEN needs some divine intervention.
