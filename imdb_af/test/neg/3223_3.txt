Well, I'm a big fan and follower of Elizabeth Berkley. I bought it on DVD from eBay for my boyfriend's birthday. We sat down to see it and it was so boring. I don't even remember laughing. It's only about an hour and a half and it seems to end forever. But Elizabeth is wonderful in this. Maybe it's just because I'm a big Elizabeth Berkley fan. If she wasn't there, I wouldn't have watched it, but every time she came to my face, I got up. Unfortunately, even Elizabeth can't save this movie. Just the overall story and terrible comedy make it a movie you'd rather miss if you waste half an hour of your life. It's a very forgetful movie.
