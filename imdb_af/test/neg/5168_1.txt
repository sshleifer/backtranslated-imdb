From all the bad comments about this movie and adding it up, I feel the same way. The Australians may seem weak, but they were brave soldiers. In this movie it was very terrible and too graphic. I didn't see enough heroism, just more cowardice that is breath because it's nothing of what I read. We do not need the extreme force, so we can use our lively imagination of what they have gone through. It's like private Ryan, where the Nazi pushes his knife slowly into the soldier. For example, Mel Gibson is an excessive director for his movies, not because of violence, but for the level of historical inaccuracy. Letters from Iwo Jima were one of the war films that were close to history (although I could be wrong), except for Flags of our Fathers and Bridge of the River Kwai. It's better to read it, it's an insult to the victims and the cases if you don't say it right. And the movie goes too long, there was nothing interesting about the dialogue and not enough retribution from the Aussies to kill Japanese. soldiers. Just read history on the internet, mags and in books. Movies always kill the feeling of realization. What they did to POWs in Singapore and the Philippines was just terrible for civilians. It just makes me proud to see things, but the bad things are beaten, but movies like this ruin it.
