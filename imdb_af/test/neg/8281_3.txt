This movie is slow. This movie is cheap. This film makes the 13th look like a Best Picture on Friday. The acting is shit. The special effects are crap. No one dies for about 40 minutes and all the people are doing bad. The only thing that saves it is the ability to make you laugh at all the stupidity that is going on. The funniest part looks at the heroine "fighting off" the attacker. She had to be trained, but she fought like a 70-year-old. They spend useless scenes on people who don't die and no scenes on people who die to the point where you don't even know why they die. I love slashers, but it's just crap.
