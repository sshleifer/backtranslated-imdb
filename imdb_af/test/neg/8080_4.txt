** IMPORTANT SPOILERS ** Just look at the action sequences, not the story or what's in it. "Nature Unleashed: Fire" has one of the longest and most ominous ends in modern film history. We have the fearless Ranger Jake, Bryan Genesse, who is leading this trio of hysterical cyclists in all patients to the safety of an explosive steam coal mine! This during a furious forest fire! It seems that Ranger Jake, with all his knowledge of the outdoors, did not realize that a mine bowl leaking with dangerous and explosive methane gas is the last place to go if all the bushes are burning! <br /> *** SPOILERS OF THIS POINT *** All of this started some time ago when Ranger Jake tried to save the game, not on the ball less Tiny , Chris Harz aka "The Sherd", let him through his fingers and fall to his death at the bottom of the mine disc, or does he! Although we were thrilled with the forest fires for the first half of the movie, it wasn't a surprise. The Tiny was all the culprit! As you would expect in movies like this little one, it seems to be made of hardened steel, as nothing that ever happened to him exploded, the explosions as well as the impulse exploded, the mad miner could stop. <br /> <br /> For Tiny's revival, or resurrection, Ranger Jake became involved in the rescue of bikers Chris Mel Sharon and Marcus, Josh Cohen Melanie Lewis Anastasia Griffith and Ross McCall, who were caught in the bush with fires who are breaking around them. With the usual know it all-Marcus among the cyclists won't do things as smoothly as Ranger Jake wanted them to go. Marcus, not just eggs on the gentle Chris to do something stupid, jumps with his bike over a 10 foot pile of logs, but the man breaks his leg. It makes it almost impossible for Ranger Jake to air Chris before the fires consume him as well as his fellow cyclists! <br /> <br /> For the rest of the movie, Ranger Jake, who puts him in control, boner beans in his quest to save himself and get caught and lost in the forest bikers! All of this ended with Jake's brilliant idea of ​​hiding in a dangerous and deserted mine shaft with the rescue party to save them if they just stayed and in the open space where the rescue team could find them! <br /> <br /> Although he was supposed to be the life of the party or movie, Tiny has overcame all his efforts to be another indestructible super villain as a man who has too much time in spent sun. The makeup work on Tiny was so outrageous that he looked like he had pressed a pot of spaghetti sauce over his head instead of burning it to a crisp. <br /> <br /> Ranger Jake came as something somewhat naive or slowed down in her by the dangerous Tiny in always trying to save the rattling psycho who never hid his feelings about what he had in mind for the game by the rules Forest Ranger. In fact, Ranger Jake actually encouraged Little to do both him and the cyclists by showing him how incompetent he was to save them. The fact that Ranger Jake was successful wasn't because he was so clever, but because Tiny, despite his indestructibility, was so brainless!
