For me, it's not a good TV show, animated or otherwise. However, this is irritating to the nth grade. There are a few reasons for this, in no particular order. First, the intro of one of the most sensible, and annoying characters ever, Batmite. This character does not serve any purpose for the performance whatsoever. Although it is meant as comical relief, it doesn't work like that. Secondly, the Joker. I thought it's really ridiculous to let his character loose with that ridiculous laugh after almost every sentence. talk about repetitive. It gets old really fast. also don't think the real actor had the character. It just doesn't sound like the joker. Sound.lastly, they have Robin look like a full dork. Other than these problems, the show is not that bad. But it's big enough trouble to drastically lower the likability factor. For me, Batman's new adventures are a 3/10, at best.
