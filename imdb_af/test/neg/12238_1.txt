If it were Jack Black's foremost actor, I would stay away from this movie immediately. It actually makes some of its movies good compared to this movie. This movie should be filmed as a cartoon for ages 3-8 and it would have been much better. This is nothing but a bunch of the dumbest sketches of other movies made up to make one big mess. The movie seems to have been shot in about one day, without thinking about it. There are a few times where it seems or maybe there is a turning point and the movie will actually actually plot the movie or at least a storyline, but the stupid sketch inserted just ruins the whole movie.
