I will never go to another Tarantino movie again. The whole movie was worthless. My wife and I both regret that we have not risen and leave at the first indication of what the film is really going to be (which is still difficult to determine, as it was such a ridiculous story ... blood, intestines, and violence was the only true theme, but we hoped there would be something around the corner. Unfortunately, there was no reason to make sense! We mumbled, along with many other people in the audience who walked out of the theater, "it was disgusting", "what a waste of time", "I had to go out", "where was the comedy", "It was pathetic ", etc. It actually made us, the audience, our aversion and the feeling that we were just thoroughly ripped off. The only thing in the film's merit was the costume and the acting ability of almost everyone in the movie .... there just wasn't a plot / script worthy of their talents. I rate it a 1 because there is no 0. I can't understand how anyone can evaluate it higher than 0!
