I am currently 22 years old and remember to watch this movie in theaters when it first came out. You really heard me, I was 5 years old, and yet I still remember what I saw so many years ago. Was it a mystical journey through the fantastic world of Mark Twain's creativity? ... No, it was a very nasty movie about Mark Twain's dark, depressing, and even suicidal side. One scene that still bothered me was a particularly strange scene in which Mark Twain played the organ at his own funeral. <br /> <br /> Would an adult enjoy this movie? Well, this movie probably offers some interesting views that a person with a working knowledge of Mark Twain's writing may enjoy; But trust me, "Adventures" is NOT the movie you want to use to introduce your young children to Mark Twain.
