OK, I admit I still associate Sophie Marceau with La Boum. This was the main reason I was going to see this movie. But it was so boring that I almost fell asleep. Sorry, but her talent as an actress is not very convincing. Furthermore, this film was presented as outstanding special effects and CGI. Yes, for a B-Movie it's not that bad. Having seen her in 'Marquise' a few years ago (also a very crazy movie), I thought she would play more convincingly. But La Boum (and perhaps the James Bond "the world is not enough") seems to be the only good movies with her. Is it her talent, does she have a bad taste when choosing her films or just accident?
