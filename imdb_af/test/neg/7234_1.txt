Greetings, Moviegoers! As I look at Octopus II, I think of the inherent lameness of the Octopus / Croc / Dino Horror Genre. Many filmmakers can blame the bad acting, or a poorly constructed plot, for reasons that cause the OCD movie to faint. These reasons may indeed be fluctuating factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD film at the heart of the lameness. <br /> <br /> You see, technology does not yet exist for a realistic, life-size OCD and CGI technology currently used by studios has the ability to blend in with real world environments and characters. Even with clever cinematography, you can shoot as many as half-dark depths of the ocean / half-dark forest / half-dark cave / half-dark passage before the Sci-Fi aficionado gets completely bored with the genre (the OCD sub-genre, it is). <br /> <br /> What can be done, you ask? I would not suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness, but another avenue should be investigated. We can't really go back to the days of the "Fade-to-Black" cue that someone was killed. Or can we? If we cannot reach the goal of realism, we have to compensate in other ways, such as plot, innuendo and photo-ingenuity. <br /> <br /> It will be through genius and alternative methods that the disease of lameness, as common for the OCD subgenre, will be cured.
