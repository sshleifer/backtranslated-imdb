That's exactly what the title tells you ... an island inhabited by fishermen. Shipwrecked doctor Claudio Cassinelli and crew land on the island, they were either counted down by the fishermen or roped in the work for the treasure hunt lunatic Richard Johnson. Cassinelli discovers that Johnson, who believes he has found the lost city of Atlantis, swept the sliding scientist Joseph Cotten and his daughter Barbara Bach for 15 years so that the fishermen can uncover a treasure chest under the sea. Cotten, of course, is a complete mold. Bach and Cassinelli have good chemistry. This insanity is directed by Sergio Martino and is not surprising without merit. It is fast, reasonably well behaved and the fishermen seem pretty convincing (although it is unlikely that anyone can prove these things to be like real fishermen). There is an excellent music score by Luciano Michelini.
