It is really easy to toast, fried, flay, and otherwise burn this movie for all its abundant mistakes. It was made by high school students and faculty and a whole community; it shows! Certainly, I can investigate the writing that is just ridiculous. A monster created from the rubbish of a growing Californian city begins to waste and eat rubbish bins all over the city. Soon, this great winged animal will no longer destroy buildings and even play the "beauty and the beast" act with a young high school girl. Fortunately for her, there is a gang of guys, her former boyfriend named "The Penguin", and the town got drunk to help her. The direction is terrible, the production values ​​are just terrifying, the acting non-existent, and the pace slow. The movie is hard to go through - period. But it is said, it is also a miracle of a movie when you think this thing is made by a whole community. You can see all the collective efforts of the actors, the real mayor and the actual firefighters and policemen, to the area shots used. I was also very surprised at all the local businesses credited at the end of the film to help finance somehow. Looking at the movie from the perspective, it is indeed quite an achievement. I didn't know anything about it before I sat down and watched. Now that I've found out something about it, I'm impressed. But make no mistake - I have no ... NO ... desire to put it through again.
