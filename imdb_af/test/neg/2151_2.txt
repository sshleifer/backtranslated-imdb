Not sure if it's just a bad movie or it's a mockery of a "B" Western. Story line was so-so, but the filming, editing and acting were just bad. Plus the music in the background was annoying to no end, too loud and just non-stop. Many times you couldn't make the background music dialogue. I'm in SASS (Single Action Shooting Society) and shoot some Old West with them, and many of the actors are members of this group, so I bought it. If you have no interest in this group of people or sports, you will probably not even have this little interest in helping the movie. The actions of even veteran actors (especially Stella Stevens) have also left much to be desired.
