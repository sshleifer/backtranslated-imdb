No one is going to miss THE SQUALL for a good movie, but it's probably a memorable one. Once you've taken the warm-blooded gypsy girl in Myrna Loy's performance as Nubi, you probably won't forget the experience. When this film is made, the exotic is beautiful girl. Loy still cast as strange vixens, often Asian and usually sinister. She's probably in the eye here. Her skin looks dark and her hair curled. In most scenes, she is barefoot and carries a little more than a skirt and loose chest blouse while wearing nothing but a pattern towel in one scene. I think I'm focusing on Miss Loy's appearance, as she is by far the best if it is not the only reason to adjust and watch these critical antiques. You will probably not be lured by the dialogue, which is hopeless. In a typical section, Nubi looks out of the window at the caravan room and becomes poetic: "All the cigars sing them. Weird and sad. If the big sun burns, and when the light moon looks behind the cloud and breathes the air cold as death, they sing. "Poetic, or what? Lovers of press prose will have a field day. I can't help but wonder if Miss Loy in her later years chose not to remind her involvement in this project. <br /> <br /> Like so many early talks, this one was an adaptation of a recent Broadway success. . The stage version opened in November 1926 at the 48th Street Theater and ran for more than a year. The play has caused a well-known episode that humorous and theater critic Robert Benchley, who was known to have a dislike of characters who spoke in thick dialect or pidgin English. According to many repeated anecdotes, Benchley rage uncomfortably by opening this show. The Spanish village institution (for some reason to a Hungary movie for the movie) donated the actors to practice their accents with varying degrees of success, but Benchley's patience reached his limit when he went on a family meal order. open a breakthrough and shout an actress dressed like a gypsy girl shouting into the room "Help! Help! He's calling me!" She throws herself at the feet of the mistress of the household and calls, "My Nubi! My good girl, I stay here!" At that time, Mr. Benchley got up and announced to his companion, "My Bobby. I'm a bad boy. I'm going now," and leaving the theater. <br /> <br /> The movie version offers many examples of unintentional humor, but never comes near Benchley's level of white. The melodramatic plot relates to the Lajos family: father Joseph, mother Mary and son Paul, a student at the nearby college. We will consider this prosperous "upper middle class" family since they are landowners with servants and all the amenities of life, but their comfortable existence is suddenly thrown into turmoil when a gypsy caravan arrives in town and their home is invaded. by yes, Nubi the nubile gypsy girl. She comes to their door in the storm of the title - symbolizing stormy emotions, I dare immediately. The girl flies an abusive relationship and prays for the sanctuary. After considering the case, the Lajos family agreed to hide her from her angry lover, who appeared shortly afterwards but turned away. Nubi becomes a servant in the household. Goodness motivates the family's decision to take her, but soon that Nubi, who does not mean anything, paid them back by deceiving every capable man in the area, starting with Lajos, Peter's servant, and then working on to Paul Paul Nubi breaking Paul's relationship with his fiance Irma (played by Loretta Young, still a teenager), causing him to come out of school and ask him to buy her jewelry through the savings of the family's virgin Lena ( ZaSu Pitts) to steal. Lena, for her part, is still grieving, seducing and letting go of her own fianc√©, Peter, by Nubi when she changed her attention to Paul. Eventually, Nubi set her sights on the father familias Joseph, and I think if the run time was longer, she would also have gone to Oom Dani, Maria, the village priest and God knows who else. <br /> <br /> I think it goes without saying that a scenario like this one easily lends itself to parody, but during the first half THE SQUALL practices the unmistakable fascination of a day's soap: we look, hypnotize, like the Bad Girl's play on the men works people and destruction like an irresistible force of nature (almost like a storm! Ah-ha, another metaphor!). But as the plot machines grind on the camp, fun fades. During the later scenes, Nubi is emphasized and the focus is on the dysfunctional dynamics of the Lajos family, and after a while these people become a real draw. The boy in particular behaves like an absolute heel, but the parents never admit it or their own shortcomings. everything we have told is the fault of Nubi, it is not a good sting. <br /> <br /> The men of the role play are boring. Apart from me. Loy is the only actress who can perform in talkies, ZaSu Pitts, as usual. The mother of the Lajos household is played by Alice Joyce, a lingering silent star who was out of element with roles, and who retired shortly thereafter. Loretta Young's freshness gives a nice contrast to Nubi's dark allure, but her line readings are so uncomfortable, it's kind of engaging. No, there is only one reason to watch this movie, and that is Nubi himself. I can't think of another actress who could have played this stupid role and also got half. However, I am not an objective observer. I have a desperate lover on Myrna Loy and will see her in anything, even the SQUALL.
