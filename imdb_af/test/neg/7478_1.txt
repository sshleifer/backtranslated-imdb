For a while when I was in between jobs, I had a habit of watching all the late-night talks. For a while I had a good choice: Conan, Leno, Letterman, Ferguson, Kimmel ... <br /> <br /> Until I reached the time of 1:30. The time between Conan and X-Files, on SciFi. And the only show at that time was (and is still peculiar) Carson Daly. <br /> <br /> His performance first throttled me. Young, by chance dressed, and with the hip tree of an MTV host, I thought Carson would bring a younger aesthetic to late night. I couldn't be wrong anymore. <br /> <br /> He has no comic timing. His jokes are undoubtedly unfunny, and his monologue is a painful issue of self-conscious chatting. I began to think he was simply unable to deliver comedy (and that's right, he wasn't), but it became obvious that the writers had to have it for him. The writing was idiotic and much to persuade and the sketch was screaming badly. And at the end of the show was in the studio, authors Carson drank on each set of alcohol on the set, with an unconscious Carson grabbing the emaciated cheek to the cheek as he was interviewing. <br /> Zero maintenance skills. None. He tries to be friendly / chatty, but becomes rude and rude. He speaks too much. He cut off his guests. He asks them rude or embarrassing - if he can have a question to ask them not at all. And as someone has noticed, the guests literally hide on him or in their seats in the seat. This is clearly uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Now the show left the studio and looks like it's shot on one handy camera. Even so, Carson refuses to take the hint of NBC. At one stage, Carson didn't even get a camera, he had to film for himself! Wake up, Carson ... the handwriting is all over the wall. <br /> <br /> I see the show is made by Carson. I can only imagine that this is the reason it is still on the air, he pays it himself.
