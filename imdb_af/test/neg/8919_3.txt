Today, dying begins as honorable Harlan criminal criminals (producer Steven Seagal), hired by sinister businessman Max Stevens (Kevin Tighe) to drive a security vehicle with $ 20 million in the back of the point "A" Las Vegas casino around 'B' He sounds right right, well, what did Max forget to tell Harlan that the money was stolen and that he had just become the escape manager in an armed robbery Bummer. Harlan when local police catch him and has been in prison for a long time, but Harlan hid the money before being caught and with a good $ 20 million at stake and inexplicably that Harlan should see his back as The villains want it as government agents Harlan boasts Ice Kool (!) (Anthony 'Teach' Criss) in jail and they can both escape at what point Harlan is looking for a revenge ... <br /> <br /> Photos and directors of Don E. FauntLeRoy one should say that the shot in Eastern Europe is straight-forward A-video stock movies that Steven Seagal specializes in these days don't get any better. Today you are a good thing. It's a horrible movie, just like it really is. The script by producer Danny Lerner, Kevin Moore and Les Weldon, gives Seagal a new kind of character to get its non-existent acting skills around, that of a criminal rather than a state agent / policeman / soldier / one man army -clich√© what he usually plays. In fact, if you were a charity, you could say Today you are a rip-off of Mel Gibson's excellent thriller Payback (1998) where he also played such a good job. While Payback was a wonderful compromise, it was difficult to play. Unfortunately, Seagal is horrible, he has no screen presence or threat, and the audience is never quite sure whether he is meant to be a bad man or not. For example, his character is initially like a contemporary Robin Hood, as he steals from the rich drug dealers and scumbags to give to the poor (as well as to make neat profits) that are just ridiculous on their own, but then it turned Seagal and murder many people who contravene the equivalent criminal with moral allegations that the film has gone so far in the first place. The story is full of holes, for example Agent Knowles is contacted by the runway Harlan & is then touched by her bowed superior to meet him. It seems that he found out by tapping her phone. In what case did her boss not use the information he needed to capture Harlan? The story surprised the usual dull predictable mere struggle over a lot of money with surprise. The investigating agent is actually a bad guy! Wow, I didn't see how I should say. <br /> <br /> Director FauntLeRoy slows everything down to a snail's pace. Today you feel what it's going on forever, the action scenes are also badly lacking in entertainment value. The rare battle scenes aren't good, most are shot in the shade, cut very fast and edited or with the camera behind Seagal's character doubling the fact that most stunting is done here is with " n double. Seagal looks greasy and out of shape and uses long-haired overcoats to try and hide it, don't. In the beginning there is a nice cool car ride through the streets of Las Vegas. I thought Today You Die might be good, but the whole series seems to have been stolen from another action movie called Top of the World (1997). It's about a Las Vegas casino robbery, as well as using footage of the movie. Today You Die also edit plays from the Charlie Sheen action film No Code of Conduct (1998), the Jean-Claude Van Damme action film The Order (2001) and the Wesley Snipes prison-based action film Undisputed (2002) so much from today that you die is original imagery is anyone's guess. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is good, as it is made up of four separate films that own visuals are just about skillful and consistent enough. All the footage of the American locations is obviously lifted from the films already mentioned with all the original footage at the cheapest in Bulgaria. The rap style music that is rubbish today is a pity for the road. The play is poor and Seagal runs as usual through its lines. <br /> <br /> Today you are a very bad movie made up of other bad action movies, Seagal looks old and fat, the action scenes are average at best and most of the story is pretty random and it comes smoothly not together. One to avoid unless you're a sore Seagal fan, even if such an animal ...
