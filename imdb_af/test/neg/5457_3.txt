TV director uses astral projection to kill people using the shape of the blue man. <br /> <br /> Dull disruptive horror movie sitting right in front of your eyes and wondering why you see it. At the end, I put the film through and I can no longer give you a flowing version of what the film is about, because I still distracted my attention from other things. <br /> <br /> I really can't recommend it. I think my feelings are best summed up by the fact that I paid a dollar for the DVD as a dual feature and I feel kind of ripped off.
