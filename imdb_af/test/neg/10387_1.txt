This movie has very few moments of real drama. After the opening, the film descended into a spiral that we didn't quite take to hell and looking back was the pure purgatory. The acting was more terrible than the subject of the movie and sometimes I couldn't stop laughing. The continuity between some of the screens was frightening - characters disappeared without explanation to be replaced only by other characters. It was certainly a spoof of The Exorcist. The gathering place at the church had to be full of brass, the day Mr. Russo reported this one. Do I speak Latin too? A tu Brutus.
