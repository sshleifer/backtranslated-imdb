Okay, last night, August 18, 2004, I had the clear dissatisfaction with Meet Bebble during a performance of the movie The Manson Family at the Three Penny in Chicago as part of the Chicago Underground Film Festival. Here's what to say about it. First, the movie is a clear ripe of every Kenneth Anger, Roman Polanski, Oliver Stone and Terry Gilliam movie I've ever seen. Secondly, in a short Q & A session after the show, Van Bebble immediately said that he never made contact with the real Manson family members or Charlie himself, and they called them liars and said he didn't want to do anything with them. The film is based on his (Van Bebble's) taking the trial. everything from his living room on TV and in the news (and I assume from the autobiography and the book Helter Skelter aimed directly at the narrative). So I asked if he wanted to offer the outsider, MTV, sex drugs and rock-roll version, and not necessarily the true story. This question, of course, began to scream at the horrible director who started screaming, "F *** you, make the f ***, that's the truth! All those other movies are bullsh **!" <br /> <br /> Well, anyway, I didn't even think about how ridiculous it was until the next day I read the tagline for the movie: "You've heard the laws of the story ... Now hear the story as it is told by the Manson family. "Excuse me, if this man has never spoken to the family and regard them as liars he does not want to do, how can he, in God's name, tell the story tell them! This is the most ridiculous statement I've ever heard! Of course, the film focused on the sex drugs and rock-roll hearing that it had no trouble attracting the small, dim light theater and was even more clearly seen by the sex drugs and rock-roll thoughts of a man who can't even see his own movie without getting up every ten minutes to get more beer or shouting a kind of Rocky Horroresque call line to the actors on the screen. This film reaches a little more than dreaming of the public's image of real-life events (which have shaped the state of America and most of the world today) into a kind of Slasher / Comic Book / Porn / Rape fantasy created by " a natural level individual is dreamed. br /> <br /> The movie was definitely very impressive to watch. The soundtrack was refreshing as it contained real samples of Charlie's work with the family of his Lie album. The editing was fun and brave to simulate the misleading uncertainty of most modern music videos. All in all, this movie would have made a much better addition to the Mtv catalogs than to the Underground Film Festival or the minds of any intellectual observers. I felt like I was a midnight Rocky Horror, probably the best part of the experience, the way the audience was dressed and worn. The role play was very good, except for Charlie, who looked more like a stoned Dungeons and Dragons enthusiast than the real role he portrayed. The descriptions that gave him the film as full of energy, threw out ten things with you and were very physical about it, did not match all the slow, funny and chubby performances actually offered. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film basically explains itself as Sadie (or perhaps it is Linda) declared at the end: "You can write a lot of bullsh ** books or a bunch of bullsh ** movies ... etc .. Etc. Etc. "As an example. Even the disclaimer "Based on a True Story" is giving away a dead, suggesting that somewhere under this psychedelic rubbish dump is the foundation of a real story with content that will make and make a difference in the world. All you have to do is add a little alchemy to the truth, or actually, you can just avoid it and read a book. <br /> <br /> All I can say is when the movie ended, I got a free beer, so I'm glad I went, but not so glad I spent 15 bucks on my ticket to to tell you that I need to close the f *** to ask the director a question. Peace.
