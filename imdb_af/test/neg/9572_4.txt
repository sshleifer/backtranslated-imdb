I had to lower my rating of this movie to a 4 because of the terrible soundtrack. I'm pretty sure it wasn't a problem with me or the band, because some actors and the soundtrack sound good. But most of the actors' voices are distorted or distorted by recognition, especially for non-British. <br /> <br /> There are many cute twists that make it a pleasant movie that ends up in Bosnia. - But much of the humor was lost in the sound.
