Flatland is one of my favorite books, so I'm looking forward to this movie. Unfortunately, the movie is absolutely horrible. The dialogue is so bad, improvisation seems to be half the time. The new storyline makes me think they took the book and a few newspapers, threw them into a blender and used what came out for the script. It is a disgrace to the book and independent filmmaking. The only reason I could even get through the film was my hope that it would be better. Unfortunately, it just got worse, climbing into a really delayed end. <br /> <br /> That's not to say EVERYONE about the movie is bad. The CG is acceptable, in a 1990's "Reboot" kind of way I assume is where they go. And I suppose you can't go wrong with "people" half-chopped and spitting all over the blood.
