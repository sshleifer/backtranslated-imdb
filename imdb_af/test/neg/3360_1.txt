Jack Frost returns with an army of Styrofoam pallets that can only be filled by being shot with super-sweepers loaded with margaritas. How about a plot? The film depends on such a ridiculous point of view that it hardly increases an eyebrow when characters with a BBQ pliers are murdered and illustrated by roots. You can even say the whole movie skate on thin ice (ba-tree-tish). <br /> <br /> There are some fantastic one-linens including a comment about the Murderous Coconut Shark. <br /> <br /> Reasonable times are difficult, but they do not apologize for the willingness of the actors to take part in such an absolute tribulation. <br /> <br /> For fans who want to see Jack Frost, be prepared to accept him as just a phallic root that shakes the beach with curly voice over.
