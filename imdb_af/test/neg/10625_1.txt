I got this movie as a birthday gift because all my friends know I'm a big fan of low budget Horror flicks. Kaufman Studios has always made the cheese-like movie that made. I loved watching their movies at home on raining with my family ... until I saw Bugged ... WHAT HAPPENED? <br /> <br /> This movie started out with a pretty good concept to change bugs and even added a bit of clever comedy, but overall writing is bad and it was number one. Ronald K. Armstrong must first learn to become a better writer before becoming a movie maker. After reading the credits we discovered, he gave himself the most important role in the film!?! two words Mr. director "acting lessons" ok? Mr. Armstrong joins the ranks of other writers / directors who cast themselves into their own movies and it's number two. <br /> <br /> The only thing I believed saved this movie, the artistic camera work and the musical score, (let's hear it for the crew!) The role players of other actors in the beginning This production is a bit cold, really warmed up to the middle and end of this production. Everyone pulled together and helped to pull off this movie. Ronald Armstrong may not have the talent to ever become a decent director or actor, but I will tell him. He seems to know how to organize people to get everyone together and pull off his productions. <br /> <br /> This film, which I have to say, can be an inspiration for a young filmmaker who dreams of making their own movie, because if Mr. Armstrong could pull it, anyone else could. If you get a chance to see this movie, look for the goal of being inspired to do better in the future. Hollywood needs bigger and better Horror Flicks to keep this genre from the grave.
