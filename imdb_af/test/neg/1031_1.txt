Here's an overview of a typical Rachael Ray Show: <br /> <br /> 1. The horrible theme song starts playing, and Rachael descends with her Snapcrotch outfit in this bizarre airport. 2. She starts running to scream and / or insult the audience, then screams that they sit down. 3. An uncomfortable monologue. <br /> <br /> (The following is in any order) 4. A segment topping Rachael's own horn (ie "I lost 500 pounds with Rach's recipes," Rachael Ray, my life, Rachael's Fashion Tips 5. "A completely useless DIY tip (that is, how to engrave words in the dishes, how to use your washing machine as a salad spinner, how to build a tube of lipstick with a light on it). 6. Unleashing a terrible recipe for the unsuspecting audience (first-shot reaction shots are never shown.) 7. A famous hostess with an awkward interview, followed by a few clear-cut questions 8. A person who gets help from one of the Rachael's cronies (ie I say yes to everything woman, I have nothing but ladies, and I can't get time to make makeup housewife). they would do without you Rachael. <br /> Reasons why this show like the plague should be avoided: 1. Fakeness: Rachael Ray claims the entire show is unscripted. Many people who attended the performances of the show claimed that the entire show was being written. Many of these same people also mentioned that there is even a very strict dress code for the show. <br /> <br /> 2. Her performance is overloaded: Wherever Oprah, the highest-rated promoter of all time, has a definite theme for her performance, Rachael runs like an ADHD soft drink on crack . Her shows might mean 10, short, worthless segments, a show. The second time you get fashion tips from Kojo, and the next Rachael is going to make brutal "Spanish" sweet peppers with Manchego cheese, and the next will be a huge anaconda on stage, and the next, well, you get the picture. <br /> <br /> 3. Rachael is a poor host with bad ideas. Apart from her timetable personality, Rachael's hosting capability is at its worst. Her questions for her celebrity guests are poor and often not relevant to the interview, and her segments are unattractive and offer little educational or humorous value. <br /> <br /> Finally, you don't have to waste your time with this lock. It will be canceled soon.
