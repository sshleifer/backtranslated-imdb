Mexican 'classic' was the third entry into the Aztec Mummy series. As you soon notice, this movie is nothing but a classic, but rather a movie that deliberately tries to turn you around. <br /> <br /> Some scientists want to steal Aztec's treasure from a grave, but to guard that grave is the walking toilet paper commercial: The Aztec Mummy. Knowing that he can't beat the mummy, he builds a robot and a very bad one. We just see Mr. Robot in the last line, as he climbs around, and battles with the Aztec Mummy. <br /> <br /> I've seen quite a few funny Sci-Fi movies, hell most Sci-Fi movies I see are common, but this one, because it's the whole duration of 64 Minuites, the worst movie I've seen, with Fubar in a near second time. <br /> <br /> Finally: Don't waste your time.
