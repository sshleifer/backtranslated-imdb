"Stealing Time" actually dates back to 2001 when it was secretly titled "Rennie's Landing". What explains how director Marc Fusco could afford this role of established television / film actors in what is, of course, a very low budget output. About ten minutes into the movie you understand why this thing never got a theater release after making the film festivals several years ago. <br /> <br /> The recent distribution by Franchise Pictures probably reflects a perception that the rising popularity of some cast members can be hampered to recover from the modest production costs. Although not a good addition to someone's resumption, young actors did worse when they were desperately looking for work of any kind. <br /> <br /> Peter Facinelli, Ethan Embry, Scott Foley and Charlotte Ayanna play colleagues they do an early "Big Chill" reunion and compare war stories about the failure of reality to measure their dreams. <br /> <br /> Nothing else happens, absolutely nothing. Yes, Alec (Facinelli) dreams of a liquor store and a bank robbery, which is then "cheap and ugly" staged for completely inappropriate music. This is the least strained bank work since W.C. Velds was waiting in "The Bank Dick". <br /> <br /> If anyone can indicate in "Stealing Time" anytime something really happens, I would like to know, because as far as I can tell, the whole movie doesn't happen. Perhaps Fusco tries to say something profound about the control of his life before it is too late, through incessant visual reflection. Like the "St Elmo's Fire", the movie is littered with every profound thought ever expressed by a young adult who left the ivory tower to experience the real world for the first time. <br /> <br /> I felt Fusco was going for a kind of Howard Hawks Young Professionals in Action "Angels Only Wings" motif. Then I'm sure I read a lot too much in the movie. After all, things actually happen to Howard Hawks movies. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
