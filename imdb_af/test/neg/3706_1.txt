The Capture Of Bigfoot is one of the silliest and worst movies of all time. I love Sasquatch and Bigfoot movies, but this one is just a brand new waste of your time. Terrible, Terrible, Terrible! I watched this movie last night and that was all I could do to watch. I understood that this strange crazy man wanted to catch Bigfoot, but that was the only thing that made sense in this movie. It did have some entertaining parts. There was this very cheese and crown disco club with very bad disco dancing long ago in the movie. I think the director tried to fill time. The worst thing was how the Bigfoot looks. The obvious man in a suit looks like a pink faux fur Bigfoot. It was laughable. If you want to see a very bad Bigfoot movie, then I suggest you buy this movie. Staff I messed up my time and my money on this one!
