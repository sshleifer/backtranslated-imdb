In a word, god-horrible ... too many plot holes. Um, yes ... Who takes their child to dig a dead body in the middle of the night? And how about his wife who steals the skeleton. Who does this? why did the shrinkage stick in the neck? and that whole dog thing .. i mean, really! With Sparrow, from the beginning, only the tension for me completely destroyed. I mean, if he tells the story, he clearly learned to tell it, so there's no chance he'll come up. Where's the tension there? <br /> <br /> Of course, you expect plot holes in a movie like this. But there is so much that I have completely lost from the story because of them. What kind of name is Fingerling? Or Toppsy? Why did the woman dig the body? (Who does this?) Or go alone in that crazy, haunting asylum? and where do all those candles come from? Why does the author have his PO BOX in the freaking book ??? I mean come on ... And the book just goes to the bookshop next door to the woman's bakery? Away to convenience ... Oh and happy birthday Honey, here's a book about a serial killer. What a GIFT gift! The book is like 20 pages, half of which is empty, and it leaves him freaking FOREVER to read it. If he was really obsessed with this book, wouldn't he read it in one shot? <br /> <br /> A little convenient for him to clash his future wife (a cookie!) about 23 seconds after being released from a mental hospital. how old did he play? 36 ?? <br /> <br /> Was I the only one in the end who cared for the bus to actually run the man? It is not nice if you root the protagonist to eventually bite it. <br /> <br /> It seems as if it was written by the committee. I think the first concept probably had nothing to do with number 23. ... They seem to need a hitchhook to lure the audience to think there was a supernatural thing going on when it eventually had nothing to do with anything. I mean, I didn't expect the Godfather, and nothing, but everything about this movie was a total decay. Without all the numerology stuff, this movie might actually be good, instead of a cut Se7 knockoff. <br /> <br /> Not scary, unintentionally hilarious and otherwise a total snoozer.
