During the university, we played Professor Philosophy, Mr.R, our "Roger & Me" as a whole. It was at a time when the obese misfit was quite unknown; a charlatan-in-the-make, a short-to-be-household name still honing its factual bending skills and still learning how to easily manipulate it, the pathologically paranoid, the mentally ill, the sexually frustrated, the illiterate, the semi-literate, the clueless, and the legally gullible among you. <br /> <br /> When we finished, I thought, "Yes, it was somewhat entertaining - in a completely brave Bugs Bunny kind of way - but what an ultra-privileged, anti-capitalist propaganda Turkey has no objectivity whatsoever. Its only purpose is to take cheap shots on people and ideas that the author of the movie's pets have, a documentary of any imaginative power. "However, our beloved Marxist professor was absolutely excited about R & M, and ultimately we have not only criticized any aspect of it, but actually actually spent the rest of the class praising its "attributes". Similarly, we understand each other, the words "propaganda", "viewer manipulation", "leftist extremist" or "selective fact display" have never left his eternally smiling mouth. And just to remind you: it was supposed to be a philosophy class, don't indoctrinate your students with your own political BS. <br /> <br /> Anyway, now I come to the very interesting aspect: this professor, Mr. R, is now a highly successful screenwriter in Hollywood. He wrote several left-handed scripts with A-stars in them. <br /> <br /> The Morale of the Story: It's the kind of people all doors in Hollywood are open to. <br /> <Michael Moore is a talented filmmaker (which he proved to be a forge of a doubt with "Canadian Bacon"), but a Marxist liberal opens doors for just about everyone. Tinseltown is busy with racial pro-Chavez extremists. That's why political brainwashing through simplistic portrayals of reality has been part of the Hollywood experience for many decades. <br /> <br /> Embrace this demagogue and you have betrayed your own brain forever.
