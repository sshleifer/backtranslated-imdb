A 1957 Roger Corman not epic in which a lot of characters fall into a lead, just as the stocktaking thermo-core slope is triggered. It's the end of the world. Four men with guns, two women (one an unmarried virgin, the other a Las Vegas show belt that drinks and smokes - guess which one makes it to the end of the movie?) Time elapses, tension develops (or is suppose). Something is in the forest that eats radioactive rabbits. A mutant monster! Seven weeks of radioactive substance performed a million years of evolution (on a living human). The result is a laughable bad, zip on the back, rubber sample that is strangely afraid of their only source of fresh water. It is raining. The monster loosens. The remaining two characters, the Hunk and the Virgin. Relying on the world, the headline 'The Beginning' fills the screen after it emerged that the short rains of the rain washed away all the radioactivity and solved all the monsters that ran from it. <br /> <br /> The only true comment on this is the incredible amount of "curtain work" that goes on. One of the basic elements of the bad and lo budget of the period was the abundant use of curtains in the set design. It was cheap. Complete with a setup? Pull over a curtain, leave another piece of furniture in front of it and you have a different place in minutes without moving the camera or changing the lighting. <br /> <br /> Curtain acting is a skill that the actor will get to comment on what goes on outside a building, it seems to be ("It looks like Rain" or "Here comes they and they seem to have the sheriff with them! "kind of things. He would do this by standing on one side of the window - coming over his body and lifting the curtain from the window, but along the axis of the shot - ie to the camera - so he could pretend looking out and telling us What happens from the screen without showing the audience, he stares at the studio wall three inches from his nose behind some cheap velvet curtains. There was a lot of this in this movie.
