I saw this movie last night, and after reading all the reviews, I expected a good, emotional sport movie. What I got was something clicked and boring. Yes, I thought it was boring. I injured the all-star long before the match. I thought they could wait for him to fall until you know the game before the "big one", but I think the first game is good enough. <br /> <br /> Parent relationships were also very clicked, with the dominant drunkard (I will say McGraw, however, impressed me), and the son she wants to stay sick and help. <br /> <br /> I especially loved the random girls (Melissa and Maria) who had been in the movie for five minutes, and just put there to force the soccer boys off the field. I thought 'okay, now, how does it work in the plot again?' Maybe I missed the point, except "Well, they play soccer in a town that loves it so much that girls throw themselves on their feet" point. <br /> <br /> The sport action had good points but most were so rushed! I think the first game lasted longer than fitting the whole playoffs! And I wasn't so sure about the continuity of the wobble in the final game. <br /> <br /> I think I can see this movie, winning the ESPY for the best sports movie if it is the only one released. . Honestly, I found it to be a boring movie, full of people sickly obsessed with the pig. For a better football movie, see Remember the Titans.
