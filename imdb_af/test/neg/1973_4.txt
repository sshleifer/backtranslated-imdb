A fun, transparent attempt to eradicate cash from the flourishing British club scene, Sorted is a movie that shows promises in certain sections, but does very little else. A Perfunctory thriller plot (that's just there to string the club's rows), variable acting and a pretty ridiculous script, stop everything. Sorted from the showcase that director Jovy of course planned. <br /> <br /> Although Jovy is sometimes overbearing (especially when he uses the often bad dance music), he shows potential, and the lack of an anti-drug message is very refreshing. Overall, however, the movie is a wasted opportunity, and the prospects for a great clubbing movie are somewhere. Yet it is still visible.
