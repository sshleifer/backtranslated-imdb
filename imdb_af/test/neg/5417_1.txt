Wow. I thought, Eskimo Limon was the most horrible and embarrassing first sex movie ever. But I forgot that Germany was always trying to compete. In this case, well-known German film producer Bernd Eichinger was successful in producing even worse shit. Harte Jungs is stupid, not credible and predictable, and above all: not funny. It is almost a tragedy that so many children have it in Germany (and I'm also scared, also Austria). <br /> <br /> Tobias Schenke, 19, seems too nice not to have a girl and too ripe. be 15, and his character is too stupid to be true. Schenke is really trying to make us believe he doesn't know anything about sex, but it doesn't help. Harte Jungs seems to have been made by someone who looked at Al Bundy and took him seriously. <br /> <br /> The best actors in the movie are Sissi Perlinger and Stefan Jürgens who play Schenke's half-liberal parents. Perlinger and Jürgens are stand-up comedians who are not very talented in film performance. Yet their performances are the 'best' and 'funniest' in comparison. <br /> <br /> A complete failure.
