I hate to admit it, but they are right to sack Schrader. The opportunity is here to build an atmosphere, to draw an audience into a movie. This was not done. The characters are weak. The story was poor. The direction was very poor. Schrader was out of his depth and showed it. I've been watching it a few times in the hope that there will be at least one salvation function. But no, nothing. The next phase is likely to be a remake of the original or hopefully it will be left alone. Anyone who wants to know what the best successor of the Exorcist was, had to read "Legion", written by Blatty, it should be the best follow-up to an original piece dedicated to printing. Unfortunately, it didn't translate to screen very well and I doubt it could ever be. As for Dominion, Begin. Avoid at all costs.
