As cute and beautiful as they are, it seems as if the story of three singing chipmunks is not enough meat to maintain it for half an hour. I thought the first half hour of this movie was worth watching. It was fun, it had some laughter, it was full of energy. Then it just lost something. I won't even say it disappears because it suddenly seems to me. The fun was gone; the laugh disappears. My daughter also noticed it. She is 4 - she laughed several times in the first part of the movie, then her laugh stopped. Perhaps it has become too serious - the evil film producer has worked the chipmunks to death. Something happened anyway, and it wasn't any better. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie tries to tell the story of how the chipmunks (Alvin, Simon and Theodore) began to tell. Everyone knows the Christmas song. Here we discover how they met Dave and they started. The movie is currently up-to-date, although its true origin was noted by Dave's 1958 street address. It was the year when animated singers were first created. Jason Lee did a pretty good job as Dave and the chipmunk voices were also pretty good. David Cross as the evil Ian has irritated me to be blunt, and I couldn't figure out Claire's character, played by Cameron Richardson. She added little to the movie. It's a movie you can see with the kids - it's probably a movie you just want to see with the kids. It gets a 4/10 of mine.
