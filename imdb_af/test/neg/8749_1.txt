Yes, this movie has a gall called Jessica that says that everything is evil and that its trees also land on people. Well, she only makes one tree once, but she says everything is evil. This movie is about a farm that apparently rents out rooms for people, but offers a bit different in the entertainment area. Jessica can find things with a stick and she finds the head of an evil man. Of course they don't know it until the owner of the farm's helpers open the box with the head. The head continues to hypnotize everyone so that it can get Jessica and use her powers to find things to help look at his body. This movie has an interesting enough story, but it plays very badly here. Everyone in this movie will come to your nerves at least once.
