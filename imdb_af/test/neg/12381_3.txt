This one is so cheesy as they come? The concept of a massive and indestructible alien bird has been too long for words, but wait until you get a load of the goofy creature as it appears on the screen! I tell you, I laughed so hard at this thing I missed on some of the explanatory dialogue? then the latter is often so heavy on scientific jargon and laws of physics and such (which I have never been good at, despite my love for sci-fi movies) that did not really matter! The bird ?? First depicted as a mere deformed shape shining through the air, but then displayed in all its brave glory? is so sublime stupid that it will not be wrong in a Looney Tunes cartoon (see the series of intermittent-taken pictures starting with the creature in the distance and ending at a side-by-side closest to his face)! <br /> <br /> Director Sears did much better with his other film about UFOs, the fine EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUERS (1956) ?? with special effects by a master, Mr. Ray Harryhausen is given (of which I just gave my copy of the latter in anticipation of acquiring Columbia's recent released SE DVD); Also, it seems to me that some of the footage illustrating the bird's rampage in New York was elevated from the destruction of Washington in the earlier scientific classical classic! Again, the main roles being played by genre regularly? namely Jeff Morrow (from THIS ISLAND EARTH [1955]) and Mara Corday (from TARANTULA [1955]); As with the aforementioned flying SAWERS, these titles are highly regarded and loved by fans ?? Consequently, they are much better than those of the alien addition to the alien / sample animal cycle commonly found during the scientific boom and beyond. In addition, other flying threats in the FLYING SERPENT [1946] I didn't watch, and Larry Cohen's in-the-cheek update of the same in Q: THE WINGED SERPENT [1982]. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the GIANT CLAW can't even lead to a decent climax? who is so rushed to be a scum, to quote a jet from the movie itself, whose assault with rockets on the bird proves completely ineffective (that is before Morrow realizes that it is protected by an invisible barrier and then find out how to penetrate it). Ultimately, apart from the persistent (and honestly boring) technical asides, you get a sense of "so bad, it's good" to look at it: it only lasts 74 minutes ?? And anyway, the bird is such an unforgettable brave creation than putting a big smile on your face every time!
