The first time I saw it was when I was with a date, and she thought it was a wonderful movie. I didn't. <br /> <br /> The second time I saw it, it was on TV last night. It still sucks. <br /> <br /> As a love story, it sucks. As Julia portrays a street cabinet, it is repulsive. For me, she was a librarian with a mini skirt and heels. She didn't have a hard shell for her. She is not tortured, anxious, angry, hungry or anything else. Her "HOOKER" character was so flawed, like comparing a cubic zircon to a diamond. The two just don't fit, no matter how they look. <br /> <br /> The ENGLISH role I felt was worth looking at, the 2 bitchy saleswomen, which were excellently cast. They did such a good job that I hate them for the few seconds they were on the screen. They had real definition, for the small roles. Okay, so the movie wasn't quite rubbish. The two ignorant salesmen saved the film. <br /> <br /> Apart from the two women selling people, the rest of the cast ... including the big names was just crap. Everybody was an asshole or had absolutely no reason to fill a dialogue in the movie, except to compliment Julia Roberts or give an ass to Richard Gere. <br /> <br /> It was a movie about how to walk In high heels and a tight dress in Beverly Hills, people learn from you and guys working in hotels, as if they only had a baseball bat. They faced. <br /> <br /> While in fact the women dressed in the nine in Beverly Hills, hookers and prostitutes are to a higher degree, but as they do not wear the going Madonna looking for jewelry or patent boots , they can look at the other ones they do. <br /> <br /> The hotel thief was sickly sad to watch, and anyone who had a real character had less than a minute of screen time. <br /> <br /> It's an insult to romantic movies, comedies, dramas, and even prostitutes who deal with affluent clients daily hoping their lives will work perfectly. <br /> <br /> The story about Jul ia Roberts is PIMPED (yes PIMPED) by a multi-millionaire in a bag and limousine. <br /> <br /> She's still in possession, still telling you how to act, how to move, what to wear, what to say, where to go and what to do. He is more in control than a street pimp, but the people at Disney / Buena Vista make it easier to swallow. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere has a black man with a golden tooth and an AK-47 on his side instead of an attach√© case, this movie will be about how a woman should struggle get away from the hardness of prostitution. The same story, different characters will make a whole different prospect. <br /> <br /> Yes, change the white man for a black man or Asian or Spanish, the land business act must be changed to a deal of arms or drugs and the whole concept of romantic comedy is discarded. <br /> <br /> As for me, Pretty Woman is still garbage, dressed in ribbons and bows. <br /> <br /> I didn't "I liked it 15 years ago when I didn't understand it and was led by the Hollywood hype. I hate it now, that I can see along the beautiful decorations called "love". <br /> <br /> This movie is NOT a romantic comedy. This is a story about how to control a woman, as long as you have the means and income to do so. <br /> <br /> It's an insult to strong women, women and women in general, as well as my television screen. <br /> <br /> Did I hate it? Yes. Suck it? Yes Will I recommend it? NO ... well, maybe if I really hated you. <br /> <br /> Will this review be posted? We'll see. <br /> <br /> Anyway, that's all for now.
