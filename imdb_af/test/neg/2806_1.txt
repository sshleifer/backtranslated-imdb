If you were in eastern Europe (or even in their armed forces), you might find this movie interesting. I don't know why it calls a comedy (sure there are some funny moments), but it's not a good movie if one of the orderly officers speaks for 15 minutes about the achievements of socialism on a Christmas meal. . officers generally act like funny oafs, the soldiers run from the base to meet their girls at night, and surprise, surprise, one of the girls is the commander's daughter. The East German army was known for its abused and humiliating service by its valued men. The comedy is basically not on the facilities or with the equipment filmed to make a good movie of the East German army and their time is now over. In spite of this, some actors and actresses tried to do well, but it only found out in the roles they are known from East German TV and some small films. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, it was basically boring and made very cheap.
