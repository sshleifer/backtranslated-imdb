This movie has a pretty decent FX sequence of an earthquake for 1936. The reason you didn't see it is because the public was enriched in the 30's by the "Jeanette MacDonald picture". in which the eponymous star darkened her through numerous songs, while the plots came to a complete halt. The FX crosses time very well. MacDonald's songs do not, and the uncomfortable insertion of the songs mentioned to point out her only typical talent is not good. <br /> <br /> The tall device of two friends who grow up to become a priest and a hoodlum is once again given by the machinery (Manhattan Melodrama, The Departed). At the 30-minute point you have heard the song 'San Francisco' three times. Entertainment in the thirties is generally an accumulation of irritation. Only the Grand Hotel of the decade disregards the degree in San Francisco, Dinner 8, Little Caesar, Stagecoach, All Quiet on the Western Front, Les Miserables, and so on.
