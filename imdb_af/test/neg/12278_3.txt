Tony Curtis and Skip Homier both wear black with white trim cloth shoes in the screens before and after the swim dam and the tank is inflated. Must have been too hard on the young star feet. If the right Marines were on the mission, they would wear shoes. In the first screens they took off their legs just before they started to find the Boer on the small journey. When they went to the area where they dug the fox holes, Tony and Skip wore combat boots, then later when Lovejoy and Curtis walk in the Framer and his daughter Tony wears the "Tennis Shoes" but hey is black. The movie is about a real story, but do they really need the love interest?
