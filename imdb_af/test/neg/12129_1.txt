John Waters owes me two hours of my life. I got a preview show in 1990, and I still have pain. Not before or since I saw such a terrible piece of cinematic waste spelled on the screen. There is nothing positive I can say about this movie. Acting - Terrible; plot - ridiculous; music - horrible. After the movie, my friends and I asked our money from the theater manager. He explained that, as it was a free show, he couldn't give us anything, no matter how much evil we suffer. How Johnny Depp's career survived this train wreck of a movie is someone's guess.
