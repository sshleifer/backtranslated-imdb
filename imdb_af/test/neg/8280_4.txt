Pretty lame and horrible shooter about someone who kills members of a high school track team after their star winners die during a meeting. <br /> <br /> Christopher George gives a hilariously top-up performance as the team's coach. I don't think anyone has ever acted so seriously and done as hard as Chris here - not even in the Olympics. This is a typical divine CG show, and if you're a fan of the man / legend, you have to run straight and grab a copy. <br /> <br /> But we're looking at shooters for the murders (you know it's true), not the gigs, and graduation day failing to score the most (there is one very good kill). True horror comes only during a performance by the band "Felony". Never heard of them? See graduation day and find out why.
