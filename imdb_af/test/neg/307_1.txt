I reviewed it at the Vancouver International Film Festival and was not impressed. <br /> <br /> The only part of the movie I enjoyed was the commentary on filmmaking. For the most part, this movie was random and somewhat fantastic (I'm not saying this in a complimentary way) and just stupid. It was as if he was mixing fantasy with everyday life, which might be interesting in some films, but the fantasy just seems unnecessarily perverted. <br /> <br /> My criticism of this movie is not the actors, but rather the story itself. I found it boring and narcissistic. I wanted my money back, but considering it was a movie festival, it didn't want to happen.
