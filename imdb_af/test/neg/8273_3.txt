I can't help but laugh when I see what the public could do to think, was email back in 1996. Apparently email is an interactive discussion (similar to a chat) with lame voice synthesis who reads each comment aloud. And some of the other "technology" aspects are also extremely funny. I will swear the "high tech" communication center that it actually has a few Commodore 64 monitors in it. Almost like watching the movie hackers these days, I think. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that for the majority of the movie the main actress wears the illusion of disabled, the last part of the movie has an unexplained use of her legs that somehow cannot don't ignore. I mean, why is something so stupid? <br /> <br /> Anyway, to summarize: the plot is pretty predictable, the acting bad, the killer is riddable. But it can be amusing in a Mystery Science Theater 3000 way I think.
