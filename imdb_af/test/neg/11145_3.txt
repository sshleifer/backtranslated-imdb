All the hype! All the additions! I was thought to have missed it on the big screen. Where this movie worked was in the small details. In ALL OTHER, it failed. Arnold has done so much better in the past few years. I thought the days of the commando and the last action hero were away from our lives. Unfortunately, this movie flickered to the lowest common denominator and reduced Arnold to a bulging, quivering, contradictory face that only knew how to shoot guns and blow things up. In a click at the last moment (and at another time), which was predictable from the start, we see a glow from the actor who has proved he is more than he paid early in his career. I was unimpressed with the movie because it never broke new ground or went anywhere but where you expected it.
