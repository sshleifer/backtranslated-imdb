I saw this movie and I didn't care about this movie anyway. I will not think of Paris, because I do not like this country and its national capital. However, I can't learn French because I don't understand their language. Why do I go to France if I go to Germany or the UK? Germany and the United Kingdom are the nations I tolerate. Apparently the Olsen Twins don't understand the French language like me. Therefore, I will not bother the France journey, no matter what. I can just like the UK and meet single women and play video games if there is a video arcade. This is all.
