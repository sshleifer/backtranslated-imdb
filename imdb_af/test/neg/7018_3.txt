Lucille Ball cannot sing or perform or dance. This makes the quality of her performance in MAME all the more terrible. She can't do the low-brow slapstick that made her a hit on TV, so she has to rely on building a character. Unfortunately, me. Ball has never learned that skill, because none of the moments has any warmth. How does she really feel about Patrick or Beau? We never believe the words she says. The vacant stare of me. Ball is supposed to convince her she is emotional, but there is no chemistry between her and Bruce Davidson, Robert Preston or Bea Arthur. For this reason, every scene in which she is, is flat. <br /> <br /> Also, when Mrs. Ball opens her mouth to sing, we are immediately made aware of why the studios vote for every other musical instrument she did earlier in her career. It was said that she insisted that her voice be used, so it was an error of ego and leadership. It gets worse when she sings in voice hearing and she has to do the words "without any words". Whoever thought it would work, forgot who played Mame. <br /> <br /> I understand that Rosalind Russell has the role on stage and in the film AUNTIE MAME. I'm also aware that Angela Lansbury has won a Tony for her performances in the original 1966 Broadway musical. None of these women were known for their singing voices, but both were better off than Lucille Ball. Why they went with her is the worst in blatant mistakes. <br /> <br /> The only person who gets hurt is Bea Arthur. She is big and wonderful, catty and general in all amounts. Unfortunately, you are waiting for this movie to take off and invite you to join the fun. But the movie never does and you can't. Nobody but Bea Arthur seems to have fun. <br /> <br /> An additional bad review goes to director Gene Saks. Saks is known as an award-winning director of stage and screen music and comedies, including the Broadway music game on which this film is based. None of the skills and expertise is here to help. The poor editing and storytelling in this movie is under a caliber director. The shiny mistake in performing the movie isn't the fault of Ms Ball.
