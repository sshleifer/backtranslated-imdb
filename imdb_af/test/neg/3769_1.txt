About to be impenetrable. Somehow I just kept a little bit of interest, but it was because I really wanted to know what the "secret" was (what I have to say is pretty damn obvious) or because I was hoping Scarlett Johansson would put on a more sexy outfit? This movie is poor and it is also a disgrace to all the lonely, alcoholic Southern literature professors out there. Travolta wants his Oscar so bad that he wants to cry in the bathroom after he has beaten blood. Sorry, buddy. . You were more credible "stay alive." Not everyone can draw a Peter Fonda in "Ulee's Gold". If you want the anti-brave anti-hero Oscar, you should actually act. . Not just pout on the screen. Stop this director before he / she (name is vague about gender) regulates!
