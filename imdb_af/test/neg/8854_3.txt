This film deals with a gap between the real world and the world of the dead. There is a lot of mumbo jumbo over the internet (ie if you install a program on the computer, you see dead people - much like when playing a video tape, you will die in RINGU). Honestly, most of them were rather stupid and lost me. What I found interesting is the idea that the dead live in their own separate existence - entirely alone forever. It was sober and fascinating. <br /> <br /> I love Japanese movies and have seen a large number compared to most Americans. However, a genre that has been popular in recent years, which I just can't very well relate to, is these horror movies. I know they are super popular - especially since they are so common in the United States. I saw both RINGU and THE RING, YU-ON and THE GRUDGE and were rather ambivalent despite their popularity. About the only recent horror movie I really liked from Japan was SEANCE - a review of the British British film, SEANCE ON A WET AFTERNOON. And what, I think, made SEANS different? Well, unlike other movies as well as KAIRO, the gobs and gobs are not spent on special effects or trying to scare the audience - instead, the emphasis was on the story. The bottom line is that these other movies are much like American movies like HALLOWEEN or Friday 13 - with scary things just jumping to scare the audience and the plot is purely secondary (at its best). For me, I want story - not cheap excitement or ghost as the primary focus of the movie. <br /> <br /> With a relatively high rating I know I'm in the minority, but I just don't think it's a very satisfying movie. Too often, there are small things that can be slightly upset - but the characters start shouting and crying and acting like saying "this is the scariest movie ever made so you can start shaking better". Well, I think it's just trying too hard and I wish it focused more on the afterlife that was seen at the end of the movie and the progression - not scared.
