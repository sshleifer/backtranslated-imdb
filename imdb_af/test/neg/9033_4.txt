So, Seagal plays a DEA detective named John Hatcher who has lost his partner on a drug investigation into surprise, Colombia! Not to boast of anything, but my father was born and raised in Colombia (hence my last name), and now he's a doctor in California. No matter what the movies will believe you, there are other things than drug dealers and cocaine coming from Colombia! <br /> <br /> Anyway, in a drug chest, Hatcher lost his mate and accidentally killed a naked Colombian prostitute, inspiring him to go to confession somewhere I never had he didn't see him before in any of his films. It was pretty interesting. Seagal has a tendency to get so nearly uncomfortable that he doesn't get much more involved with other women than a plot machine and the way the occasional temptation, either by a stripper or a lover, never gets the least. interest from him. He's all the time-the-bad guys. <br /> <br /> But in the confession he confesses that he lied, sold drugs, had forged evidence and even slept with informants to get the information he needed to get the bad guys behind bars. farm. I don't get into trouble with God by telling it?). The priest tells him to go to his family, so he decides it's time to step out of power. <br /> <br /> The next third of the movie is an exercise in the paper-thin characterization feature of Seagal's films. Market For Death is the story of Seagal against a group of mystical Jamaican drug dealers. These guys have no discretion to print their products in broad daylight. <br /> <br /> Hatcher goes back to visit his old high school coach, Max (minimal effort by Keith David), and right in the middle of the exercise, there are some of these horrible crackers out there sitting in the bleachers sitting on a few bookworm-seeking high school girls. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I just had a sheltered high school experience, but I didn't know that crackers and crackers were hanging out at school in the middle of the day. Anyway, it's not long before Hatcher learns how angry these guys are. Not only do they break high school kids, but the coach regularly loses soccer players to their drugs, engages them with smartass stars with Max, and since that is not enough, his 13-year-old cousin is dead in their squatters. <br /> <br /> OK, OK. We get the picture. I'm sure they also torture puppies and beat old women, and maybe steal kids' candy, just for a good friend. Is it really hard to find out who the bad guys are? 13-year-old cousin died in their squatters. Wow. <br /> <br /> Anyway. Not only does the film not know how to develop villains without deciding what basically means the name of the film, where bad deeds are dedicated to them through dialogue, but they also do not know how to act. <br /> <br /> The leader of the drug dealers, known as Screwface, and I suppose it alone should tell you something about the kind of movie it is. Screwface is a cartoonish Jamaican man with these bright, bizarre green eyes, which I guess should be an important part of his character because he spends a good majority of his screen-time, with his eyes half bent out of his head. His favorite way of intimidation is to scream completely hard in his overwhelming Jamaican accent with his face, literally less than a thumb away from whom he shouts. This guy likes to get into guys' faces so he has to turn his head to the side so their noses don't touch. All I could think of was how the poor guys would breathe. <br /> <br /> Man, they don't want you to forget that these guys are Jamaican. Their accents are so exaggerated and overwhelmed that it is almost impossible for most of the movie to understand them. Not that it matters. No matter what they say. All you need to know is that everything coming out of their mouths is an evil drug-related thing. They are just the psychos that drive drugs and kill people. The biggest movie of the movie in Jamaica! <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with the movie is that the theaters, especially the bad guys, as I have described, are spectacular, even for a Seagal movie. They are so comical and strange that it is impossible to take them as anything other than a goofball-b-movie creation, which is tied to present to whom Seagal can spread its distinctive trademark of dilapidated retribution. <br /> <br /> But there's also a bizarre kind of mystique in the movie that just makes it so strange. For example, a mystic, I think you would call her, at some point put a curse on Screwface by (if I remember correctly) spit the mouthful of Bacardi on a live cock hanging upside down before it was cut and she blood drops a picture of Screwface. Hmm. Interesting. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is the same woman who warns Hatcher that his family is "marked for death" by these people, meaning they have a few voodoo hex on them. To deny anyone, but if I was told that my family was cursed by such people, I would just laugh at it. Hatcher does not save me as the kind of guy to take a lot of stock in fearful voodoo curses! <br /> <br /> But the setup, as you can see, is pretty standard for a Seagal movie. Unique villains, I think you can say, though not very impressive. Definitely the weirdest movie of Seagal's early career?
