I had great hope when I went to the theater. I saw the trailer. I was so hip as the next person to see how great talent participates in making a story with a beautiful starting point. <br /> <br /> But, it is disappointing to see that this talent is wasted by the poor composition of songs. The words are thick and cheesy, probably because it is composed with a more western theme. I won't find it hard to imagine the same melodies with French or English lyrics. In Mandarin it just sounds strange. <br /> <br /> The pieces of music were also badly cut - too fast to be enjoyable and the shots of the actors who watched took too long. <br /> <br /> The special effects are the next disappointment. That's enough to say it's very clear where the special effects start and stop. <br /> <br /> It's not Moulin Rouge, nor is it in the mood, despite the occasional (and very similar) slow waltz theme. Completely and hour long to tell a simple story.
