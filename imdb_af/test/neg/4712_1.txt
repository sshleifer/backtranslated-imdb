An annoying and talented American documentary author learns from a legendary <br /> <br /> South African monster, the Halfkaste. Tradition says it is a half-human, half-leopard creature, with the closest parallel of that of the European tradition's werewolf. Instead of concentrating on the creature, the film follows the meanings of film staff. There is little action or tension until late in the movie. This problem is exacerbated by many annoying characters that cause a ceaseless amount of even more annoying talk. The basic premise is wasted as it is accompanied by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the director was influenced by the approach of The Blair Witch Project (1999) or The Last Broadcast (1998). Regardless, the movie fails at most levels. Avoid at all costs.
