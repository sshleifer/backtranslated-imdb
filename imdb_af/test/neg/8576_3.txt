This week's surprise show at GV was the horror movie The Nun (La Monja). Seriously, I think horror movies should try to come up with more imaginative titles, though the story about the character described in the title. Who knows, soon we will have spinoffs like The Monk, The Priest, and others who belong to various religious sects. <br /> <br /> The basic premise is very simple, that a ghoul is dressed in a Nun clothing (so that it can claim the title) is about the death of early monasteries. There was apparently some kind of conspiracy, since the daughter of one of the victims, Eva (played by an eye candy Icelandic Anita Briem), using some good friends, like a rip of I know you past Saturday done. (As also mentioned). <br /> <br /> So, as the body setting rises, it's a race against time for our emotional scars (isn't it always?) heroic to expose the truth and save the day. In the sins of the mothers, the film became the unthinkable, with a dream sequence as the introduction. I hate dream sequences as this is a cheap technique if not done correctly, and there are a few of them in the movie. <br /> <br /> In part, the movie sometimes played, as Ju-On went wrong with many of the dark water references, and they could have withdrawn this unholy water, for the circumstances and plot points in the movie. However, there are plots in abundance, so don't look too deep into the story. You will expect the standard handbook to turn to the end of the sadistic nun, and suggest that they may match the recent Thai horror movie Dorm. <br /> <br /> The play is pretty forgotten, with the role player speaking perfect heavily accented English. And since most of them are pleasing to the eye, the story should be weaving in a love center in the middle of a witch. What gives? Hello, do you still have your mood ah? Then again, the ghoul is a pretty cheap animated / SFX that has a built-in AI from time to time in various ways, just to attract crooks of fearless audiences. The characters also break every unwritten rule in the Do-Nots into horror lore, so you know and expect them only desserts. <br /> <br /> Can you enjoy this movie? Yes you can. Just make sure you look at it in a full house (it should be easy as locals struggle for anything remote) and laugh at those who are so excited that they are screaming at every "terrifying" scene. It's fun, and adds to the atmosphere, except what's on the screen. Surround sound doesn't even come close. <br /> <br /> Think of it as an episode of Scooby Doo without the wisdom cracks. It is a pity that the greedy moments in the movie should be censored for a PG rating. It might have been the best bits, and has now left on the floor board of the censorship.
