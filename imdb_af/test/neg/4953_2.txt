Jack Brooks's characteristics are initially somewhat charming and lend to the deliberate campus feel of the beginning of this movie. <br /> <br /> I was promoted and anxious, as I was accused of seeing this one at The End, hoping the payout would be the overwhelming wait. <br /> <br /> The climax can't begin to make up for all set-up time. <br /> <br /> Normally one may expect flat characters from this genre. But the fact that the wait-for-action index is so high will mean that in the meantime, some interesting character development will be dedicated. <br /> <br /> Not so. <br /> <br /> Although not without its initial charm, this movie is finally choking, and disappointing. <br /> <br /> Wishing I could get that set-up time back, to reinvest it in something paying off.
