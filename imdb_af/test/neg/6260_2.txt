Hard to get in depth with these kinds of things, since there is absolutely no existing khaki that even partially reasons to look at it, let alone express an opinion on it. I know nothing of this - look it for a laugh and stay for the false breasts. Apparently this is an unofficial successor to 1982's "Slumber Party Massacre", which I enjoyed as a fun treasure. "Cheerleader Massacre" looks like a late-nite soft-core Cinemax porn! And not surprisingly, chicks such as Nikki Fritz and Samantha Phillips (productive T&A actresses) are here. Many of the nekid hooters and not much else. A group of 20-something high-school cheerleaders, two random guys, and the thick, stupid, comical relief sloop are stranded in the country and find a house where they plan to stay the night. . The recently escaped "Slumber Party" killer is in the area and is killing them. There is no gore or originality and I will not say the nudity is a real "point of sale" as it can be just as boring as a treasure trove. Totally terrible ...
