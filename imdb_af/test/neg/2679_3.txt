Man, the 90's was really an awful decade for movies. The movies are lacking in good style and the storytelling is often lacking. <br /> <br /> This 6th entry into the long-running Halloween series is definitely a bad one. You just never really get into the story because it is not a very well-constructed and constructive film. <br /> <br /> It's just a bad movie that also suffers from its imaginative writing and non-compelling characters in it. Dr Loomis seems to be there just for the sake of being in it. It is a real shame that it should be Donald Pleasence's last film role. It's nice and similar to being his last role in a Halloween movie, but he definitely deserved to be in a better one. <br /> <br /> There is never a real danger in the movie and the character of Michael Myers is never so threatening or scary. Perhaps this is because he emerged early in the film. He does his usual things again, but without too much class or originality. Also, efforts to uncover Myer's past do not really work out, because the main reason for not explaining it is well explained. It is clear that the screenplay has gone through several re-titles before and during filming. Several scenes were even shot or added again after the first track was far from pleasant. <br /> <br /> The movie looks more and feels like a made for TV one. It is also due to the lack of some good good gore. As a horror movie, it is basically lacking in basically everything to make it a good or even original one. <br /> <br /> So far the worst of the series! <br /> <br /> 3/10
