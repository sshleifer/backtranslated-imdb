Childlike story torn from a lame Hollywood movie, horrible play, cheese dialogue, and not a "sexual scene". It's just another great software parody! I really enjoyed this movie! Sure, the acting is terrible, but that part of the fun! The storyline is ridiculous, but some things have to be sacrificed when the story has to turn around sex scenes on the girl. And because it was just softcore (no penetration), the sex scene was a bit dull. But it's like the great god of softcore smut Russ Meyers said, "Who really gives up what goes under the middle." I don't know if I agree with Mr Meyers about this, but what the hell ... the movie entertained me for half an hour. I give it a C +, it would have been a solid B if they could make more of the girls look like Russ Meyers actresses. VaVoom! VaVoom! ~
