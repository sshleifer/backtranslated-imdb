This is the only uncomfortable thing I've ever seen. It's sad how he tries so hard to get a good joke and all he does is curse and think his disgusting vulgarity is funny. He's the most bitter person I've ever seen. His whole act he tries to show how much he doesn't care, thereby showing just how much he is angry with the critics and the people with any sense of humor and humor, who rather go through enormous torture than to look at his "Show". There are good comedians, there are bad people and there are terrible children. But this man is in his own league. I feel sorry for him and even more for the people who find him funny.
