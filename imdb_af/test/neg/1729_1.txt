It's a disaster movie, in both meanings of the word. Every character, every role, every conversation, every turn, everything in this movie stinks great time. It's a pity that Dennis Hopper's talent is wasted in this horrible movie. I can give you hundreds of examples, but see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Or rather: don't.
