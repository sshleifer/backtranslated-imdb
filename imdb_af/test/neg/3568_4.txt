For me, this movie is essentially an episode for a TV show. It reminds me especially of the British memory of the TV series Wallander, with Kenneth Brannagh. People questioned by the police are difficult and often as bitter as the weather, the main investigator has great family problems. Investigations always lead to atrocities of the distant past and the plot is labyrinthine with strange incidents and subplots only make sense at the end. Both have excellent cinematography. <br /> <br /> The plot of Jar City reminiscent of a standard British or American crime series. Effectively, you can take the views of any of the episodes of Touch or Frost and transplant them into the bitter spot in this movie. They have an effective successor. <br /> <br /> Actually, the script can no longer be clear. From the cookie cutter. You get even the best-known motifs, like police to the local prison, to question a manipulative and dangerous psychopath that inevitably explodes at the end of the interview. <br /> <br /> I am absolutely convinced that it is scones and jams for many people, but I feel it should point to people like me who are not going to the theater to watch television. What I felt a great lack of was message. The film, as the theme, takes the genetic studies in Iceland. Icelanders in genetic terms have largely isolated from the outside world, and offer a good chance for scientists to study their genetics. A lot of information about the heredity of the population has been preserved, and many genetic diseases unique to Iceland can be effectively traced in a population that has prevented interbreeding and is remarkably genetically homogeneous (that is, like a London puzzle underground map, instead of a puzzle of a daisy field). A company called deCODE genetics has tried to set up a database that contains all the genetic and hereditary information for the entire population of Iceland. Due to privacy, this project was terminated, and at the end of last year, deCODE genetics went bankrupt in Iceland. The episode is a rich topic for debate. <br /> <br /> But in this movie, genetics and medical science are not there for the sake of education, they are there for strange atmosphere. <br /> <br /> It's a creepy movie if you're interested in it, and there is often a morbid focus on food to accompany events, such as a shredder who eats lunch between incisions. The most excitement for me was when the chief inspector threw a sheep's head. Unfortunately, it sometimes came to me. The movie seeks the rather delicate task of mixing the grisly with the sentimental, and eventually they delivered unintentional humor to the end. It's the equivalent, in cinematic terms, to trying to prepare fugu, if you're not well-qualified, glove and keen eye, you poison the client. This director's director had to lower the rate on his performance. <br /> <br /> I walked out of this movie and rather feel bad about myself and about life in general.
