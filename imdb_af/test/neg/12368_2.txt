The movie was pretty bad. It is not so much a problem. It's just that the movie is very boring in terms of pacing. The movie just seems to be moving at a slow, speedy rate. The story in San Franpsycho is that there is a ceremony that kills moral corrupt individuals (maybe I read too much in it, but hey, that is my nature apparently) after San Franpsycho kills some people under the Golden Gate Bridge we were introduced to one of the main characters of the movie: Joe Estevez (brother of Martin Sheen) as a curmudgeony cop named Bill Culp. Bill is trying to hunt the killer. He's got a name, he's just The Killer. He tries to embrace a local news reporter named Rita to help him investigate. Bill is the stereotypical hard-edged police and he threatens to throw Rita into jail for the obstruction of justice. Anyway, a few scenes go by and suddenly Rita finds a letter left behind by the psychopath. He's a cold bloody psychopath! And she has a heart failure and tells Bill and his partner Joe about it and helps them with the investigation. <Br /> <br /> The movie is trying to be a naughty murder thriller, but it just failed. It's much like the movie The Black Dahlia tries to be tense, but it's just incredible. The film tries to be serious throughout, but it has plays like where the killer masturbate (obviously a fan of gore porn that lines with "ooh blood on her" or something that serves it) and Joe Estevez the table: "He is a cold-blooded murderer! "I admit I have been to the movie more than once, although I'm sure it was meant to be a deadly serious movie. <br /> <br /> One of the only positive points after which the movie goes, is the fact that I didn't pay money to see it (huzzah netflix) and it is sad because I could see a little good in their movies after watching The Damned. His fair share of mistakes, but it was nice. Unfortunately, San Franpsycho has nothing to do with it, admitting that it has a good writing, it's nothing big, but it might have been interesting, instead of what you get, is a murderer who does not get excited, or even vaguely pleasurable deaths other reviews claim the movie has a big twist that is shocking. "I apparently watched another movie, because about one hour I figured out what's going to happen. The end didn't shock me at all. I will insult this wreck of a movie, but I don't think I will. A long story short this movie is a boring, uninspired thriller (I use the term loosely) that does not have the "Hitchcockian thrills", that another reviewer claims a predictable end, mere deaths, which with all Emotions from a wood planks, and a decent soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I'm sure others will try to defend it with the usual: It was a low budget movie, they did the best they could with such a low budget, and everything else nonsense. But if you come straight to it, there was very little that they could really spend the budget, there were very little special effects working, the soundtrack sounding or it might be recovered from the hood of the living dead or the damn, and that is the same damn crew of those two movies. This movie reminds me of another low budget that was not good, and that was Mr. Jingles, the two are about the same quality, they fail to deliver anything close to enjoyment and must be quickly darkened.
