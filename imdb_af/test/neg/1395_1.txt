... so where's my friggin trophy? I expected a banner and confetti to descend from my ceiling to watch a full 30 minutes of that shit. Comedy Central lost the ball lately, trying to fill the gap left by Chappelle with several seasons of a delayed man who personified delayed men. Dah duh nah !! If you pay attention to the show, you will notice that Mencia is not stuttering and sketching on its own, but only makes exaggerated observations that have no sense of humor. You ever see how people in Buick's drive really go slow? It's like Dah Duh Nah! Not even the midgets and half-naked hot chicks can derive from Mencia's clear lack of talent. In addition, Mencia is not even a "wetback" as he constantly and unpleasantly declares himself to be a scam above all. <br /> <br /> If anything good can be said about Mencia, it's his attempt. The man obviously has no talent, but like a wounded top in the mouth of a hungry crocodile, God knows he's trying.
