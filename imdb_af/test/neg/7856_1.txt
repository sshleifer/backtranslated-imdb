C'etit complètement minable: à fuir absolument! <br /> <br /> It was an idiotic attempt to destroy classic source material, and it was a great success! <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie under any circumstances unless you want to run out of ten and <br /> <br /> This kind of movie illustrates the divide that still divides directors and audiences, but unfortunately divides they have your nostrils. If the individual (heaven could have a collective ban to invent this foam) behind this was largely enough to watch the version currently playing in French theaters, he or she would have endured what I had to be forced to do for it. to endure and merely rewrite or just deleted it altogether. The age of mature humor being exploited here dates back to Fritz the Cat in my mind, but lacks the film's avant-garde status or even its basic attempt to make social commentary. <br /> <br /> With the spread of remakes and increasing confidence in existing source material to fund these days story stories, one would hope that choosing Snow White, and therefore not worrying about pregnant characters or a radically new one story, would have allowed more time, oh I don't know, interesting animation, smarter jokes, maybe a coherent movie that has something to say and not its emptiness from the opening telegraph? <br /> <br /> A male horrible production.
