This movie looks like issuing the extracted scenes from a high school movie class experiment. It does not make sense! It was well done, but I just felt sorry for the characters because they had to appear in this slum. The alien machines were created with Pentium I technology and no creativity, it was tight! The luminous and scarce seen strangers were Frisbees with legs. WHERE WAS THE TRIPODE? The editing, done by director / writer / producer / makeup artist / gripper Latt, jumps all over the place, with several scenes repeatedly. Most appear to be filmed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The next time Latt wants to make a movie, someone has to hit him. In 2005 he made 11 movies! This does not include writing, editing, directing or visual effect credits on other movies. If the rest is like this snot load, he just makes fun of us. It was a snapshot of Spielberg's movie, nothing more. I look forward to Latt's "BackBroke Ridge", "X-Man IIV", "The Hillocks has Eyes."
