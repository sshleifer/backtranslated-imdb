** from **** stars <br /> <br /> Let's look ... 14 shared by 20 times the square root of 13 equals 23, which was my retired grandmother's favorite number and the year she was born is, 23 minutes past the 23rd hour. Allocate the number in any way you choose and be very scared. Be extremely scared if you are looking for a brain-dead 23-go and you have Schumacher's latest attempt at a dark stress with The Number 23. Oh, yes, 23 is my record in Cuervo shots at my favorite 23rd street in the 23rd state in the union. <br /> <br /> Carrey carries the film about halfway, then we see him, not caring. Don't look for a crazy expression of comedian Carrey, as you saw in The Mask and Me, Myself and Irene. No. And don't expect a characterization of a character as he did with Andy Kaufman. This role is a sad and peculiar deviation for Jimbo. Where's the riddle when you need it! I know we don't need him. Virginia Madsen is commonly used as the supportive, speculative and peculiar woman. Her talent, like Carrey's, is suppressed, and it's almost painful to see her trying to save her underdeveloped, close anonymity. <br /> <br /> To give credit where credit is due, there are some interesting scenes in the number 23 that show some very clever cinematography. They themselves were arrested enough without being in the incoherent story of this stupid story. <br /> <br /> I don't know about you, and I realize it's a work of absolute fiction. I don't know of anyone who often reads his novel in a blue, dark basement, or uses his time on cemeteries on a regular basis like Carrey does in this movie. Schumacher keeps his film dark and crimson and gloomy and rainy and sloppy and gloomy and raining and thankful and on and on and from start to finish. Even Flatliners and The Lost Boys have a bit more daylight in them, and we're talking to medical students who are obsessed with death and teenage vampires! <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, even if it is beyond mere curiosity ... make sure you do it while enjoying about 23 catnaps so you can kill 23 birds with one stone.
