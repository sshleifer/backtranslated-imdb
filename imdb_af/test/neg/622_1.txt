Leave Ed Wood alone. Calling "Plan 9 of the Outer Space" is the worst movie ever made to deny this abysmal vulgar hope of Hollywood Guano's legitimate title. This predictive merger of intrepid whimsy and badhetic socio-political "commentaries" actually looks according to plans by "Plan 9", with bad-scene scenes from players who are not in luck, on cheap sets ranging from what appears to be footage of the battle and crowd scenes cut from higher budget epics. But while "Plan 9" is sometimes funny when it comes to being generally and fairly entertaining, this sticky performance is terribly lacking in basic performances, with scenes of indifference (the disgusting burlesque of Groucho Marx that the Indians steal to low camp (Hedy Lamarr who tries to increase Joan's or Arc's "voices") (Dennis Hopper does nothing at all with the role of Napoleon) to the unexpected, accomplished performance of Peter Lorre as the psychotic Nero. Give the worst director trophy to Irwin Allen to change as much in as little.
