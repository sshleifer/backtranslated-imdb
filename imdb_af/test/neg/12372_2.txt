This terrible moovie is on very flat pleasures - the prettier is the lamb, fake bird droppings floating around the cheap sets, without having to make wings flame (as it were on a rope, maybe?), Attacks of model trains and toys cars. The "science" is asinine - a Masonic Atom gun? And how about the enormous amounts of Brylcream in everyone's hair? I think the 50's were the Slimeball decade! Well, this bird pop is apparently coming from "a divine anti-matter universe", and it's here to build a nest and lay eggs in New York. Seriously. Being killed by the puppet is almost a shame. I give it 1 need out of 4 - it's stupid and stupid, but moore nice as Armageddon. : = 8)
