Why isn't this movie on the bottom 100? Raptor is without a doubt the worst movie I've seen in all my fifteen years of life. I have never seen such a catastrophic mess. Absolutely everything about it is uncomfortable and cheap. <br /> <br /> No one in the role-player gives a somewhat decent performance. The dialogue is completely incoherent and the humor is nothing but humorous. Corbin Bernsen was the most painful part of the whole thing. I can't help cringe if I remember some of his lines, like "In or out? You're worse than a cat!" and "Your lady friend is not a very good poker player. She revealed her hand." <br /> <br /> The raptors are a joke. Even I can make more realistic dinosaur effects than those filmmakers have done. This is an insult to the real velociraptors, or any dinosaur. Not only that, but the deadly scenes are too horrible, even for me. I don't think seriously that these animals will tear their victim and throw bits across the ground just to make everything look better. Besides, blood and intestines are all useless when you can see death coming from miles and miles. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Jurassic Park movies and dinosaurs. Perhaps the filmmakers didn't expect anyone with a bit of intelligence or sense to disregard bad movies to stumble on this movie on HBO this evening, like me. If I can say one thing to anyone involved in this movie, Alan Grant of the first Jurassic Park quote. <br /> <br /> "Just try to show some respect."
