I think south park is hilarious, and I have no problem, with the shots of people on the left, but you will think that after taking a whole movie to attack celebrities to dare their careers' To accept an illegal war and then to be right, GASP will have the sense to start w. and the bastards ruin the land a shot or two. forest looks like a nice, free run of these guys for as stupid and messy as he is. <br /> <br /> Gore is fair play, but please, what should the republicans do, how bad is it? to entertain the country before these guys finally act as they might not just try to do the best they can, and that they did some real screwing ... or maybe just after the rush. a good goal ... or even make fun of kondoleeza rys' gaps.
