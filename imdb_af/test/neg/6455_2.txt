Yes, this review may contain spoilers, but you will thank me for that. It's the worst movie I've seen for some time. I came to this advice to see the same answer I had, but inexplicably, there are several people who especially love this movie and Spacey's performance. <br /> <br /> Some will chastise me to say this, but I find Kevin Spacey's play is pretty limited, despite the world's admiration for him. I felt like I was watching a mean version of Kevin's "American Beauty" role. His character in this film is ridiculously over-emphasized, up to his ridiculous insults he throws at his assistant. <br /> <br /> There are worldwide trites and boring scenes like when Spacey tears in Whaley to bring him straight instead of sweat and low. Somehow I suspect this particular scene would be funny, but by this time I was ready to hit the stop (it's about 20 minutes in the movie). <br /> <br /> What about the faux homage to "Resevoir Dogs"? Whaley proclaims, "I think I saw it once in a movie," as if he were about to cut Spacey's ear. But what does he use to cut him? An envelope! That's right, he's going to give him a piece of paper! It has to be one of Hollywood's worst scenes, and the fact that the actors and directors try to do it with a straight face makes it even more terrible. <br /> <br /> I will admit that I am not the end of this movie (my DVD is merely closed about half an hour before the end), but anyone who says it can save me the line which I missed a big turn and everything would have made sense. Well, I don't care what ultimately happened, because it can never make up for all the bad acting and ruthless dialogue over the top. I even had the feeling that the actors wanted to get out of their way as much as I did.
