Presumably, a movie about a journalist who sent journalists to investigate reports of UFOs, one that is more or less tolerant or agnostic about the whole affair and the other an Aussie, a hardened skeptic at UFO illegality. It's all a crocodile, a kind of money that makes racket. <br /> <br /> Seems this movie is actually a scam and a trick to actually preach Christian teachings and the Christian explanation of UFOs, one I've heard before. . This is an ad hoc explanation that is not biblical at all, but was invented by some modern theologians who fit anything in their mythology. The paranormal? It is really, just demonic, unless it happens in a Christian context, then it is of course God. Simply, if it is not from God, it is the devil, stupid! So I suppose, since Beethoven's 9th symphony was not inspired by God, it must be written under demonic influence. Or so will the logic ad absurdum. <br /> <br /> We are informed that since the Bible does not tell of life on other planets in the universe, there is no (a version of Ad Ignorantium deception) and that God is the universe created so great, so great to show us its almighty power. I think of Carl Sagan's remark that if God created such a great universe and just held it on earth, it would be a tremendous waste of space. <br /> <br /> So what are UFOs? They are Demonic activity and provide the golden earthquake of Christian event, the break ... I mean Rapture. Before the tribulation, true Christians will disappear from the ground, causing mass panic, confusion, car and airplane accidents. Therefore, Satan knows how to send his demons to basically create an illusion of alien spacecraft and alien abduction, which can then be used to explain this otherwise inexplicable event. All part of Satan's plan, which of course will keep people looking at God or Jesus and falling for the lies of the Antichrist. <br /> <br /> This ad hoc explanation also typifies theological mishmash by explaining one mystery with a different way, as opposed to the scientific method of explaining the unknown, the stranger and the mysterious as much as possible, firstly by the familiar, if not just by the familiar. <br /> <br /> It is like jumping straight to a stranger kidnapping when a child is missing and inexplicable. I think I'll first look at more verbal statements, as the kid ran away, lost or kidnapped for ransom or kidnapped by a predator pedophile before he attacked strangers, or the supernatural or Satan or such. <br /> <This kind of fraud or fall of the fundamentalists is nothing new, as young people are often drawn to free rock concerts, which may start with innocent things, then suddenly switch to ancient Christian music, followed by a sermon and a altar call. This kind of blatant deception one would think would be more Satan's ball game. But perhaps because the Christian faith will soon be in the deadlock, these guys feel that something is going on, any deception or slander or scare tactics are acceptable to keep the faith alive, leaving serious opposition from both secularists and competing religions like the Islam, the world's fastest growing religion that can replace Christianity, as Islam is much more coherent and united, and logically more acceptable than Christian fundamentalism. Although it would offer little benefit to humans, it would replace one intolerant thinking system with another. <br /> <br /> And of course the movie ends more or less with a variant of Pascal's bet. The atheistic Aussie who is skeptical about everything is told. Well, if you're right that there is no offspring, and death is nothing but rotting in the grave, don't worry ... but what if you're wrong? <br /> <br /> Basically, statements that imply that reality is going to make nothing but an atheistic view or Christian fantasy is a false dilemma or black-and-white error. Even if the atheists are wrong, it will not necessarily correct Christianity, or if Christianity is apparently full of theology, that the materialistic atheists are by default correct. <br /> <br /> For everything we know, Native American Spirituality may seem to be the best description of the ultimate reality, and we can all use it to treat Earth and its creatures a little better. <br /> <br /> This movie should be stamped on the right.
