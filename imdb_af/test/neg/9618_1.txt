The DVD version released by Crash Cinema was done very poorly. The master engineer had to be drunk, fell asleep or not even in the room while it was being done. It seems to have been mastered from about a tenth generation copy and about halfway through the movie the audio synchronization disappears. The dialogue is about 10 or 15 seconds behind the sound. If you think about buying this DVD, please save your money. I remember seeing this movie at the theater in 1973. Also the VHS copy of this movie entitled "When Taekwondo Strikes" looks better than the DVD, but the remaining few minutes of the movie is "missing". Where is the original camera negative?
