First of all, I really can't understand how some people enjoy this movie. It's the worst thing I've ever seen. Even the actors seem bored ... and I think it all! <br /> <br /> But I have to applaud the opening credit creators - that team looks a great future. Therefore, I recommend the large studios to only see the opening credits and one or two special effects ranges (if they are watched outside this movie, it almost looks like a good movie.) <br /> <br /> Better happiness (or judgment) next time for the producers of this, this ... this "thing!"
