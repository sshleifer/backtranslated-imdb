How much longer should we continue with this lack of conviction that when a director delivers a great, groundbreaking work, all future work "cannot be so bad, he has made such a thing". <Br /> <br /> Mulholland Drive is a case in point, and is actually uncontaminated rubbish. The performances are excellent, especially from Watts and Theroux, but a good movie they don't necessarily make. What Lynch clearly forgets is that just making a movie unnecessarily cruel just works when it surprised the audience. When the audience expects the movie not to make sense, the film needs some measure of interest to the audience. Lynch succeeds in the first half of the film, with the murder mystery set up with many twists and red herring, and then ... plop! The story covers a rogue of bizarre halusinations and useless trials. Methinks Lynch realized how devastated the film had become, and woke up the lesbian and mastobatorial scenes in the audience and stopped the male viewers to stand and leave. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie at the preview, I was surrounded by Lynchophiles who didn't like what was going on anymore, but made the theater comment on the "low and low" of Lynch's movies. Excuse me, but these people are the same nitwits standing in art galleries looking at tins painted white, commenting on the "courage of the artist to paint such a brave work." <br /> <br /> Films like this are made because (a) Lynch deals with his previous job; and (b) because people are convinced that unworkable film is art, and therefore it should be good. I asked a number of Lynchophiles about what they really had in the movie and the only response I received was that it was not a broad "low" type of answer, as they liked the "chicks they had" got kit ". <Br /> <br /> Nuff said.
