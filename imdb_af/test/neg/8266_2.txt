Documentary Definition: A work, such as a film or television program, that presents a political, social or historical topic in a factual and informative manner and often consists of real news movies or interviews accompanied by narrative. The keyword here is informative. I love them to be giants, and have almost learned something about them. <br /> <br /> Interviews with all the celebrities were pretty worthless. I don't care what Sarah thinks of anyone and Syd Straw was really annoying. And listen to people, mention TMBG lyrics as they are supposed to be funny / interesting? It wasn't. I think that was the problem: the movie spends time discussing TMBG's love of coffee. Approximately?? Millions of people love coffee. Was the presentation of the material funny? No! There were hints that both men were married, but it was never discussed. And what about the solo material they did? What motivated them to do this? These types of questions are not addressed or answered. <br /> <br /> I could continue with the negative. I found the segment on Dial-a-Song very interesting. If you want to learn about them being huge, just buy a few CDs and listen. Seriously. This movie is a huge disappointment. I can't believe so many people gave it a 10.
