It was stupid. Kind of like an Adam Sandler movie. <br /> <br /> There were some funny parts, but not so funny. <br /> <br /> However, I liked the actors in it. <br /> <br /> There was some Saturday. Night Live people in the movie. But I won't recommend it unless there's nothing better. And it was even better than any Jennifer Lopez movie.
