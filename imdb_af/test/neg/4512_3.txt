I saw and had the original 1959 black and white that stars Shelley Winters and Millie Perkins and how often I see it, I can't help but cry. <br /> <br /> This version was (of course) a set, like the 1959, but there were so many errors in layout. Spiral staircase? Items that did not exist during that period existed in the movie. Doris Roberts, sad to say, can't play drama, she's a comic actress and it won't change. James Coco was a terrible Mr. From Daan and Mr. Dussel looked like a college professor of mine, rather than the dentist he had to play. In the original film, Anne walked the "gauntlet" to go to Peter's room, which seemed to take her more than a minute. In this crappy remake, it took her under 10 seconds. The first reviewer was correct ... This remake is just that, a remake. What did the director think of playing comic actors in a drama role? I'm sorry, but James Coco can't play drama. Max .. Schell was better in Deep Impact than this movie. The cranky Mrs. Frank was just as cranky, I couldn't stand her. Reference and comparison to the 1959 version, I like her better, she did better to be the overwhelming mother. Out of 10 stars I give this remake 3. Don't waste your time, get the 1959 version and a box of Kleenex.
