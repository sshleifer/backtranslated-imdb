Face! Antoine Monot, in a copycat copy of Kevin Smith's Silent Bob, still asks, but writer / director Christian Zübert never listens. Zübert just can't say no to a joke, no matter how cheap. The best thing about this movie is the soundtrack. Of course, Joey Burns of Calexico and the divine Jonathan Richman, underestimated old school bar of "There's something about Mary" boast, will get a small town out of bounds. In a visual appeal, Stefan (Lukas Gregorowicz) looks cool enough to drive his six-tier BMW two-door, with flying shades that go nowhere. Surely he * accidentally * sleeps with his wild-eyes bohemian child sister (Marie Zielcke), but then who wouldn't? Thumbs on how he goes black-and-white at a liberal dose of the mysterious substance, call them zero-zero, but if you're looking for a slightly more serious version of what drunkenness can do to you, I suggest before you make sure of "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas".
