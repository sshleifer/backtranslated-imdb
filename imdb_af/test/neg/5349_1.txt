Regardless of whether the dominant social message of this movie - that vigilant justice is acceptable - is justifiable, I was more insulted by McConaughey's final statement. In a courtroom drama, the final statement of the lawyer is actually at the heart of the film, and if the problem is so difficult to resolve, the statement is really delivered to the audience and the jury. It basically implies that the audience views the rape of a white girl as a more horrific crime than the rape of a black girl. I find this very offensive. Regarding the rest, I found the acting rescue, with the exception of Sandra Bullock, who apparently plays her usual vibrant self (doesn't really work in a courtroom drama), but what is the point when the film's message is so poor is like this one. It tells you that vigilant justice is good, and accuses you of racism if you disagree.
