Koyaanisquatsi is simply the best movie I've ever seen. This is a masterpiece where everything is in the right place. Some scenes are not "beautiful" or "beautiful", but the camera never mocks or intrudes. This is exactly what happens here. The camera is used to pull in, shame and mock. There is no magical flow here, no sense of greatness or respect. Instead, some scenes are thrown together without greater purpose or plan. The music is disturbing. Just as I rated Koyaanisquatsi, the best movie ever made is the worst. It's also a "pure" movie, but it's the negative form, exactly what not * should be done.
