Apparently, a massive head wound is the cure for murderous tendencies, and makes a murderous sociopath in a lovely and indifferent dog-catcher. Also (for the ladies), it seems that the front gate of a psychiatric hospital is an over-mentioned hot spot to meet potential friends. These are just two of the approximately 23 absurdities we are supposed to accept for this movie to have any meaning. I love movies and I believed, as I assume many Americans are doing (forgive me if I'm wrong), Hollywood has become the best product. I came to learn how sad naive and brainpower I was and 2) how much more sophisticated European / Asian Cinema is compared to its American counterpart. <br /> <br /> I watched this alleged psychological "thriller" the night after watching a Japanese movie called Suicide Club. As the camera disappeared at Walter Sparrow's happy little family, it enjoys a good time to visit a room in prison (not to mention the condescending voice review that does the virtues of "the right thing"), I suddenly had an epiphany. I just watched a movie that made me feel like I had just a glass of water when I really wanted a beer. My thirst was sated, but it was strictly utilitarian. The point of departure was lightly interesting, but the story itself, with its innumerable "coincidences" (How do we explain her to find the book? We'll just say something, "... Or did the book get her, will it buy), yawning plot holes (why did wifey take the skeleton?), predictability and compulsory happy ending, just seems to be a Hollywood hack. In addition, throwing Jim Carrey was just wrong, at any moment I felt he was capable breaking into one of his stupid comedies, or In Living Color, Jim Carrey as a tattooed hard-boiled police detective who enjoys slavery and rough sex, didn't buy it for a second. "You want to disrupt? Deeply disturbing? Look at Suicide Club. The story surrounds the mysterious mass of suicide bombers of 54 schoolgirls. The film opens with a group of giggling high school students walking on a subway train platform. get up, hold hands and present themselves for a quick commute throw your train. Needless to say, there is a lot of chaos. That's the way I go with the story line, because I encourage the reader to watch the movie. In fact, I'm not sure I could judge the plot, even if I wanted it. What starts out as a simple mystery, falls quickly into a madhouse of grotesque images. Did I understand the movie? No, not initially like many of the foreign films my friend introduced to me. So of course I thought it was bad. But this one thought in my mind. I went to sleep and woke up the next morning and looked at IMDb. I read some of the viewer comments and was surprised at 1) the insights that others got from the movie and 2) the fact that I missed the whole point of the movie so thoroughly. I realized that I was so used to spooning the "message" of Hollywood that when I was confronted with a movie that actually required the viewer to participate in thinking for themselves, I was totally unfinished. It was as if I had been conditioned to check my brain at the theater door. <br /> <br /> Do I think Suicide Club is the biggest movie ever made? Of course not. It has its faults, many of which have been reportedly adroit by the IMDb reviewers. Do I say that all American movies are bad and all foreign films are good? Again, of course not. My point is that there is a whole world of movies outside Hollywood, a work that involves the viewer; force them to think and question movies that do not follow telegraph plots, follow a strictly linear sequence, and above all, do not look at the person's intelligence. I am looking forward to expanding my mind as I explore this new world of film that does not mind me.
