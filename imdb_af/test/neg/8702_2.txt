I realize it's very difficult to live up to the first The 10 Commandments movie (which was great and personally not a Charleton Heston fan), but wow ... this movie / mini series was disappointing. Even the animated The Prince of Egypt was better. <br /> <br /> The one thing that threw me off was Ramses. Compared to Yul Brynner's version, Paul Rhys's version was just as weak and un-Pharoh as. The acting wasn't really that good. For a modern adjustment I expected something better. It just didn't look as beautiful as the first one. I think they are running on a tight budget or something. There is an occasional storyteller that I found strange and unnecessary. It also broke the flow of the story. And um ... God's voice / lines were a bit strange.
