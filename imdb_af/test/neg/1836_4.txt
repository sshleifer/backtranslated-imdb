Disturbing and rough, very scary parts. It even has a good writing and ending. But it has a poor part. What else can you see from this movie? It's a good mystery and horror movie. But of course, if you like, go buy it. If you don't, there's still no reason to waste your money on this. <br /> <br /> Rated R for extreme graphic violence, sexual situations and profanity.
