An Sci-Fi network original. Not the best. Not far from the worst. An electrician (Richard Grieco) stumbles on a "key" that can open a gateway to a parallel Earth taken over by mutant spiders. The mutations have been controlled by a super-alien queen for the past thirty years. She has already generated the population of this parallel world that looks like Chicago less residents. Guess what? Now she has to find another world to educate. The electrician leads a team of four men who are reluctant to save the world. The final confrontation is probably the best part of the whole movie. The cast also features: Richard Yearwood, Colin Fox, Kate Greenhouse, Jason Jones and David Newman. One might think that the Sci-Fi network could spend more money on special effects.
