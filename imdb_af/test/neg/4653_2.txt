All but the youngest Americans are probably familiar with the iconic call of "Laaaaaa-sie!" from little Timmy, or whatever the child's name was, laughed his little head for his border collie friend. These Americans may or may not be familiar with the fact that Lassie made the leap from television to movies (or was it the other way around? I am far too lazy to do any research here) and The Painted Hills is one of those. It is irresistible to go "this movie to the dogs!" pun, so I will not (although I technically only did). But somehow it does. Lassie (playing Shep, man's best friend) gets top bill. THE DOG IS ABOUT BILLING. Now, I'm not familiar with how actors or their agents negotiate contracts, but here's how it plays in my mind: <br /> <br /> MOVIE MOGUL: Well, Lassie, in the credits, it's gonna be, " he said. And with Lassie as Shep! "LASSIE: Rrrrowf! Grrrrrrr. MOVIE MOGUL: Ha, ha, kid, calm down, calm! LASSIE: Rrroo rrroro roooo. MOVIE MOGUL: Well, I think I see. Co-determination invoice? LASSIE: Rawrf! Rawrrrff rawrf! MOVIE MOGUL: Oh God! Release my arm! Top invoice! Top bill for you, leave my arm now !!! <br /> <br /> So, the dog gets the best bill, and with the rest of this shell-shocked role, I suppose it's understandable. We get lovely old grumpus Jonathan, the prospect, his young, shiny and apparently beloved friend Tommy, heady loser Lin Taylor, and lovely old religious grumpus Pilot Pete. The meat of the plot here can be summed up in a few sentences, so I'll save you the real pain to watch the movie. Jonathan is a prospect with a dog named Shep, and his partner dies while he is claiming. He gets a new partner named Lin, who is occupied with the gold, and Jonathan, for some reason, gives Shep a little tiny crybaby Tommy. Lin kills Jonathan, Shep sees it, and Lin tries to kill Shep. Then Lin Tommy tries to kill. Then Tommy, it gets cold, and Shep does an extensive plan to take revenge on Lin, what he (or she?) Does. The end. <br /> <br /> Unless you have a deep, disturbing need to see a Lassie movie (even a better Lassie movie should be like that), just avoid The Painted Hills. If not, we are amazed at Lassie's limited ability to "act" (similar in style, perhaps to Keanu Reeves - always the same facial expression, just moving the body), the conspicuous use of several-minute movie, or abusive Native Americans everywhere with his white-actor-in-face paint "Ugh! How! I walk wear!" stereotypes, The Painted Hills is only suitable for Lassie fetishes or people who have some kind of connection with prospecting through their days as a grizzled old prospector lookin 'goes some weathered ear of glittering gold!
