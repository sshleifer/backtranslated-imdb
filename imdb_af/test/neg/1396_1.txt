I didn't watch this show in months, but I had to force myself to watch it every day because I had a roommate who liked it. Perhaps it's been a big improvement, though the ads and the 4.2 rating on IMDb are not a good sign. <br /> <br /> It was clearly just a quick replacement for Chappelle's Show. Even Mencia says so. And while I wasn't even a fan of Chappelle's Show, his jokes were at least original and clever (and far beyond Mencia's). Mencia's jokes are completely original and birthday. If you can't see it, I think there's just no hope for you. But to be honest, here are some examples: <br /> <br /> - Miencia blatantly chop off Chapelle's Lil Jon shit. Just take it. <br /> <br /> "South Park" episode about Scientology. One week later, Mencia has a joke on his show about how offensive he is to scientists. Keep in mind that the joke is not about scientists, but about how much he insulted them on his performance. To this point, he has never made a single scientific joke. <br /> <br /> - After Hurricane Katrina, two AP photos are on the internet that "find" a black man's "grounder" grocery and a white woman. WEEKS later, after millions of people have seen it, Mencia suggests it has been discovered and it is shown for the first time (the Daily Show would have been such a thing that day). Pathetic. <br /> <br /> Even more annoying than the joke is the way Carlos promoted himself and his performance, claiming to break down a kind of PC barrier (whatever) and if you don't laugh, you must be a poor pride that can handle no jokes about race. Yes, Carlos, it's not because you're not funny, it's because we are all insulting to laugh (if it was really true, why was Chappelle's so popular?). He keeps on listening to his audience if he doesn't laugh enough, and often repeats his jokes, a technique that stops most comedians at the age of 14. <br /> <br /> The worst part is that Mencia doesn't seem to be very intelligent. It's kind of tragic that there are dozens of harder, more insightful comedians trying to make it while this man is rolling in money. His performance is thought to be the third highest rated on Comedy Central, which is staggering (again, it has a 4.2 rating on this site). Where the hell do they get these numbers? Comedy Central is trying to register itself as an "edgy" station, but as long as it tries to address the stupidest audience, it will never be the case.
