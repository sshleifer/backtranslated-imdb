I just wanted to say that I was very disappointed after seeing this movie! I expected a biblical story with a special special fx, etc. But during the film I discovered that it was an absolute disaster ... it was not biblical at all ... just the boat and the animals were similar to the story ... if you had a visual "translation" of the Noah's Bible version, you should NOT see this movie!
