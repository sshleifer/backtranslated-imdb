Dragon, sad and a total waste of my time. The plot is incomprehensible (so don't think too much about it). The acting is strange and wood. I would have sworn they were all professional bodybuilders trying to play their luck, but it could be an insult to the builders. There are no interesting special effects to save this disaster, but lots of fires, explosions, a free sex scene, etc. The only thing that caught my attention is that it happens after a war between the US and Iraq that somehow goes down. ..hmmm. Are Roger Corman Psychics? Let's hope that "Iraq" was just a happy choice for Corman and the rest of his scenario didn't come out. <br /> <br />
