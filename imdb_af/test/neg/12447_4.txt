Don't be fooled by the 'awards' and the comments below. This is just one poor movie. The way George Katt played his character (the gentle gunman) makes it very annoying to watch. The conversation in the opening scene is a dramatic show of this. In the rest of the movie, the character's head looked somewhere else. His emotions do not match the things that happen in the movie. The things he says as a voice-over do not add anything to the film. It only makes Zeus an even more spineless character with head in the clouds. <br /> <br /> The story and the film are composed with a total lack of fantasy. All parts of the film were stolen from other modern directors. Let's hope that Jon Rosten will use his own style and ideas for his future films.
