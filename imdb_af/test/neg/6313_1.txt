This movie easily falls into the category of ridiculous, if not beyond, actually being abusive. I mean in what alternative universe did the filmmakers and studios think this movie would play? From start to finish we bombarded with Quaid's overworking and ridiculous facial expressions, which put a little thick on the "im los cannon". Another picking point I had at the movie was the lack of a realistic story of events that grow to connect to a character. I mean in one scene where Lewis plays in a pub before he makes it big. It is on top of, just totally absurd, fighting which every citizen in the town seems to be part of. Then Lewis shakes his version of a whole bunch "and everyone immediately forgets their differences and starts dancing wildly as if it were the most common thing in the world. These kinds of scenes, of which there are many, along with the lack of depth in any of the characters, led me to the real laugh, so all this movie is not worth watching for someone who is not interested in mocking a filmmaker and his actors for half an hour.
