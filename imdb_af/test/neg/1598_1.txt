I can usually tolerate twisted movies, but this one is really a sick obsessive self-absorbed movie! <br /> <br /> First, the author / director is completely a self-absorbed guy full of sick jokes that isn't funny at all. Secondly, he is also a sick twist that manipulates and poison children's minds! I can't believe my ears when I hear the sick and perforated monologues hearing the kids! <br /> <br /> I really feel sorry for Zane Adlum and Devon Matthews. They are both very talented, but have become the victim of Eric Skaeffer's dirty, little-known movie! <br /> <br /> And what did Eric Mabius's beautiful face happen to? I mean, he met this girl he's supposed to marry, but he wasn't in the wedding! In fact, there is this naked man in his place! Did the time fly so fast? <br /> <br /> Anyway, don't waste your time watching this movie unless you get poisoned and manipulated by one sick Eric Schaeffer!
