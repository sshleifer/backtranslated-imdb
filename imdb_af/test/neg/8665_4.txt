Is it just me or are most of the actors in this adaptation crazy? <br /> <br /> Although a superior actress, Jemma Redgrave seems to be joining her kids instead of nodding on the sofa. (I would have liked to see Brenda Blethlyn in the section, her commitment to the latest Pride and Bias.) <br /> <br /> Blake Ritson and Rory Kinnear were the only two I felt to be theirs to live characters. spirit and achievement. Everybody else confused or looked out of place. <br /> <br /> I'm not very familiar with dr. Who (I have only seen a few episodes so far) or it would definitely have been. <br /> <br /> Too bad Mansfield Park has not seen its appearance on the screen (big or small). This novel requires the talent of a Robert Altman to successfully balance all the complexities of the characters.
