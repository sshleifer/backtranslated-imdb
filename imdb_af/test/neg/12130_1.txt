This movie was pure genius. John Waters is brilliant. It's hilarious and I'm not sick of it even after I have seen it about 20 times since I bought it a few months ago. The acting is great, though Ricki Lake could have been better. And Johnny Depp is wonderful. He is such a beautiful man and a very talented actor. And to see most of Johnny's movies, it's probably my favorite. I give it 9.5 / 10. Rent it today!
