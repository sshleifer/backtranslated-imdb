From the handful of alternative titles in English, "The Sexorcist" is definitely the most suitable one, as it is basically just a shameful rage of William Friedkin's classic horror movie in which they replaced Linda Blair's 13-year-old old Stella Carnacina just so she could show her enigmatic naked body grat. I'm not sure exactly what Satan is trying to achieve here, but he looks solely at owning the young girl to play sexual tricks on her! Poor Danila masturbates through the bell and tries to seduce priests and even her own father to have sex with her. The young girl is introduced as a smart and ambitious theology student with a strange boyfriend (a stupid yellow car) and loving, though adulterous parents. If she takes a strange crucifix home to recover, ancient relics comes to life and no less than Satan himself (played by Ivan Rassimov of "Jungle Holocaust" and "Planet of the Vampires") begins to torment her. The overblown masturbation sessions and some bizarre nightmare sequences cover about three quarters of the film, and eventually director Mario Garriazzo begins with the actual exorcism. The final segment is even more embarrassing and amateurish! The priests don't really do anything but say vague prayers, but Danila somehow suddenly heals. There is not much going on, the dialogue is terrible and the producers seem to compensate every little mistake by adding more sleaze! This is one of the strangest Italian exploitation efforts of the seventies (why hell refers them to the Rocky Horror Picture Show?), But certainly not one of the best. If you prefer clones from "The Exorcist", I recommend "Demon Witch Child", "Beyond the Door" and "The Antichrist".
