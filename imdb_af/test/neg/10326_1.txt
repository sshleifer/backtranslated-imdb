I love Sandra Bullock. She is one of my everyday favorite actresses, but it's a movie she's had to pay long ago to get trashed. I realize it's nearly 20 years old, but my dead grandmother can do better than these people did. Beware, it's not even the $ 5.50 WalMart shelf. You know that when the play is so bad it doesn't even earn a few dollars, the sound quality is terrible. There is no closed caption to hear even the terrible dialogue, and it seems to have been filmed on a $ 1.98 budget. I thought I'd like to see Sandra in an early role to see how she developed as an actress, but YIKES is too friendly to use a word.
