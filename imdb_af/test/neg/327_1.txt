If you have low budget horror movies as much as I do, you'll see where you can tell who was involved in creating the movie, as each movie maker adds his own flavor to the cheese. So is the case with Jack-O. When I watched this real horrible movie, I had the unmistakable feeling that Fred Olen Ray was involved, perhaps not as a director, but somehow. And I found that I was correct. Just Fred and a handful of others can write something pathetic, and this movie just came from Fred Olen Ray. Unless you like Fred Olen Ray (and God just knows why anyone would like it) avoid this movie. If you are going to rent an Olen Ray picture, rent Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers, the only shining star in Olen Ray's dark cheese horror movie universe.
