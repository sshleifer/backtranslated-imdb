This show reminds me of an episode of The Simpsons, where Smithers fit by Mr. Burns was fired and forced to live a miserable life that was unemployed. All he did while drinking hours was watching Comedy Central. The implication was that Comedy Central was a pathetic TV channel for unhappy people, with nothing else to occupy their time. "Mind of Mencia" is slightly better than most of Comedy Central's programming, but it still serves as an example of why this channel is a low quality filler for people with absolutely no lives. <br /> <br /> Truth be told, Mencia is a fairly competent comedian who emits trite, softball ethnic jokes and cash on mere stereotypes of people based on their race, gender or economic status, or a combination of Two out of three of these features. If you've heard one of your friends' jokes at a bar or at work, believe me, you've heard about comedy about "Mind of Mencia." Carlos also tries to make fun of current events, but lacks creativity or originality. It's not to say that Carlos is always a washout. I found some of his sketches amusing, such as his rap video depiction as an oil sick. If you get a thin, come-of-the-mile comedy on you, you'll probably enjoy 'Mind of Mencia'. For those who are tired of recurring, pedestrians come away from comedians who walk out of the same old jokes.
