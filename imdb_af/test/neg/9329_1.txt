This movie was childish in his writing and laughable in his visual effects. Screens where Father Merrin throws in his bed and his smile of a cute native are signs of bad acting and poor imagination. Nothing seems to fit. The story jumps from scene to scene. The elementary writing leaves no imagination to the imagination and leaves no tension. The lady doctor at one point declares that she thinks the town will soon "explode" from all the crazy events. Indeed, there was nothing in the movie to make the line relevant. Of the terrible work the movie did, I would never have known there was tension in the town. If you are in stocking films, it goes on and rents it, but if you want to see it, look straight.
