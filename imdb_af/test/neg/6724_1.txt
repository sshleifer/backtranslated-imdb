I usually enjoy Steven Seagal movies. They are usually highly entertaining and are somewhat of a skilled Aikido. I usually like the way Steven incorporates these martial arts techniques into battle order. <br /> <br /> This movie, however, is a very bad movie making and it seems to me that the blame lies with the director and the producers who obviously have no idea how to make an action movie, let alone Someone like Steven Seagal and to take advantage of his knowledge and competence. <br /> <br /> I never saw the end of this movie. I went out before the end, simply because I could no longer look at this bad movie. I am sure that many people also share my feelings.
