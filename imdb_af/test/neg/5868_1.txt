This horror and the successor ONE MORE TIME (no thank you) and the terrifying Jerry Lewis disasters like Do not drive the BRIDGE LOWER THE WATER (why not just flush it) to shut down cinema owners to close their doors rather than being forced to run these movies. . True: in the 60s, block discussion of films has still been applied to unfortunate suburban and land cinemas. That means getting a good movie forced the movie to run loud timewasters. FIDDLER ON THE DRAG, or something good like that, I was sold by the American artist discussion office by a sniff seller who waved a lot of flops in front of me and clipped: "Now before we reach that one, you'll see your date this first ". that basically means "book this duds and we'll give you a tired hit". That's how and why so many theaters closed, forced to relieve their diminishing audiences and get annoyed with these assembly line failures with lame comedians and bored talent. Cinema owners, exhausted arguing that they were just locked, sold to a petrol station and demolished the theater. Nowadays, the same type of movies (like: I see you being HAPPY CHUCK AND LARRY) are banned in the mega google site in the 20 seat theater 99. Not much has changed. FREDDY GET FINGER ... anyone?
