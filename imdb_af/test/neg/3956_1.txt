I didn't laugh at a theater in so many years. The only problem is that it wasn't the movie's intention to snatch my throat. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely crowded with bad CGI, absolutely terrible duologist, absolutely terrible * acting * and enough geek references to bring out the whole thing as nothing but complete cheese. <br /> <br /> As a gamer and a geek-type girl herself, I have all the obvious game references in this movie, as well as the geek STUFF just thrown in the background as an eyecatcher (the Steamboy poster, the t-shirts of thinkgeek.com and j-list.com), and it didn't redeem the movie at all. <br /> <br /> The only thing EVERYTHING was good was the ghost kids who were deliberately bad at CGI to make them look like a game, and from Japanese horror movies yesterday. stolen. <br /> <br /> To be honest, it was hilariously bathed, and something I expected from a midnight TV show for Sci-Fi TV Movie. Don't expect more than that and you'll have a good time. Don't just get a soda, or you'll spit it everywhere when you get good lines like: "Why did you bring that game into our lives?! WHY?!"
