I challenge you to watch this movie and deny the above statement. That is, if you can stop looking at her almost flawless face. She also did a little fighting and a little shooting, but not nearly as much as I had hoped. The movie is extremely slow and low-budgeted, although at least they have tried to apologize for the spacecraft so under-populated. Almost the entire crew is on "suspended animation", and the ship moves on automatic pilot! And the heroine does not save any of them, or bring something valuable back "home"; The evil lady in space seems to have moved through, was the only part of her mission that couldn't be more easily achieved by the missiles that had blown up the ship at the end. There are also a few long but rather soft softwares, and a few "Alien" ride monsters that kill about 2 people. * 1/2 out of 4.
