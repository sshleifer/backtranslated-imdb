There is no way to avoid a comparison between The Cat in the Hat and The Grinch who stole Christmas. Let's get that part out of the way. First, let me first say that I think Grinch was an underrated and untouched movie. Cat was ... well, but terrible. <br /> <br /> Jim Carey was thrown out because he was a brilliant physical comedian, and fearlessly linked to the top, scandalous characters. Mike Myers returned to his old trick. <br /> <br /> Why, why, why Mike Myers ?? The kids can care less, and the Austin forces demographic will not spy this movie. So what was the studio thinking? <br /> <br /> The cat was also apparently related to Linda Richmond. Can we talk? Why a New York Accent? Not entirely in line with anything Dr. Seuss ever wrote. Myers was even allowed to sneak into his Scottish shtick. I wonder how many different voices the director and the studio are trying to work out before they just gave in and said, "As long as you don't say anything, you can keep the accent." Meyers never found any kind of comfort, either with the costume, makeup or dialogue. <br /> <br /> The little jokes were incompetent and incompetent. When Myers picks up a garden and delivers to the camera: "dirty ho", everything except the edge shot is missing, and even that wouldn't have helped. <br /> <br /> The same people who created Whoville 'clearly had a hand in the creation of the town and the houses in' Kat '. The sets and props were very attractive, giving the viewer an essential distraction from the bad writing, direction and Myers. <br /> <br /> There was a pleasure with Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston. Dakota Fanning was the only actor to know she was in a movie based on a dr. Seuss classic, and stay true to the genre. <br /> <br /> Call the SPCA. This cat must be nuts and never allowed to reproduce again. Please, please, no prosecution.
