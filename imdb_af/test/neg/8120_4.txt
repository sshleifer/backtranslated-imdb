Terrifying movie about a doctor who goes fishing and wind to catch a mermaid when thrown overboard. She stuck to bring her back with him. <br /> <br /> Glynis Johns, in the title role, is really a stupid person with a tail hanging out. <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford is the nurse who is so eccentric, but we don't see eccentricity here. In fact, Mrs Rutherford cannot use her real comic gifts. <br /> <br /> Nice to see David Tomlinson in the movie. He will meet with Johns 16 years later in the exaggerated "Mary Poppins". <br /> <br /> Miranda causes disaster in the fact that two guys, a neighbor's fianc√© and driver (Tomlinson) fall for her. <Br /> <br /> Ask any mermaid you see, what is the best tuna, Chicken of the sea! As for this movie, forget about it.
