If it is an art and essay movie, there is not enough art, not to mention essay. <br /> <br /> If it's a thrill, there's not enough thrill. <br /> <br /> If it's a teenage drama, there's not enough drama, and for teenagers there's not enough NOFX and too much Nino Rota. <br /> <br /> I thought it might be a trailer for Tony Hawk's upcoming movie, but there's no Tony Hawk, so I think I'm cheated. It's not Tony Hawk's biopic. <br /> <br /> If it's an action movie, it's missing out on explosions, which would be of interest or at least let the sleepers jump into their seats. <br /> <br /> Most characters seem dead inside, but it's not a zombie movie. In fact, if it's a movie, there's not enough plot. If it's not a movie, it's too long to be a music video. <br /> <br /> If it's a music video, well ... it's an album I won't buy.
