'Bland' is probably the word I want to use to describe this movie. I just watched it because it had a good score here and I was lowered. <br /> <br /> Basically, the film about racism is in a post 9/11 America and the director has a sledgehammer with it! There was no subtlety in the movie and it felt as though they wanted to achieve some sort of Magnolia feeling on the film - this is never a good idea, as the movie was just three hours' tedium and confusion start raining frogs to the end ... <br /> <br /> All in all, a big disappointment.
