A few years ago, this movie was scheduled for broadcast on TCM UK as part of a Tod Browning retrospective? but what they actually showed was the repetition of 1937! my brother watched it (and afterwards it follows the original, very scene-by-scene, even up to the set design)? Although no classic, he said it was a far more satisfying viewing experience than the incredibly creaking previous version? <br /> <br /> This was the first collaboration between Browning and Bela Lugosi, I had great expectations for it? but it was stopped when it became clear after the first line of boring conversation that the film's greatest concern was to saturate the silent-novel sound technique and consequently the rashes were stages and extremely static. The thriller plot is also not very exciting; even less appetizing is the apparent British-Indian institution (with the characters' affected actions and high-class behavior), not to mention the over-exploitation of wheat-idiosyncratic idioms such as "I say", "rather" and "look here now" all the more risible more than anything else)! <br /> <br /> In addition, there are a few unintentional cryers: Margaret Wycherly (as a fake medium) pleads with police inspector Lugosi (if there is anything, his unmistakable screen presence is evident) around her a little give time to 'work out' who is really the culprit of the double murder (the evidence indicates her own daughter, played by Leila Hyams!)? she hears an eavesdropping and is deceived into thinking that the spiritual world has really made contact with her, but then Lugosi comes into the room and in his unmistakable accent she tells straightly: "I have beaten twice? you have not heard me! ", where my brother and I almost fell on the floor in convulsions of laughter !! The editing is also very messy: during a high angle shot of the headset, is a mike seen how it is quickly reached from the camera? And even worse is a few cases where a person moves to the next shot to another part of the set, but each shot is kept on the other actors at an absurdly long time. Take this person forever to walk just a few steps! <br /> <br /> THE THIRD PARTY CHAIR points the third non-abominable Browning Talkie I watched ?? Even though it is both MIRACLES FOR SALE (1939) deals with murder and occultism, it can still be linked to the genre. Much has been said about the director's apparent relaxation with the advent of Sound: anyway, although it is possible, the 4 straight horror films he did during the 30's are infinitely better than the rest? which I have always found attractive and bizarre enough to suggest that Browning was not so much at sea during this period as proposed?
