It's probably the most annoying show I've ever seen in my life. It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic I have ever seen. Everything about it is just bad. <br /> <br /> Overview: Different situations occur every week for the parent to handle their children. <br /> <br /> I couldn't understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several seasons. The writing is bad, very bad? It contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in graded R or NC-17 film. Especially for the young boy character, where everything he does is enjoy himself, is what one called family shows humor? The casting is also terrible, because everything you see is a very real BAD actor, period. <br /> <br /> Final Word: This Show is a real torture !! This view gives an idea of ​​how irresponsible the parent can be (use power incorrectly rather than understanding). It's a thousand times away from reality. Listen to Kenny G would send a god, compare this. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0/10 (Degree: Z) <br /> <br /> Note: The show is so bad. That even Mother of the Cast is pulling her daughter out of the show.
