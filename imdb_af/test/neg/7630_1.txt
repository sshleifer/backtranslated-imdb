I thought Sliver offered the most boring and trivial "trick" in film history, but of course I was wrong. I had no disillusionment that this movie would be good. Unfortunately, it was worse than I expected. The worst part is that the obvious end is so ridiculous and horrible that you can't believe it until it actually happens.
