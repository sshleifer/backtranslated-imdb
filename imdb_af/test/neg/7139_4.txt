The grudge 2 ... Let's see. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Japanese Horror Movie or Horror or Grudge basher. I loved the first and the original Ju-On. I feel so much more justice could be done for this one. Aubrey just existed to fill in what was needed to eventually be "discovered" (which if you've already seen Ju-On, you already know the whole movie), it was really a complete remake of Ju- On, just follow closer than The Grudge. Although everyone might have thought it was coming to America, it was a bit interesting, as the house at the end of The Grudge was expected to have left the 2nd hunger for a new plot. <br /> <br /> Save your $ 6.50 and wait for this to get out on DVD, rent it, watch it, decide if you want to buy it. This movie is good for falling asleep 2 in the morning movie. But overall, I want to say a 4 out of 10. Sorry Grudge fans, it's just ... They just failed at this one.
