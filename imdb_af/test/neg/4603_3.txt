I waited a long time to see this movie. IFC finally ran it one night. I thought it would be something like Barbet Schroeder's "Barfly". Wrong. This movie does not recreate the underworld of chintzy, dirty, smoky, characterful bars that you associate with his stories. It also fails to capture the Bukowski attitude that Mickey Rourke has done so well in the above film. The natural smart-ass attitude. Charles Bukowski's fans would love to see screenshots of his books on the screen, but those who are unfamiliar with his books may get the wrong impression about his works. This film looks just like another movie of the week about drunk and his relationships. If you want a better idea about Charles Bukowski's world watch "Barfly".
