I can only assume that the previous positions of the executives came to the production company. <br /> <br /> Last night attended the British premiere. Zane and Brook attended (they probably knew I was going to be there) and are undoubtedly stars, but what a turkey of a movie. I was sometimes sorry for them, when the audience in the spirit erupted over what was a splendid spectacle. <br /> <br /> But maybe I was missing the point. Perhaps an element of tongue-in-cheek is meant. If so, pure genius. If not, career murder. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Zane always shines, and Brook can actually do a little. As the other half said (as we exhausted the cinema, some broken ribs), they can be forgiven for this movie because they both look nice! However, the scriptwriter must be marooned.
