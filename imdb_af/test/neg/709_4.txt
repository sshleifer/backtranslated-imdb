I just watched Atoll K-Laurel and Hardy's last movie together and was known here in the United States as Utopia-on Internet Archive who wants to see some extra footage as the IA version is a running time of 2 hours and 21 minutes. It seems that this is basically the same version I used to watch on the cellar's VHS band of Goodtimes Home Video, which lasted an hour and 23 minutes (with the exception that no product placement of the Welch's Grape Juice label was inserted when a bottle has been shown) with the rest of the running time devoted to the dark empty space. While Stan looks like he will soon die, he still performs fine physical comedy with Ollie for much of the first 45 minutes or so. Then the plot of a yacht with a stoep and a man with no land aboard. Not to mention a lovely female French singer, they also arrive at an unknown island. They eventually end up with ultimate complications that pretty much offset the comedy and never recover despite the well-known end of Ollie who told Stan last time: "Here's another nice mess you got me!" before Stan cries uncontrollably before it fades. In other words, if you are a hard Hard Laurel and Hardy fan, this movie is recommended to watch at least once. Anyone who wants to become acquainted with this classic comedy team should seek out their previous work done to Hal Roach from the 20s to 1940 when they completed their last Roach movie, Saps at Sea. Think about it, even some of the L&H Fox flashes (not even the two they made for MGM) of the '40s are better than this one ... Update-8/29/09: Just watched some missing scenes that appeared in the Italian version on YouTube. Cherie sings in one and talks to that captain. In another, that captain's wife pulls a gun at Cherie. In one more, Giovanni explains why he left his country with a flashback scene. Stan is called here at high altitude!
