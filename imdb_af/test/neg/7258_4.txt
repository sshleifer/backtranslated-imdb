THE DEAD MANTIS will definitely not scare anyone, but if sci-fi programmers go, it's better than most. A volcanic eruption at the south pole evokes a giant, prehistoric preying mantis at the North Pole. Military men are leaving. Dr. Ned (William Hopper - Hedda Hopper's son and best known as Paul Drake on television's PERRY MASON) is switched to i.d. the creature - but by this time the creatures ate several Eskimo and headed for the Washington Monument. <br /> <br /> About a third or more of the film consists of stock footage: government educational films, military men in radar rooms, airplanes - and do you want Eskimos to go to the sea? This obviously explains why an Eskimo tribe is being attacked in the movie. ("Hey, guys! Think we can work it in?") In some insignificant effects, mix some dialogue, and some sexist attitudes, and you're good to go. Not as original as the monster that challenged the world, but fans of the 1950's "big bug" schlock will enjoy it - and the kids will have a good time throwing popcorn on the screen. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
