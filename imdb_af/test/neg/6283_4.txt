"Tenchi Muyo In Love 2" is the third Tenchi movie. It seemed as if his creators had taken elements of the first two to make this one. Tenchi is kidnapped and the team must get him back. Nothing new there. A past love of Yosho's is the bad guy. This was done in the second movie. The battle between Aeka and Ryoko starts to get boring. The movie has virtually no action scenes in it and very little comedy. I don't personally know what AIC, it's makers, thought. I gave this movie a vote of 4.
