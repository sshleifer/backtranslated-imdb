Continued in the queue of "stalker / slasher" flicks in the year of "Wolf Creek," "Hostel," "Joy Ride," etc. Come "Rest Stop." The most inexhaustible and unprofitable one of them all. <br /> <br /> We start, pretty promising, with the violent death of a pretty young girl in dirty toilets. <br /> <br /> That's where our interest is lost. We then move to the clich√© travel trip couple, heading for LA with their eyes on acting. . . making such a movie will never reach them. <br /> <br /> The couple's sexual skirt drives the couple all the way to a desolate and disgusting resting place for the girl to use the bathroom. Harmless enough until she leaves and finds her boyfriend missing and realizes she is bumped by a lame version of "Joy Ride "'s Rusty Nail. . . only drove in Mater from "Cars". <br /> <br /> Honestly, if it was directed / written / manufactured / acted by someone else, it could have been pretty good. But no. <br /> <br /> Then comes the ghost story. Yup. . . you guessed it. Lots of "oh I'll help you but wait, you're dead" to wait, is this stalker a man, monster or ghost? "<br /> <br /> But wait? Who comes to the rescue to save the girl's life and possibly the movie? That one Lawerence brother. Excellent. We are saved. (sarcasm) Oh wait, no we are . <br /> <br /> You know ... if you want to laugh a little or get free rentals, try it. <br /> <br /> If you want something, you don't learn to make a movie. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
