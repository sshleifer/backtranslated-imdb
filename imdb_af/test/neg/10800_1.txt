This crown of doodoo won an award? They had to be desperate to give out an award for something. This movie series of teenager upstairs things made me sick. Luckily I watched it alongside MST3K's Mike and the clash, so it made it tolerant. Horror acting, disturbing mother / daughter moment, stupid idea, if you want a bad movie here it is. Be warned you see it with Mike and the crash or you will suffer. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10. I still can't believe it won an award, and the director defends this * && $$ # $ ^ && piece of ^% ^% $ ^ $ # % @ $ # @ movie!
