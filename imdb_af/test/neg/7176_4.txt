I will admit that this is not a good movie. Really, it screams 'low budget' even strangely, I still have satisfied myself with the movie, because although it has quality, it is abundant with energy. It was like the Little Engine it could and merged a movie! <br /> <br /> The movie takes place at a radio network and relates to some of their low-level employees - two-page boys (one very intrusive and brash and the other one), as well as a new receptionist . All three have visions of the radio star, but must now satisfy themselves with their low work. <br /> <br /> In this story, a murder appears slightly out of the blue. I didn't know it was a murder film and was a little surprised. But, like most B-mysteries, the police are lambriene and it is up to our naughty hero (Moran) to try to save the day. Throughout this, I had a difficult time deciding whether Moran was offensive or engaging. I'm not sure yet !! <br /> <br /> There is a moment in the movie that is high on the 'cringe factor' and that is when the two pages try to express the roles of radio comedians. They appear in black-face and do a 3rd or 4th-rate imitation of Amos n 'Andy. Besides being very insensitive, it wasn't funny either. Fortunately, the manufacturer of the show they were trying to feel felt the same way. <br /> <br /> Overall. It's easy to skip this movie and I won't blame you if you do. However, the strange and frantic pass of the movie seemed to be the artistic shortcomings of the movie and I was glad I saw it. A good movie? No, but one that is still a sight for fans of old Bs. <br /> <br /> By the way, maybe I just didn't taste very good, but I thought both female singing divas had really bad voices despite how everyone in the movie was enchanted by their warblings. Listen to yourself and let me know what you think. I just couldn't believe it was also allowed to sing on film - even for the low Monogram Studios.
