Most of the comments on this movie are positive, so I thought I'd correct the balance. I came out of this movie and wondered what was going on. I know now and consider it a poor movie. Initially, I discounted a dream order because it was too obvious. I was glad I had a free ticket for the movie, or I would have asked for my money back. Movie reviewers and critics like this movie, which only confirms to me that most of them sound intelligent rather than seeing an audience enjoy a movie. The 8+ rating this movie has is so misleading. Over 20 years, this film will not be compared to true greetings like The Godfather. The movie does have good performances from both, but it's not enough to save the movie. (also not the lesbian scene!)
