Well, where do we start? There was a lot of potential for this movie with such big stars playing a role. But the whole story was destroyed by a terrible plot. This movie didn't fall out to be what I would expect, the good guy made it alive, I mean, I don't want the good man to be successful. The end was very dignified and many cliches did not think so ever. YOU HAVE RELATED THE PLOT. The evil chicks will be successful. <br /> <br /> If you want to lose 1 hour and 2 minutes from you Time spent doing something else. This movie was the hallmark of CRAP. I really think the actors have made no doubt about this movie for some quick Vegas cash. SAVE watch your money for a better movie.
