There are shows and movies I've seen and then read reviews on IMDb.com that I didn't even agree with, and were happy to accept that there was only one difference of opinion. <br /> <br /> Reading positive reviews of this dirt just reminds me that a sinister conspiracy that TV network workers are commanded to browse the internet, undoubtedly places positive reviews on programs for which they themselves are responsible. How else would one give an explanation? review opinion that this show "probably becomes a phenomenon" a full year after it became clear that it would be nothing of the kind <br /> <br /> I will not waste words describing this mess, but Suffice to say if you enjoy, women who emasculate their husbands, men who emasculate their boys, children who are careless jackasses to their parents and absolutely no other threads of behavior or subtext to justify characters who are just careless for one-liner automatic dispensers. this sh ow. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I have some Seinfeld DVDs to go through. <br /> <br /> Futurama - Cancel. TItus - canceled. Arrested Development - Canceled. The War at Home - Renew. <br /> <br /> No justice.
