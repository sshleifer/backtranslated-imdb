I had a good time the first 45 minutes. or so, but then it was suddenly hill. The tension started to become thin and the jokes slightly the same. What was going on was the good actors. <br /> <br /> But the problem with this movie is that it is cleverly funny, like Tarantino and God are those old things. Tarantino is sometimes overestimated, this movie comes ten years late. At best it is for teenagers, and I'm sure many of them find the character of Johann funny, which he is for the first 30 minutes. The other problem I have with that is that the story disappears more and more, I tried to find a recovery point. Maybe it didn't recover, because the lack of passion comes with the attempt to be clever. Also, as in many movies, it is certain that good actors who can afford it do not require a better dialogue, or just turn off the script.
