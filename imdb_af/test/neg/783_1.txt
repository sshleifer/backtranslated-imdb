How really sad that it came from the same thoughts as Donnie Darko, possibly one of the best films in this genre. Where do I even start? I think one of the disturbing aspects of the film is that we have to criticize humanity, and yet we see no humanity in the film. No more than 5 minutes of the film was spent worrying about the possible death of another person. These are horrible one-dimensional cardboard cuttings from humans. Unfortunately, this is how they are played with what can only be described as terrifying. Is it really how Kelly sees humanity? Judging from the reaction of viewers, this is a terrible encapsulation of humanity. Why don't the characters in the movie ask the questions that all viewers have? It is not a charge of humanity. This is a charge of straw men who set up Kelly, who has almost no parable with the real people in this situation. <br /> <br /> For those who say it was a wonderful thinking movie, what do you compare it to? Armageddon? I even saw someone comparing it to the works of Kurosawa. How truly deprived should you be thinking that this would promote good existential discussion? For the love of all that is good in film! Even indecent suggestion is ten times the charge of humanity that it is. There we see people truly malicious about greed and human condition. Yes, even indecent suggestion renders this film shameful for philosophical discussion and yet it gets 5.3 versus 6.0 for these senseless trips. <br /> <br /> Rarely have I rarely seen a more pretentious, pontifying and self-enlarging film fall flat on his face. It has the depth of a high school film project, and an arm on it. Surely it is about the level of discussion promoted by this film. If you want to see GOOD psychological filmmaking, do yourself a favor and look at Das Experiment. If the box even lived to this one goal, I would have been willing to forgive some of the horrible plays, gaping plot holes, and sheer nonsense story. Unfortunately, it can't even happen. <br /> <br /> The true charge of mankind is that there are people who think this film is a deeply penetrating look at the human condition. It's not Sartre! It's not even the Cliff Notes version of Sartre! It's a fast-paced, complicated 9th-quarter paper on Sartre, based on some internet board boards. If Sartre were alive, he would sue Kelly.
