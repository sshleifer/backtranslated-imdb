Lord David Cecil wrote an interesting book in the early 1930s VAST VICTORIAN NOVELISTS, where he studied the works of Dickens, Thackeray, Eliot, Trollope, Ms. Gaskell, Charlotte Bronte and Emily Bronte looked. He chose these writers as the favorite favorites of the first half of the Victorian era, and he explained their strengths and weaknesses (as he saw) to the reader public. Some of his remarks are quite appropriate today, but like all criticisms, it also gives an idea of ​​the spirit of the times of the critic's life. <br /> <br /> Cecil thought of George Eliot (Mary Ann Cross), who wrote about eight or eight books (including sketches and poetry). But for most modern readers, they are usually familiar with her shortest book, SILAS MARNER, which is still read in some high school curricula. The other books, FELIX HOLT THE RADICAL, DANIEL DERONDA, MIDDLEMARCH, THE MILL ON THE FLOSS, ADAM BEDE, ROMOLA, SCENES OF CLERICAL LIFE, are still in print. (Penguin, for example, has most of them in print), but is mostly unread. One of the greatest interest today is her latest novel, DERONDA, where she discusses the Jews in English society, and a beginner, pre-Hertzl-type Zionism. ROMOLA is her only attempt at a historical novel (about Savanarola's experiment of a religious pure republic in Florence in the 1490s). Her meatiest novel is MIDDLEMARCH, which in 1832 was the English society in the provinces, the year of the great reform bill of Lord Gray. I had to read MIDDLEMARCH in college for a literature course. It's definitely a thoughtful book (Virginia Woolf calls it the most mature book in the English language). But it suffers (like Eliot's novels) from one defect - she can't write lively, exciting prose. While Dickens is sometimes exaggerated, and Thackeray can become pompous and prolix, and Trollope can (as Lord Cecil says) become quite common in his conversation and Charlotte Bronte cannot explain certain relationships well. Gaskell looks the best to go With female characters, everyone (and Emily Bronte in her single novel) keeps the reader's interest. To read most of Eliot's novels is to chisel the sentences of marble blocks with a toothpick! <br /> <br /> To date, I've read about fifty pages of MILL OF THE FLOSS. I see that one of the other reviewers has never finished the novel. But I've read a summary of what it's about. The Tullivers (Maggie and her brother Tom) are the central figures - they own the mill in the title. Although close to the beginning of the story, Maggie falls in love with the son of a neighbor whose father is involved in legal problems with Mr. Tulliver Sr. Tom takes a dull view of this relationship and the tragedy of the story is about dividing the brothers and sisters, which eventually ends at their end. (Maggie walks back to the mill to save Tom during a heavy flood, and they die together). It must have been a success with Victorian readers, but it is very dark and depressed for modern audiences. <br /> <br /> The movie has changed the end a bit - Maggie (Geraldine Fitzgerald) dies at the end with her lover, and Tom (James Mason) kills them at the end of his record book. The story is completely rewritten, except for the double death in the flood. It doesn't really help. Although Fitzgerald and Mason are doing pretty well with their parts, they can't really pick up the movie through their work. The end result is a fairly small movie, which fortunately did not hurt the lead's careers. The only other thing to note is that the boyfriend was played by Frank Lawton, who played David Copperfield two years ago as a great opposite of W.C.Fields, Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan. But then, Lawton never really had a big movie career - he just happened to be always in pictures, some good, mediocre.
