I'm not sure I've ever seen a movie as bad as this. Awful acting, All about the place plot, terrible special effects. There are a few 'so bad' good moments here, but not really enough to keep interest. The woman playing Tracey looks terrible. There are a few disappointing scenes with a dwarf that make you feel so slightly hurt. On the positive side, the operating screens are quite amusing for the special effects, such as the car hunt where a car is trying to force us off the road without actually making contact. Guess the budget didn't stretch to dirty cars. Oh and what looks like a Taj Mahal's picture letter is shown every time they cut into the fictitious foreign land.
