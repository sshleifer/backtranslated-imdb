I come from Bangladesh, and here is C.C.Costigan a goddess of wonderful sex. Everyone slept aside, a friend and I woke up in the middle of the night and watched movies on the Encore: Action channel when we got a series of sci-fi esquire movie. There was RoboCop 2 (not bad, ... not bad at all) ... then Judge Dredd (Stalone almost ruined his career) then a movie called Lethal Target. One would think the title "Lethal Target" can only be awarded to a really cool, and really cute Rambo knock-off. But no, what is being delivered is what I would like to call a "Semi-softcore, semi-pseudo-action, semi-sci-fi movie" ... actually, I think I can say it's not even a movie is at all. If it wasn't for the main character's beauty, my friend and I would turn off the movie as the opening credits rolled. <br /> <br /> I have a few questions for the people (I don't even dare say "professionals") who made this movie. -And, in the future, why do they use the weapon we used in 1999? Oh, wait, I get it, that's all they can get their hands on ..... Well then, why is the main character that looks like a regular daily linen shirt and jacket, similar to what people in worn in the late nineties? .... oh ... I get it ... in space it must have been a fashion statement. Well, then ... WHY, OH, WHY does the main character draw a 3.5 slide at one point in the movie so she can upload some bullshit? wtf !? ... we've gone so far that we have space travel, but we still haven't progressed past 1.44 miles of space. <br /> <br /> I think I'm just asking too much. <br /> <br /> Question two, let's just say ... yes ... this is a soft porn. Then why is there only ONE real sex scene and why does it last for 2 minutes? <br /> <br /> I mean, you take the REDE people in the middle of the night to see this shit (dare I say "movie" more?) ... and finish it up to 2 minutes . Hell, they just had to take that sex scene and sell it to another porn movie, and they would have made more money from this crap than they did. <br /> <br /> CCCortigan is hot. And no offense to the actress, but she does as well as I do. and I'm mentally retarded, and have only one testicle ... (C.C. Cortigan, ... email me ... we're going to lunch) I'll write more, but I walked out of space.
