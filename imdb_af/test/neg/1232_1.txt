Please do not waste six hours of your life as I did. The fact that I did is not a very good reflection on me. The only redeeming work in this clunker was by Wes Studi. How a 'prequel' with similar roots can't even be in the same universe, since Lonesome Dove is outside of me !! It was an unpleasant, fearless story. Plotlines were not developed, action scenes were almost laughing and the big end (disappointment) was an appropriate end to this mini-series. Val Kilmer, who I thought of as a trusted actor, played one of the strangest roles I've ever seen him. His final scene in the show had to be a filler by the director. I've read these reviews for years and this show asked me to sign in !!!
