I'm sorry, but it's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I can't believe they could get the first one in the series to get a budget to make another. Not that the budget could have been a lot - it's the least scary movie I've ever seen and laughed to the end (actually I can't believe we've looked it up) but I think it's because we could not I do not believe it.
