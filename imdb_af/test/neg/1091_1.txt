Well, I notice that IMDB didn't offer a plot info ... it's because it's not possible to do it without being crazy and disgusting ... because that's what this movie is. I watched it because I am a humongous fan of Chris Noth, whom I personally met and he is a good guy ... but if I ever meet him again, I will have no harm asking him what he does let them down. something so terrible. He plays a former children's gorge, which is now a brilliant doctor who spends his free time on small children with his car, with the purpose of mutilating and paralyzing them. It's not a spoiler, because it's all made. very clear from the beginning ... sick enough? Oh, it's getting better ... he's being manipulated to do so by his shaky sister who threatens to keep him sexually favoured if their youngest victim doesn't die. Even Clive Barker couldn't write anything so bad. Please, if you want to see Chris Noth in something worthy of his talent, hire "Teddy Roosevelt and The Roughriders"
