** Possible Spoilers Forward ** <br /> <br /> When fans of bad movies meet for more than a few minutes, a name always comes up, that of Larry Buchanan. This amazing director has given us other turkeys (ZONTAR THE DING OF VENUS), cheap jack crime dramas such as A BULLET FOR PRETTY BOY, and a little conspiracy flicker like DOWN ON US and GOODBYE NORMA JEAN. THE LOCH NESS HORROR is a humdinger to say the least. In view of the fact that Loch Ness is extremely long and narrow, Larry filmed this cry on a wide and round California lake. Early on, the film boasts a spectacular (for budget) underwater photography and creates an atmosphere in spite of itself. Then it is disrupted in a windy dialogue, spoken by no-actors, with Scottish accent. It's not a soundtrack that won't do anything for the very malicious bagpipe. At one point, campers sing "You take the highway, I'll take the low road," just to throw in another Scottish cliche. If Scottish people ever decide to jump on the Politically Correct Bandwagon, they will sue Larry Buchanan over this film, his name despite. The monster looks like a giant paper-mache puppet and it makes the dragon look like Beanie & Cecil. In an unforgettable scene, Nessie takes land, and to evade some patrol soldiers, the fifty feet of a tree tries to hide behind a tree - and the soldiers don't see it! THE LOCH NESS HORROR is a true mindset that has to be seen several times to be believed.
