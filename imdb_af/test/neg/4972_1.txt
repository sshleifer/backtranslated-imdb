I love the Jurassic Park movies, they are three of my favorite movies. <br /> <br /> And I hate this game. If there is one game I wish, I never owned the Super Nintendo. br /> <br /> How can a game based on a classic movie be too terrible? And to make it the worst, I was afraid of this game when I was a kid. <br /> <br /> How stupid it was, but then I was a kid again when this game was the first time. <br /> <br /> The game in this game is just strange. One minute it's an action game and then it's a shooter. What in the world is wrong to make your mind when making a video game. <br /> <br /> The sound in the game is just awful to listen to. <br /> <br /> The music is just too sick to listen. <br /> <br /> The controllers in the game don't work most of the time. <br /> <br /> Jurassic Park the game is just a waste of time and money and will not be a classic. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs
