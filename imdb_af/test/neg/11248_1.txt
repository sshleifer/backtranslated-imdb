This movie was completely outdated and uninspired. The central premise of this movie was basically a lot of stereotypical black people who were sitting around a hairdressing shop that exchanged painfully unfunny repartee. I didn't even laugh at the whole movie. I could have sat in a barber shop in America and heard this banal scarecrow, and maybe even a decent haircut came out. I can't understand why this mess received any favorable reviews, much less why so many people wasted money on it. None of the characters here were funny or cared for. I didn't really care if the competitive barber shop across the street would let Nappy Cutz go. Don't waste your money on this one, people, because this is the only way to stop Hollywood from holding out these shambolic pieces of garbage. 1 * out of 5
