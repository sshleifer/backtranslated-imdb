Dr Stephens (Micheal Harvey) manages a spiritual asylum. He has a different approach to the insane. He does unorthodox treatment methods. He treats everyone like family, there are no locks on the patients' doors and he makes some of the prisoners work out their distorted fantasies. He makes Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin) dress and act as a soldier, and Harriet (Camilla Carr) is a puppet, including putting her in a bed. Dr Stevens is outside to cut Judge Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Ross) with an ax quote. It seems to be a bad move. Once Dr. Stevens turned back, the right turned the ax in his shoulder. Soon nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives at the Sanitarium to arrange an interview with Dr Stevens about a possible work. She is met by the main nurse, Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick and Anne McAdams) and is offered a route post. She gets to know and gets well among the patients. But things are starting to get acidic, the telephone lines are cut, an old woman, Mrs. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams) cut out her tongue and she began to feel a strange feeling that things were just not right. Then one night all the dark secrets of the Sanitarium are completely revealed. Produced and directed by S.f. Brownrigg this movie has a good central idea that ends in a cool twist, but ultimately it is a bit of a pain to go through due to the low budget constraints and a fairly slow writing by Tim Pope. There are just too many long-haired dialogues by prisoners, not many really happening until the last twenty minutes. The film has no real visual quality as it is completely situated in the Sanitarium. It's basically just a big bare house in the middle of nowhere. There are no graphics in it, a few splashes of blood here and there and it's a pity for you. There is a little nudity, but not much like the gore. The acting is pretty strong, especially Holotik and Weenick. Photography is flat and unaware and I can't even remember what the music was. The spinning end is great, but it just takes too long to reach it. A film that had a lot of potential was probably held back by its budget. OK, I think, but I think it would work much better if the story changed in half an hour 'Tales form the Crypt' episode.
