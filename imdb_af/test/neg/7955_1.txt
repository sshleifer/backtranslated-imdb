Pathetic NRI Crap ..... Appeal to anyone who is not Indian .... This is the WORST of Indian theater, made by the worst piece of NRI waste ..... The story is boring and cleaved (the way NRIs and westerners see India). Go for it if you want to be bored. <br /> <br /> The movie deals with the fate of widows in India before independence. Many are true even in remote rural areas, but not to the extent depicted (perhaps because it is a period film). <br /> <br /> There are many other Indian movies directed by highly talented directors who are worth enjoying. This one is a definite mistake. Rather look at a documentary or look at information about the internet if you are really interested in the fate of the oppressed in India. <br /> <br /> I wasted my time.
