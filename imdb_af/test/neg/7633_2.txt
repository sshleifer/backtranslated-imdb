Rebecca De Mornay can be a fascinating beautiful actress, but for the parts she is given to play, if you can't say something nice ... <br /> <br /> De Mornay depicts a woman who had terrible trauma as a child with a father she could no longer stand as if she had grown up and had a natural brilliant shrinkage. She has a relationship with Banderas, which we suspect is a serial killer. Sometimes they remind Banderas mother. -In-law Tippi Hedren's character in "Marnie". But I won't count on it: Hitchcock died twenty-four years ago and many regents are trying to replace him immediately. The director goes all out to make a thriller with an unexpected end, but the end is so far-fetched. It is absolutely impossible to buy it. The film includes the mandatory "talks with a serial killer" in the "silence of the lamb" tradition, murders (people and cats), split personality, and open end in case the crowd has to call for more.Apparently they have not, and they were right.
