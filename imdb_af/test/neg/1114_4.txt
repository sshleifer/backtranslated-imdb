In 1913, in the Carlton mine, Addytown, Pennsylvania, the cruel owner of a mine used poor children in exploration and after an explosion a group of children were buried alive. On the current days, Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring) recently lost her husband after a long period of terminal illness when the family savings in treatment were spent. Without money she goes with her daughters Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Emma (Chloe Moretz) to an old house in the mountains that belonged to her husband. Karen is advised by her neighbors to stay home at night, and Sarah hears there are zombies in the area. When Emma becomes a friend of Mary, his mother believes she is an imaginary friend. However, when Sara's friends are attacked and eaten by zombie kids and Emma disappears, Karen and Sarah chase her near the mine. <br /> <br /> "Wicked Little Things" is not a very bad movie: the play is good; the makeup is creepy; and the cinematography and music score is excellent. However, the story, and therefore the script, is very poor, indeed a bad collection of clichés. The start is reasonable, with a widow moving to a house in a remote location because the family spent all their resources on the disease of the patriarch. But when she arrives, the small zombies accidentally drop people without any consequences. For example, families do not seek out the missing persons. Then comes the wicked Mr. Carlton to the place with the most disgusting attitudes, a typical cliché that he will eventually die. There is no explanation why the children have attacked innocent people and why should they stop Carlton killed. When Sara runs away with her mother and says she's tired and can't run, it's one of the dumbest lines I've ever seen in a horror movie. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Zombies"
