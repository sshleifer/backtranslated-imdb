It's hard to believe that director Barbet Schroeder once did the majestic and very funny Maitresses (1976), and just looks "by the numbers" Hollywood thrillers. <br /> <br /> It is very lightweight John Grisham material, crossed with the plot of a TV movie. Bullock is Cass Mayweather, a firm and independent crime investigator specializing in serial killers. Ben Chaplin is her reserved police partner Sam Kennedy, and together they make an awkward duo. Not good, when two unbalanced fellow maladriots (Gosling and Pitt) decide to send them to a wild goose hunt - by planting many clever and deceptive forensic evidence on a crime scene. <br /> <br /> Good enough, but while Bullock and Chaplin fail to create any sparks, we also endure some dull, exaggerated melodramatic flashbacks that illustrate an important event in Cass's history. Then there are, of course, the regular shots of a stone-side log cabin where there is no doubt that the OTT end will be instituted. Oooh ... the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Look at an episode of CSI. It's on the point and much more exciting.
