It's a fair movie, good for one-off show. The plot itself is pretty well worked for a picture of this kind which is a pleasant surprise, like the play, although a little hammy, is better than normal for this type of movie. <br /> <br /> The 'special effects' are hilarious - a translucent giant and a blatant polystyrene / paper mache hand undoubtedly wrap on a little wire. <br /> <br /> Definitely look for kitsch entertainment value. <br /> <br /> 5/10.
