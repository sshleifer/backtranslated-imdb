Chaplin was a quiet comedian, but very quiet era stars fell when the public heard their voices in the first talks. In my opinion, Chaplin's voice simply doesn't match his silent characters who made him rich and famous. His career never recovered when sound came into the movie. In contrast to most of the reviews I read, Chaplin's lifestyle and politics did not help with the average viewer who would be entertained by Chaplin's comedian, and not spend their entertainment dollars on Chaplin's political commentary. <br /> <br /> Despite Chaplin's awards and knights, I would make exception to his "contributions" to humanity. The Great Dictator was made simultaneously. Stalin's brutal dictatorship had its trial trials, and both dictators signed the agreement that led to the invasion of Poland by both dictators. World War II began in an attempt to save Poland. The Nazis were defeated in 6 years, but Poland disappeared as a sovereign country. This happened during the time this film was made and Hollywood's investigations by the federal government. If Chaplin included Joe Stalin in this satire, he had, apart from the Italian dictator, perhaps less politics criticism by politicians. The Soviet abuse of Jews and dissidents exceeded the Nazis over time and numbers. <br /> <br /> Only considered a movie. Many of the gags were too active to understand by younger viewers, who wouldn't know who Goebbels, Goring or Mussolini were. A classic artwork should be the test of time. Classic Greek Tragedy, the 9th Mona Lisa and Beethoven are still enjoying centuries after their creation, because they are timeless. Movies that rely on current political commentary or popular social views usually do not fall into the generation in which they are made. But those who address issues that are common to all generations will probably live forever and get a high rating from me. <br /> <br /> Chaplin, as a writer, director, and lead actor, has to blame for what I consider a dated and tiring movie judge. <br /> <br /> Chaplin's apologists have decided to leave the country, rich and famous. If Chaplin found the USA so offensive, why didn't he return to his native country. Great Britain fought the Nazi with blood and money. What contributed to Switzerland in the fight against European dictators? Switzerland is like a country club that chooses and selects its members based on race and class, and does not care for people who cannot join the club.
