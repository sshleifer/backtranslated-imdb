An exuberant, overarching, relentless comedy that has no dramatic center. It was probably meant to have an epic vision and a surreal flair (at least in some episodes), but the separate stories are never elevated to a meaningful whole, and laughter is little and far between. Amusing end, though. (* 1/2)
