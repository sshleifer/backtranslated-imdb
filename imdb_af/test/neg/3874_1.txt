This movie had potential. The writing was not bad, and it presented an interesting dark atmosphere with themes of suicide, patricide, regret and - as Chris says - "10 years from nowhere". It is a sharp contrast to the original MAG7 which was bright, humorous, and even the bad guy was fond. <br /> <br /> This is a very interesting change of tone, and if they developed the characters more, I might have liked it. <br /> <br /> But instead, they waste too much time on free (and ridiculous) scenes, badly handed down. At one point you see a horse fall, and 5 seconds later you see the same scene again. But many people will not see it, as there are already two dozen horse rides (I do not exaggerate), and we are already gone. <br /> <br /> Which leads me to the title of my review. This movie is extremely cut because of animal cruelty, so chances are (if you decide to see it), you get the watery, kiddie version. There is a bullfight where the matador stings the bull, and suddenly when the crowds erupt, there is no bull, just the matador in an empty arena. Like wow, maybe the bull was a Jedi, I don't know. More likely, the scene was cut. <br /> <br /> Later, there is a cockpit scene where in the original version one of the birds is terribly murdered before a crowd of delighted Mexicans. It's cut. But we still see enough to get very irritated. <br /> <br /> But by far the worst scenes are the horse throw. One after the other you see horses' legs being cut down and sending thousands of pounds of horses on their heads. In one scene a horse is thrown, and when it crawls on the ground in paralytic convulsions, an explosive just goes under its neck. <br /> <br /> This film was made in 1966 when Hollywood just started regulating animal breeding on film. This is probably one of the last movie where you can see it happening. So if that kind of thing drives it on your boat, check it out and you'll get a light excitement. But if not, you won't be annoyed or bored.
