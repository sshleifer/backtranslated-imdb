If you are a fan of the original ten commandments, this movie will make you cry. Permitted, I'm only about 1/2 hour in it, but it's so painful. I felt it was my duty to warn true ten commandments before being subjected to this bastardism. I didn't think it was possible to really make the special effects worse than they were in the 1950s when the original shot was made, but this 2006 remake proves to be wrong. I can forgive some special effects, but the craptastic dialogue, melodramatic lifetime film-style and the stylized orbital figure-to-life act make me hope they will overwrite the plot and drown mosses. the Red Sea.
