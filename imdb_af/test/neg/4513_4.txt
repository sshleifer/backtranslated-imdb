As a dedication from Mrs. Frank, I remember being so excited that the play was made for TV again. This is until I have seen it ... This film is an excellent example of how important decisive and how directing such an important role plays in creating the sense of purpose. The decisive of any CENTRAL role is CRUCIAL to such a production. Show like AUNTIE MAME and MAN OF LA MANCHA are totally dependent on the charisma of the main actor. And in the movie of this movie, the whole thing is destroyed by the horrific decision of Melissa Gilbert in the lead. There isn't a single time that Mrs. Gilbert even close to the sensitive, mature spirit of Anne-Ms. living. Gilbert is "white bread" throughout the movie. The only time I was near tears was during the reading. from Anne's most haunting line: "I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are really good at heart" - it is said by Mrs. Gilbert talked, so chased, so convinced that she might well be buried and reached the effect. Film and dance legend Marge Champion was the dialogue coach for this production - she had to repay her salary! Despite me. Gilbert, who spoils the DIARY, is other performances especially satisfying for Joan Plowright as Edith, Scott Jacoby as Peter and Clive Reville as Mr. Dussell. Maxmillian Schell does not have the deep-seated soul and spirit like Otto as the creator of the role on stage and film (Joseph Schildkraut), but he is okay. Doris Roberts and James Coco as The Van Danns are relatively superficial in their parts. They are shrill and bombastic, but just on the surface. This may be due to the fact that the rate of the project has been rushed too much (as mentioned in previous reports) - this movie sounds shorter in 45 minutes than the movie version - the difference due to the pauses for dramatic effects, which apparently is needed to propagate the appropriate MOOD for the story. It is NOT mandatory viewing, especially for young people learning about Anne Frank for the first time, adhering to the original movie version, and even better, the TV production by ANNE FRANK: the true story starring Ben Kingsley, the most definite thing is to film the sadness and reality of Anne's situation ever! Note: Particularly terrible is the fact that Melora Marshall, who plays Anne's sister Margot, is NOT included in the opening credits with all the other members of the secret attachment. She is listed in the post credits with the actors playing Miep. and Mr. beads If I am mrs. Marshall was, I would have passed!
