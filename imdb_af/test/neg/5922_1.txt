I mistakenly thought that this neo-noir attempt by the Buffalo-Niagara Falls area might be something else. Unfortunately I was wrong. There are many problems with "The Falls", which really has nothing to do with the low budget video production. Immediately one has to ask why all the constant narration questions? My feeling is that if you have a decent script, the audience will follow without being insulted by voice over storytelling. The acting is very amateurish, which is not unexpected, but simply adds to the problems. Finally, the whole thing is annoyingly shot like an MTV music video that I find totally unacceptable. The narrative, bad acting and annoying video effects are all good reasons why it should be avoided. - NOTE
