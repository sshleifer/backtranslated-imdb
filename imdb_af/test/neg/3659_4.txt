Maybe I saw a made-up version, but besides a few flashes of breasts, I'm not sure what the top nudity these other commentators are about. <br /> <br /> All in all, not as bad as I was expected from previous comments, but the end makes you wonder ... WTF? It was dark, but not so much that you couldn't make up the scenes, and I think it just added to the creepiness and terror of the situation. <br /> <br /> Movie quality could have been better, but the acting was pretty decent. <br /> <br /> All in all, a definitely sloppy (and yes brutal) movie with a disappointing ending.
