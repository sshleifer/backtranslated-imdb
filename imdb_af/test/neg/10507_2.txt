As I said, sometimes low budget is good. You get a good movie without much of the extra BS that can hide another piece of crap. Well ... it was that piece of shit. As something, I thought it had humor, unfortunately the humor was unintentional. The only semi-conscious play came from Bill Smith and his part was cut out (it's a joke). There was never a Bill Smith, and no one could act. Even Gerald Okamura sucked, and he was thrown into nearly 40 movies. The battle scenes were comical and made me feel like I could kick their $% # @ # $. The sound was terrible, as if all sound was recorded on the set. My 10-year-old wrote a better script ... VAT, my 10-year-old fell asleep ... not joking. I give a B + for editing to cut the movie to just 90 minutes ... 60 minutes would have been an A +.
