There is so much wrong with this movie. Greico with a girl's horse, old man's scientific timekeeper, tough old Jones who stays behind with a shotgun who has three rounds, spinning people with tentacles and bad teeth. The makeup was so bad and they only had a few visible spiders on the screen at once (Aliens Cameron technique could have been used) instead they chose to pull each spider's person the same way ... bad. The nice thing about Greicus's play is that at every syllable he has his bobs, as if he counts how many words he gets to speak in the writing. It amazes me that with all the information out there on DVD commentaries, people like this still exist who make movies. This movie could have been worse, how I didn't know. Oh and one last thing. I'm going on a SCI-FI movie hunt. The people who manage that channel should not be allowed to propagate to continue the nepotism that exists in Film and Television.
