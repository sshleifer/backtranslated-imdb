I wish I could get some good things to say about this animated sequel (but not really a sequel) to "Atlantis: The Lost Empire", but that would be a very brief comment. The magic that the first one had is nowhere to be found. here the animation is pretty poor. The characters themselves are not very well drawn. The backgrounds and the foreground are also not good. There is very little attention to detail here. And instead of a compelling and engaging story, we have 3 short stories that are boring and do not make much sense. I swear, even the characters sounded like they were bored, and would rather be somewhere else. What says the voice actors were bored and wanted to be in another place is the impression. Some of the same actors return for this painful attempt, but an integral part of the success of the first one was Michael J.Fox as the lead hero, Milo Thatch. I get the clear impression that this movie is just thrown together. To capitalize on the success of the first one, with you This is probably the only good thing about this movie, and even she doesn't look like her heart is completely in it. You think I think it's a good thing. You can't blame one of the role players for not giving everything, considering what they had to do. Or not working. It's a straight to video movie (and I use the term loosely) that had to go straight The nearest landfill. Now, disgrace on Disney.consumers deserve much better than that. This one gets a 0/10 and a well-deserved one at that.pu.
