August 25, 2003 Extraordinary Lord League: <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is one of the all-time greats and I've been a fan of his since the 1950s. I went to this movie because Sean Connery was the main actor. I didn't read reviews or had any previous knowledge of the movie. The movie surprised me a little. The scenery and sights were spectacular, but the plot was unreal to the point of being ridiculous. In my mind it wasn't one of his better movies, it could be the worst. Why he prefers to be in this movie is a mystery. For me, this movie was a waste of my time. I will continue to go to his movies and add his movies to my video collection. But I can't waste money to put this movie in my collection
