I'm so glad I just got this movie for $ 5. Anime is expensive, no doubt about it. I looked at this one for a while and eventually I saw it on sale. I immediately grabbed it and just took it home to hang my head in disappointment. This movie sucked. I heard people talk about how greedy and violent this movie is. It's really not as stingy or violent. I watched it three times, and I think I've messed up enough of my life on this. The demons get a point to prevent them being unique and sick. The generation gets a point because it's almost non-stop. The horny old man gets half a point for horny and still has the sex drive. And the main character (whose name I've deleted from my mind) gets half a point for the cool design of his gun. I saw great connections between this movie and Demon City Shinjuku. Both have the same style of animation, it's obvious because of the director, both have lame soundtracks that suck like the Antichrist, and both have terrible ends. Avoid this movie unless you are in anime sex.
