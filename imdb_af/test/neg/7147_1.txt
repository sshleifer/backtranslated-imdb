During this movie, I thought why did they make it to the earth as a "documentary", but not real footage of the people interviewed? Certainly, it would have been like any other documentary, but then it would have been the filmmakers to find the meaning of the movie. <br /> <br /> Using an army of famous movie stars (many of whom apparently asked to be in it) to portray "real" people, gave me the feeling that there was a predetermined message to deliver. and the director was so committed that real people could not be trusted, so actors and rehearsal scenes were used. (Yes, I know it was also a play, but a documentary should be a documentary.) I really found myself sticking through the different stars, and I expected one of them to be a moment for character will fall and say: "I am a good person because I am here. <br /> <br /> This movie could have a much stronger social comment if it was more objective or let us Matthew Shepard and his killers as people rather than symbols. (The much better "Boys Do Not Cry" had an incomprehensible view of those involved - good and bad.) Instead, the Laramie project gives an almost inexorable lecture that someone's sexuality must accept be no matter what.
