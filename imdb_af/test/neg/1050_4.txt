It's really a two-part movie. The first detail of the lives and friendship of two boys (one privileged Pashtun and the other an apostate Hazara) in the late 70s of Afghanistan before the USSR invasion works very well. The young actors turn into convincing actions and see Afghanistan, as it once threw the current situation into the difficult relief. <br /> <br /> The real problem comes when we move into the later stage of the story where we join the Pashtun as a man living in America. Old debts to his young friend lead him to return to his homeland and it is really at this point that things are being broken down. The central adult character is clearly supposed to be sympathetic, but is actually left as wimpish and walk in self-pity. It's hard to really see him and you can't help but feel that the very interesting story is the one we don't see - that of his boy friend. When he returns to Afghanistan, the story becomes astonished in a series of highly confronted coincidences. Most notably, he has been able to immediately overtake his childhood enemy almost all the years, even though he is not looking for him, despite the chaos that has since consumed the country. It enables him to confront past demons in a way that is simply too convenient to be credible. The narrative resolution is also being worked out with an awful mahogany sentimentality that undermines any real serious points trying to make the movie. <br /> <br /> Although it is possible to see characters and their abuse, live as symbols of a state torn apart by world politics. It's really hard to see it as a movie involved in any wider political discussion. Instead, the story is reduced to one character's emotional journey of self-discovery and healing. Unfortunately, this character is so dull and wrapped up in himself that it is difficult to really get involved in his story, while wasting opportunities to make a very interesting film about Afghanistan itself.
