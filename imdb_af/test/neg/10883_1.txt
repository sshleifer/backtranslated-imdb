Seriously, people ... I was right to really write the Razzie board and recommend this movie as Razzie Champ for 2007 ... until I got to IMDb.com and realized that its copyright date was 2006 and not 2007 no. Though, this movie could easily have been a Razzie Champ. This movie sucked! How in the world this piece was watched, even though a Razzie nomination was outside of me in 2006, as it could easily compete with basically it stink, also for the 2006 Razzie Championship. <br /> <br /> I hired this movie on the recommendation of a female neighbor of mine who told me: "Oh my God, after I have seen this movie, it will be long before I ever stop peace! " I couldn't believe how scary and terribly this movie was! Possible spoils below, not that you won't miss anything. <br /> <br /> OK, first of all ... the problem ... the rest stops himself. Obviously the director of this piece of crap doesn't know the first thing about women. The toilets in that rest stop were on the same level as the one in the movie Trainspotting. I do not claim to know everything about women, but one thing I know is that women are for the most part total and complete hygiene / neat freaks. Given the choice between a shit on one of the toilets and possibly catching something in the woods or in the woods, a woman will choose to scratch the forest. I know, because I had previously packed with them, and they have no problem in the forest. So right there ... big plot hole and untruth. <br /> <br /> Secondly ... she stops from the rest, and her boyfriend driving the car is nowhere to be found, not his car. He just left. She started shouting his name, wondering where he was. Ummm ... hello? You stand on wet mud ... has it ever happened to look at some lanes? I mean, his car is gone ... it just didn't get up and blown away. And actually, it makes me think ... I actually looked at her feet, and there were no tread points in the mud. How ... exactly ... did this happen? <br /> <br /> Third ... The Bible immerses mobile phone family with the freak midget in the back of the Polaroid photos ... Wtf!?!?!? ? They had absolutely no sense and it is as if the director just threw them to be strange for the sake of strange. They had nothing at all and even had no place in the movie. <br /> <br /> Fourth ... Oh my God, this ... I mean finally ... near the end of the movie. She eventually saw the escape hatch on the ceiling in the resting place. I'm like, "You ... dumb ... bi ** h. You're locked up in these rest stops for all this time ... and you just ... Now ... see ... escape escapes on the ceiling? "I mean ... it's like they threw it just because the killer throws petrol on the floor through the window and was ready to lift a match. So she must reach higher level to burn, and ... oh, look! A perfect reason for her to get on higher ground! An escape hatch on the ceiling! It's like ... Why didn't she go there before? Most people in that situation would have seen it from the moment they were locked in that resting place and got the f ** k from Dodge. When they showed that escape pants at the end of the movie, I was like, "You must joke." <br /> <br /> Fifth ... what was the deal with all the people she got? continue to just disappear? The girl in the broom in the rest stop? The stupid man? At the end of the movie, when she finally ended up in the poll? It has never been explained. Personally, when they did, I thought to myself, "Oh, Christ on a cracker, it's her. She's the killer. Wonderful. She killed all the people, don't remember them and the authors of this movie. just got a certain French horrorflick that I can't name on IMDb.com, or I'll get blacklisted to finish (that movie also went through, people). "But it wasn't. She was not the killer, and the whole deal with the dead who disappeared has never been explained. Oh, for the love of God, people, stay away from this movie! This movie sucks balls, and I now have a serious leg to choose with my neighbor. It's on the 2nd for $ 1 rack at Family Video, don't even rent it if someone gives it for free!
