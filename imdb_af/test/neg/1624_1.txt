I just read an extra long review on the front page of this movie on this site and he fully explained that this movie is just worth watching on the television program "Mystery Science Theater 3000 !!!!!" to watch. And yes, I find that advice very useful! I mean, a movie trying to be this good and this exciting one really isn't what that movie wants to be !!!!! So, look at this movie as seen on the show and instead of giving this movie a single star out of ten stars, give it a ten out of ten stars! Until then, my one star review is for the real, pure, untouched version of this movie alone !!!!!! Do you have it now?
