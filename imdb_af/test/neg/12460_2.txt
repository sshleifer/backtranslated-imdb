Spoilers! <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 2 out of 10 for 2 scenes I will never forget. By the way, my husband hired this surprising non-blow up em almost chick looking flick. ... but I guess why when I saw the cover .... girls in school uniforms .... hey .... lol .... ah well, men if you can't do it. .... ;-) <br /> <br /> <br /> Byou Philips, one of my favorites on the indie screen ... too cute ...... not just okay not (her toy dog ​​is the best lesbian in town according to her bubbly outrageous character). This will be the first valuable scene. <br /> <br /> Then she goes into a toilet in a lovely gown and goes into a stall. get up, go out to the party she and the pathetic sad 'Cat' character, and give a shiny silver ice cream to the party host ... the host looks in her precious silver ice cream and says, "Oh my god it's a poo." <br /> <br /> I love Byou Phillips for her creativity and unusual movie choices. It will definitely be one of them. .... and um, I'll rent it for the poo scene if I'm you ..... I'm not a big poo joke fan, but it definitely puts the 'party people' in their place (they didn't look like they had a good time anyway ..... lol) ... You will never forget these two scenes ... hmm, but that's what we want in our database ... Maybe you shouldn't follow my advice. lol <br /> <br /> Dominique Swain is a kind of squirrel and sad in her confusing inescapable role in 'Tart'. I don't know, I can't decide if I like her because she's so in indie movies? Indie movies are wonderful and everything, but can't she choose a few things? I'm going to watch some of her movies and review review .... but this one was a dog (forgive the reference to animals).
