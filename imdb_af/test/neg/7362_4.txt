See .. I really wanted to enjoy this movie. There were moments when my heart was beating faster, when the hair started to stand on my neck when my muscles began to increase. But just like a stream, I was left without real action, no decision and money missing from my wallet. <br /> <br /> Jaume BalaguerÃ³ and Miguel Tejada-Flores do not know the right recipe for making a Horror Movie and use the old amateur cake's method to put everything in the pot. br /> <br /> This movie really threw The Shining, Poltergeist, Amityville, and Hellraiser all in one. Amazing, I know, but true. All the flavors are there, you can taste each one, they just don't mix well. I'm not going to list every thing that's wrong with this movie; In short, good cinematography, mediocre acting, worse dialogue. <br /> <br /> The -real problem of stealing so many movies and combining them into one movie, apart from the confusion that comes from it, is while you can run multiple sites at once, you can't do several have ends. And what does Jaume do if he runs into this problem? Just like a Freshman in English 101, you end your story with ellipses: "The car has disappeared in the dark and ..... THE END" Oooh, creepy. Not really. And many anti-climaxes. The end confused and disappointed me; almost empty. <br /> <br /> Take your $ 10, rent the Shining, Poltergeist, and Hellraiser. Scare off the pants of yourself, enjoy a good time and forget that The Darkness ever existed. <br /> <br /> -Bamin
