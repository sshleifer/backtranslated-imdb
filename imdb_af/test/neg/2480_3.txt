I saw every episode, and the characters all remained the same self absorbed. There is no character development in 5 years. Being pregnant is not developed if you are still the same daddies girl. Just now Delinda blows to Danny because Dad isn't around. Sam never changes or grows, making her boring, repetitive and just as annoying after his season 3, Danny is a typical gentle character commanded by everyone in his life (he has no principals of his own), especially Maria and Delinda . The old boring clich√©s will get used to them and off relationships get bored very quickly. <br /> <br /> James Cann can act and his character is good to watch, only he is just another hack writer wet dream, an ex CIA man who has great contacts and training, etc. so that he can stop any thief or deceiver for man, although the cameras can't make up half of the stuff they make up for a while, but in 5 years the writers are dumb, why? Having all this expensive and advanced technology, but no simple walkie talkie (communication is quick and easy), you never see security running the floor, just when there is a situation and suddenly everyone is right there. <br /> <br /> The plots move very quickly from the fraud and robbery of the casino somehow, to terribly typical American boy girl relationship ships. Seen the same killed material all over the world, they have sex, but I hate you, I always loved you, I think I do, but I love him / her instead, but what if, maybe someday blah blah. <br /> <br /> I would go '' Hotel Babylon '' to people who like Las Vegas, so much more, just because the characters get interesting and not forced into our throat for 6 months. no. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to be British? I'd rather see the same actors in 5 different shows rather than 5 years and become consistently the worst in the same one.
