The only positive thing I can think of is that at last I get a good answer if someone ever asks me what the worst movie I've ever seen is called. <br /> <br /> It would have taken so little effort to make it more vigilant ... much more effort and it could even be brilliant. <br /> <br /> Why would anyone want to produce such waste? <br /> <br /> I refuse to believe that a director can be so ridiculously unbeatable. <br /> <br /> To make a totally unbearable movie had to be the point. <br /> <br /> Anything else just doesn't make sense.
