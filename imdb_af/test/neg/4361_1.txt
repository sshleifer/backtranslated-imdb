... the first? Killjoy 1. But here's the overview of Killjoy 2: <br /> <br /> (contains spoilers, so be careful for readers) <br /> <br /> Oh me. Oh, me, me, me. I'll start telling you I didn't have the least hope this movie would be good. Since Killjoy (the first movie) is undoubtedly the worst movie ever made, the successor didn't have much promise. <br /> <br /> As expected, it didn't deliver. <br /> <br /> The deaths were even leaner than in the first movie. There was absolutely no eyebrow cake whatsoever, and each prop looked so fake that I wouldn't be surprised if they had a nursery school. <br /> <br /> Look, I don't even know where to start. Hm, for the first time, the movie wasn't even feature length. It was only an hour and eight minutes (68 minutes), but then again early, it was actually a delay. In fact, this is the only reason why this movie wasn't as bad as the first, because the first one was longer. <br /> <br /> Usually I don't give spoilers in reviews, but since I don't want any of you going through the torture to watch this waste of movie, I'm going to spoil. Not that much is spoiled. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the end. KILLJOY IS THE PUSSIEST KILLER. It requires explosions, firearms, guns, etc. To kill all the normal series murders in horror movies. Guess what it did to kill Killjoy? A F *** ING GLASS OF WATER. No lie. In the end, a girl picked up a cup of water and threw the water on Killjoy's face. Then Killjoy started screaming, and they tried to make his face melt by putting dry rubber cement on his forehead. Then he lay there, and the people went to bed. <br /> <br /> Now let's hit the play. VERY DIFFERENT. Not even one person was least credible. I don't even know what to say, otherwise it looks like they've just hired a few hobos on the street to perform in this movie. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I honestly doubt they spent more than $ 100 total to make this movie. They had nothing. Most of it happened in the woods, which would cost them nothing to film. The actors give nothing in any effort, so it's blatant that they work for free. They didn't have any special effects or nice props, and they probably used ketchup for the blood. Hell, who do you estimate? They probably didn't even spend $ 100. They probably spent $ 3.29 on a bottle of ketchup and that was it. A F ** kin movie made with a $ 3.29 budget. <br /> <br /> For Bob's sake, they couldn't even afford to rent a cop uniform. In the end, after Killjoy dies, the girl wakes up and says, "Where is he?" and the principal replied, "He is gone." Then suddenly there are a few naughty guys with scars on his face, with a cell phone saying, "You have a call." The girl answered and said, "Oh, Mom!" and smile. Then the fat naughty man walks together to reveal it's a police officer. However, he has a khaki pants, and a regular button to green shirt, with a lame badge on the front pocket. Hell, it was probably the weapon the director got when he was in 3rd grade in security patrol. Then they all climbed into a brown blower and ran away as the credits rolled. They couldn't even get a police cruiser, so they just got a blazer. F ** can be lame. Killjoy didn't even have the ice car he had in the first movie. <br /> <br /> Killjoy is without a doubt the most flamboyant gay skater ever. If there was a treasure that wore hot pink spandex and wore a rainbow flag, it wouldn't be as gay as Killjoy. Killjoy is also not funny (and believe me, he tried). <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is an extremely crippled threat given by one of the criminals. Someone comments to a boy not to pass the third degree, after which the boy responds, "I'll show your third grade!" in a threatening manner. It must be the absolute worst threat I've ever heard. "I'll show your third grade!" <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't even work on a "so bad, it's good". It's dirty. Unless you did something bad and you feel so guilty about wanting to seriously punish yourself, DO NOT watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Just remember; If a flaming homosexual clown with a big black afro kills you with gay jokes and tries to kill you simultaneously, just throw water at him. Case closed. <br /> <br /> FINAL RATING: .1 out of 10
