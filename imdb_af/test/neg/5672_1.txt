Yes, we all know Dan Schneider's strange fascination with showing young children and iCarly is no exception. Seeing young girls wrap their toes and stick their tongues out for the camera and wear smart clothes and bikinis. Yes, it makes you wonder if these performances were made for teenagers or for an older degenerate crowd. However, the performance is not as good as Dan Schneiders. Other performances like the far superior Amanda Show & Drake and Josh. <br /> <br /> The show is about a brother and sister (Carly and Spencer) who live alone. and to go alone while their father is in the army and their mother is strangely absent from their lives. Carly has a common spiritual friend called Sam and they do a very well-produced, award-winning web program called ICarly with their grandchild friend Freddie. The episodes deal with their lives in and around the webshow and their hi jinx at school. <br /> <br /> Carly Shay is a young, all-known web personality / businesswoman / producer played by Miranda Cosgrove, a young actress who relies on talking very hard and fast to get her point across and make strange faces. Her brother Spencer is a somewhat temperate, dull and eccentric artist played by Jerry Trainor. He tries to be a bit too hard to be Jim Carrey and whose comedy style seems to be aimed at the young male audience who wants it. type of Joey Gladstone humor. Then there is Sam Puckett, an unlikely, average, small, thief of a brat who needs a posture adjustment played by Jeanette McCurdy. This clearly adds hair extensions, as you can see them disappear and appear again from stage to scene. And lastly, there is Freddie Benson, the web application, nerdy cameraman and technical advisor, who has a great deal of luck on Carly, but will of course not come with her who played Nathan Kress. <br /> <br /> Other secondary characters come and go like Freddies mother, Carly's grandfather, annoying teachers and many of their annoying little school friends to finish off the roll. Most of the comedy is moderate, such as blowing up Lewbert the Doorman as a gag, throwing a water balloon at a teacher and knocking over the table of young girl scouts selling biscuits. All the adults come down as complete idiots while the kids all know, and some main characters have absolutely no morals. Light, deception, stealing and violence are all acceptable in this children's show created and written by Dan Schneider, Yes ... it's a children's program! What more can young viewers ask? Well, with Dan Schneider we can expect the young girls to dress in tight clothes and bikinis and do some strange things to stick their teeth out for the camera and eat bananas. Shows like this are just what the young crowd likes and I don't think any worse than any of the other rubbish Nick kicks at his young crowd. There are always fans for everything seen on television, at least it's a little better than most of the stuff seen on Nick is like the horrible Naked Brothers show.
