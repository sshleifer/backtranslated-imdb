I do not leave IMDb comments on movies, but this .... this movie was bad. very bad. I quickly passed through most of it, to stop where I had hoped that the play had improved since the last scene, just to continue with the fast forwards. Formula Plot - Once the provisional killers have been discounted, there was only one remaining. And it was in the first five minutes. Scene per scene felt like I had read the script before, because there were no surprises, no secret. The Tori character ... bad bad play. A real waste of time on DVD and a definite 'let's go to sleep early' option if it's the only thing on television. Looking at this movie, you will realize that you can never get the time you just wasted.
