The original title has always struck me as a little over-painted definition for a bunch of rifle-toting-saddle tramps. Still; their screen presence is at least underlined by a top-quality group of actors to support Yul Brynner. Most were movie stars in their own right. <br /> <br /> But; this first successor was a pale imitation, with a group now consisting mainly of B and C list players, who were more mediocre or wonderful. It was a similar arrangement. Brynner's 'Chris' had to recruit another team of armed saddle tramps to sort out the problems of Mexican farmers again. Another tyrant grieved them. <br /> <br /> With the originality and freshness of the first movie now being spent, this remake still has little to offer. The budget was apparently very limited. It was not only reflected in the film, but also in the sub-script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic borrowing. It was also more than half an hour shorter than John Sturges' original. Yet we still had a repetition of the pain and moralization that even made the first a little turgid. But here there was no decent acting action, action or place to balance things. Filming was less extensive. It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were much of the original. <br /> <br /> Generally; it just had an imagination. The first movie was a smash hit, and this pedestrian successor was apparently put together as quickly and cheaply as possible to sign up for the former success. And it shows. There is a lot of 'made for TV' about it. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
