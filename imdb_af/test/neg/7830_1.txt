Asia Argento has never done a movie (as far as I know, and that includes those directed by her own father, Dario) where she doesn't show all her anatomy at one stage. Sure enough, in the most boring opening dialogue scene ever, poor Madsen entered her office and reminded us that even though her hair was up, she could still stick her fingers in her cross (which she does but in a random "what? I see it really?" kind of way). The DVD box, packaging, looks like a femme-deadly movie, so you wait to see her turn into a sleek and minimalist killer. No luck. She is amazing, hungry for aging and even worse, has no credible skills in physical dexterity other than (surprise!) Taking out all the clothes when any scene allows it. Her accented English would be cool if she just didn't try to make it sound like that and tried to talk like a 12-year-old. How about this plot? Poor thoughts, but at the same time, nimfomanian woman is suddenly driven to kill while already on a different road and running a little cheap drug deal ... have he? what? does anyone have motivation in this movie to do something different than buying a hamster? The script seems to be oriented by letting everyone talk about the same things over and over (I expected to see that the worst thing about it appeared as a producer who dumped money to just have screen time) - there is Nothing goes under the obvious shortcomings of Asia's character that at any stage in the movie promises the DVD cover. She's weak ... but she knows how to kill. she hit a lot. She slammed naked, she slammed half-dressed, even slamming into a dead woman's clothes. She is very floppy and unmotivated. In fact, "Floppy" would have been a good name for this movie. And a shot of Asia was looking and angry with the cover, would have been a better representation. There are actually shots of her eating airplane food !!! What is it about? <br /> <br /> The end makes 0 sense. Everyone is just irritatingly desirable in their intention and their accomplishment of all goals. Lester's wife does not make a real vengeance (take someone to bad cartoons IS life-threatening but not really valid) .. and Lester just drives around without really making much of anything. Overall deceptive key art ... yes, we know that Asia lost the baby's fat from her first, but really, a whole movie trying to pretend it's interesting enough to run a film about a passive aggressive chick, is not worth it. See point no return.
