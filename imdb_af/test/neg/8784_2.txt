Would it surprise you that my ears and eyes are almost exposed to watching and listening to this horrible movie? My eyes were almost uncovered to watch the horrible animation and careless, inexorable, empty story. My ears almost blossomed to listen to the songs that sounded as if they were sung by a choir of baby puppies. Then my brain almost melted because of this film's complete lack of intelligence. It is formulating every step of the way. Talking animals are one thing, but a penguin that can only fly to stay with the "dreams can come out" schtick? Please show even more confidence in children's intelligence. Along Rock-A-Doodle, this is one of Bluth's worst.
