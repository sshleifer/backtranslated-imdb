Did we all see the same movie ??? I can't believe the raves, some of the others give this very awful bio that, whether or not they believe, is authorized by Shirley Temple herself, based on her book KINDSTAR. Give me the feeling that some are very easy to be satisfied. <br /> <br /> First, ASHLEY ROSE ORR, whatever its modest talents, does not form or shape in any way, even though Shirley Temple seems to be enough to be thrown. her in this kind of straight biography of the world's best-known child star. She gives no indication of why or how this child was so respectful, except that she tried the hardest to make a Shirley imitation that never clicked on any level. Nothing at all. <br /> <br /> And this is the main disability of the whole piece. But as if it's not bad enough, any drama inherent to Shirley's story of her climb to almost overnight stars, completely white crop with indifferent writing that occasionally tasted songs and dance moments that didn't even approach what Shirley did has (as, for example, "The Codfish Ball" with Buddy Ebsen, which was probably the highlight of Shirley's choreographic dance routines.) <br /> <br /> Making a girl in a polka dot dress makes her not Shirley Temple. None of Shirley's own brands of charm, warmth and appeal have even been remotely suggested. All we see is a pale imitation of the original proof, once and for all, that there was only one Shirley temple. <br /> <br /> Writing anything about this mess is worthless. None of the others is more than ordinary in lifeless roles. My advice to Shirley's fans is to read her book - or better yet - watch her movies. <br /> <br /> These are the wells.
