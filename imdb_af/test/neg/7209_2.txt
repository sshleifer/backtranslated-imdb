SPOILERS: The original Road House is one of those movies I know is clich√© and original, but it's done so well, I'm ashamed to admit that I really like it. Show many of my friends, whose movies I respect, think the same way. So when they try to make a sequel to it and it's as if it was written by some high school children who were given the right to do a succession, it's just bad; really bad. <br /> <br /> Strange, Johnathon Schaech is listed as one of the authors and I can only hope his WGA membership is revoked. The writing was only bad and all the authors of this film have to retire for a complete lack of originality and the worst dialogue in this millennium. Schaech is already the king of the straight-to-DVD successor (8mm 2, Poison Ivy 2) and now that he has seen it and 8mm 2, I think his acting ability does not exist. He was terrible, just awful. <br /> <br /> It's not the horrible fighting tones that make this movie horrible, but take it from me, it's bad. Every battle scene is a slow-release punch (which still makes the "wiff" sound in the air) which is then blocked by the opponent, who returns a punch that sends the first man to the ground. It is repeated by the film, worse than any bad 70-year-old police artist. Or the fact that many of the people involved in the fighting for some reason have a mouthful of cherry cabbage. And we must assume that Will Patton is a fighting machine; his fight scenes looked so incredibly fake I was honestly shy to watch. <br /> <br /> This is the complete decay of logic in this ridiculous movie that makes it horrible. For example, Johnathon Schaech's character is in town for a day and already tells a girl he hardly knows who he has no idea what side she is up to, "I'm with the Feds, but don't tell anyone." The female villain who fights the good girl in one battle with acrobatics taking part in a superhero is easily held in another scene by Wil Patton, old man, simply holding both her hands while making a little ridiculous line (hide me once, shame on you, stab me twice, won't happen), it's bad) and then shoot her. Jake Busey's villain shoots at the feds while he is caught in the middle of a drug deal, but no DEA agents or anyone simply goes to his place, and he simply fails because "it's the country's territory." Busey wants the bar, because it is "in a good spot" for drug trafficking, but its own home seems to be just as good, apparently offering all the benefits the bar was supposed to. Johnathon Schaech's character is the son of Patrick Swayze's character in the original, but Swayze's character's name is Dalton and Schaech's (also not the alleged brother of Swayze's character). And Johnathon Schaech looks about 50 in this movie. I watched it, he is 17 years younger than Swayze, but he looks terrible. <br /> <br /> But my favorite absolutely stupid scene in this movie was the most versatile scene ending in movies: the villain gets through a window on a second floor and as they move down, I think, "don't for tell me he was forced on something ... "and sure enough my worst fears were realized. <br /> <br /> Actually, I can go on for half an hour about the things I hate about this movie. That's enough to say, let's put an end to these ridiculous straight-to-DVD sequels to theater movies, at least those with Johnathon Schaech.
