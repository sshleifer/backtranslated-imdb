It's one of those movies where the acting, direction and effects are so bad that you have to rent a copy, get 5 or 6 friends, a beer jar, sit down and watch. To borrow from late Douglas Adams, "To watch this movie will be like breaking your brain out of a piece of lemon ... wrapped around a big gold stone." <br /> <br /> What's wrong? Everything. British actors position as Americans, there are many that can make it like Bob Hoskins, but he is not in this one. It wasn't even necessary to choose North America as a place, why not say it happened in England or something? The director looked as if they were taking shots of girls' tits and asses, rather than actually coming up with some kind of character motivation. So at this point you will say drunk friends: "ALL RIGHT! Another T&A shot!". There is not much dialogue, so feel free to go to the kitchen and make the sandwiches. What did I have about this movie? After my friends passed, I managed to pick up $ 185 from them and told them they brought it to the strip after we finished the terrible movie.
