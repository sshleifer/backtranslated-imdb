"Ninja III" is not as bad as "Enter The Ninja", the first part of this "trilogy", but it is still a very bad movie. It will hardly be the followers of martial arts movies, as there is not enough action, but even the action scenes are often neglected by ridiculous remains and unnecessary violence. As if the film wasn't enough, the filmmakers turned parts of it into an idiotic "The Exorcist" ride. The only redeeming value is the popular presence of the actress playing the "dominant" heroine; she is a beautiful and athletic woman, who does not forget to exploit the director in various slender ways - she is just an aerobics teacher. I don't care for a little soft core exploitation, but it shouldn't pretend to be something else.
