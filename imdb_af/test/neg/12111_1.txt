This thing, directed by the French sensation, Patrick Sebastien, is the worst of all the turkeys you may have seen. Forget about Independence Day, Kazaam, The Patriot, etc. ... you get the picture, these are the wells. Sebastien is a TV celebrity in France (if you need an equivalent, let's say he is Jerry Springer with an IQ of 13). It's his first movie. Let's hope this is the last. I hope that Troma or someone will distribute this movie in the United States so that the guys out there can worsen the French stench. Let's cut it short, that's the masterpiece of S ** t.
