1st watched 7/19/2003 - 1 out of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): Nice 3D movie, which follows the sites of many 80's teenage sleepers very well. Stupid kids go to a well-known murderous campsite, hunted by an unknown masked man, and then try to find out who, if anyone, is going to live. We really don't care who's behind the mask, but even it's not hard to tell if you've seen any of these movies. What a waste of a 3D viewer despite somewhat decent 3D effects.
