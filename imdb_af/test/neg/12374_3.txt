Before we start, I may say I hope you have eaten when you read it. Why? Because I first saw the movie, the bird's appearance and sound made me eat chicken after the words 'The End' appeared on the screen. So don't say you're not warned. <br /> <br /> Fred Sears may have targeted Earth vs the Flying Saucers (a good movie and one of the bigger examples for Tim Burton's "Mars Attacks"). , but "The Giant Claw" is not such a movie. Yes, it is a prehistoric monster flying in the air, airplane and city attacks and occasionally treating itself to a man on a parachute. The animal is giant, except in the screens where it is significantly smaller, but who needs consistent proportions in a movie? Frightening? It could have been, but not if the plot was hopelessly stupid and the monster looked like a puppet running away from Sesame Street.
