I like a good novelty song. No, I'll take it back. I love a good novelty song. I despise GGROBAR absolutely, and have of the first note I've ever heard. When I found out, someone grounded a cartoon on it, my head almost exploded. Now that I've seen it because my kids begged me, I wish my head had exploded. This would have saved me from the ominous misery this cr @ pfest was. First, it's a ridiculous idea to make an hour-long show based on a three-minute novelty song. Extending such a song, which had to be a deadly way to be so long in an hour, is even more ridiculous. It was poorly written, cheaply animated, poorly acted ... the list goes on and on. Dear God, it's ever bad.
