Go into teaching Mrs. Tingle, all I wanted was a fun, pleasant teenage comedy that would entertain me because it ran. Despite a fairly good first half hour, the film quickly decays into a dull, clumsy jumble that is so entertaining to draw your eyelashes with forceps. Rusty pliers. "Scream writer Kevin Williamson wrote and directed this movie, and proved that Scream could be a fly. Most of the elements of this movie have been seen millions of times in other films; and while it was good for him to steal elements of other movies in Scream, due to the fact that it was meant as a slasher tribute; here it looks as if he is completely without ideas. The plot follows the smartest girl at school, played by Katie Holmes. After being caught with two of her friends; the three decided to take the teacher who caught their hostage in her own home. However, this is not just any teacher; It's Mrs Tingle, the meanest bitch in the school. She also does not take hold of the bed because she starts to play her minds to turn her prisoners against each other. <br /> <br /> The plot looks much like the 1997 movie "Suicide Kings", and a whole host of earlier films. It's not really a bad idea for a movie, and if Williamson could have populated the movie with interesting characters; it could have worked very well. The character of Mrs Tingle is the most interesting in the movie, but she is massive one dimensional and likes all the other characters in the movie; is merely a caricature. The acting is largely diabolical, with the exception of Helen Mirren in the title role. She is quite angry in the role, and while she does not have much to get into her teeth; She clearly enjoys herself from the central figure. The teenage throw is not worth mentioning, with only Katie Holmes standing out; and it's just really because of her star profile, not her acting talents. Williamson had almost every scene turned into dull, soft rock music, which would be really annoying if the movie were not quite terrible anyway. Honestly, this movie does have a few good times; But basically, if you want to see a good example of the teenage comedy, it's not the movie you want to see.
