I saw "Caddyshack II" when I was ten and I mostly laughed because of the horse scene. I had to realize that the movie was as empty as ... I can't come up with a good comparison. It's stupid and not really funny. The cast members of the original who chose not to die here probably made the best choices they ever made to reject it. why, oh, why did Chevy Chase return? And how did Jackie Mason, Robert Stack, Dyan Cannon and Dan Aykroyd touch this pool? I bet every person who has his / her name, even remotely, to this rubbish (eg, the caterer) is ashamed of salvation. All in all, it's over, terrible, and everything so. Avoid it as if you had the Ebola virus.
