A research expert is experimenting with human DNA in an effort to create the perfect human. His work made it the point where he could take a human fetus within a few days and accelerate his growth to that of an adult. The creation is a (spoiler omitted), but side effects of the process (spoiler omitted), "according to the summary of the DVD cap. <br /> <br />" Embryo "opens by promising:" The movie what you are going to see is not all science fiction. It is based on medical technology that currently exists for fetal growth outside the womb. It may be tomorrow or today, "said Dr. Charles M. Brinkman III. Dr. Dr Joyce Brothers later appeared at a festival with Roddy McDowall. <br /> <br /> First, we see Rock Hudson (like Dr. Paul Holliston) light a cigarette and drive recklessly (see the speedometer!) During a storm; unfortunately he hits a dog, Mr Hudson takes the wounded dog home and learns it is pregnant and runs the life of one of them Puppies, due to his experimental knowledge of fetal growth, is what Hudson uses as an experimental drug to grow the embryo so that it can survive outside the womb, the dog, "Number One", grows rapidly into adult. and is portrayed as his mother. <br /> <br /> Hudson lives with his son-in-law Diane Ladd (like Martha Douglas), since his wife Nicole, also a doctor, died in another car accident.

Then Hudson decides to use his accelerated embryo growth on a human, Barbara Carrera (as Victoria Spencer). <br /> <br /> Hudson and the cast are trying their best; but the "Embryo" storyline is undeniably absurd nonsense. If you take her foolish opening and closing styles away, Mrs. Carrera's brave characterization barely; she might have been a bigger star than better movies than those offered. The infantile end indicates a successor; but fortunately the idea was broken down.
