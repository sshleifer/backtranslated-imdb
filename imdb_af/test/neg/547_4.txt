I found it to be an incredibly disappointing version of a beautiful story. I thought the acting was generally pretty good. Reginald Owen crawled the scenery, as mentioned by others, but I found him almost amusing in his short scenes. TCM made an Ann Harding fan of mine, and I thought it was good as usual here. Jessie Ralph had a field day as the old chariot, to order everyone, and Frank Morgan, as always, played Frank Morgan with a flash. <br /> <br /> To me the problem was writing and / or editing - Transfers were uncomfortable, motivations were dark. The movie was just too short to convey the story properly! I dropped completely, especially since I had such good memories of the later version.
