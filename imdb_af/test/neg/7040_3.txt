Two escaped prisoners step out of the forest and shoot two campers in the head. This is the first scene, and it has blown me and feared what was in the store. But by the end of the first half hour I was all shot up in the flood. Not because I didn't care about any of the characters, but because I was scared of how priceless the movie was and was curious to see how really low it could sink. <br /> <br /> Frank (Remar) and Red (Woolvett) are former prisoners. After killing the two innocent campers, they plowed through the bush and dragged them away in the isolated cabin of Dean Stockwell and his two sons, lawyer Keith and the alienated homosexual Behr. The escape conditions first indicate that their car has broken down and they need to use the phone, but they gradually reveal their identity. <br /> <br /> Well, it looks like familiar territory so far. "Desperate Hours," or "Funny Games" maybe. But - hang on - the gay boy is in the cahoots with the two. It seems that Stockwell, after discovering his son in flagrant delicto with another man named Billy, kicked Billy and threw him out. Billy has died and Behr now blames his father for death. And indeed, Dad is something of a Neanderthal when it comes to parafilias, the fact that he just got together with a secretary. <br /> <br /> The grief Behr just searched and searched, looking for someone else who knew Billy, someone with whom he could share his despair. It seems to be one of the escapes, and now Behr is determined to look after their freedom. <br /> <br /> It's all turned around. People talk. They talk and talk. They are constantly talking. And NOT about the two crazy killers who just can't wait to put one in their eyes. No - the dialogue goes as follows: "You were just as scared of something in yourself that you even drove your own son." It's Behr, the young gay man, who talks to Stockwell. It's as if an afternoon drama has mixed his genes with a killer player in a sort of transforming device or sundowner. <br /> <br /> The only real show is given by James Remar as the more talkative and ominous of the two escapes. And it's mainly due to its gruff, but liquid baritone, which sounds like Lance Henrickson's, and his feminine lips. He is easy on the eyes and ears. <br /> <br /> Dean Stockwell has made proper appearances, including his priceless bizarro in Blue Velvet, in which he was my supporting player, but here laziness, progress, or limp direction she has every move and every expression formed in a stereotype. It is as if he is reading stage directions - "Surprised surprised" and "screaming" and literally following them. There is no surprise in a truck. <br /> <br /> If the gay boy Jason Behr ever sunk, it should have been while I was blinking at the same time, because I missed it. He has a long neck and just one expression in his instrument. Woolvett as the secondary villain fades into the pine-knot panel woodwork. The lawyer's son is Robert Glen Keith. I hope he didn't leave his day job. <br /> <br /> The direction is pedestrian, the stage functional without being at least innovative. Sometimes it is confusing. I was lost from where everyone was supposed to be while the killers were moving around the porch of the cabin and the family locked in with a shotgun. Nor can I understand how Stockwell can hit an explosion through the cabin door, beat Remar, and knock him in a back of the stoep and then Remar can just get up, dust himself and with a cranky riposte comes like, "Okay. Two can play that game." But why continue? See it if you need to.
