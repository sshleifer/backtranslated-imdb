To keep in bed with the flu and feel too rough to get up to the distant, I actually saw this horror from start to finish (how many people can say? And to anyone who can - what is your excuse?). My God, has there ever been a total mess released by a large studio? There is not one second of true tension in a so-called "thriller"; the writing is clumsy and ridiculous; The sets look like they are remnants of a low-budget TV movie; and the cast ... WHAT WAS IT? Sally Field gives, without doubt, the worst and most embarrassing of any Oscar winner in history. Her annoying nose annoying and foolish behavior intended to be a life-threatening situation is really asinine. It's a wonder she didn't use all her future earnings to buy and destroy every turkey of this turkey. Michael Caine, now acting endlessly on the screen - even running master classes for those who want it, must be pulled out and shot (preferably by one of Telly Savalas's henchmen). Angela Cartwright, an actress I usually love (and whose name is not even in the opening credits, poor soul) is 10 years old for her and her horrible matron yellow prom joke must haunt her nightmares to this day. Slumming it is Karl Malden and Shirley Knight - hopefully they have collected a large pay package to prevent their involvement. The whole movie is a series of bad scenes, but the one that especially beats in my mind is the explosion that results in the "ceiling" (if a upside down deck can be called as such) and " a load of empty boxes falls through! Oh, how scary! Really, really, terrible.
