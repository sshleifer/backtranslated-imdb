Sorry Randy. I love your comedy, but in this case you really laid a "Golden Turkey" egg. <br /> <br /> The plot was thinner than a single layer of my skin, the scene more wood than a giant Redwood and I think the direction didn't exist. <br /> <br /> There were definitely pathetic attempts to take down other movies, Jaws and European Vacation, to name but two. <br /> <br /> If the memory is right, Eric Idle played the same kind of character in Nat Lamp European Vacation, but much better. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Chevy Chase and Beverley D'Angelo were approached to make this successor. If so, they certainly knew what they were doing when they turned away. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, nobody can improve Chevy and Beverley in their roles, as the Griswolds and Randy Quaid complemented them in the past. movies. <br /> <br /> Randy Quaid had to leave National Lampoon as he lay ahead.
