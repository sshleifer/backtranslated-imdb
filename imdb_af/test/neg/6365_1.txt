When I heard the movie was released and the theme it was about, I felt very curious. But when I saw it, it was the biggest deception of my life. Technically speaking, the sound is poor, you can tell about manuscripts repaired on the studio that are poorly reached in the final mix. Secondly, photography is mediocre, some of the films show some soldiers with night goggles and the way the cinematographer reaches that dark night is illuminated by everything, as if they were in a real military base with lights, there is no reference of the moonlight, my god! Most of the events are really poor, but the role of the wife of one of the soldiers is unbelievable. Her performance is pretty poor. <br /> <br /> Big disappointment, sorry about the jury who chose to send this movie to represent Colombia on the Oscar.
