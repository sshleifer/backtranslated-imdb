I watched movies for the past 10 years, and I have to say I never felt so bad, which I felt after watching this extra-large drill bit, it was bad, very bad. There were songs and songs. No one should see this movie. The director has shown Germans speak English that is so junk. Germans do not speak English. & in one scene there was a white girl who asked Homesh for signature. (Note that he had to give her some money) In the promo they suggested that they upload for riot. But I can say there was only one scene that Himesh laughs for no reason, he thinks is funny. Hansika is very good. she is like an angel. But too young just 16 years old. If you have enough time and don't know what to do, watch this movie or waste your money
