Take a few dark and stormy nights, misses from the shore, obsession and doubt, two brothers who have a mysterious relationship based on hate, a suspicious disappearance, a shoe in the night that snaps a glowing cigarette butt apart and finally, a proud heroine who threatened herself so much through her own doubts than with one - but which one? - of the men around her. It seems we can have a good 80 minutes noir. Instead, under the leadership of Vincente Minnelli and with two A lists, Katharine Hepburn and Robert Taylor, Undercurrent, an almost two-hour matinee melodrama, a long slogan of threatening anxiety amidst the perfectly groomed, chopped and dressed throw. If you look at your watch halfway through a movie and with a sinking heart, you see another hour to go, you and the movie probably have problems. <br /> <br /> In one of its earliest non-musical movies, Minnelli is not as heavy on the rococo hothouse as it was later known. Still, which is basically a simple story of greed, murder and obsession, is being transformed into an endless Katharine Hepburn vehicle. Hepburn shows us in meticulous lighting, how to demonstrate fear, love, anxiety, madness, happiness, doubt, suspicion and terror. Robert Taylor is more or less together for the ride. <br /> <br /> Hepburn starts the movie as tomboyish Ann Hamilton, an energetic young woman in slacks who helps her father with his inventions. Their housekeeper is determined to marry her. When dr. Hamilton decides to sell an important formula to Alan Garroway (Robert Taylor), this is the first sight love. Garroway is the smooth, attractive, dynamic inventor of the Garroway Distance Controller, which was essential in the war, and it has made him a cargo-millions million manufacturer. He is a captain of the industry, as one of his many Washington friends says. Ann Hamilton, now Ann Garroway, can still be a bit of the tomboy, but her husband shows her how to dress and how to be a successful social host for all the congress and judges who know her husband. She learns quickly and eagerly. They are both obvious and happy in love. <br /> <br /> But wait. The cancer is gnawing. Ann realizes she doesn't know anything about her husband's family. None of his employees or friends seem to be talking about them. When she learns a little bit, Alan's mother died in the old family home in Middleburg while sitting at the piano, or that he had a brother, Michael, who had disappeared, Alan became very quiet ... and sometimes in anger go. He always apologizes. But wait again. Did his mother really play the piano? Didn't she really die in bed? Wasn't Michael caught to take money from the family firm and Alan sent him away? All this looks out on the beautiful hotel suites, the married manor house in Middleburg with the horse stable and the tasteful country house next door. Everyone in the movie except employees is dressed in the nine. There are exclusive cocktail parties and intimate meals for twenty. Even in a black-and-white movie, Minnelli can't help us bring dining tables full of crystal and china, tasteful and elegant furniture and lots of gowns. <br /> <br /> By the end of the movie, when everything is finally known, Ann is hunted on a high horse, on a high, well-designed mountain trail, when she is threatened with death by boulder and her runner finally meets death by horse, this is a relief. Even Robert Mitchum, who plays Michael, can't bring much tension into the movie. What may have been in less hands is a solid little B movie, instead of the A list, it's just a crowded melodrama, too big for its legs.
