I will never understand why when a studio like Universal buys a musical, it will hit it when it comes on the screen. My first thought when Ava Gardner and Robert Walker envisaged, I would see something from MGM that was best at that time. Boy was I wrong and disappointed. <br /> <br /> One Touch Of Venus, played by Mary Martin, Kenny Baker and John Boles on Broadway, won 567 appearances in the 1943-1945 season. Gardner, Walker and Tom Conway play the roles of Martin, Baker and Boles on stage. The Kurt Weill-Ogden Nash musical with book by Nash and S.J. Perelman was a return vehicle for Mary Martin who had restored herself as the Queen of Broadway to a disappointing Hollywood business. <br /> <br /> Look at the names that went into this show. Given who was responsible for the book, I expected to see sparkling white in this production. Instead, I had a rather pedestrian screen, it was as if all the white had been drained from it. Eve Arden plays her regular girl Friday role with Tom Conway, but it's just too much for Eva. <br /> <br /> The story is about shopping cart skater Robert Walker who kisses a lot of kisses. valuable statue of Venus that comes to life in the person of Ava Gardner. Of course, when the statue is missing, Conway shouts for the law and is suspicious of Walker, the last person to be with the statue. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is Walker who deals with Gardner and what will happen to them. Of course, for reasons I don't understand, Ava was baptized by Eileen Wilson and Walker sings only a few lines. The song is worn by Dick Haymes and Olga San Juan who play Walker's friends and colleagues. Of course on Broadway the songs were done by singers Mary Martin and Kenny Baker. You'll like Haymes to play at least Walker's role. It was uncomfortable to say the least. <br /> <br /> Only three songs survived the score, Don't See Now But My Heart Shows, It's Him And The Inexorable Speech Low. Haymes's silk baritone is best shown in Speak Low, sung by Martin and Baker on Broadway as a duet. For some reason, the lyrics of one of the greatest men of the last century, Ogden Nash, were transferred by Ann Ronnell. I suspect the infamous Code was here at work. <br /> <br /> In Lee Server's biography of Ava Gardner, he mentions a brief flaming Ava with Robert Walker when she spit with her current husband, Howard Duff. When Duff and Gardner reunited, Walker took it badly and didn't speak to Gardner at the camera. I'm sure the fact that they both were not in their best job didn't help either. <br /> <br /> Hopefully some repertoire companies will do One Touch Of Venus and you'll see it as the way, Weill, Nash and Perelman wrote it.
