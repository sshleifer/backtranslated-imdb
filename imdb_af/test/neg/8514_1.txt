When a friend and I saw it in recent releases, we decided to do so despite the fact that none of us had heard it before. We're both like Costas Mandylor and it has James Coburn, so we thought it couldn't be that bad. We were wrong. It was. It was really so bad. No actor or actress could have made this movie worthwhile. It was like using Titanic, The Poseidon Adventure and a nuclear weapon film and trying to cut and paste it all together. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that there were a few chuckles. I laughed when the main cabin's son Alan (Costas Mandylor) asked if he was a "pussy navy". The other laughed this movie though nothing had to do with the writing. I would like to know how the people who make this movie thought you could have a crusader knocking upside down and staying stable. It's not typing or anything. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something to look for Costas Mandylor, James Coburn or any of the rest of this role, continue. Find something good they did.
