It is nice that these three young directors have made films with good production values ​​and decent acting. There are some good jobs here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, they suffer from a lot of modern gay theater; recycled plots, familiar devices (I've seen the "pool" setting too many times in gay male movies) and hacked scripts. The most distinctive of all is Dorothy, whose premise is that a cute young man will have difficulty in being laid in NYC due to a shortage of identifiable gay guys in his area. <br /> <br /> In terms of theater, these shorts are playing as smallish small gay after school specials. Not much imagination in their writing or performance; basically they follow a point-and-shoot, shot / reaction shot / master shot convention that becomes painfully boring after five or so minutes. There is hope for a boyfriend in the works of Todd Haynes, Sadie Benning and the late, great Marlon Riggs ... but not here. These movies are incredibly medium-wave, simple white-blooded and their values ​​are basically a gay bourgeois sensibility. What is probably why they play so well at gay movie festivals.
