"You can survive anything". Anything but a dumb horror movie. The director couldn't even decide whether he wanted a devil or just wanted an ordinary murderer. You can't have both. It's like Michael Moore eating his cake and eating it (or, in his case, 1500 cakes) by making his special charlatan brand of "docu-comedies": they are supposed to be oh so hilarious and zany and yet It is also meant to treat them as truth-based, earth-shattering, documentary programs. Some genres cannot be mixed. <br /> <br /> "Anything can happen to anyone, anytime, anywhere." (Translation: this is the horror genre, so we can do any kind of nonsense we want.) It doesn't sound as much as pointing at a paper of a Chinese fortune cookie, but more like the creed of every bad horror movie director . We get this baloney from a statement that was served to us early, such as a preparation / justification for the absurd buffoon that comes. <br /> <br /> "My phone doesn't work!" Well, of course it's not. There is a far greater chance that Sean Penn's brain will start working (after decades of catatonic apathy) than a horror movie cellphone does. The most sad and predictable horror cliché of the past decade. Why does it even say? We know that help will never come through a telephone call, so you can't just make an abomination. The last 50 horror movies I've seen use this plot device. It gets embarrassing. <br /> <br /> "You should always expect the unexpected." The final turn was quite surprising, I'll give them so much ... But there's a lot of nonsense on the way there. <br /> <br /> Watching the extended fall the heroine sits up with the speed of a drug-on lab rat - in cold, wet, and almost completely dark conditions. I just love horror movie realism ... When a bloodthirsty devil tries to be funny (hiding his victims), you know your horror viewing pleasure is in doubt. The less said about the old geezer, "cracking wise," the better ... Another stupid cliché served by a tired, lazy, uninspired director. <br /> <br /> What is the chance of being attacked by your husband and then by an eye-hate demon - on the same day? "Expect the unexpected". They might as well have crawled into an event in which she survives an aircraft crash, and then another in which she meets strangers trying to try her out ... <br /> <br /> The speed button needs a temple or a shrine built in his image.
