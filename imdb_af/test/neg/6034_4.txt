This movie is pretty bad, aggressive, not well-played, not well-targeted, low budget, low-quality, emotionally weak and closed. After looking at previous comments, I looked at them, but if you try to compare them to apocalypse, PLATOON or any other, you're really off track. This movie looks like a 60-year-old and pure film made with cast neanderthals, not to mention (or not), without paying attention to details such as changing rounds, low budget fireworks and all kinds of poorly-filmed features. However, if you see it as an early development of the movie document, you can see it. not to go back !! <br /> <br /> p.s - then the guys are pretty right.
