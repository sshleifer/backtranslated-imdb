The essence of almost every real-life crime thriller is a carefully considered, methodically-planned, superb super crime committed 9 times out of 10 by a lot of similar gray-scale morality suspects for whom life is not fair, for whom he joins the man. coming back, it is good to rejoice. First time writer James V. Simpson's script for Armourer gets half right. He made extra double assurance that we had nothing but sympathy for the recent orphan, Tygerberg veteran Ty Hackett (Stomp the Yard's Columbus Short), who took his home away from an evil bank (brother, I'm "I was there ). And he gave Ty a good family friend in Mike (Matt Dillon) who is very nice and a job at the armored car company where he works with Baines (Lawrence Fishbourne) and a weird French dude (Jean Reno) . These guys like to have fun and play pranks, but they are also serious armored cars, so that means carrying guns and being difficult. <br /> <br /> After a short while, like start thinking as I did, maybe - just maybe - it's going to be a wonderful, tongue-in-the-cheek, chorus-heather movie featuring some characteristics that move the story to its natural course, obscure the personal input of everyone involved in the hope of revealing a very, very clever plan with many potential 'sacred sh * t' moments. I mean, the music alone is a handbook heist-movie - gritty, edgy beats working overtime when we are treated to nearby characters who say things like "In fact, I do" and "Are you crazy" for 45 minutes or so the movie had some serious genre movie potential. <br /> <br /> Things started to really stink. These dudes, these idiots, have no plan. There is no "Ok, here's what we're going to do ..." scene, no blueprints, no explosives, no black order or ski masks (despite their "test run," as seen in a trailer). No, these guys are stealing $ 42 million from their own trucks (which are only measured by HOURLY radio contacts, despite being equipped with some fancy GPS technology), and they are not even sit down and discuss it. Hell, Mike just tells Ty about the plan the previous night, which is totally ridiculous. But of course, Ty has his home to think about as long as Mike promised that "no one will be hurt," he is on board. Guess what, though. Someone is hurt. Why? Because, besides driving the trucks in a deserted factory to hide the money, they have no plan. That was it. It was how far they thought things. So, of course, things are unraveling. These cats earn everything they get to be so unprepared. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this script feels like a product of a bad improv game: "Armored Car, robbed by its own guards ... Go!" perhaps the picture has taken some interesting directions, the story just falls apart, and soon nothing makes sense, or even unlikely. <br /> <br /> When filmmakers don't have a cool "hook" for their loft, their characters seem stupid and dangling. And when characters are stupid and bungling, it's hard for an audience to invest in them and their story. And when that happens, any tension drains the bottom of the movie, with a flimsy, hollow shell. <br /> <br /> Skip it. 10/03
