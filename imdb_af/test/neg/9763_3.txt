I loved the beautiful Greek landscape, but the story, which could not follow anyway, was even harder to follow in the movie. I can't imagine how anyone watching the movie can get any hold if they haven't read the book, and then, like me, they will probably wonder why Australian Allison has changed into French Anne, and many other seemingly useless changes in the story. The mysteries in the book sounded or left out in the movie. I saw it when it first came out and had the same problems with it, since I read the book several times. I recently watched it with my granddaughter (very intelligent at 20 and usually in movies I love), which was mostly surprised by how young Michael Caine and Candace Bergen were in it, but otherwise they couldn't think why one would see it , except for the scenery.
