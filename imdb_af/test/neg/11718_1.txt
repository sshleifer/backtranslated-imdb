This movie gives a cinematic example of the word worthless. It's terrible, you can plot or forget about proper acting, because it's not there. And with the dismissal of any decent story or acting or even the ability to be frighteningly frightening, there is usually only one plus for a horror movie. The appeal to those who hold soft core porn. This movie doesn't even have it. The women show a little skin, but not really more than the Xena show. Except for the star star who is not particularly attractive and has some poor, and I mean poor sex scenes. As briefly as you like good movies, you have no interest in this movie. If you like cheese, you still have no reason to rent this movie. If you like erotic and soft core porn, you really have no motive to rent this movie. And most importantly, if you value your time in the least, you can't do better than avoid this movie.
