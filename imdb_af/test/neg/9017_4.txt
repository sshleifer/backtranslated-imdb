After an astronaut dies in space, he is returned to a military base. Inside the man, alien embryos are discovered - he is the host for what can be a terrible alien invasion! This film comes from director Bernard L. Kowalski, who also called Attack of the Giant Leeches (see separate review), but can be better known for his work on Columbo. Executive producer was Roger Corman, known as the creator of much better movies than this one ... especially in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> This movie is cheesy and poorly built. What is interesting is the poor effects, not the actual movie itself. One scene shows a close-up of the alien embryos and it is an embarrassment of the cartoon depiction. Even for 1958. And when an adult alien appeared, you'd wonder why he was wearing shoes. Or if you're really conceived, you'll wonder why you've seen the strange pack in other movies. <br /> <br /> It's never the worst science fiction movie you'll ever see. And you should get almost credit - the alien host overtaking a military base idea has won both "The Thing" and "Alien" for several years. I don't know if these movies were inspired in any way (I doubt it), but it was at least before his time. In addition, the film is flops and it is just nice to drink when you drink. I didn't see the "Mystery Science Theater" version, but it's probably one movie worthy of their insults.
