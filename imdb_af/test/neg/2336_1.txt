How does David Lynch do this? Unlike the legions of thick-black-framed spectacle wearers and pretentious film critics who praise his name, I just don't see how this guy is paid to make such a three. How can Lynch, with an awkward, poor performance, unpack an awkward remaining footage of a failed TV pilot and notice critics about it and actually include it on Year's best listings? <br /> <br /> I'm surprised. If you are looking for a good movie noir, rent "Bound" rather. If you're looking for a good "puzzle" movie, try "Memento." But beware of this overheating stinker unless your idea of ​​a fun night throws 2 1/2 hours of your life and $ 3.50 of your hard-earned cash.
