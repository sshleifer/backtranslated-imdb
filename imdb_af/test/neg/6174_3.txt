Ugh. Even the ever-popular Diane Lane couldn't save this movie, and the most exciting aspect of the movie was seeing Rourke's face move. One heard so much "gossip" about his face, etc. So, like a road accident, we just had to slow down and see the wreck. The plot was thin. Here we have a very professional mob hit man who somehow connects to a wild and uncontrollable punk / rogue, and in this movie we wonder why this man stays with this idiot, let alone with the old in the first place. Then the crime that wasn't even committed tended to go to the witnesses. He would have cut them there and there. But then we wouldn't have had a movie, would we? And why did the broker even agree with the extortion? There were more holes in this flashing than in my pit. The acting was terrible, the whole movie predictable until the minute, and even the end. And so much could be done to make it a much better movie. But if you have about 90 minutes to kill and do not use brain cells in the process, then this movie is just what the doctor ordered.
