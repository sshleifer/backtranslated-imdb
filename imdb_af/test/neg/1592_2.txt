The only reason I didn't give this movie is a terrible onslaught because I feel it was such a horrible movie in every aspect that it earned at least 2/10; for not trying. <br /> <br /> The plot is the least of your worries while clapping your face with the top language and scenes such as "the song hole" in a bad attempt to shock and dislike. As the main purpose of this movie is to shock and not reach its main body, the final scene is disgusting to wipe out the memory of this shocking senseless movie and achieve its goal of being the most dirty movie ever. br /> <br /> A very low budget movie, terribly actionable and the dialogue is shockingly bad. <br /> <br /> I really give it 0/10 !!!
