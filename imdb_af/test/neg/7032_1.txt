I'm a great Shirley Temple fan. When I watched this movie, it appreciated what a talented Shirley child was. Ashley Rose Orr may have made the worst of the screen Shirley. Imagine an 11-year-old Shirley temple from the age of 5. That is in itself wrong. But does she get to "mimick" Shirley's voice? And her song is sad. The dance was good, I'll say it. As previous users said, there were few dramatic scenes, nothing to make the story interesting. Not even Amelia Earhart. I would have liked to see more of the worldwide phenomenon that Shirley Temple created. There was too much focus on Oz's wizard, when Shirley was just considering Dorothy. The film portrays it as if it were the end of the world when it did not. Shirley herself said she was glad Judy Garland had to play her. For me, the star of the show was the woman Gertrude Temple played. Otherwise, stay away! For great Shirley Temple movies, see Heidi, Poor Little Rich Girl and Little Miss Broadway.
