Mickey Rourke hunting Diane Lane in Elmore Leonard's Killshot It's not like Mickey Rourke ever really disappeared. He had a steady series of incidents before he burst into the scene. He was unforgettable in: Domino, Sin City, Man on Fire, Once upon a time in Mexico, and got Carter. But in his powerful dramatic performance in The Wrestler (2008), we see a complete representation of the character shown only in Get Carter. When we get to know him, Rourke stays a cool, but thin, muscular slim ball. <br /> <br /> It's an Elmore Leonard story and production. Leonard wrote such notable films as a western thriller 3:10 for Yuma, Cool, Jackie Brown, Get Shorty, 52 Pick-up and Joe Kidd. That means we get tough guys, some good, some not so good. <br /> <br /> This also means that we get solid, realistic sites with characters that do best for them in every situation, which weighs complications in violent conclusions. Killshot is no different. Hard, slender ball killer. Rourke unfortunately bumps married witness Lane. Think History of Violence Doesn't Meet Country for Old Men. It's not as intense, bloody or greedy as the two, but it's almost as good. If you like the two, including David Croneberg's equally wonderful East promises, you'll also love Killhot. <br /> <br /> Director John Madden did not do much movies. His last few were nice, if not successful: Prove, Captain Corelli's Mandolin and Shakespeare in Love. <br /> <br /> Diana Lane didn't have a powerful movie, as she and Richard Gere have unbelievable performances. In the past she is charming and attractive in romantic stories such as nights in Rodanthe, must love dogs, and under the Tuscan sun. Here she is right on the mark and balances her sexy appeal with reserved tension. <br /> <br /> It's a small part for Rosario Dawson. Yet Dawson does a good job with it. You'll see much more of Lane, including an underwear scene to compete Sigourney Weaver in Aliens and Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut. <br /> <br /> While in the crime drama section, you also need Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang, and Go Baby Gone, and before the devil knows your dead. The latter has great performances by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney. <br /> <br /> Killshot closed at the cash register. More is our happiness. It is definitely worth a 3-4 dollar rental if you like this genre. 06/20/2009
