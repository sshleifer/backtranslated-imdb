As a big fan of Brian Yuzna and the majority of the movies he was involved in, I believed I would enjoy the offspring. I didn't do it, though it is in some ways. However, if you expect something from the caliber of the Society or Beyond ReAnimator, you might be in shock. In a way, it's similar to society, a story of a seemingly ordinary world with a terrible supernatural belly ... but that's where it ends. <br /> <br /> I don't cover Yuzna when I say it The bug isn't really with him, because bad direction is bad, but the direction is healthy. What the film leaves is both mini-dissertation and acting. Stuart Gordon (ReAnimator, Dagon) wrote an intelligent script, but one that does not really work with Yuzna's style of direction, keeps him silent on actors who deliver long dialogue when he really wants to throw that camera and with his bad fall himself . This matter makes the movie uncomfortable enough, but there is worse. <br /> <br /> If the movie was made with big actors, the movie would probably have had its own. Unfortunately, this is far from the case. The play is wood, shockingly so even for a low budget B feature. The inexplicable successful and well-known Arnold Vosloo blurs every damn line with exact accuracy and gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen. The man succeeds in changing every line of well-considered dialogue in the type of ham line. The next time you're in the bar, you'll be drunk with friends. "Hey Bob! GOOD GOD, I GO MAD! What's ... about me! Noooo!" In fact, I can try the one myself this weekend. The last minute, the addition of genre veteran (and personal favorite), Brad Dourif, instead of enriching the film, almost looks Dourif's movie in a final ditch's attempt to keep Vosloo hammered, but Dourif looks like really quite uncomfortable (possibly waiting for the next attack of bad acting) next to Vosloo, and even an eccentric turn of his failure to revive the film. <br /> <br /> If the play was better, this movie would have been good. Very, it would have been nice, but the lack of character makes the movie a pathetic thing, and the horror element seems to be uncomfortable and tasteless instead of an organic part of the film. I have had a bit of a stomach upset for the alien torture / rape numbers, but the fact that the characters have been so lacking has made them look grumpy and unpleasant. Such a nasty taste in the mouth. <br /> <br /> So, if you really like Sci-fi and don't have a problem with bad acting, pedestrian pacing and a really crazy, boring rape, Progeny will probably be your cup of tea. But since I do, I'll probably never look again. Once was enough. On the plus side, it is the only scientific film that Yuzna ever did to make, so of course he wasn't really happy with it.
