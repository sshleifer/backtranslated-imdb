When I saw it for the first time, I thought it was broken. But the horror is a bit undermined by the fact that the sloppy teenagers are so annoying that you don't really care about what happens to them. There are some really good moments like Angela's speech on demons, and the short-sighted demon itself is effective. But it really doesn't stand for repeated viewing or careful analysis. It's all pretty tough and cheap and often straight stupid, pornography and unfunny wisecracks, which are all too often replacing terror. The music, however, is excellent, and the epilogue is definitely amusing, but this movie did not recommend it much, but comes just like another Jason-type stalk and slash prize.
