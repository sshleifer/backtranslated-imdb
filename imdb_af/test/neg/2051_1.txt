Bled begins as young female artist Sai (Sarah Ferooqui) meets a mysterious, but charming, Renfield (Jonathan Oldham), and they end up in her studio apartment where he gives her the bark of a tree used as a hallucinogenic drug when melted. Sai is quickly addicted to being included in an alternative fantasy reality that includes Vampire creatures. Sai's photographer friend Royce (Chris Ivan Cevic) is worried about her being driven out of reality as she becomes addicted to the drug, Royce can kick her the drug or ruin her life and why the mysterious Renfield has enslaved her to the things in the first place and does the extensive fantasy dream like travel have any meaning? <br /> <br /> Co-produced and directed by Christopher Hutson this anemic arty Vampire flick is almost 95 minutes of tedium and is thoroughly earned all the bad comments. The script was written by the interestingly called Sxv'leithan Essex (how the hell do you even speak it anyway?) Who is also credited as a production designer and his unusual name is actually more interesting than anything that ever happens in Bled, I would guess the makers set out to make a very serious fantasy-based horror movie with a strong moral message about the dangers of drugs, drug addiction and deadly drugs at its core. The majority of the film is devoted to the drug problem with Sai's first introduction to the drug, how big the first time was and how she became hopelessly addicted to eventually destroying her life and her friends. It has never been explained where she likes this drug, as Renfield only gives her a little during their initial meeting, but hey, who cares? The first twenty minutes of Bled is really boring and boring, and the next hour or so is not much better for a while for a last ten minutes involving a Vampiric monster and Renfield resulting in a revival. The moral elements are condescending, the fantasy elements resemble an afterthought and the abomination does not exist. There is also the dreadful dialogue, every sentence tries to be deep, has a lot of hidden depth, and just tries to make so much sense that it becomes difficult to listen. <br /> <br /> The concept of the movie is terrible and so is the performance, because there is absolutely no gore or violence to speak of and the whole thing is inside a flat that doesn't look light . The fantasy environment looks a little better, but it is sparse and under-used. There are no frills here, no atmosphere and to make matters worse, manufacturers have decided to use muted, very faded colors that I just hate and find annoying, which is wrong with a pretty colorful image? It seems to me to be a mystery with current filmmakers who think it automatically makes a movie cool or adds atmosphere that it definitely does not do, more often it makes your movie dull and dead as shown here by Bled. <br /> <br /> It probably had a low budget and was shot in Los Angeles. It has reasonable production values, but it is so boring. The play didn't impress me, I didn't care for or about someone who was never a good sign. <br /> <br /> Bled is a horrible Vampire movie that goes for psychological horror and physical of all kinds. from parallel to real life dug addiction and what it can do to little or no effect because the whole thing is so boring. There may be an audience for a movie like this, but the other comments aren't that big.
