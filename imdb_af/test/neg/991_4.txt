As their entire career was a light pre-characterism of The Beatles, it is not surprising that the Monkeys would soon follow their own frivolous Beatles "Magical Mystery Tour" fiasco, following their own careless and creative morass of a movie, "Head. " Both movies are not so much a true story with a plot (although MMT has tried to define a plot), as it is a hodge-podge of sketch and snippets, between music and songs and excerpts. <br /> <br /> "Head" has no plot except the pre-fab four who are trying to get rid of the "box" in which they are involved (ie the type of ruling of Monkees and surrounding commercialism) back in the box. Most sketches involve breaking into the "fourth wall" and crossing over to other seemingly unrelated scenes. Filled with anti-Vietnam war messages and attempts by the group to show their other talents, the movie jumps randomly - also to blame on the multiple directors. <br /> <br /> The movie, like Magical Mystery Tour, is now excused by some fans as "wonderful symbolism and misunderstood artistic statements." Phooey. Like MMT, there are too many guys who have access to too many drugs, all trying to make something art and shit. <br /> <br /> Like MMT, Head has a few clever moments and offers some relatively unknown Monkees songs that are pretty decent. It develops a little more charm than MMT and is a bit easier to go through, but it is not ironic that, like everything the Monkeys did, it was just a decrease of what the Beatles did first. even when it comes to laying an egg.
