I readily admit that I watch very bad movies. But there is very little I can think of, it's rather bad when women had tails. It is a stinker of epic relationships. What a sexy comedy should have been about a group of cavemen who a woman discovered for the first time is rather a dull, lifeless affair without a single laugh. The comedy is extremely poor. I think if you think someone in the head is funny, you might get a laugh or two. The guys in this movie make the Three Stooges like high art. And there's just not enough of a plot to keep the thing together. It seems to go on and on. <br /> <br /> Well, you may ask yourself, "If it is as bad as you say, why didn't you give it less than a 3/10?" Good question! And I have two answers. First, the movie is not without its curiosity value. I find some interest in an Italian spoof of movies like One Million Years B.C. with Raquel Welch. I'll give As Women Had Stils a point for its historic "value". The other two points are for the mere presence of Senta Berger. I know it's not much of an explanation or reasoning for a rating, but what are you going to do? That's the best I can come up with.
