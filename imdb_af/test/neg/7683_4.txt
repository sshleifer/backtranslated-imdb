Well, "built" Doris Day (like Ethel S. "Dynamite" Jackson) is wrong for Thespian Ethel Barrymore and falls in love with dancer Ray Bolger (as S. "Sam" Winthrop Putnam). Older Frenchman Claude Dauphin (like Philippe Fouquet) also digs Doris. Honest ?? What do they think? - This wildly inappropriate musical functions me. Day, singing the standard "April in Paris", and others. Certainly, there is nothing as good as her Columbia recordings of the time; And nothing touches Day's beautiful and forthcoming "Secret Love". Although the material does not serve him well, it is nice to Mr. See Bolger. Some of the musical numbers are stupid. <br /> <br /> **** April in Paris (12/24/52) David Butler ~ Doris Day, Ray Bolger, Claude Dauphin
