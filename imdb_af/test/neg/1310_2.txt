I'm not really frightened if I can honestly say that this movie is not suitable for Sunday night viewing on ITV4. <br /> <br /> The underground screens are just awful when London is probably under 30 meters of water, Robert Carlyles's character is dull. The police commissioner's outfit reminds me of something that Kate Moss raised and Nigel Planner looks VERY VERY old, in fact, I'm worried that he had a stroke during the filming. <br /> <br /> Robert Carlyle's father, who had been right for a long time, apparently dropped too much Ketamine and, while having a major role in this awkward journey, deserved to be murdered that caught as if he were Kate Winslett (Titanic) while crossing the Thames Barrier. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry Movie lovers, but avoid at all costs.
