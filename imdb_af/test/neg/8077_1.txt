It's the worst movie I've ever seen. The story line is a joke, the consequences are terrible, the movie is not in the scene of the movie, the dialogue is cheesy, and the actors do a good job of screwing the rest. People do not even work in real-life situations. My question is: Who will fund such a crap? <br /> <br /> The movie starts where some miners fall into a mine bowl after a firefighter doesn't save it. Then we arrive at a few bicycles in a forest that walks around on their bikes. One man falls and breaks his leg or something. The firefighter comes to help them. Meanwhile, someone starts with fire. More bike stunts. Bla bla bla. <br /> <br /> I wasted my time. <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie.
