As Jennifer Denuccio said on Square Pegs earlier, "Get me out of the door." I would definitely choose this movie on IMDB's worst movie list. <br /> <br /> Dennis Christopher plays T.T., a Chicago guy who goes to California, who uses his brother's jazz records. He is supposed to be a barney in the locals-only surfing community. But he acts more as if he is new to civilization (just trying to get through his sex scene without squirming). There are also the continuing adventures of the rest of the local population who have to endure the viewer. That from Duke (Seymour Cassell), the airbreaker trying to get TT to act like a normal man, the silly drunk surfers cheating on their girlfriends and the man who bets with another he is in car can live. six months. <br /> <br /> California dream is just a big old mess. It starts out like a typical seventy skirt, complete with bad 70's music (though this movie came out one year from the 80's). And Dennis Christopher comes down as the most annoyed loser, making the movie difficult to watch (keep your finger on the fast forward button). Even if this movie should be about the surfer culture, the surf-tone is almost total waste. The people at the surf game seem like they can't fall asleep. <br /> <br /> I think the only cool thing is to see Tanya Roberts out of her role as Midge on the sitcom. "And Cassell wasn't bad, he was just in a bad movie.
