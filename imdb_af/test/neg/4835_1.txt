What I do most about the critics who follow this movie is the mention of 'originality'. This movie does not contain ONE innovative element. If you refer to 'originality' to pathetic action scenes, persecution, gluttony in violence, blunt humor and a scripture beyond intellectual belief. Then 'originality' is something the Swedish film can do. <br /> <br /> How Röse and Karlsson can agree to act in this poor apology for a movie is a mystery to me. And how Eva Röse, after making this movie, can be seen at breakfast TV that promotes it, doesn't bother me. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't contain a story, the writing is illogical, stiff and last but not least, but just bad. These two young directors have created a very unpleasant boy-fantasy that contains violence, comics and trivialized psychological portraits. I will not be surprised if the play of DD masturbates in the kitchen over a microwave dinner actually set to describe the everyday life of these two overgrown movie nights as directors. <br /> <br /> I won't show this movie to my worst enemy.
