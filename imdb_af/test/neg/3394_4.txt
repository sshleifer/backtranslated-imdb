A female friend invited me to see it in the theaters. <br /> <br /> After half an hour we went out and went into the next multiplex (yes, we broke the rules) in time to catch the start of Again. All chance. <br /> <br /> I remember too many monkeys dancing and saying "eye, eye." Very little about the characters or introduction to the story caught one of us or even memorable. It just went to the point of being painfully boring (and believe me, any excuse was good enough to spend time with this particular friend.) <br /> <br /> The production values ​​were excellent, good photography and lighting but it was a great studio release, and we got a movie, not an art gallery. Ralph Richardson and Andie McDowell seem to be wasted in such a poorly written film. <br /> <br /> Maybe if you come in the second hour, there's something worthwhile. I don't have so much patience with my time. 4 out of 10.
