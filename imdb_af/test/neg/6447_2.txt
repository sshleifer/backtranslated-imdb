I rated this one better than terribly because I liked to see Buffy Jonath again - even if it was the same role. <br /> <br /> First, the concept is cute for a short but not a whole movie. The writing was forced and confronted. I have the feeling that the movie suffered most during editing. <br /> <br /> Second, Amanda Bynes always looks like her eyes crossed - even when she doesn't try to do it. She's just not funny. She always plays a kind of misfit girl who triumphs by being herself - ironically, since Amanda is always a caricature. I'd like to see her in something serious. I really want to give her a chance, but she's always thrown into these thin rolls where she makes faces and faces and that's a good thing. <br /> <br /> Finally, the whole "I'm a Dork" segment was ripped off from the Nerd Revenge. There was nothing in this movie that was unpredictable. <br /> <br /> Shame, shame, shame.
