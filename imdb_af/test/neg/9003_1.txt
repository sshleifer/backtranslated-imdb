Take it from me as a camera man who worked for Republic Studios from 1946 to 1950, and then Warners Bros and Paramount from 1950 to 1993, it's a piece of shit. Certainly, it would be great to show it to your favorite friends at a home party, but trying to sell it on a DVD is absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I saw bad acting in my day, but it's NO play. . The hero is almost laughing and he really thinks he's offering something of his comment on the special. I hate to see his fan club. The old movies didn't play in many of the scenes. What the hell was that garden tone with three of the worst actresses. I never saw a garden on a ship. They couldn't even emote. I wouldn't mind if they could ever have an action, but the only one was the translvanic accent man. I'm sorry, but it's not a clever movie as some people say. I would think horror movie buffs would be insulted by this piece of film.
