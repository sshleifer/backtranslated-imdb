I think it wasn't quite the filmmaker's fault. The film has suffered from the unimaginable stupid decision to tell Clayton Moore (who did the role in the 1950s and was the Lone Ranger that our old people grew up with). He couldn't wear the mask in public. Remember, the poor parent didn't make that much money to do it, and it wasn't as if he'd take anything from this movie, but the whole thing seemed ... gratuitous. <br /> <The other thing that the movie suffered (except a leading man whose voice was so horrible, had to over-double it) was the fact that Western was not so hip in 1981. John Wayne was dead and we were only subjected to a decade-long great liberal debtor over how the West was built on the genocide of Native Americans. (That and Blazing Saddles sent the whole genre! The campfire scene. Enough said!) Hollywood was chasing away from the Westerners, because Science Fiction was then COOL. <br /> <br /> The one scene it underlined was when they rescued the drunken president Grant (and seriously, I would leave Grant with the bad guys. The country would have been better!) Grant asks for Tonto what his reward should be: "Honor your treaties with my people." Yes, right, as it is going to happen!
