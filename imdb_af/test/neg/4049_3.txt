Despite his high ambitions, Zurlini's film should be considered a failure. It's one thing to create a world that affects the viewer to feel the tedium and the anxiety the main character experiences (which I think is what Zurlini tried). It's another thing to make a movie that itself is annoying and meaningless episodic. Despite beautiful cinematography in a haunting place - and a wonderful score - the movie never enters the audience. Too much is unintentionally funny (the dirty sound of drip water in Drago's quarter, or the silent movie made by some of the actors) or simply confusing (why does Drago just want the fort for the first time?) For the film as a coherent to succeed.
