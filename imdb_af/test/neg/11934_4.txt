I will be betting for a month's salary "The Magnificent Seven Returns" (MSR) for TV. Other reviewers testify that MSR was a theatrical movie, and I will use their word for it. The logical answer must be that it was originally shot for TV, and after a change of studio heart, it has taken place in the theater. Each actor is mainly a TV actor: Mariette Hartley, Michael Callen, Ralfe Waite, Stephanie Powers ... TV artists. Lee Van Cleef divides his time between TV and theater screens. Stephanie Powers has made only 3 or 4 "real" movie shows in the last thirty years of a very productive TV career. It has been proven that it has been shot for television. Smaller players are veteran kindergarten actors who can be seen in the old reruns of Gunsmoke, Wild Wild West, Streets of San Francisco, and so on. <br /> <br /> The Ho-hum sets are identical to the Universal Studios Tour sets, which are often seen in old episodic TVs. And the editing betrays the one or two-speed of TV, with limited camera movements, positioning, cutting and lighting. The soundtrack, excluding the original Berstein themes, is straight from the seventies. Yeah, I want to put money in that it was shot for TV. <br /> <br /> This is an important point in MSR evaluation. Initially I watched MSR on cable, as it was an old theater release. Compared to the original "Magnificent Seven", it's a joke, a cartoon, an amateur attempt to make film. Treatment, lighting, writing, settings, action, cinematography, music (released the Berstein themes), editing, pacing, ... on and on .... all light in comparison to the classic "Magnificent Seven" close to the perfect 60's western, and one of the great action movies of all time. <br /> <br /> But, if I suspect, the movie was made as an early 70's for TV movie, actually better than average. Those who are unhappy enough to live as an adult through the 70's know what I'm talking about. MSR competed against "Alias ​​Smith and Jones" and similar dull network shows. During the 1970s, "Gunsmoke" was a quality show that focused on character development rather than action, and the weaponry was made up twice a week. The first shootings, usually a murder, set the hour's plot in motion - the second shooting climbs the episode by killing the guest star, his nemesis or otherwise resolving the conflict with Marshal Matt Dillon. MSR has more action than a whole season of "Gunsmoke." In this light - in this frame of reference - MSR is entertaining entertainment, a cut above the TV rate of that decade.
