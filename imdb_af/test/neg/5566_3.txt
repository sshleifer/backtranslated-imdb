The actresses are cute and the sets, while simple, are pretty good. In addition, there is nothing to save from this movie. Incredible bad behavior, dull tears dialogues, anticipated plot, lots of goofs and contradictions (for example, a pretty young girl gets hits in the head through a morning star and not only does she survive but scarcely with a scratch!) ... To make it short because it's no longer worth it, even the genre fans can avoid it.
