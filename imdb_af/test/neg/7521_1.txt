I was one of the very foolish ones to pay for it at the theater, even though I paid $ 4 for matinee (before 18:00). <br /> <br /> The remake's story was high-hum, the CGI Morlocks were lame, the Eloi was rastafarian to mime today (no, I didn't think the chick was hot). The revival of the hero's modern friend was somewhat cruel, totally just a sad, bad remake. <br /> <br /> I'll hold Rod Taylor, Weena, and the fat-glowing Ey Surfer Morlocks in any time. My estimation is that many of the judges who hold this terrible remake are young children, who do not make up for a good taste or a true value from the old classics, which are largely unaffected by today's confused and eternal more youth. <br /> <br /> When the 60s version came out (I only saw it in the 70's for summer fun), it was pretty damn impressive and still holds up. You don't have to have an abundance of CGI in a movie because it's better. Too much of this looks false. I can't say enough about how disappointingly the Morlocks looked and they ran and jumped like they were in a child's video game. 3 stars out of 10.
