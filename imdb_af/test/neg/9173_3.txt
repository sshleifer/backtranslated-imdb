What can I say ... not much to this one. Pretty dull and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> The actors' performances are just OK. The only one shining in any way is Simmons, but he has only 3 screens. I understand that he retains his screen-time to a minimum, retaining the mysterious psychic aura he has, but I can't help but feel his talent is wasted. No one else has risen above average. <br /> <br /> The story itself seems to be interesting in the beginning, but it just doesn't go away. There was not a single scene in the movie that impressed me or made me feel like I was seeing something special. The cinematography was pretty vague ... I mean desert in a sort of sepia ... not very inspiring. <br /> <br /> The story of his childhood back from prison has only been partially thought out and not "I don't add anything to the story, other than getting an average" Twilight Zone "script in full length feature. <br /> <br /> Killing.
