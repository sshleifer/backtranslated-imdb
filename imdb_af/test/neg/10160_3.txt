I saw this movie when I was a boy (before World War II) and was surprised that the local library had a copy. Say it again after sixty years and forget how bad it was. This is an example of a movie that was not an "A" movie. No editing, poor writing, bad acting and not much directing. Don't be as tall as a "B". I had a nice laugh about how I got past years. I think it was good when I originally saw it.
