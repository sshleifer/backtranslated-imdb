I would be one of the few people who own a copy of this classic owner. But I don't just have one, I actually own 2. It's good. Well, if I say well, I mean bad. But I'll try to do a thorough review. I even saw a ninja born, who mentioned one of the other judges here to compare it. And ninja born is actually worse, but not quite so funny. <br /> <br /> And it's ever funny. Everything about this movie is poor. EVERYTHING. The plot is absolutely filled (note the "you'll have to keep me alive if you want to know where to find your wife"). Each action series is also filled. Our hero danton is more than a hero; he can stab people with twigs, break 3 dots in the heart at 50 cm without even blooming, and tie a rope to a tree that, as an enemy, bumps it, joins a knot to the enemy leg, picks it up, and throw him 50 meters in a lot of nails. <br /> <br /> The acting is so bad, it is impossible to comment on it, but it must make you roll, especially dantons jumping out of the ground and growing at the bad guy. Oh yeah, and the bad guys: somehow they seem to raise themselves 5 times each in the movie. Maybe it's just that there were not enough actors, but in a movie of this caliber? I doubt it. <br /> <br /> The 'plot' is about how danton was a soldier in the Vietnam War, and now his colonel is looking for real people for training for his mercenaries. The colonel just happens to pick up danton, then danton fights back. It's just the excuse for a rambo clone, with most of the movie being danton soldiers. And I can't explain the plot anymore, because there is nothing else about the movie. It still slaps. <br /> <br /> What else can be wrong, you ask? Don't start me. Hand grenades that actually go to the actors' feet, because the explosion is the size of a match. Zones chasing 5 people then cut the camera back and forth and there is 7. The way every time Danton launches the grenade launcher is against the same background, though in quite different places. And the worst part is when danton pushes the plastic stones on the enemies and one enemy is totally untouched by the rocks. So he doesn't know what to do, he dies half-dead without being touched. It's ridiculous !!! <br /> <br /> But funny. Very, very funny. It's one of the few movies I highly recommend to everyone, so if you don't find it funny, you're 1 in a million. And for the rest of us it's magic.
