All I could think of while watching this movie was, "Will it ever end?" It was unbearably boring to watch. I just wish I could just shut it down, but I wanted to do this review right. I ran the good fight and maintained the torture to completely watch this movie so you, the good reader, shouldn't carry that pain. . <br /> <br /> This movie sounds like it's a good condition if you read the prescription on paper. However, the real film does not deliver on this premise. <br /> <br /> The opening scene features mining in the early 1900s, forcing children to carry dynamite in the tunnels that aren't big enough. for the adults to fit in. It looks like the point of departure for an interesting movie is. But after 4 minutes it becomes clear that this is not the case. The adults who committed these crimes are never punished; There are no effects in the movie for their actions. The opening scene is much better than, and completely irrelevant, the rest of the movie. The last time, an opening scene made a movie so wrong, so seriously the opening day of 28 days later was the only good scene in the whole movie. Wicked Little Things / Zombies (a movie so crappy that they changed the title to try and disguise it and sell it again) is exactly the same in this regard. The opening scene is the only viewable scene in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Instead, the movie flashes forward to this day. A single mother and her two bratty, groomed kids. Here's when it would have been wise to press the STOP button and never go near the movie again. <br /> <br /> In the first hour, the zombie children are barely seen. They might get 3 minutes of screen time, total. All they do is kill a pig, that's it. The rest of the hour is spent presenting the stupid mother and her stupid kids at the local store, wandering the bush, and having conversations with each other. The stupid teenage girl goes and hangs with some other idiot teenagers and smokes with them. <br /> <br /> There will be no need to care if the zombie kids have sent someone in this movie. Every single character is both stupid and annoying, without any qualitative traits. Not to mention one-dimensional and clich√©d. <br /> <br /> This movie would have been * greatly improved * if the mother and her stupid kids were sent by the zombie kids in the first 10 minutes, arriving at their new home, then the end credits rolled. It will really change the 1/10 to 10/10 score. Honest! When the stupid mother took her eyes off the road and almost fell into a pedestrian on the road, her daughter shot her: "You almost killed me, ma!" Of course, anyone with common sense knows that if the mother hit the pedestrian, it would be the pedestrian who would be dead --- not the people who were safely hacked into the car. I think this line was put in the movie to show firsthand that the total stupidity of the main characters has no boundaries and runs in the family. <br /> <br /> Wicked Little Things / Zombies run for 1 hour and 34 minutes, but it definitely feels like 5 hours or more to me. Trying not to fall asleep was a huge challenge. It has not succeeded until more than an hour in the hour and 34 minutes that the zombie children actually kill someone's death. Then the scene shows the stupid teenagers drinking beer and coming out in a car and lines like: "If you ever want to get back in my pants, you better start the car and get out of my ass here." Seriously, it's the word of the movie. The teenagers are so cleaved, one-dimensional, poorly acted, stupid and annoying that when the zombie children finally get around to hack 3 of them 1 hour and 5 minutes in the movie, it feels like a reason for celebration. Of course, the "Princess" dumb, weed-smoky, foul-mouthed beer drink-loss daughter of the main character becomes scrap-free. What a buzzkill it was! She was longer on the screen than the other, and therefore the most annoying of the 4, and most of the earnings of a brow at the head. All the more reason why she had to be sent within the first 10 minutes, as before. However, keeping her for about 1 hour and 5 minutes is completely inexcusable. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is because feature-length movies need to be filled for at least 1 hour and 30 minutes. So by keeping her long-lived alive when she needs to be, they have an extra 27 minutes to make the movie with her and her mother walks through the woods. At 1 o'clock and 22 minutes, it is the * second * time in the movie where the annoying girl is trapped in a vehicle where the engine will not start while the zombie children find her. <br /> <br /> The zombie kids are completely generic. Never say anything. No character development whatsoever for any of them. <br /> <br /> In the end, all 3 are the annoying, idiotic main characters. What I think is the way the filmmakers are giving a final birth of the bird gesture to the viewers. In my opinion, the filmmakers know that they all have bamboozoles who had the big accident watching the whole movie. Why not rub their faces because they don't even give them the satisfaction of seeing any of the 3 main characters that should be sent within the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Avoid Wicked Little Things / Zombies like the Bubonic Pes.
