This comment is mainly intended as a warning to people who can be attracted to the title by his (temporary) high user rating that I honestly find mysterious. The reasons why I didn't like this title follow: <br /> <br /> 1. The director had some doubts as to whether he was a Jackie-Chan type of movie or a dark Oedipian tragedy had to make. As a result, in terms of genre, the film falls between two feces, as the tragic and comical elements collide and eliminate one another rather than make a harmonious whole. <br /> <br /> 2. The characters' motives and behavior are incoherent and unconvincing. Psychological truth and logic unfortunately disappear. <br /> <br /> 3. Absurdly decisive. I do not violate the actors, because it is a difficult thing to create a convincing character by responding alone, if there is hardly any logic in the writing. But why is there an apparent age difference of about 15 years between the leading two actors, whose ages in the movie cannot differ by more than 3-4? <br /> <br /> 4. For me, the movie was poorly entertained, mainly due to point 2. If you can't get a character, you can follow it with interest. When you finally learn the reason for what has become the main character, it doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> 5. Some movies, besides entertainment, are also tempting. After watching this movie, I began to wonder if the idea that the director was trying to provoke was not that intrusive relationships could be wholly healthy and delightful. I can't put any other construction in the end. <br /> <br /> 6. The movie is full of completely unnecessary violence. Violence in a movie (and elsewhere) is a good thing if it serves an important and dignified purpose. Purposes may be different and I do not want to enter this broad subject. Let me just say that I do not object to violence in films such as Private Ryan Save, The Passion of the Christ or The Pulp Fiction. In "Oldboy" the scenes of torture and suffering are extended and graphically (or obediently). For what? I do not know. Personally, I do not derive any satisfaction from seeing how teeth are with a hammer or hearing a man cutting his tongue with a pair of scissors and then putting him on his own blood. Etc. Fresh Toor. <br /> <br /> 7. The movie reminds me a bit of Japanese porn mangas in its fixation on blood scanning and young Asian girls' panties, urination and the like. It seems that there is a minority who actually enjoys these kinds of things. If you are one of them, you can find this movie enjoyable. <br /> <br /> In short, I do not recommend this movie as entertainment or "food for thought". Where it's not stupid, it's disgusting. Don't waste your time.
