I don't know why IMDb calls all the Ghoulies movies as theater phenomena. They were all straight to video films. Same with the Puppet Master series. Why didn't anyone notice it? Right, somehow you stumbled across Ghoulies IV, probably from 1993 an old abandoned video rental store. You looked at the discount section and found ... Look at the back and front page. What do you expect, The Shawshank Redemption? It is not necessary to review this film so critically. This is the fourth GHOULIES movie! I bought it on DVD for 6.50 because ... it was ?? 6:50. I knew it wasn't Kubrick material. And I was right. An unremastered DVD with no extras, not even a trailer, boasts an uncared-for movie. <br /> <br /> It actually contains the star of the first Ghoulies movie, Peter Liapis ... who really didn't get much. 'big' roles apart from the two movies. And I don't see why. He is not a bad actor and is very nice. But I think if you play a leading role in the Ghoulies movies, Scorsese and Tarantino will lose interest. Also present is his idiot sidekick Bobby Di Cocco, who, despite a very small agreement with Al Pacino (very small), does not retain any of his acting abilities. A full idiot that is just uncomfortable to watch. Then there's Stacie Randall - of course a pornstar, I don't have to look at it. She looks very sexy, even though her costume, her character and everything she does, drag off the film credibility. It's not an easy task for such a movie. <br /> <br /> Then there are the Ghoulies themselves! Who can drop us. Ghoulies III started talking to them, mistakes no. 1, but Ghoulies IV takes it a step further. Instead of dolls, this time the Ghoulies are actually KIDS in COST !! The filmmakers have decided to run that extra mile to insult the movie viewers. There are also only TWO of them, and they are not the main highlight of the movie, as it does not occur in many of them. But at times they are MILDIE amusing ... And they're not evil this time either. <br /> <br /> It's really hilariously bath stuff, it's amazing that I could actually enjoy it. I do not know why. Some of the black humor is actually funny, although the writing is usually effortless. Imagine Satan's only threat to you that he will "kill you, slowly ... painfully ...". <br /> <br /> But at least the full moon has not been involved this time. Did they? Yes, a very bad and cheaply produced movie with 0 production value, but not so bad to be in the ranks of Puppet Master 1/2, Lawnmower Man 2, Surviving Christmas or even Ghoulies III.
