-SILILERS ------------ I am a fan of the French cinema of the 60's-70's, but not necessarily of the more modern. So frankly I saw it because of Bellucci. She is very young here, very beautiful and, moreover, this movie is where they met Cassel, so it gives it a little extra importance. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a very nice style that reminds DePalma. Then we suddenly get thrown flashback, and the back and forth goes on getting tired. I don't mind one flash back but do it and get it over with man !!! Anyway, the movie is still interesting to me to a point when the first and definite hole in the plot, which allows the rest of the story, never leaves me the rest. I can allow here and there for small holes, but not to base a whole plot on the hot air. This is the story of a man. who is literally looking for an old flame. This is the main plot. I go along, when the story at some point convinces me that there are really mysterious things going on, but in the Bellucci Cassel is a couple, and Bellucci must be in Italy immediately (not the furthest place on earth) Paris), and she leaves him a message, which for reasons later explained he is not getting it.OK, so what? Don't these people have phones? She was supposedly gone for 2 months (not a century exactly) and wouldn't she call her boyfriend in Paris to see how he was doing it? Of course not. Instead, even after she returns, she forgets everything about him. And it's good, but later in the movie she tells her friend that it was her greatest love and was ready to commit for the first time in her life. she did not ask him for 2 months and never tried to come back. And what about Cassel's character? He was probably unable to find her in Italy, very hard to find anyone in Italy, it's probably like Siberia, especially an actress who is probably even listed in the art forms. And after 2 months when she comes back, it's hard to find her and ask for an explanation. One thinks she wanted to avoid him, but no, we find that they simply couldn't meet. So hard to meet in Paris. OK, I don't have to go any further, because it's the incident where the whole movie is based. What's worse, Bellucci isn't really the star of this movie, but this other girl is Bohringer.
