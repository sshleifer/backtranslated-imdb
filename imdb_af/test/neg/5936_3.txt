Based on the David Ignatius 2007 menu, Body of Lies tells the story of a CIA-operating Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) sent to Jordan to find an Al Qaeda mastermind, for a long time a narrow rope of loyalty to his Jordanian hosts and his manipulative American boss Ed Hoffman (Crowe). <br /> <br /> Anyone who has seen the trailers can be forgiven for thinking the story revolves around double-agent action and the betrayal of Ferris by Hoffman, but the real story is much more commonplace. Instead, we serve a light broth of ridiculous subterfuge as a white beautiful boy. American Ferris moves with virtual impunity through the soothing streets of Amman Jordan with a worried look over his shoulder or the attention of the locals. Only in a scene where Ferris takes his new found Iranian sweetheart for tea, reality is overtaken when the couple are bombed with Jordanian men's glares. <br /> <br /> The compilation of the movie's problems is plot twists and turns that look designed as nothing more than stuffing. Ferris flying to Jordan, Ferris being driven out of Jordan, Ferris flying to Washington, Ferris flying to Britain, Ferris flying back to Jordan, Hoffman flying to Jordan, Hoffman returning home to take care of his children? Going on it. These are the things you'd expect to see in an episode of The Amazing Race, not a spy thriller. <br /> <br /> In the corporal punishment of his craft, Crowe has an impressive 63 pound flab for the role of Portly Ed Hoffman, joining the small, selective club of actors made up of Robert De Niro and Christian Bale as theses who subjected themselves to massive weight gain or loss for their roles. It's too bad that everyone involved didn't share Crowe's level of commitment to quality, because if they did, we had a much better film on our hands than this sub-parma.
