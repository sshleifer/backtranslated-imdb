The film disappointed me for several reasons: first, the idea of ​​a future that was first realistic to me was well-built, but played only a marginal role. Then the story itself was a poor copy of Lost Translation. The Middle Eastern environment, the man with the family, meets a new girl abroad, karaoke bar, camera movements and images - all of which was a very bad imitation of the excellent Lost in Translation which also has credibility had. This movie tries to be something brilliant and cultural: it is not. I wonder why Tim Robbins is even considering doing this movie! The female chief actress is terrible - did she play the incident in the minority report? And why should you show the vagina in a movie like this? Lost translation does not have to show excessive love scenes. R-Rated just for this? This movie is not even worth watching from a video store!
