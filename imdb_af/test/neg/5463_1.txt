First, the title has no meaning whatsoever to the movie. It started off with good development, but became annoying when he couldn't tell his girlfriend what had happened to him. Even his attempt to tell the police failed, which only added to the annoyance. There were too many pregnant pauses in the movie that looked more than filler. The plot never revealed who did this crime to him, although a good plot allowed the disclosure. The end was nothing but "we ran out of budget, let's stop it now!". If I wrote a novel that ended in this way, I wanted to bow myself. TRASH TRASH TRASH !!
