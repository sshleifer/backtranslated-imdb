OK, this movie was the worst show I've seen for years. The actors weren't bad (I thought it was a b-movie, so they had a movie). Anyway, I watched this movie, think, OH COOL a UFO Sci-Fi movie. WRONG. It was just an excuse for radical Christians to put a message on people. The last scene was extremely messed up. It is a terrible thing to do to someone to believe in something. What someone believes is a matter of opinion. This movie shows just how corrupt religion is, especially Christianity. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a b-movie, it's not. If you want to see a movie trying to brainwash the masses. Well, that's the choice of junk. go right there. If you are going to convey a message, do it, don't force it. Ridiculous that people would abuse the media to such an extent. Especially Christians.
