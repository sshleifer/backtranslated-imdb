There were two things I hated about WASTE: Directing and writing. I know I'm opening myself to mock, but Stephen T Kay's direction is too much like a .... like a ...., like an MTV pop video. It is shot (I think) on digital video at an intrusive soundtrack, often out of focus and often with quick cross magnification. If you are not a teenager, you will find many segments of WASTE incompatible because of the stylistic approach. Worse than directing it was the script that drove my chain. The story is told by Samantha, a poor little rich girl who spends much of the movie through a voice over talk. (Strange how the voice seems to be unique enough to come from the same character). We tell of the pressures of her exams, the pressure of home life, her social loneliness and that is all that led her to take drugs. It's for similar reasons like parents who break her two male friends (I thought she should be alone) to start using drugs. Oh poor little Sammi in her beautiful home and her problems how my heart bleeds for you and your chums - NOT. What is not wasted is that it is no matter what someone is addicted to, whether it is drinking, drugs, nicotine or chocolate that that person has to work to become addicted, they are not a victim of external forces, they Do an act of free will. Both TRAFFIC and TRAINSPOTTING have made this point very good, people become addicts because they want to. To portray them as victims in any way is wrongly patronizing and possibly dangerous. <br /> <br /> By the way, if MTV is anti-drugs, will they stop playing videos of stars who freely admit drugs are being used?
