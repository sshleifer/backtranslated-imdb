The other day I showed my boyfriend a movie, Stand By Me, a movie I showed to many people and they absolutely adored it, but for some reason he didn't like it. He gave me a movie called Backdraft and he tells me he showed it to many people and they loved it, but I hated this movie. I don't think I hated a movie so much for a while, how this movie is even a 6.6 score is beyond me. I couldn't keep up the five million stories here: Billy Baldwin becomes a fireman, the random sister figure, the random love story (s), those who are an arson story, the investigator, the fire that is a personality of its own. I just have a problem that this movie can't keep up with all these stories, they haven't made good enough to make the movie interesting. I would have liked this movie to be about a firefighter or the investigator and how he came to be one or what he did and why. <br /> <br /> The movie tells the story of a group of Chicago firefighters, two brothers. Stephen "Bull" McCaffrey, the older brother, is obsessed with beating the fires he is fighting. Brian, the younger brother, concluded several years before the charcoal academic school and then started a number of other unsuccessful careers before becoming a firefighter again. He is watched by his older brother who expects him to fail in his newly chosen career as a firefighter. Donald "Shadow" Rimgale is a fuel investigator dedicated to his profession. He is called in because a number of fires have somewhat similar connections. . Martin Swayzak is an elder on the city council. He has obvious hope of being elected mayor, but has made a number of budget cuts to the fire brigade. Many of the rankings believe that the cuts he made are endangering the lives of firefighters. However, Swayzak was initially successful in portraying the fireworks as puffed and ineffective after firefighters were repeatedly killed in fires. <br /> <br /> I just couldn't get into this movie, I don't know how anyone else is. It can be incredibly unrealistic and firefighters have depicted everything wrong. I loved how they had every action clich√© in the book to fit this action movie. I just felt like there was great talent wasted on such mediocre roles, Donald Sutherland, good actor, but such a strange role that could be taken by a lesser-known man who was the upcoming talent at the time. I know Ron is going for good quality, but I think he plays such big actors in small roles, was a mistake for this movie. I even had to pave the way while watching this movie commenting on how the doctor was probably Kevin Spacey in the background. The fire was so unrealistic and the movie was just out there, I didn't enjoy it and would not honestly recommend it to people. I like these recommendations in my relationship. <br /> 2/10
