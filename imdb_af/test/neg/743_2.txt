What a terrible adjustment. The worst part was the music. Saxophone muzak and synthesizers play in a story dating from the early 1800s ?????? The only character who didn't carry me to sleep was Robert Hardy. I had to fight to keep my eyes open on this one, and I usually like Jane Austen movies. I didn't even rent it, I borrowed it from the library. They had to pay me to accept it. I do not quite understand how Catherine and Henry had a passionate kiss at the end, because they had no chemistry or indication in the film that they cared for each other. Isabella and her brother were very exaggerated; It was a secret to me that she and her brother were the "bad guys" and part of the excitement of Jane Austen movies is the discovery that whoever you think is good is not. It's probably on my list of the ten worst movies I've seen.
