This film portrays the story of John Belushi, based on his biography 'Wired', written by Bob Woodward. All the movies are told on a flashback without a chronological order. After the death of John Belushi we see one angel next to Belushi accompanied by a few points Michael Chicklis in the character of John Belushi is sufficiently credible, but completely without the devastating power of Belushi, and his play remains just a light animation. The director no longer succeeds in proceeding with the story, that whoever does not know the book is very confused. But the worse is that they have Bob Woodward who spoke to Belushi before he died. For these negative points, the movie is just an attempt to tell John Belushi's controversial story. My rate is 4.
