When this series broadcast, I watched most of it. I think it was supposed to be a long-running series in the year of "The Fugitive" and "The Incredible Hulk" where the protagonist in the country was chased around and looking for a solution to his problems. In this case, the hero's problem is its progressive aging in reverse order. I liked what I saw about these shows. The acting was good, especially the sad relationship between the main character and his wife. Problem is: They canceled it before it had a chance to end. (either it or I missed the last episodes). <br /> <br /> They never had the opportunity to turn the story, because they knew it was canceled. Poof it was just gone. As I said before, I could have missed the last episodes. But my opposite is that: I hired the tape. Where I left the series. The main characters' wife dies in a fire started by a chase involving the well-known organization of the King, the store. As it gets away, the hero is kidnapped. It ends with his friends who realize they have to save him from the store. The end. Last episode. On the video: His wife does not die, but escapes the fire with him. Just as he approaches the store, he and his wife share a strange moment and then out of life. Suddenly, stupid and cheap to the limit. They just wanted to send out this video and decided to put an end to it, not mind how bad it was. They can also only show off the stock of the first atomic bomb explosions. Nearly Pythonesque. <br /> <br /> The show had a cool opening title set set to the David Bowie song of the same name.
