This movie is so unreal. French movies like this are just wasting time. Why watch this movie? Even, I didn't know why. What? The well-known sex scene of half-brothers? Although the sex scene is so real and explicit, but the story on which it is based is so unreal. What is its use then? Can you easily find life, half brothers or sisters doing such things? <br /> <br /> Did I learn anything about this movie? Yes, some people love to waste time making such movies, such stories, non-sense. But for those who love nihilism, nothing in life, or just a life without hope, you are. You should see this movie. <br /> <br /> Only a worthy appreciation, though: CATHERINE DENEUVE. She is such a strikingly beautiful woman.
