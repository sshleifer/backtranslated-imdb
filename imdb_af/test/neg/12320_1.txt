Inappropriate. The PG rating that this movie gets is another big mistake by the MPAA. Whale Rider gets a PG-13, but this movie gets a PG? Please. Parents should not be deceived, because a primary school child for this movie is a big mistake. There were many times, I found myself uncomfortable, not just because the humor for children was inappropriate, but also because it was completely out of the blue and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> But all that was set aside, The Cat in the Hat is still a terrible movie. The decisive and overall appearance of the movie is the only savings. The beautiful Kelly Preston and the always likeable (or hateful in this case) Alec Baldwin are both good at their roles, although Preston is almost too beautiful for a role like this. The kids are conditioned actors and it especially shows Dakota Fanning. Fanning is the only human aspect of the movie that shows me and doesn't throw it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that there was a big cat in this movie? Mike Myers is absolutely deplorable. I didn't love him like the voice of Shrek, and I truly believe that Myers should never be allowed into the kingdom of children's films again. His portrayal of The Cat is a slightly weakened version of Fat Bastard and Austin Power. <br /> <br /> In the end, the cat didn't have to come, he had to stay away, but he came, even though he was only anger and strife. <br /> <br /> The cat in the hat can be the worst child movie ever.
