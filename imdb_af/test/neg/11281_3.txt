Carmen's many narration begins on a high note with a smoldering, sexually-honest dance between Senegalese prisoner Karmen and her female jailer, but the vibrant opening times never ignite in a cohesive film. One minute Karmen is all sexual predator, the next she dances in protest against her unfair government, and then she is suddenly a smuggler on the high seas. Although the film earns kudos for postulating the first carnivorous bisexual Karmen, the broad strokes it paints, is so vignette-rich and not supported by any narrative coherence that the film comes down as a schizophrenic, undisciplined "Basic-Instinct" blend "Bound" meets an African version of a Bollywood musical.
