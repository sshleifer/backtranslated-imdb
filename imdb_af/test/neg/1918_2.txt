Life is too short to waste two hours of Hollywood nonsense like this unless you are a clueless naiive 16-year-old girl without reality and nothing better to do. Dull characters, poor acting (artificial emotion), poor story, slow pace, and most important for these movies, lack of existence. Nobody cares about the excessive dramatic relationship.
