I really should judge "Sex is Comedy" as one of the worst bits of liquor I've ever seen. The film unexpectedly shows those who are the worst aspects of the French, or at least how they stereotyped, narcissistic, snobbery and pseudo-intellectualism. I am French-Canadian myself and feel a little embarrassed that the creators of this movie are the same culture as I do, to give you an idea of ​​how bad this movie really was! One does not look so much at this movie if it undergoes torture. There was a total lack of humor, and it seemed to me that the whole film was a documentary interview that was not known or talented as if it had celebrated. something that has never happened before. Instead, look for Auberge Espagnole, Happenstance or Je t'aime ... a la foil, three fantastic modern French films.
