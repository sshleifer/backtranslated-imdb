Steven Segal's film career is a tribute to horrible theater. I was tragically bored with each one as soon as I realized they were even unrealistic as Jean Claude VanDamme. Has anyone ever noticed that he is never hit? I mean, give me something to root ... a hard fight with a bad guy that's scary. TWENTY YEARS and he is still filming the same battle scenes. Vegtonele can often deduce you from the fact that your hero cannot act. The boring choreography of a Segal movie puts its painful lack of acting skill into sharp relief. Even worse, he is discouraged by form. Just what we need, a fat stiff that thinks he's a leading man. There is no reason to settle cinematic value in all these movies ninety or so minutes. Don't look at it unless you throw away half an hour of your life.
