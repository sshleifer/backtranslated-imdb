Susan Sleep It seems to be Dick Powell's swan song as a big screen exporter. Of course he directed even more movies and he appeared on television regularly until he died. It's a pity he didn't go out with his performances in The Bad and the Beautiful. <br /> <br /> Frank Tashlin did so much better movies, I'm still not sure what he did to do this one. The premise is absolutely feasible. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is a screenwriter who wants to do more serious things than the fluff he writes. He had an idea for a film about juvenile crimes, so two friendly policemen in Herb Vigran and Horace McMahon deposit 17-year-old Debbie Reynolds on his doorstep. She is not a very bad child and does not want to put her in the system. So they give her to Dick Powell at Christmas. <br /> <br /> I mean, is there someone out there who doesn't see a problem? The term jailbait comes forth immediately. In addition, Powell has a girl, the young and sexy Anne Francis. Why Debbie Reynolds is any competition here is outside me. <br /> <br /> Susan Sleep Here's one Oscar nomination. The song Hold My Hand, sung by Don Cornell in the background, was nominated for the best song, but lost to Secret Love. <br /> <br /> Powell and Reynolds have some funny moments together and Alvy Moore as Powell's facts and Les Tremayne as his lawyer also get a few laughs. <br /> <br /> But that's not enough.
