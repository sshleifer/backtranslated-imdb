An American family is moving to the countryside of Spain to live in a secluded house. Regina (Anna Paquin), the teenage daughter of Mark (Iain Glen), who is ill and has some mental problems, and nurse Maria (Lena Olin), notices that strange things happen in the house and with her young brother Paul Stephan Enquist), but her mother does not believe in her. Reggie, with her boyfriend Carlos (Fele Martínez), decided to investigate the origin of the house, and found that forty years ago, the place was the site of the death of six. Reggie decides to ask her grandfather Albert (Giancarlo Giannini) to protect her brother from home and her father. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD and expected to see a good horror movie of haunted house, mainly due to the names of Anna Paquin, Lena Olin, Fele Martínez (from "Thesis" and "Abre Los Ojos ") and Giancarlo Giannini. Furthermore, I really like Spanish theater. In spite of that, I found a terrible script, a terrible direction and a deplorable act of excellent actors and actresses. The intention of the story is good, and it's a little reminiscent of 'The Shinning', but unfortunately it was poorly developed. It is never clear, for example, the reasons and motives why the American family moved to Spain or the terrible relationship between members of the family, especially the situation between Maria and Reggie. The direction is confused, poorly trying to use dark and shady to make the story unpleasant. I love Anna Paquin, but her expressionless face never works in this movie. Lena Olin is a caricature of the great actress she is; and Stephan Enquist is too weak for such an important role. Only Fele Martínez has a good performance in his supportive character. I like the open end of the story. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Satima Vítima" ("The Seventh Victim")
