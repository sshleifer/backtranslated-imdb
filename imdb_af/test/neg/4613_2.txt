Following the 1970s classic horror movie Carrie with this presentation, is like Ford to the Mustang with the Edsel. This movie was horrible in every detail. It would have been titled Beverly Hill 90210 to Mystery Science Theater 3000, but both of these performances are beyond these trips. This movie was hardly a horror movie. I went about 3 minutes from gore and 90 minutes from high school hazing and ritual. Wow, what a surprise, Carrie's odd friend, commits suicide! Wow, Carrie distorts her love affairs! Wow, the crowd sets up Carrie! Wow, the jocks have a sexual score battle! What this movie needs was much more action and much less tired teen cliches. This film is completely unimaginable.
