As a useful warning for others, I believe "Skeleton" is actually worse than "Raptor Island." I use RI as an example of the worst original movie on the Sci-Fi channel, but SM is the most legally disjointed and miserably designed movie I've ever seen. Yes, I almost watched the whole thing and got there in about 35 minutes. It involved me with his pure discontent. What was Sci-Fi thinking? Once the Skeleton and the surviving platoon leader (or whatever he was - I'm not good at military unit terminology) reached the chemical plant, the film moved to a zone of impossible nonsense that was almost enchanting. I had the same idea as another viewer who wondered if more than one movie had edited someone together to make one horrible whole.
