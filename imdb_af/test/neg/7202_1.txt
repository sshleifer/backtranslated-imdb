It's just about the WORST piece of garbage I've ever had the dissatisfaction to go through. The story was embarrassingly amateurish, the graphics were terrible, and the acting ... I have never seen any worse acting in my life. A nursery school can come up with a frightening, better written and more entertaining concept than that. I'm sorry for anyone wasting their time on this movie, as well as the actors who agreed to do the work. It was clear that they were not given appropriate direction. The authors had to spend their time at the film school in the back room play point. Many professors have spent a lot of time on these two. I would really be embarrassed to admit that I knew them.
