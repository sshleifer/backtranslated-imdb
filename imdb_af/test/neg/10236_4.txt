Time has not become so enjoyable for this movie from the transitory days of silence. The plot has a gunman who falls for a social man who wants to help him to help his lucky violet. There are, of course, complications. The problem with the movie for me is that it is not well-aged. Performances are everywhere in the place with a few emotional scenes that look so over the top to be ridiculous. One exchange where Carol Lombard throws someone out of her room, cried me with his song. There are other times when the movie becomes static, a sign of the limitations of the microphones. It's not a bad movie, it's just that the technical limitations of the movie stand in the way of true enjoyment. Usually I forgive you, but this time I couldn't just go with the flow. Then the copy I saw is absolutely terrible. Worth a shot in a forgiving mood (and reminded that Robert Armstrong actually did more than Carl Denham in King Kong)
