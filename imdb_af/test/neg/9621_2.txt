"MirrorMask" was a terribly disappointing movie for me. I expected a lot from a Jim Henson production and found favorable reviews comparing it to "The Labyrinth" and "Alice In Wonderland". Unfortunately, the movie ended in one of those style over substance stacks of movies. <br /> <br /> While most kids dream of walking away from home to join a circus, Helena is a child who grew up in a circus (child labor, anyone?) want to run away to join Real Life. Helena wants her mother to die, which is a bad move for a spoiled brat with a princess complex in a child's fantasy movie. Next thing you know, Helena's mother flops over and for some reason she is suddenly transported to another world. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, I felt like I was transported to the Museum of Contemporary Art with some foggy sepia-tinted glasses. <br /> <br /> The appearance of CGI-generated creatures and backgrounds was initially interesting and I liked the Orbiting Giants. After a few minutes it became a bit too difficult, and I turned my mind ... <br /> <br /> With no sense of narrative and MTV styles cuts and soundtracks (the Sphinx reminded me to Kelder Jaxx's "Where's your head?", I didn't get involved with the fate of the protagonist and also frustrated as we waited for the movie to lead us wherever it was, hopefully to the "Outing" signs of the theater ...
