An insult to both poker and theater, this movie manages to make the most dynamic, brilliant and fascinating figure in poker history in a complete drill. Another fun movie to make jokes, from the lame gangster movie clips from the first half to the incomprehensible nonsense of the second hour. Stu Ungar wins all three of his titles in the World Series without playing one hand on the screen. His notorious merchant abuse? 1 scene. His coke habit? 1 scene. His incredible memory? 0 scenes. They couldn't get actual poker players. What did they cover? Many high angle shots inside a suburban house. Oh, and a Stu's mounting every day wakes up and buys for meat that doesn't come close to sense. Why do I care so much about this little Sopranos summer camp, trying to cash in on the poker frenzy? Because I think there's still a good movie to be made about Stu Ungar, and wait for someone willing to do it right.
