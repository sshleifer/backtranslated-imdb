I had this DVD to watch and think I would see a kind of biography o painter Goya, but the movie was about everything except Goya. This movie is about a young woman who was taken away from her family by the Holy Inquisition because she was practicing Jewish rituals (just because the poor girl didn't want to eat pork!). The rest of the movie is about torture, humiliation, driven by poor writing (it can't believe it is JC Career, because I couldn't believe this cr ** is being directed by Milos Forman). Centered on a religious man and young woman and that's all. <br /> <br /> Oh, and there is Goya, I forgot to play a completely peripheral role - this could be John, Paul, Peter, Manuel, Joaquim, Jose or anyone. Very disappointing - one this movies that will be forgotten forever (if not yet). Rent "The Name of the Rose" if you want a movie about the Holy Inquisition. And I don't know what to rent if you want to watch a movie about Spanish painter Goya. Perhaps a good caliber director, not Forman, should still do it. PS: The Spanish painter Goya - the title role lost in the plot - is portrayed by a Scandinavian actor, something that makes this movie even harder to take seriously. Maybe we should send Javier Barden next time to play the biopics of Norwegian painter Edvard Munch!
