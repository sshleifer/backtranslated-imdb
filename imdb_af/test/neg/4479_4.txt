The only thing romantic about this movie is the pain and anxiety of romance. If you expect this movie adaptation of another Nicholas Sparks novel to rethink the surefire formula of previous films, such as 'Message in a Bottle', 'Nights at Rodanthe' and 'A Walk to Remember,' expect you. Nobody dies of an accident to save someone else and the romance does not change these characters. Anything, it makes them even more miserable than they were. <br /> <br /> A softly spoken Special Forces Sergeant, John Tyree (Channing Tatum of "GI Joe"), has a memorable two-week flirting while on leave of the army with an impressive college girl, Savannah Curtis ( radiant Amanda Seyfriend of "Mamma Mia", who boasts Springboks in South Carolina. Savannah doesn't drink, smoke, but she tells John that her head is full of curse. Inevitably, John and Savannah disappear badly in love with each other and start an endless letter of exchange of love letters that is according to any standard sleep experience. Tyree is in the service of the army in a divine corner of the world while away from college and reading his letters in class. Just as they get hot and heavy between them, suicide bombers fly into the World Trade Center. John reindeer lists with his friends in a wave of patriotism without discussing the option with Savannah. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, another old, rugged but nice family friend Tim (Henry Thomas of ET: The Extra-Terrestrial) who has a motherless, autistic child named Alan, becomes the object of Savannah sentiment. She is the kind of girl who helps build homes for the underprivileged and wants to start a summer horse farm for autistic children. She slows down what looks like forever before she finally contacts Tyree with the equal letter. Indeed, she throws him to a man with an illness! Later she confessed to John that she knew that the voice of his voice would break her decision to marry Tim so that she did not make the fateful call. Predictably, John agonizes about Savannah's lack of communication. During a routine mission, our hero picks up some terrorist bullets in the back and wind in Germany. While all this is going on, Tyree tries with his own municipal father, Tyree (Richard Jenkins of "Step Brothers"), who suffers from Asperger's syndrome. His father seems to be on his last legs after John comes out of hospital. The main female character has a little respect and her betrayal of Tyree is a fairly low blow. Tyree, his father, and Tyree's commander, Keith Robinson, are the only sympathetic characters in these long-range epistolary romance. <br /> <br /> "Dear John" gives new meaning to dull love stories. Bah!
