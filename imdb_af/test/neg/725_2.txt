This is called by others the inane dialogue in this series, and I agree. <br /> <br /> If Mom and Daughter were really so sharp, they should be Queen and Princess of the Universe and not kicking around in a small town. . <br /> <br /> I really tried to watch a few episodes, but if the witty staccato mumbles pop culture thunder, I flip the channel. <br /> <br /> I watched a bit of a new episode. to see if something changed (the better I hoped), but no, the same old "we are so clever with our references to pop culture" that I almost barfed. <br /> <br /> Long time fans who aren't happy with the newer seasons can just get up and get sick of the regurgitated pablum that never stops.
