Being a fan of Marlene Dietrich's films, I was very anxious to see this "documentary". I also sucked in by reading rave review after rave review of national critics. It had to cut me off. <br /> <br /> The movie is just boring and obviously overstated. You don't even see Dietrich. She is heard in the background, discusses her movies and this video. She complains almost nothing except everything. What a drag! <br /> <br /> The filmmaker, Maximilian Schell, constantly complains and pleads with her to be on camera ..... all in vain. She just keeps refusing to work together. After a while this kind of thing gets really tired. With her attitude, why would Schell continue with this project? He just had to tell the prime Donna to "move it." <br /> <br /> Whatever you read, don't waste your time with it.
