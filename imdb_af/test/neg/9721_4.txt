I really feel bad about reviewing this movie because I wish I had just watched it as a draft production. The covenant seemed to be a very original piece, but unfortunately they lost the good idea in the translation to the screen. <br /> <br /> The story follows four (five) teenagers who are the descendants of the families. that started the village of Ipswitch, started a survivor of the Salem gate trials. They are also part of the secret sect called the "Covenant". Their power must be used sparingly, as they drain their vitality in small quantities and are very addictive. In theory, it would make a nice, good action sci-fi movie or at least an interesting teenage girl. <br /> <br /> However, there were just too many glaring failures that did not allow this movie to reach its full potential. It wasn't good, the soundtrack was mediocre and we found many unnecessary synchronization problems. The biggest problem is probably the poor workmanship. The movie has little or no coherent flow and fights one to keep a spiritual timeline or a sense of pacing. <br /> <br /> The movie has moments, but overall is a bit disappointing. <br /> <br /> A witchy 4/10
