First, I'm critical of this movie because I had a lot of hope and instead this movie sucked. <br /> <br /> * possible spoilers * (if you haven't seen the TV series) Where to start ?? ? Well, let's start with the quality. The movie was barely better than the original TV series and the two battle scenes were made very beautiful. But the CGI was terrible. <br /> <br /> Then there are the plots and questions that still remain after the whole movie has been told and done. This movie does not conclude as a successful conclusion to a very broad universe, known as FMA, and just returns to expand the universe before we leave with nothing but our imagination to decipher what will happen in the future will not happen. <br /> <br /> And then there are the biggest mistake stories. Adding World War II and Hitler ... WHY ?? The series was perfect ... and didn't need Hitler. It doesn't even need Germany. <br /> <br /> Overall, the entire movie has become what a real FMA movie could have been and if I were the directors, I wanted to delete CoS and end a new, more "ending".
