If you want to make a movie from any book, make sure the characters are consistent with that book. This movie has not only denied the biblical story that has been told to children in thousands of thousands of years, but it has clearly taken freedoms that are unlikely to ever try. At least the Lord of the Rings is close to the books that people understand the story more when they read the books than these Noah's Ark tried.
