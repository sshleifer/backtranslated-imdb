I didn't read any of the books or saw the first movie after receiving a preview. I had no expectations. <br /> <br /> 'Angels and Demons' was a distorted, winding movie that didn't have any direction or credibility. There was very little character development and I never found myself on the fate of the protagonists; The reverse was true, I was more interested in how the antagonists would succeed, as the first half of the film is almost exclusively focused on why the Illuminati is who they are. <br /> <br /> The movie jumps from place to place. place with little explanation or reason and expect the viewer to believe that everyone in the movie is an ally when they first meet. Any analytical mind will realize that it is highly unlikely. <br /> <br /> The climax is extremely clich√© and asks you what happened and wonder why none of these points are considered. It feels very tackled and unnecessary. <Br /> <br /> The actors are not particularly credible in their roles, mostly because I have found it difficult to believe that scientists, professors and men of the church would act in the way they do without the consequences of their actions. Events that happen are not plausible, and the pace of the movie is doubtful with the characters running around on a tight schedule and I had to question how the protagonists get from time to time on time. /> <br /> The most enjoyable part of the movie is cinematography. I found it to be a great movie to watch, but it was such a mess that I found not worth paying in the theaters.
