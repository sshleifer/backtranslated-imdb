Unfortunately, it's not one of those movies that at least makes you laugh at their incredible stupidity. It has no entertainment value. It's just sucking. I don't know where to start to explain how much this movie annoys me. I think what the cake actually takes is the unbearable soundtrack. It sounds like someone has taken a simple beating and then ran a 5-year-old child with a synthesizer and tied it to the rest. It's really so terrible and as if it's not enough, there is not one scene in the movie without "music" (= noise). At the end of the movie you are deaf or have cut off your ears before. This will keep you at least asleep, since nothing happens in the movie to keep your attention. Just a very bad play, kill some inexpensive and unconvincing, no story (it just jumps from one scene to another and you and the viewer can make sense) and in the last 30 minutes or so can ever of the worst "special effects" ever testify. It's extremely boring. Don't see this movie! You can do something more entertaining like staring at a wall or reading the phone book. Did I mention how much the soundtrack sucked?
