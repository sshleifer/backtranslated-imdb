That's a joke, right? Lynch could not be produced as a TV program. He was out of money, so what to do? Well, he did get some dollar somehow and "completed" the pilot and created this mess just by collecting everything. How can anyone see a failed TV pilot as a cinematic masterpiece?! <br /> <br /> And now everyone is guessing about the deeper meaning! Well, wake up, there's no one! Like Lynch's other TV series, what was the name again? Same procedure there. Build a riddle and then get nothing up. I think Lynch will repeat this concept until people realize, the emperor has no clothes. <br /> <br /> In Germany there is a comedian named Harpe Kerkerling. He acted as an opera singer and performed some new art songs. The thing is as follows: <br /> <br /> "The wolf. The lamb. On the way. Hurrz!" <br /> <br /> It's a classic now. <br /> <br /> Anyway, he discussed it with the audience. And they talked seriously about the deeper meaning of the wolf / lamb relationship. <br /> <br /> Your people who give this movie a score of 8.0 in imdb.com, your people can be one of them. <br /> <br /> Let's say it all: "Hurrz!" <br /> <br /> Macaulay J.
