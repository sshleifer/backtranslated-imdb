Granny is definitely one of the worst horror movies ever made in the history of the theater. <br /> <br /> The script was diabolical, so bad in that I almost cried with laughter at some of the things they came up with. . The acting was almost as bad, they would have been better off throwing traffic cones to play the roles (they would have done better work). The murders were laughing, the tension didn't exist, the work of the camera was ineffective, and the "big" plot turn at the end was disgustingly inappropriate. It just gets worse and worse. <br /> <br /> The grandmother is probably one of the most unattractive "villains" caught on film, she looks like she's wearing a cheap mask from the supermarket (the nylon hair has endless amounts of laughter) and a loose nightgown. Do you want to be afraid of that? I was definitely not. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch bad movies (see Manos, Troll 2, Michael Bay movies ÔÅä), then it's a must see. Those who do not like bad movies and do not like to laugh at shockingly bad dialogue, avoid the plague.
