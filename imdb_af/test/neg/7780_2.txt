The problem with this movie is that it's not funny, it's not scary, it's not dramatic, it's not intriguing, it's not stimulating, it's not, it's not exciting, it's not It's not the least interesting. I recently watched this movie on tape and I was glad I didn't spend money to rent it. It is basically a poor effort to make a movie. I won't even tell the story. Story? What story?
