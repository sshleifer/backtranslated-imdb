Riggs and Murtough are back, but the magic of the first film has disintegrated. The story line is just awful! I mean, really, South African diplomats who smuggle the mythical Kruger rands into the US. This is not painful! And the accent is absolutely abysmal! Can't anyone get an African South African accent right? Or will we ever hear the British or Americans that they sound like drunken Dutchmen? The only man who has the right African accent was Tim Robbins in Catch A Fire. Another thing about this movie I didn't like was when Danny Glover described an Afrikaans accent as relentless! I mean what a slap in the face hits the Afrikaans. There is also enough hypocrisy in this movie to make me vomit. I mean Mel Gibson's character is so against the diplomats, but then sleeps with their P.A. Touch! Don't waste your time, look at this garbage, non-researched movie. If you want to see a movie that doesn't completely offend a cultural group then rent Die Hard 2.
