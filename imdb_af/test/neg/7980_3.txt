Produced by International Playhouse Pictures, it seems to be filmed in a pop house. Everyone is a liar, everything is dreamlike, toy-like for no good reason. I don't say everything in all movies should be completely realistic, but such incredible fantasy and movie situations are too much. How did they get these fine actors activities especially for this movie? It's nice to see Mia again; if we were meant to understand why her husband wanted to kill her, Mia did it well. Not funny, not moving, just fake. Stephen Dorff appears briefly at the end, which suits for a play, less for a movie, but it's not one to measure things. Awful.
