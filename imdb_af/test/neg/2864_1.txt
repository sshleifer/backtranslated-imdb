About one step above an Olsen twin movie, there is a surprise in the store here, except how repulsive the puffy, hongbacked Depardieu runs without running a shirt on the beach. This guy was supposed to be kind of sad? Quasimodo hubba hubba? Well, whatever. <br /> <br /> Katherine Heigl is a great actress, whose career over the past few years has shown much of her potential as a comic and dramatic actress, but this movie certainly did nothing to offer her an outbreak role . Her short-lived character has no traces of personality or self-esteem, and spends her entire holiday on a cute little boy she thinks is the world's biggest guy (basically because he is a cute boy), but she can't be honest with him don't be. for two seconds. Ladies, let me tell you something; If a man is really in you, he's not going to get stuck in a shirt, because you've been trying to get your dad as your boyfriend. He may be a little confused about why you will do something so foolish, confronted, and um ... offensive, but ultimately it will just be something you will laugh at together. <br /> <br /> The plot and dialogue hit every click right on cue. No originality and no white ... but it's rubbish, Rilly SWEET and Ben's Rilly, Rilly cute, so viewers who think Titanic is the biggest movie ever made, will of course say this movie is great because they won't notice it not have a brain in his head. A star.
