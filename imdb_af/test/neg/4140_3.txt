If there is one word, I can be associated with this 'embarrassment' at this movie. It has to be accorded to everyone involved in the movie, actually watching it in a theater. Everything - the writing, script, dialogues, song lyrics, direction - unashamed, common. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie when I was a kid. It was then, especially because it was a fantasy, a superhero movie. It's a not-so-exploring genre in the Hindi cinema. The effort earned credit, but that's all there is. Sashi Kapoor looks in a big hurry to make the movie. Can't understand why foreigners are playing as Hindu-speaking characters, who can't even get the synchronization (nothing to say about dubbing). The script is terrible. The editing even more. If you follow the dialogue now, you can find grammatical errors (which alters the intended meaning altogether). Nothing special about the music. <br /> <br /> The biggest embarrassment should be for the Sensor board. There are some nip chips in the movie, one of which is absolutely clear (so much so that I can't even think of a metaphor). The director missed them. The editors missed it. And the censorship board also missed it. So much for the non-indecent exposure-on-screen motto. The officials probably fell asleep while watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Can't think why Amitabh went with the role. It could be because he was a good friend of the Kapoors. But the role has almost nothing for him. With wonderful roles in Hum and Agneepath behind him, he could not have succeeded with a worse one. There are some heroic scenes, really worthy. But otherwise it is terribly incredible. (It may be better with CGI, but it was '91 ..). <br /> <br /> Dimple and Sonam don't exactly set the screen on fire. Shammi Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor give an inspired performance, but their scope is limited. Amrish Puri is his usual self in the role of a fairy-tale villain (the rogue laughs occasionally). Overall, an interesting concept. Could have been much better.
