Director Jim Wynorski (Chopping Mall, Return of the Swamp Thing), Cheerleader Massacre is the fourth installment in the Slumber Party Massacre series. Just think about it: this is the fourth chapter of a treasury series that nobody really cares about! So how can that be good? Well, it's not! But since then slasher movies had to be good? Cheerleader Massacre is entertaining, that's for sure. But in the entertainment field we have seen better, it is also sure! As you can see, I'm not sure where I am about this movie. Those who just look for nudity will be more than happy. This movie is all boobs, but unfortunately no blood, or not enough. I think I'm generous with this movie because I had a good time watching it and I really enjoy watching slasher movies, even as bad as they are sometimes. If you want me to be sincere, the Slumber Party Massacre Part 1 is the best and all the others are a waste of time so I think I have a lot of time to waste! For more fun, see Sleepaway Camp 2 and Cheerleader Camp.
