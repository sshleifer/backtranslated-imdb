How do two big actors play such a piece of junk on moviegoers. My only conclusion is that they and their director believe that any movie they are staring in should only be seen and applauded. <br /> <br /> Now to the movie - probably the worst thriller I've ever seen. The actors showed minimal emotion; the plot was reasonable for a 1/2 hour time slot (not 91 minutes). The FBI agent was almost a stupid parody - his mother apparently got bad and didn't speak one word. To paraphrase Robert Redford, the villain was a meaningless piece of crap! The film is signed out and meaningless. The only question was whether the hero would die or not. One actually bizarre part of the story. The waiting family seems to have been going on for a few days; the hero and antihero seemed to be just one day. <br /> <br /> All in all - waste of time
