What a good story could have been destroyed by the ridiculous time series scenario. If something had changed in the past that changed evolution and people never developed, the time machine would never have been built. If something of the past was introduced into the present, it would have no influence on the past. <br /> <br /> I really wish movie producers would pass their ideas as a real scientist before completing the script. Even if you suspend reality and assume that time travel is possible, you must stick to the logic. <br /> <br /> OTOH, Ben Kingsley, seemed to have had a good time with his victory. All the other actors were also doing the best. It was the writing that made them turn in the wind. <br /> <br /> "Back to the Future" handled it better.
