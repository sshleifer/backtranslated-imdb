I will never forget to watch this show at age 13. Even at a young age, I remember, "It's a Baywatch zipper without the one thing Baywatch tolerates. The girls in bathing suits." Nonetheless, in those days I was too small to be the spacer in my house. The highlight of Pacific blue was an episode in which some extinct gangsters are going to hit someone submachine guns ... on bikes !!! When thirteen years old I never laughed so hard for something that was supposed to be taken seriously. Even I knew the task of going out and getting Uzis (for murder) was a task that should never come before someone borrowed the car for the day. This was the decisive moment of this show. Simple crimes and custom made situations by hack writing so they can be cared for by the unsung hero of the crime battle world. The Bike Cop. Don't get much stupid.
