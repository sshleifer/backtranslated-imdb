There is a beautiful scenery to look at here, if you can keep your eyes open long enough to see any of them. I'm a big fan of life-snaps, but these people are just plain simple. Although there is nothing political here, the whole film can be regarded as a political statement, communicating what destroys the individual, and making each one the same naked animal that only sleeps, eats and sometimes loves life.
