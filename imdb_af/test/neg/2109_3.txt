The movie starts in Mexico where a girl is cursed, she spits on snakes through green jello and her friend tries all this crazy game to lift the curse. He does nothing but a horrible language that does nothing, so they decide to cross the border around their path to L.A. to see his uncle to lift the curse. Comic hilarity ensues. This movie has the same snakes over and over! It has garden hose and pythons that will never bite. They all make the sound of rattlesnakes that don't make sense. The whole movie has some funny lines, some bad effects, but most importantly is a good ending that makes you look like WHAM BAM WHAT HECK HAS HAPPENED !!!!! The whole movie is about a 1, but the end is a 10, so through my crazy math it gets a 3 overall. If the blocker wants nothing more, grab it for sensible entertainment!
