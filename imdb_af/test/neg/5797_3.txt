If a movie has an unpleasant, hackneyed story and mere characters, it really should be really funny. You can get away a lot if you're funny. But while there are a few amusing moments scattered here and there in Grandma's son, they are so far and away between them that they can't start making the hacking work the movie shows in so much abundance. <br /> <br /> The movie is definitely not aimed at anyone. If Alex conceals dagga in his grandmother's house in a moment, you know what will happen and do it later. The film appears to have been written by a committee that conducted a study of mediocre comedies and grabbed gag that appeared in more than one of them. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about the movie is its somewhat unusual setting. The game takes place in a video game development company, which must be an interesting source for a smart comedy. But don't be fooled, it's not a movie about video game developers. It's basically a college frat house movie in which all the freak boys are moved into a large room to play video games. <br /> <br /> The way the movie doesn't quite think about its environment and it's for original use Lek can be seen in the character of JPJP. I think more or less teamed up by the creator of Doom, John Carmack. At least inspired to the extent that he is a strange genius who makes games. <br /> <br /> In the movie, J.P. a strange, unpleasant geek who despises and is defeated by the company's game testers. It doesn't make sense at all. If you are one of the most important people in the history of video games (like J.P.) then people will even admire and respect you at some level, even if you are strange and unpleasant. If Stephen Hawking is unpleasant, his associates are not going off his face yet. <br /> <br /> Also, gaming testers are just as likely to be geeks as JP, but in the movie they are basically frat boys. It is a fun normal guy against the silly moped movie. And while that formula worked, it's sometimes absurd in the game of a game company in the past. If you decide to use an unusual movie setting, you shouldn't simply enter all the conventions of movies from different institutions into that one. Unless you're a hack. <br /> <br /> About two-thirds of the way through the movie I gave up. Something happened that I knew would lead to a series of painfully predictable events. And I realized I hadn't laughed anyway for the last half hour. So I stopped (although I was quick to make sure I was right that they would follow the most predictable clich√©s.) <br /> <br /> Usually, if a movie is bad, I just say it's bad and then run out of things to say, but this movie is such a phenomenal foamy production that deserves a long diatribe. <br /> <br /> Scan the movie to attract a good actress like Linda Cardellini and surround her with talented nobodies. I'll give the movie 1 point to give Shirley Jones the chance to be the anti-Shirley Partridge.
