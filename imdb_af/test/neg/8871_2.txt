Tu pa tam is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. But on the other hand, better than most of the movies are from Slovenia, which is full of depressing characters and story without any clear ideas. Tu pa tam is bright, optimistic and without any artistic moments. In many interviews, Mr. Mitja Okorn, director, tries to tell us that his movie is top quality, just because it doesn't cost much money. But to think so is wrong. Tu pa is for my very bad movie. The dialogues are really badly written (90% of the writing consists of cursing), the characters are stereotypical morons, the story and its twists are very predictable and the action sequences (this movie is supposed to be an action comedy be very filmed. bad and without any style. Okorn just thinks he's even bigger than Quentin Tarantino, so he writes his style over 90 minutes. The humor in the movie is very cheap and primitive (Okorn probably thinks that constant curse is funny). In my opinion, Tu pa is very cheap (not just by budget), movie with stupid story and very bad acting.
