Some movies are just ?? unfortunately. These were the films that were congratulated, of course, and a handful of potentially good ideas, but simply didn't have the budget and / or professional and crew members at their disposal to make it happen. "The Strangeness" definitely belongs in this category. You really want it, but even the most tolerant and tireless 80's horror fanatics will have to admit that the movie barely reaches the level of mediocrity due to its atmosphere of cheapness, clumsy stop-motion effects and unceasing dark cinematography. "The Terror" has a fairly original plot and setting. It's similar to "The Boogens", but I really doubt director David Michael Hillman deliberately ripped off a co-insignificant 80-year-old B-movie. everything is disgusted. A meeting of amateur cavemen goes on an expedition to explore the infamous Gold Spike mine. Many years ago, several miners mysteriously died there and the place has left before, but too much gold is hidden there to remain forever closed. Shortly after they descended into the mine, the group members met one by one the smart governor of the Gold Spike mine; A lovecraftian monster with tentacles and an incredibly cute way to move forward. For most of its time, "The Strangeness" is a boring and incompetent mess that is difficult to follow due to the complete lack of lighting. The characters are uninteresting and the mine remains a mystery because the only lighting effects come from the hell of the caving. There is very little action or horror to experience in the first hour, but director Hillman understands the attention of the viewers by showing the pieces of the sample at regular intervals. Once you get the first glare of the monster's tentacle, you're doomed to hold to the end. The creature is realized with stop-motion effects, which I usually worship and worship, but here it looks extremely weak and spicy. The person responsible for the special effects had to pay more attention to Ray Harry's work. The death effects occur mostly on the screen and there is very little tension throughout the movie. A horror flick with an institution like this should benefit from claustrophobic atmosphere and unidentifiable sound effects, but "The Strangeness" has it all. The biggest asset of the movie is undoubtedly the beautiful appearance of blonde actress Terri Berland. She looks like a speleologist as much as I look like Mother Theresa, but she looks pretty good in her tight white top and beige pants.
