I don't know what happened to director Abel Ferrara. Since the "Body Snatchers" recovery, he has already lost it. "King of New York" and "The Bad Lieutenant" remain two of the best films of the 90's: a decade of searing went wrong. With movies like "R Xmas" (whatever that means) and "New Rose Hotel", it looks like he is disgusting and carries his former supporters. This movie has NO LIFE in it. While getting excellent performances from his actors in all of his projects, the results of these ideas are not only refined. Whatever the point is - that the new breed of drug dealer is more or less the same as any other higher middle class New Yawkuh - is lost in the sensible and annoying writing. <br /> <br /> I saw this opening night at the 4-square in downtown LA. In the lobby, while buying tickets, I was surprised and delighted to see it fill with a large, mixed group of men and women in their twenties and thirties. Then they started in the theater, but it was the '8 Mile' theater 'R Xmas'!' The theater that shows "R Xmas" (remember, it was opening night!) Watched a total of 4 people, me, my wife and two others! <br /> <br /> Get away, Abel! <br /> <br /> 2/10
