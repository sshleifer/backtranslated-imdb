All right, I haven't read the book yet, but I have to say that the main character was ignored. How can I say such a thing has not read the book you are asking? It's simple. Considering these miniseries, I got irritated by the ways, gestures and appearance of the main character, Fannie Price. It is one thing to be a good person, but it is quite a stick in the mud that does not like to look or see someone else. In addition to the exaggerated "Susan B. Anthony" profile, she decided not to look at another person. The scene where Edmond pours out his heart looks straight ahead and forces him to do the same. Consequently, it was just uncomfortable and I just couldn't understand that someone was in love with her not only Henry and Edmond. Many said it was true for the book. If so, I find it hard to believe that Jane Austen would create such a character as her main heroine. It is possible to create a character that has been used by others and succeeds in earning their trust and confidence, but the portrayal of this character in these miniseries has not done it to me.
