I'm not going to tell the story of the movie as some people do. I'm pretty sure people who read it will know what the storyline is. I'm not going to go any further on everything wrong with this movie, because I'll be here forever if I do. The storyline is typical, and the special effects are below today's standards. It's not a movie you should watch if you're a serious movie buff (as most of us are here), little things will annoy you the whole movie and ruin the experience. If you're a casual movie keeper, who likes to have a good time watching a movie, this movie is perfect for you, great fun. It will also be a good movie to take a friend. Just not for our movie buffs. <br /> <br /> 5 out of 10
