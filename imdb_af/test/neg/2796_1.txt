Now I'm going to do it without making spoilers if I can. My cousin and I rented the movie this weekend, and we stumbled on this, with the big scarecrow on the cover. It looks nice, so we rented it next to Kungfu Hustle. <br /> <br /> Wow ... Just ... Wow. To start, the movie was terrible. Now the boxing art, opening scenes and music were pretty good, but the movie itself is terrible. The acting is subordinate (Sean, the chief, shows no emotion and / or effort in his character), the scarecrows look nothing like the one on the cover (False advertising, maybe?), And the camera shots and corners were what of a bad struggle event. <br /> <br /> Trust me, I'm a wrestler. I KNOW bad camera angles. And honestly, it's right there with Gigli and Pootie Tang. It's done so badly that it's my AMUSES. It makes me laugh. So, somehow, this movie takes its place as a good comedy for me. <br /> <br /> But to be honest, it means what to do and what not to do in movies, especially the slasher genre. I recommend that people see it, just to get a good understanding of what to avoid.
