It's amazing to me that the best version of this wonderful story is a cartoon made by Walt Disney in the 1940s, but that's true. Here's another awkward attempt to confuse sputters and alienators will be viewers with admirable effectiveness while successfully harming those of us who actually read the story. Irving's original work is short and with any measure and making a feature film, is a challenge. One can either completely rewrite the story of a La Tim Burton, which is a discussion for another time, or the breastline of the old girl with unintended detail. The latter is what is being attempted here, and if I can say that, sadly so. Inexorable and thorough modern new facets of character personalities such as religious zeal in Crane or wanderlust in good old Bram Bones destroys the story's intent and rejects a serious lack of talent by filmmakers. By the time the story's well-known climax approached, I lost a lot of interest. This is the kind of movie you are planning to see in an internship handbook.
