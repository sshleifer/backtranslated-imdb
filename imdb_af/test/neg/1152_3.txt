I've never heard of this movie until it comes to DVD. I was immediately intrigued by everything about it: the actors, the title, the cover, and especially the author. Arthur Miller, you can't go wrong with him, can you? Yep. I didn't read the novel, but I'm going to guess it was much better than the movie. I had high expectations for this movie. I love Macy and Dern, and it looks interesting. Unfortunately, this movie never really rises above cookie cutter messages about racism and bigotry. If you've never seen any other movies dealing with this topic, or if you've never known that America is based on bigotry, then this movie might want you. Others will probably find it predictable, stale, and totally bare.
