Unfortunately my friend and I watched it !!! It was mentioned on a Sky channel here called "Zone Horror", which basically shows bitter B-movie horror movies 24/7. It was a boring Friday night, so decided to have a laugh and give this one a glimpse. Aside from the horrible acting, the horrible plot, the tremendous effects, the shabby camera work and the brain that was insulting, it was OK, LOL !!! In all seriousness, it was quite a laugh to catch up with and laugh at the goofy actors. There is a piece of semi-nudity that has taken the film a bit. Unfortunately, it was the "uggo" that became topless if my friend called her: oD If you get bored one night and it happens, play a chance, you can just love it :)
