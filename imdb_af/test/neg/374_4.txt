Although the story is good and depicting what I expected from Sam Elliot, my DVD copy had almost unbearable synchronization issues. The dialogue was almost 3 seconds behind the lip movement throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I would be very careful to buy any DVD from the movie without looking at the problem. <br /> <br /> I will also follow the recommended censorship ratings especially for language and drug use. <br /> <br /> This movie can be a quiet classic cop movie and with the above cautionary notes I can recommend it to prospective viewers.
