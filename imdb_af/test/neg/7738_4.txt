Because they are all just watching MST3K with their artificial friends who (mostly) don't make those funny and striking comments on movies. And this is the only way these people see them and then comment on the IMDb, just on it, they don't even try to watch the movie itself. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie myself, I didn't even read the reviews, I didn't tell people what to laugh, I just bought the DVD (bought for the back of Morons From Outer Space , an old fave) and watched it. <br /> <br /> For that reason I knew well what I was for when it was a Golan Globus, Albert Pyun movie, but usually they can be quite entertaining. <br /> <br /> The movie is not too stressful for Alice's brain in the so-called King-hole story, and similar to basic structures (but totally different in content) to Warlords or Atlantis, another entertaining B movie. <br /> <br /> The voice was annoying, but then it was the idea with which they even stamped in the movie with some rules. <br /> <br /> The hero character has one of the worst over the top voices / accents in English language fi <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie, but it's not a very bad movie, it's just a bit of an average B-Movie DTV type movie, nothing too new nothing too outstanding and will probably be more enjoyed by a younger age group (say 7-14 year olds) than me. It's a little light fantasy. <br /> <br /> Will I See It Again, probably not about 10 years ago, I would have. <br /> <br /> Don't be so hard on a movie, because some dolls have also told you. This movie does not take him seriously and it is definitely no Troll 2 or Space Mutiny.
