It is a family movie broadcast at my local ITV station at about 01:00 a few nights. This may be a strange decision from the schedulers, but the real HOWARD SPITZ is a strange movie, strange in the way he doesn't want to upset his audience. Come on, there's nothing more like sadism and that's why Roald Dahl is such a popular writer for children. It also explains why Doctor was such a successful show around the world. In this script, you just go for the pulp-fiction writer to do something for the kids, but it doesn't. I am not advocating child abuse, but to see how Howard Spitz loses his cloth, the little ones will make the movie better. Can you imagine how much worse KINDERGARTEN COP would have been if the producers had gone to the computer? I mean if you make a movie around a kid's writer who hates children, the story shouldn't show and not tell? <br /> <br /> Much of the problem lies with director Vadim Jean and you get the feeling that he doesn't know how to handle the material that is bad news for the movie. As someone has noticed before, the soundtrack is random and Kelsey Grammar is very wood. I think he was trying to play the dead pan, just like in that show he is famous for, but it fails to work here and there are many scenes with silent, ridiculous camera angles that seem unintentional but very distracting. But at the end of the day, the biggest problem remains that the potential is destroyed because no one wanted to insult the audience's sensitivity
