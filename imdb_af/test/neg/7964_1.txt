I don't like Cary Grant, but I found his performances annoying in enough movies to watch. this, Arsenic & Old Lace and Bring Baby. I don't like him in North North through North West, but I find the movie unbearable. In addition, I find the endless surprise of Grant's class exhausting. I have no idea what his class is doing for the viewers who repeat it. It doesn't matter to me. <br /> <br /> In the behind-the-screen feature included with this DVD, Patrcia Hitchcock says Grant was her father's favorite leader; I think he was wrong. Jimmy Stewart was a better-leading man in a better Hitchcock movie. <br /> <br /> With this being destroyed, it really ends half a movie and doesn't carry discussion and can't support the high ratings. . Even if the movie ends, there's not much to it. Fontaine is a completely unsympathetic sucker. She must die, be inactive and reluctant to contact anyone but Johnny for the whole movie, or to end, because she's working. It's not much to work with. Cary Grant started every line with "Monkeyface ..." until I wanted to strangle him. He says it sixty times. It's a positive timetable. Hitch's technique here is shocking. An endless sequence of rooms / sets has a fiery skylight projected onto the back wall as a spinner web effect. And a light bulb in a glass of milk can excite fans, but it can't save a movie that's made bad. <br /> <br /> Peter Bogdanovich should retire if he does another Hitchcock / Cary Grant imitation. A DVD. I think it's all his career now. As soon as I saw him, I thought, oh shit, here comes an imitation which he is only impressed with. Instead, there were two! o joy!
