This movie was made with a very low budget, but had to make it so obvious? They seemed to have made no effort to make the "future" the least futuristic. For example, the first scene takes place in an office in the 80's and all the cars being inflated are from the late 70's (I assume they don't want to buy cars that cost more than $ 500). In addition, it is quite obvious that Don "the Dragon" manages his personal car during the movie (he partially financed the movie.) Finally, at the beginning of the film, they show that all kinds of drugs are now legal in this new "cyberpunk" society. Not only is it important in the film, but when he does not need anesthetic surgery, why not just go out and get a legitimate heroin or morphine? The whole movie is messy like this and totally anticlimactic, as Don can blow an unstoppable Cybertracker in the movie for about 25 minutes. But if you find this movie cheap or free, I will see, the last scene is almost worth playing with this whole movie.
