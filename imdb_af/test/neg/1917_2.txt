****************** SPOILER ******************** SPOILER ********** ********** This movie bumped. Let me just say that I totally agree with what carisafillips had to say about this. What did Sam think? She was with a man who told her he loved her (3 times in total), was very hot and tried to hold her with her times (Josh Hartnett). But she decided to break up with him, no, deceiving him with a sneaky, ugly, spoiled, rich-bear-jerk loser who never said he loved her in the whole movie. Oh, he wrote it on the wall. who counts?), and left her in her time of need because he was scared (Chris LOSER Klein). Who would you like to be with? The only reason I sat all over the movie was because it had Josh Hartnett in it and hoped she might die at the end. I wanted Jasper to get another friend who was really worth it. The whole "your mother" thing was funny. I enjoyed it. I hate it when people say here, but I think Kelley deserved it. Jasper also had to tell Sam, she needed a good blow. How the romance started, is a mystery to me. They never said anything to each other, so I don't understand how they got together. "I thought of the cheese roll you gave me ... it had mustard or mayonnaise or ....." Oh, what does one get? The so-called romantic lines were so stupid. Plus he is sosososososososo UGLY! I must admit, I cried in this movie. For a long time, very difficult. Not because she's dead, but because she's broken Jasper's heart. He cried so many times in this movie ... he tried to smile for her, but he couldn't stop the tears. He cried 1) He told her he loved her. 2) She got sick. 3) Chris Klein came back and he saw how lucky she was with him 4). She died. I cried when he cried because he loved her all her life and told her. Yet she was dumb enough not to care for and love a man who left her in her time of need and who did not crawl at the funeral. 1 1/2 stars just because I love JOSH HARTNETT! Oh, Chris Klein, YOUR MOM! -Wiley say it
