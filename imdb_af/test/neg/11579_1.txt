**** SPOILER ALERT **** My boyfriend, a few friends, and I rented this movie as part of a marathon of really bad movies. We knew what we got. But the lack of intrigue, direction and special effects has actually left us for a big (or tolerant) battle scene between the two main characters ... the poorly molten cobra and the super violent giant komodo (which people eat like ice cream ) ... in the end, but had to be cut short because of possible budget or time constraints? The one reason for quality is that it's nice, with very important information being pointed out by other readers. I recommend this movie if you cut in onions to make yourself cry.
