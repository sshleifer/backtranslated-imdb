As everyone knows, nobody can play Scarlett O'Hara like Vivien Leigh, and no one can play Rhett Butler like Clark Gable. All others are pale in comparison, and Timothy Dalton and Joanne Whalley are no exception. One thing I really couldn't get by was that Joanne had BROWN eyes. The green eyes were the best aspect of Scarlett's good looks, and in this sequel she was stripped of them. <br /> <br /> The movie, as well as the book, had some fun in it. The new characters were not so memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who. I felt like she was going to Ireland, absolutely nothing done. It may be that I am only 11, but I have seen no change in her attitude until the last say, 10 minutes when Rhett told her she grew up. If Rhett didn't tell her, I'd never guess there was any change in her attitude. She really loves Cat, her baby. She loves this child best because she had it with Rhett, her only beloved man. However, if you have read Gone With The Wind, you will see that children make no difference in Scarlett's world. <br /> <br /> Honestly, it was as if there were too many without Rhett. Everyone who cares is whether Rhett and Scarlett come back together, and Scarlett has gone too long to get it. This is almost nothing compared to Gaan Met Die Wind, but again what not? If you've read the novel, you'll have it better than the movie. <br /> <br /> I'll see it just because it's the sequel to Gone With The Wind, whether it's worth it or not. It won't quite satisfy you, but it will get you out of the way.
