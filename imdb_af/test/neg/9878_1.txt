*** MAY SPOILERS **** <br /> <br /> I was very excited to see Blood and Chocolate with my friends. I couldn't wait, because the book is one of my favorites. But as soon as the movie started, I couldn't believe how different it was. First I was so, okay, so both her parents were dead. Maybe it would be good. But then the rest of the movie came. By the time it was over, I was furious. Nothing was right, but their names and the fact that Vivian fell in love with Aiden. At the end of the book Gabriel was my favorite all the time ... and then the movie turns into a complete heartless idiot? The movie also showed the shifters or weather waves, as these dirty, evil creatures were as the book shows them as they just want to fit in and keep their suit safe. They would never kill people for their pleasure. <br /> <br /> If they wanted to make a movie as they did, they had to give it a different title and the characters were mentioned differently. Because then I would go out and see and buy it again, but if I think about it, all I can see is bad. You can't pay me to see or buy it again.
