Spoilers for JEEEEEEEESESESSSSSSSS .... I have a word: "Insecticides kill insects and Moronides kill morons." The "ghost" in this movie kills morons. Several of the people killed in this movie actually claim to be killed, walking in abandoned homes, tracing, etc. <br /> <br /> On a strictly cinematic aspect, this movie is really bad. The three story lines are shown to be parallel and suddenly we learn that they are separated for at least a few days. It's a cheap shot ... <br /> <br /> The "excitement" is so cheap, they're laughing. Even "Nightmare on Elm Street" did not sink so low to show that someone was being attacked by his own jersey. It's pathetic. <br /> <br /> Save your money, stay home, and you won't have. a grudge against the filmmakers.
