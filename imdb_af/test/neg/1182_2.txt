I stopped watching this movie halfway through. It was just awful! Drill, contracted subplots. A complete lack of pathos in Norman Bates, Buffalo Bill, or Steve Railsback's depiction of Ed Gein. A movie doesn't have to be historically accurate, but the true story of Ed Gein is so much more interesting than these two-day melodrama that are completely built up for no good reason! Ed Gein as depicted by Kane Hodder is a cartoon sadistic. The efforts to show the trauma given by his mother are only poorly-reclaimed exercise exercises. And this movie wanted to be stylish, but it even screwed it. Fortunately, there is a better movie of this story. 2001's Ed Gein told the story effectively and presented some real cold fever because we looked at a sick man who was not in control of himself. Steve Railsback, who played Ed Gein at that time, was already known for memorizing another well-known serial killer: Charles Manson. His Ed had pathos. His movie is the one to watch. Avoid this mess.
