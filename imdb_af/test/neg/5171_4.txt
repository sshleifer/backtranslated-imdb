First, I give this movie a low score of 4 out of 10! It was nothing more than a wannabe movie. I felt like watching this movie. I was led to people, it would be more drama and more factual about the true story on which it was founded. Instead, I spend more than an hour seeing middle-aged, breaking the law, and taking drugs. <br /> <br /> It's just like soccer factory but with no real storyline and not a good ending. After watching the movie, I walked away and wondered, "What was the movie about?" If you use and curse movies with no real storyline and lots of drugs, this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> I'm a BIG fan of mob and gangster movies, but this movie didn't live up to the hype. I can see where the author tried with the movie, but it never reached the destination. One of the worst British movies I've ever watched. If only the movie had a storyline, it would be a great movie.
