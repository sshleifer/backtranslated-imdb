I would recommend placing this one in the "skip it" stick too. I was very excited about the concept when my fiancé rented it, and a little more excited when I saw that Milos Forman had fixed it. Oh, well ..... <br /> <br /> The costumes were nice, sure, but they were typical. There was nothing about them that said they were coming from anywhere, but the Period Costume division of any major Hollywood studio. There was no distinction between Spanish, British and French - all dressed as they were at the Versailles court. The sets somehow did not elicit the characteristics of the institutions - the prison did not feel like a prison, the houses did not feel like homes and the outside screens looked like they were shooting in a background is, for all that they were probably, practical places. <br /> <br /> The score was dramatically less than it could have been. I've been a fan of movies since my youth, marking, appreciating and collecting it, meaning I mean more than John Williams. My fiancé is a professional movie composer, an award winner who performed her work at Lincoln Center, and a rising star in the industry. At the start of the film, we had great expectations for it, and indeed it started well. It has deteriorated rapidly and on several points - including the scene of the release of the prisoners - has actually reached some degree of annoyance. I actually reached for the remote to decrease the volume. The score was never more than the obvious choice to determine a particular play and did not integrate it into the soul of the movie (think of the music in Babel and you will have an idea of ​​what I mean ). It never reached the grandeur that it wanted, but also not the movie. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem was as talented as he was. For the first part of the film, his ways are so distracting that he takes over his performance. In the second half, everything his character was in the first half was gone with a whole different set of annoying ways, and he looked like the love-child of Keith Richards and Stuart Townshend's Lestat. I never got the idea that he cares about the role (that is, the character cares for his life and actions) or that the character has ever been drawn more than an opportunistic by the authors, for whatever reason change his mind and decide to end his principles. <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman was very good, although her performance lacked the shades of increasing madness between her release from prison and Lorenzo's hand ended that I would have needed it to be really effective. to mention performance. The character of Alicia was never enough to distinguish, and if it wasn't for the beautiful makeup on her eyes and cheeks, someone who saw the beginning of the movie and the end would not know they didn't have the same character no. The prosthetic teeth were terrible, artificial and distracting, but it was not a knock on me. Portman. <br /> <br /> Stellan Skarsgård was good like Goya. Not Oscar-worthy, but serviceable and generally credible. I don't know much about the life of Goya or his deafness, but he seems to be conceded to the film as a requirement for biographical information rather than anything used in the film. I'm sure it has influenced Goya's life far more than just needing an interpreter, but you'll never know how to see it. For the record, words and sounds can only be interpreted correctly by lip reading about 30% of the time. <br /> <br /> Don't start me at Randy Quaid. At least he was a minor character. <br /> <br /> Reading the scriptures as one of the "choose your own adventure" books I read as a child: several moments through the film allow several outcomes and none of the actions they precede , leads with some certainty to the way the movie actually speaks. Ironically, the film is also predictable, especially its slender efforts to lighten the mood through small pieces of humor. The joke about the hands? Perhaps this is because I, as a hobby (not good) paint and know what a PITA hands are to draw / paint, but I saw the joke come a mile away, as well as reprint in the second half . Was the baby ever there for any reason other than being taken by Ines? There might also be a line of breadcrumbs. <br /> <br /> Disappointing. <br /> <br /> (Note: this review is a copy of a reply I made to a thread in the forum)
