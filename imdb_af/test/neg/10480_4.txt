Lame rip-off from the QUATERMASS XPERIMENT (1955): the first half is deadly boring, even sad - but the latter stages are significantly improving with the screens that the devastating monster entails. In the accompanying featuret (a little dry retirement at just 9 minutes, compared to those created for the other titles in Criterion's "Monsters & Madmen" set), director Day - who admits he is not a fan of the scientific fiction is not. genre - trying to justify the film's shortcomings by saying that it had a zero budget to work with (where all outer space zones consist of stocktaking!) ... and I would tend to be more pleasant with the movie I did not recently watch CALTIKI, THE IMMORTALE MONSTER (1959) - a similar (and similar), but much more attractive company from Italy! <br /> <br /> Bill Edwards as the crazy but unlucky astronaut - obsessed with achieving the titular performance - was initially boring boring, but he eventually managed to get sympathy for his audience when his physical characteristics were distorted and the character develops a taste for blood! Marshall Thompson as his commander and older brother is O.K. as a slimmer Glenn Ford type; He previously died in FIEND WITHOUT A FACE (1958), another (and more successful) Richard Gordon-made sci-fi, which is also available on DVD by Criterion. The Italian star Marla Landi, who struggles with the English language, makes an inadequate female lead; even her input in the featuret seems to be of little lasting value! <br /> <br /> The Audio Commentary is another pleasant Tom Weaver / Richard Gordon track where, among other things, FIRST PEOPLE is meant to be a dual function with CORRIDORS OF BLOOD (1958) - but it was finally released as a standalone release, utilizing the current news value of the current space trip; It is also mentioned that the monster dialogue actually died by Bonar Colleano (who has died tragically in a traffic accident before the film's release!). Weaver even remembers some anecdotes from the time he was involved in the production of the DVD featurettes shot by, by all people, ex-cult filmmaker Norman J. Warren: Landi, who at that time became a lady of the title , was still ready to help carry out the necessary equipment to cover the maintenance on multiple stairs! Edwards was supposed to contribute to the featuret, but once in London he was unwilling to work with Weaver. The latter learned that the actor was recently diagnosed with cancer and died in 2002!
