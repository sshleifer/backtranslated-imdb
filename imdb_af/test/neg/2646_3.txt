Although it was a well-told story, I found it to be unpleasant. The major is child abuse, which is never fun to see - a sordid subject. Add to that a very curse by the drunken man and a GD by a small child, no less - and this movie has seen me as far as ever. <br /> <br /> Also shown here were punkers who chose the two little boys, another unpleasant viewing experience. The realism of the story takes a plunge when one of the boys flies on a homemade plane! Give me a break! <br /> <br /> The only positive part of this movie is to see the lovely, loving and gripping relationship between the two young brothers, played by Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazello. The latter has become a well-known face over the next few years with major roles in Jurassic Park, Shadlowlands and The River Wild. Of course, wood didn't hit it until a decade later, but he made it very big In The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy. The two kids, and narrative by an unfair Tom Hanks, are the only facets of this movie I liked.
