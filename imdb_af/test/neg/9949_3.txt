While I was thinking about Poison for the Fairies, I realized I couldn't be fair with the movie. My 3/10 score can do more with my disappointment with the movie than the real quality or entertainment value. Based on the plot description, reviews on IMDb, and the 7.6 IMDb rating, I'd make sure I stumbled on a little-known jewel. Unfortunately, it just didn't do much for me. For whatever reason, Poison for the Fairies, let me all sleep. <br /> <br /> Poison for the Fairies is the story of two young girls in 1965, Mexico City. One of the girls, Veronica, is a compulsive liar and tells her friend that she, Veronica, is a witch. The other girl, Flavia, is so faithful that she believes and is afraid of everything her friend tells her. It's really about it. In fact, nothing happens, and the film moves over and over as Veronica attempts to terrorize and dominate Flavia. One who commented on IMDb described it as the "scary movie in 80's Mexican theater". My comments ?? If so, there shouldn't be much horror movies made in Mexico in the 1980s. Another commentator wrote, "Look it up if you want to be scared." My comments ?? Are you sure we're talking about the same movie? My opinion is diamond opposed to these examples I gave. For me it was boring, uninspired and poorly behaved. The scene is particularly annoying as director Carlos Enrique Taboada never shows the faces of any of the other characters. Veronica and Flavia have long, spread talks with members of their families and their teacher, but we never see the faces of these people. It's an annoying gimmick.
