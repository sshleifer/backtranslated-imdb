When the legends die is a powerful, moving story of an orphan-out Indian who becomes Tom Black Bull, a champion bronze rider. In the old way, Tom is given a white man's name and must accept the language and manners of the white man in that world. Bitter about the role he was forced into. Tom finds satisfaction doing one thing, breaking horses, killing them, in the rodeo. The movie features Richard Widmark in the role of Red, the friend Tom befriends and as his manager. Red is a drunk that eventually dies in the story, which is about where the movie ends. The true story is completely ignored, the dark side of Tom Black Bull developing a reputation as a killer of horses in the rodeo arena. Oh yes, you have to read the book, this movie doesn't come close to the story of justice.
