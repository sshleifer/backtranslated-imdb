Witchcraft / Witchery / La Casa 4 / and whatever you want to call it. How about .. Crud. <br /> <br /> A gathering of people at a Massachusetts resort resort is besieged by using the black magical powers of an evil witch killing every individual by brutal, painful methods. Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff) takes photographs for Linda (Catherine Hickland whose voice and attitude resembles EE-YOR of the Winnie the Poo cartoon), a virgin studying witchcraft without permission on the island. Rose Brooks (Annie Ross, depicting an incredibly rude bitch) is interested in buying the resort, and with the man, Freddie (Robert Champagne, who is always other women much younger than him), pregnant daughter Jane (Linda Blair and grandson Tommy (Michael Manchester, who just got bored, probably want to see Sesame Street instead of going into this rubbish), go by boat to the resort around the property by Realtor Tony Giordano's son Jerry (Rick Farnsworth) at a glance. of course a puppy in the business that makes his feet wet. Along with these people, architect Leslie (Leslie Cumming, whose character is a nymph) can help design Rose again. The captain of the boat is shot dead by The Lady in Black (Hildegard Knef, with her makeup and lipstick extra thick) and a storm breaks. The boat floats in itself (.. led by the invisible power of The Lady in Black, I think) with everyone stuck in the remote resort, which has a serious need for repairs. Most of the victims, before meeting their grim fortunes, are worn by a kind of red wormhole whose whirlpool leads to another dimension (perhaps a kind of hell or something) where they are tortured by these enemies. a lot of clothes dressed with a fairground. One victim sowed her mouth before being hung upside down in a chimney, while the other lighted up the fireplace. One poor soul is tortured by hard ropes that are tightly wrapped around her flesh before being trapped by the sword of a sword that penetrates her neck. One colleague is slowly suffocated as his veins bulge (and bleeding) and the neck's blood vessels burst into Hasselhoff's face! One man was crucified with nails hammered into his hands before being hung upside down over an open flame. Blair's pregnant victim is busy with her hair and is finally in another woman's voice. One is raped by this demonic man with a "sick" mouth, as the hellish hobos appear to be happy in the vicinity. The film is, despite the surplus, mostly boring feed for those who really want to see the lowest point in the careers of Hasselhoff and Blair, which earn better than that. Hardly unbearable at times, builds little to no tension. Clumsy execution of the death row that looks cheap and smiling. Sure, it's good, but most of the movies show the victims after running through the ringer. We get a chance to see pregnant women (which look like stunt men in a wig costume) who protrude three star windows. Oh, and The Lady in Black's reflected face often appears on lifeless characters for characters to watch. Tommy has a small Sesame Street recorder that uses the The Lady in Black's mumbo jumbo chicks, which are of course later used. For some reason The Lady in Black likes to visit little Tommy. He is not afraid of her, because Tommy is just too bored to show any expression on his face, much less fear. Should I say more? This one is a real stinker. Ugh.
