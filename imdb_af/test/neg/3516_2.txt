No way to interpret this overly simplistic script, with basically one character, as function entertainment. In fact, it's about enough material for an eighteen minute short, and even that will seriously burden your attention span. Zero characters outside Noble Willingham are being developed. The never-ending close-ups of lips and telephones are sleep-inducing, and the writing is so underdeveloped that a chimpanzee could have written it. In fact, this whole sad thing shouldn't even be put on film. A tape recording would be more than enough to make you sleep. Definitely not recommended. - NOTE
