Woody Allen (whom I had never yet confessed) addressed this quasi-documentary about the life of Emmett Ray (Sean Penn), a 1930s jazz guitarist whose star apparently shines for a while, then fades quickly. Penn does a credible job in the role, depicting a complicated and somewhat neurotic man (not only Allen himself, who might explain why Woody would be attracted to this project) who can't maintain relationships and whose twin passions (apart from guitar games) shoot rats at the shower and watch trains. <br /> <br /> There is not much consistency in the story. It is told in a sense by a series of contemporary jazz "experts" (one of whom is Allen himself), which relates their different theories and interpretations of various events in Ray's life. The end result is a materially contradictory version of the life of a fictional man who got a pretty interesting life story from his creators, who probably had to do a better job. <br /> <br /> Jazz fans and fans of Woody Allen will probably enjoy it. As for me? The best I can give is a 3/10.
