It's not a good movie at all. I can't believe that after fifty years this movie gets the National Award if there are such jewels from Marathi theaters that have been systematically ignored. It's a very overpriced movie that has become very, very happy. It has been awarded the National Award, the popular opinion, and will now represent India before the international audience. Anyone with even a marginal understanding of good quality cinema will know very well that it won't even be nominated at the Oscars. <br /> <br /> I can't understand where to start. There are just so many things that are wrong and missing from this movie that it has wonderfully considered it even for the National Award. The fact that this movie is awarded as the best film released this year goes to show the biased judgment of people holding the reins of Indian theater and the lesser understanding of the people who value this film blindly. <br /> <br /> The chosen topic is wonderful. It is important that such films be made ?? but only by people who can handle them. Sandeep Sawant does not measure up to the task ?? not even close. His direction is jumping, confused. There is no clear thought process. He tried, but could not explore the depth of the characters, especially the grandfather. He is unable to show the initial horror, anxiety and then hopeless debauchery and yet the insurmountable courage of the grandfather. He wasted our time in hospital when we had to show how long the team spent together. He tries to get hold of everything without any priorities. He doesn't properly understand his topic and it really counts against him. <br /> <br /> However, the roll throw also doesn't help Sawant. Worst work ?? Amruta Shubash. She is a terrible actor and a terrible choice for this or any sensible acting work. How did she get 'Tee Phulrani'? Extremely happy and / or extremely influential and / or extremely miserable casting. She said she was going out of her way to do an awful job in this movie. Her act of MSW had to go to the more responsible actor? Sonali Kulkarni. Amruta Subhash didn't understand it. MSW's work under constant emotional stress and yet it is important for them to produce a calm, strong outside, as it is reassuring to the patients. Amruta Subhash's Asawari looks even more scared and needs support than the people she works for. <br /> <br /> Second worst ?? Arun Nalawade. I have never seen a more wood face in the Marathi film industry (it is abundant and everywhere in today's Hindi theater). He is the producer and therefore he chose himself; no second thought, no consideration. Any good actor would have jumped to play this role, even if he had to pay the producer to do so, but Arun Nalawade didn't want anyone else to do it. About ambitious and blunt, he contributes to bringing the film together more than everyone. His play lacks research and even the basic acting skills. My choice for this role is Vikram Gokhale. <br /> <br /> The music is uninspired. The film is technically missing. This could have been a FTII project work. <br /> <br /> On the other hand; brilliant performance by Ashwin Chitale. It's amazing that such a young boy can give such a respectful performance. He has shamed many of today's actors. Unconsciously, but he brought his own innocence to his character and it made it an unforgettable show. Sandeep Kulkarni has also produced a very credible performance. Really put all his efforts in and show them. The writing is also well written. <br /> <br /> Shoestring budget can't be a valid argument for praising this movie. Lack of funds dogs all the Marathi movies. Cricket and Hindi movies flush all the money and the rest is left to fight for the bits. It's a sad state of affairs, but not enough reason to praise an immature movie that comes out. 'Doghi' was a brilliant movie and it was also made on a shocking budget. 'Doghi' was also technically lacking, but it is well researched and well made. It was in great detail and supported by great performances by everyone and it made it rich in cinema. Why didn't it receive the awards it deserves? ?? just prove my point of biased judgment. <br /> <br /> Lack of research and not of funds is what makes Shwaas such a bad movie.
