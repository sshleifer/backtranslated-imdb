So many people took shots at Platoon and born on the 4th of July, including what they called "leftist propaganda film". Now it's my turn to take a political shot on a movie. For me, this film is very much applicable to certain religious beliefs and to its political views. <br /> <br /> The acting and writing were a bit to click for my taste. Mel Gibson would like to play in these unnecessary violent movies and prove it again by working with another partner, Randall Wallace. During this film there was this garbage prototypical "Just tell my family, I love them" or "Tell Ronny to pray before going to bed". The so much overloaded with these rubbish regulations I felt I had to braai. How about the scene where Gibson's wife does her laundry and these "no colors" apply to what to put in the washing machine. She was in the mid-sixties, which she held under a rock that did not see the racism around her. Another scene is where Gibson's daughter asks him what the war is and the scene is shot in such a trivial matter. <br /> <br /> Directing it all perfectly. The many scenes of Gibson and his family or soldiers praying. It's good to show once or twice, but after a while I wonder if the movie is trying to move something in my head. How many scenes with the American flag at its best hour were shot with melodramatic music. The director also seems to have won a victory in Vietnam. What exactly they won. The cinematography was the worst of it with the delayed screens, as the American flag was scattered throughout the distance styles. I love America, but movies like this seem to glorify every thing we do. <br /> <br /> It may look like a rant and maybe it is but I can't stand it as a movie like these people who are not religious, are not so patriotic that they agree with anything what their country looks bad. This movie for me is meticulous and limited in so many aspects. To me it says if you are not a Christian you are wrong. If God or Jesus wants people to kill, I don't think so. For me, this movie was offensive. Initially, this movie was funny with the many clicks and plays, but when I looked at what this movie was trying to say or didn't say, it was really frustrating to watch. I think even though it is my fault that I have chosen to watch this movie. I hope no one takes this remark upright because I do not criticize religion or patriotism, but some of the meticulous people who are so in both and all discount. <br /> <br /> If you want a real portrayal of the Vietnam War Guard Platoon, born on the fourth of July, Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter or The Murder Field. Even Full Metal Jacket I absolutely hated was a better portrayal. I have read a quote that says in context that a true patriot does not go with everything the government or country does, but ask it if it is wrong. A true patriot loves their country too much to see that it does bad things.
