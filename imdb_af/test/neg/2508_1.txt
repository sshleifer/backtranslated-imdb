this movie is so incredibly terrible! everything about it was rubbish. you can't say anything good about this movie, the acting, essay, directing, effects are all just as bad as each other. even ed wood could have done a better job than that. I seriously recommend staying away from this movie unless you want to waste about 100 minutes of your life or how long the movie is. I forget. this is the first time I've written a comment on a movie on IMDb, but this movie was just on TV and I had to let the world of movie lovers know that this movie sucks balls !!!!!!!!!! !! so if you have any decency in you. go rent a much better bad movie like a sniff 3
