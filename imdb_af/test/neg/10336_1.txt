I won't go into detail about why this movie deserves a terrible rating, many others have already done so. That's enough to say that out of the more than 400 movies I've owned on DVD, it's the only one I've got rid of. It was so worthless that I couldn't ever see anything of it again. <br /> <br /> However, I have a comment about the ridiculously high average score of 2.9 (from 3-15-06). While browsing through the 4 pages, I didn't see a score of more than 3 stars. View the voting history, 78% of users rated the movie as 4 stars or less. It seems to me that a few people fill out the ballot papers to keep this movie off the IMDb "bottom 100" list. It will be interesting to see how many of the 30 users who rated this movie as 10 stars (none of whom wrote a review of the movie) are real active users. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled, this movie is not worth your time.
