It turned out and looked interesting. However, as it is, the attempts to create emotions between characters are so unclear that they are truly disgusting and are an insult to serious viewers. The story it's based on "I walked with a zombie" is probably much better, although I haven't seen it yet. "Ritual" looks so exciting and could have been a fantastic movie about zombies and voodoo, but in reality it has become very bad that is a shame. It's hard to say what's wrong. I think there are just too many turbulent scenes and it's hard to believe, for example, in the love affair between Alice (called Alice Dodgson as the girl who apparently inspired Lewis Carrol to call his heroine Alice) and the younger brother. There is absolutely nothing built up between them and eventually they marry. Anyway, it looks good, and it was worth a look - but the movie was just as poorly executed. 10/03.
