If all we have is, there are many reality TV shows with people who make fools of themselves, for whatever reason, it's too thick or can't sing or cook that is worth it as I know Hollywood original ideas did not materialize. I can't remember for a while when anything originally or intelligently came out on TV over the past 15 years. What is our obsession with watching bombs, fooling themselves? I would have thought these types of programs would run the full circle, but every year they come up with something new that is more strange than the one before. OK, so people in this one should lose weight ... most Americans should lose weight. I just think we all enjoy to some extent humiliating people. Perhaps we feel better when we see someone else looking like a while. I don't know, but I just wish something that would come out intelligently that didn't insult your intelligence.
