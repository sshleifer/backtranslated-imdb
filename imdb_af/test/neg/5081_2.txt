those people who told me, "This movie is good" - Estimate on them! This movie is for an audience who has no problem seeing everything (especially when it comes to tough guys, guns, chasing and listening). movie with "The Inside Man" (same time loss). I'm tired of copying and movies. And I am dissatisfied, but what can I do? fans of those types of movies are much more .... if you want to see good movie of that type, I recommend you "Lucky Number Slevin". I'm not mean, I just like this movie (bad actors, poor writing, poor action). Probably, someone else will like it. Many people, lots of taste. But for me, "CHAOS" is RELAXATION!
