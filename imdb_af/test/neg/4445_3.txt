In an upward career with all sorts of movies, it is Altman's once in science fiction, and it clearly shows it's not his forts. <br /> <br /> The movie is virtually incomprehensible. It seems to be a disastrous combination of experimental theater advocacy and a great studio trying to jump onto the post-Star Wars train wagon (not that this movie was first modeled, but you can imagine the studio has signed up to hope for another Paul Newman sci-fi movie). The story is non-existent, the characters remain strangers to us completely. <br /> <br /> Altman packs dogs that feed on the bodies throughout the movie, which is of course making a point. But since the film was so poorly thought out, it started with the lack of plot, it didn't really matter at all. <br /> <br /> The design is confused, photography is undone by blurring on the sides, and the score is terrible. "Quintet", however, has one salvation function. Not only is the movie filmed in the snow and ice, but the interiors are also kept cold. You see the actors' breath in every scene. You really feel the cold.
