When a stranger calls the group of this year's remakes, with movies like Poseidon just across the horizon. Director Simon West (Con Air) helmets this updated version, with many relatively unknown works, indicating that the mortality rate is high (that is, not), or that established stars are sending away a potential turkey. <br /> <br /> In a relatively short 87 minutes it beats mainly two acts. The first, which lasts a full one hour, is the setup. Our heroine, Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle), called up 800 minutes of talk time on her cellphone (doing maths), and as a lesson in responsibility her parents confiscated her cellphone and grounded her. To pay off her debt, she works part-time as a babysitter, and looks at the rich Mandrakis children. She's the first time. <br /> <br /> The great Mandrakis house gets a full tour treatment, as is where all the action will take place. Lots of rooms (cater for a good hideaway), an aquarium dam in an indoor pool (to get wet, for the wet T-shirt treatment), and watch these moving lights you just know , will contribute to the fright with the manipulation of lights and shadows. Of course, prank calls, red herring are plentiful, which is the time of this action, but most of them fall flat in the suspense department. <br /> <br /> There is a slight trend emerging, with actors invisible, and instead responding to their voice. Recent efforts include Edward Norton in the Kingdom of Heaven, and Hugo Weaving's V for Vendetta. Here Lance Henriksen does the honors for the anonymous, anonymous psychotic killer, but it just falls flat. Why? The script does not give him much dialogue. Most of the calls made were of silent (mind-masturbatory) nature, which I felt was a waste - they could also have thrown an unknown place, and the work would still be done. <br /> <br /> The Second Act, where the main action takes place, is too late. And the boeyman, well, is purely a boeyman. Those who expect blood and vomit will be disappointed as it is actually a one-week show to keep your attention in the first hour (eyebrows are always passed), and this action will solve her in double-fast time, ala Rachel McAdams in Red eye. Don't expect any kind of character development or subplots that will get involved. <br /> <br /> The end was trying to be clever for its own good, and came across as a cheap way to end the movie. There is not much good to highlight from this movie - no frills, no excitement, no mystery villain, and many security mistakes, especially with the door alarm. The only thing that is good is to give a number for 4D.
