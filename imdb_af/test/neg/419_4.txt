I saw this movie tonight, trying to keep an open mind. I was hoping to enjoy a movie I expected from the book. There were considerable differences from the book, much like the changes in the DiVinci code. I went to see the DiVinci code with the same thinking process and managed to enjoy the movie, despite the changes in the book. It was still fun, filled with action, and the process of deciphering the symbols was interesting and spiritually stimulating. Unfortunately, Angels and Demons have been disappointed at almost every level. Throughout the movie, symbols are found and quickly emerged, without any interest in the viewer. They blow so fast on the various Immuminati symbols that we had no chance to see them and appreciate how they work. The last Illuminati symbol, which was the most interesting and creative one in the book, was replaced by the cross-key symbol. In my opinion, this was a missed opportunity to focus on and spend a little more time on the symbols, and that's what the Langdon character is about. Overall, this movie is a very poor interpretation of the book, and fails to be an action movie / thriller. 4 out of 10
