First, how can anyone with his creativity on the right believe in such a film. I saw this movie and after a few hours I scratched my head, which is exactly the director trying to say. <br /> <br /> If it's an excitement, there is no excitement if its action does not preclude a jackal sequel, there is no drama, and the well-known love story, it never actually takes off. No passion, emotion, nothing is there. <br /> <br /> Actually, I never expected wonders of the movie, but after taking the bumper opening, I thought it was a chance. I have no problems with Himesh Reshamiya whatsoever, and I am not one of the guys who rests on any given occasion. I went in with an open mind and came out with a lock. <br /> <br /> Let's not blame Himesh Reshamiya, he's just a debutant actor. But direction, script, writing, makeup, everything went for a throw. <br /> <br /> Himesh is very stiff and will take a lot of time to reach the curve. He can do those don roles. Hansika is just a kid, and it shows on the screen with her baby fat and the way she walks. <br /> <br /> The only good actor was the friend of Himesh in the movie, I don't know his name, but he looks promising. <br /> <br /> See it at your own risk, not even good to see it for a time display. <br /> <br /> ** Highly recommend avoiding this movie. **
