So, as far as I am concerned, this episode is trying to explain how real villains are very bad people, and it's just as scary as the paranormal. The "paranormal" images associated with the villain, Donnie, are purely symbolic. He is just a normal person. <br /> <br /> The problem is that I don't buy it. Donnie is simply not scarcer than the paranormal. He's not even scary. As a man who looks confused and strange, rather than malicious, likes deadly girls and hair, and has just become a murderer, he is significantly less disturbing than most famous real-life serial killers (like: he is like a lot of watered version of Ed Gein). Therefore, Scully's horror of cutting nothing but bodies with hair and nails (something other than a normal personal hygiene routine), before anyone is even killed or injured, is completely out of character. She sees things in almost every other episode one hundred times worse and scarce. <br /> <br /> So, like comic book Guy says ... "worst episode ever!"
