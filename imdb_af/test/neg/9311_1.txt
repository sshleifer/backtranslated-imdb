I feel stupid after watching the first 20 minutes, luckily I walked and saved the rest of my brain, people have to watch better movies and make notes why they are highly rated, not because of the film's budget or special effects , just plain good and acting simple things, and especially important - not LAME - but I think it's produced for those sheep without taste and not an idea of ​​what 'a good movie is'' don't be afraid of rating movies low , save your undervalued high scores for "once in a lifetime movie". Keep in mind that many IMDb use for trusted reviews and opinions, do not spoil the sauce by sugar coats. Peace and love.
