The gang is back for more! Ron Howard and Cindy Williams are married now! Her brother shows up against the concept and Charles Martin Smith does everything he can in Vietnam to send home. <br /> <br /> The issues of the 60s are revealed here, but it's all over the road, starting with New Year's Eve 1963, then three minutes later, it's New Year's Eve 1964, then three minutes later it was New Year's Eve 1965, then three minutes later, it was again in 1963. Martin Smith speaks of his friend a year ago in a drag race, and a few scenes later, this friend wins his next heat in a drag racing and to download it all, the drug center and the flower children come in the pictures (or pictures, in some cases, as many as three different camera shots are displayed at the same time on the screen). <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, you should see this movie, but I would recommend keeping it to the original and leaving it there. Wolfman Jack is heard in the beginning of the film before almost every song played in the background, but where does he go? Maybe he can't keep this movie, and stop! 2 out of 10 stars!
