If you would like to get some quick cans of fumes on some attractive women, there might be a second or two enjoyment from this movie. If you like to see poorly crafted and performed "action" scenes, there are many. If you are blind and deaf, I still advise you not to have this movie in your presence. It's probably the worst or very close to the worst movie I've ever seen. And it seems that money has been spent on it. Talk about throwing money away! As an editor, I hope the "editor (s)" of this "movie" can never change a movie, book or even a post-it note. As a writer, I hope the author will never be allowed back near a broken crayon. You'd think I didn't recommend watching this movie. Not so. Tape it (so you can stop your pain when you need it) and teach yourself how bad a movie can be.
