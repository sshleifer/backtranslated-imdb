Made with movie stock left from Nana's production, 1927's Sur un Air de Charleston is described as a holiday movie for everyone involved, and that is the best way to see it. Jean Renoir never seemed to have thought enough about editing the footage. The plot is a simple reversal of racial stereotypes ?? in 2028, a black explorer travels to a post-holocaust Paris where a white native language teaches him the Charleston (obviously he assumes that she is a wilderness whose dance is a prelude to eating her before he beat the seductive of 'White Aborigine' music). There are many surrealistic touches, whether it's the pet gorilla who eats the flowers in Catherine Hessling's hair, the angels, the girl phones (Renoir and producer Pierre Braunberger among them), or the fact that the black performer Johnny Huggins plays his part in minstrel blackface while Hessling The dance ability is almost completely inconsistent, and there are some interesting occasional slow motion experiments, but there is not really enough to support it for two roles. An additional air of surrealism is provided by the fact that this quiet musical has absolutely no score on the Lions Gate's new DVD?
