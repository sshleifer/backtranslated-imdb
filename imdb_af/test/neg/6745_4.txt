I'm talking badly about G.I.J.T.M. mostly because I think it lacks something that G.I. Joe did. Yes, it has something that G.I. Joe did not like celebrity cameos by Don Johnson and Burgess Meredith, but I think G.I. Joe: The movie has the passion for the characters that the G.I. Joe TV series has. Most of the voice over artists really sounded like they were dead, and now they will die anytime. It's a good movie, but I wouldn't say it was the biggest movie in the world. I.M.H.O. :) <br /> <br /> Although violence is what G.I. Joe was built up. I will say that Serpentor's striking duke in his chest is not the best way for Charlie Adler's character to go out. No one has seen Golobulus remind Cobra Commander why he was chosen to lead the Cobra forces and then be terribly mutated after failing to deliver what Cobra-La felt was legitimate. <br /> <br /> It wasn't the best way. for the GI Joe series to go out, but it's better than nothing. :)
