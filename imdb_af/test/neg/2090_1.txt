Last week on Friday I went with my friends to watch Snakes on a Plane. It was wonderful compared to this horrible movie (but many of the scenes were ridiculously hilarious). In fact, a woman has a Mayan curse where she collects innocuous innocent stockings that are, instead of attacking, inside their victims. The girl with the bag's bag is pretty hot. The title screen says: "100 Passengers ... 3,000 Ordinary Vipers!" Scary, I know. There were not even 100 passengers on the train. Only a few stoners and some other crop losers. It is worth seeing the five dollars to make the woman into a big CG snake and devour the whole train and then suck in a big whirlpool. It's just sad that someone goes so far to make a crap movie, just to make a few bucks because of the "Snakes on a Plane" craze.
