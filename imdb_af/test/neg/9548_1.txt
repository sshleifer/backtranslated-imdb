* Criticism calls spoilage * <br /> <br /> I rarely make user comments, but this is one movie I have no problem with. This movie stinks, and its mediocre rating of 6 and half stars is probably too high for such pulp. The Bone Collector is not at all the same caliber film as Silence of the Lambs of Seven, despite what his advertisement claims. It's a perfect example of how not to be excited. The pace of this movie was extremely slow. I actually halfway through and returned to the exact scene with exactly the same character with absolutely no progression. (I refer to you the part where Angelina Jolie's character debates Denzel about cutting a corpse's hands off). The movie is not scary, but tries to compensate it with a love subplot, though sexy Angelina Jolie's character and Denzel Washington say. Of course, what you get is something that is comparable to that of the mentor student relationship as seen in the brilliant epic silence of the lambs with Hannibal Lecter and Starling, but even that lacks all the effectiveness and I personally drove for the villain to kill Cut off to avoid hackneyed giggles between the two. With such a crappy movie, I was half-expecting a plot twist or some sort of spectacular situation to finally act to give the movie some credit - things that made mediocre movies like Arlington Road and Scream. Anyone with a 4th grade training can see how it will be resolved (a situation that mimics Alfred Hitchcock's back window). The killer's cliche explains his motives were uninspired, but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid that I spat my rods across the screen. Esoterically, I think even the killer's intention was completely lost as Denzel happily recovered from his loss over the proverbial 'chess game' and got with his pet project, Angelina. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of movies With original ideas and truly dynamic concepts (like me), you won't appreciate this movie. If you did not attend a single movie in your life and would like to catch up on every Hollywood clich√© (knocking the late night on someone else's window rather than the murderer, the ridiculous serial killer for the first investigator relationship, the terrible one) woman trying to get into a male dominant workforce, aka SOTL), see this movie .... but even then it is too slow and you will be bored.
