This final installment of the "Airport" franchise was so terribly dreadful that it took me a while to realize it wasn't really a slapstick comedy like "Airplane". George Kennedy shoots a firearm from an open window to divert heat-seeking missiles. What will happen to your hand if you project a two-speed window to the machine? You will lose your grip on the gun and get a broken arm. The passengers were inadvertently hilarious, just like the inside of the plane. The sophisticated French woman who came to George Kennedy was like Jackie Kennedy coming to Ernest Borgnine. Don't go. Susan Blakely, a talented and memorable actress, didn't get any points on her resume for this one. Not even Robert Wagner. This movie was so thought it looked surreal.
