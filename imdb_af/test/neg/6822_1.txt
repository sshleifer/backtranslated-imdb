I'm sitting here watching the movie, Tango and Cash. This led to a discussion on other big late 80's movies. The ridiculous Tunrer and Hooch, K9 connection came up. <br /> <br /> Allowed I have never seen K9PI and if I still appreciate my life I will never. Joshua picks it up as his movie of the year. Wow. Wow. I'm totally surprised that this movie exists. But so much more than that, the fact that Joshua is holding this action disturbs me. I think Joshua is an interesting guy <br /> <br /> K9 <br /> <br /> K9
