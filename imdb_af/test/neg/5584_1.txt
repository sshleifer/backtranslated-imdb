The positive reviews on this page are planted by the filmmakers and their friends. This film is amateurish in terms of direction, acting, in fact in every aspect. If the IMDb allows filmmakers to dictate what their movies are written, it is a very sad thing. This film has a marketable premise, but it is absolutely horrific. <br /> <br /> Film is subjective so everyone has their own opinion. But this movie is on the same scale as Ed Wood's work, but without any charm. To think differently, bad taste shows the highest order. <br /> <br /> It's not a personal thing. I don't know anyone about the movie. I'm just a movie lover who feels that the reviews on this page are completely inaccurate and so I needed to address the balance and give a more accurate version of the movie. It is very poorly made and the direction is under even making movies by numbers. The acting is the worse ever committed to film. The best thing about this movie is the poster and DVD cover art. In addition, it's not worth it.
