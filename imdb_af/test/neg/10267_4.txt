When the word "gifts" finds its way into a title, preceded by a well-known name, the work is usually immediately inadmissible. For some reason, people who are able to create good art do not look in others. However, I was always willing to try the second installment of the Demons trilogy. For one thing, the soundtracks are absolutely dead. Most American directors would have sacrificed small animals to build the kind of talent on the Demons 2 soundtrack. For others, two words: Asia Argento. (Of course she was eleven when this film was made, and a few years away from her apparent decision that she would have acted after the early Helen Mirren: stupid appearance and small clothes.) Also, Lamberto Bava comes from one of Italy's best dynasties in the strange horror sub genre known as Giallo (he is the son of Mario Bava, who could well find out the genre in the sixties). And the original Demons are an absolute must-see for fans of eighty B horror movies. So how bad can it be, right? Well, bad. The demons continue their assault on the Italian media, as the movie starts in a modern Italian emergence, where many people go over their lives, their televisions are in the background. They all look for some kind of combination news report / mater video of some investigative reporter types to prove the events of the first movie (which seems to be the time frame of this one no more than a few days after the first movie). Through the usual horror movie extra inability to concentrate, reporters pass a devil back into life, and he comes through the TV screen to restart the plague. <br /> <br /> Yes. It's so bad. About the only thing you can say about the movie is that the soundtrack (if not by the likes of The Smiths, The Cult, Gene Loves Jezebel, etc. It comes from Simon Boswell's keyboard, which she began as part of the Argento dynasty started, and since then acted to make such films as Lord of Illusions and Hackers. <br /> <br /> Make a half-free free rental if you intend to drink heavily, but Cronenberg's wonderfully funny, highly nasty-creature skirt, Shivers (aka They Come From Binne), is a lot better.
