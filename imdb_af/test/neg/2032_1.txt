It was the most uninteresting horrorflick I've seen so far. The premise was suddenly forgotten after about 1 minute. The acting is terrible. The scariest thing about this movie is when the two guys kiss, yuck! What were the movie festival judges thinking when they gave this garbage a 'best movie' notation? The only reason I didn't turn this movie off was to see what would NOT do as a movie maker, and if the paper-thin plot line really could continue as it was. I was not disappointed with this latter idea. There wasn't even a little nudity or gore to interest the kids! I also thought it was tough to use about 3 minutes of "Resident Evil 2" in the movie. Was it supposed to be filler? because it was the biggest and most interesting part of the movie.
