This is the second adaptation of Charlotte Armstrong by Claude Chabrol for the screen: the first was 'la rupture' (1970) (of the novel "the balloon man") and it is a pity that nobody cares about it. This is Chabrol's sleeper, and I urge any of his supporters to see it. <br /> <br /> The chocolate spider's web wasn't so strong a detective story to start with. I read it 20 years ago and forgot everything about it. The movie promises some good things in the beginning, but then finally an error ends. It is a confusing Chabrol movie, elements of the boom period (about 1969), and a lotta-tongue-in-play from the 1980s, such as' poulet 'au vinaigre', not a particularly memorable work. <br /> <br /> Part of the disappointment comes from the cast: it's a disturbingly poor event: Jacques Dutronc plays like a zombie, Isabelle Huppert unveils herself a somewhat limited actress, ultimately rather vulgar. in "une affair the femme", it is not here. They are not supported by the young couple: b Oth is bare and imperceptible, from the past Stephane Audran or Michel Bouquet (both in "la rupture") brilliant and contributed to Chabrol's unique atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The story itself is indifferent: start as a kind of "serious" "la vie est un long fleuve tranquille" (except for a character tip at Etienne Chatilliez's very funny movie ), pulling the movie over and over again as a laughable psychological drama, we will not obey the youngster kwens not a female pianist, who after all learned from her divine hostess, agrees to drive a car along a dangerous road. <br /> <br /> Because he makes too many movies, Chabrol often introduces turkeys. One wonders why people who want to watch one of his movies should choose one among all his stuff. <br /> <br /> It seems that Chabrol's bourgeois satire finally gave way to leniency. In "la rupture" the first Armstrong adjustment has average detective story that Chabrol has completely crossed - you must say it Audran: "They have so much money!" Here Chabrol lost her bite, his strength.
