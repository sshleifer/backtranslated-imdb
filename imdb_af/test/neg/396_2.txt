Kazuo Komizu, who did not make one decent movie, directed this "notorious" shocker and should be ashamed to be a hit on his Japanese release. <br /> <br /> Yes, it does feature scenes of rape, gore and dismemberment, but so what? It shot the style of a bad American porn movie and poorly photographed by Ed Powers ("Dirty Debutantes") and is incredibly slow. <br /> <br /> It seems he deserves his fame based on his anti-social schedule. <br /> <br /> There is a big difference between this and abomination being produced well. <br /> <br /> Just because someone's cinema is a bit wet, doesn't mean they'll accept shit. like this. On the contrary, such a fan (myself, for example) endures even less shit than the average punter out there because he saw so much and became too critical. It is a pity that manufacturing companies do not realize this. <br /> <br /> One reviewer here (ZombieKilla81) said the film's "close obsession with gang rape" is one of the factors that killed it. I do not agree. The subject is never the problem. The problem is how the topic is dealt with. In the case of a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, it is treated so unpredictably that it is boring. <br /> <br /> Personally, I like graphic representations of psychopathic behavior (with an intriguing context) if the material is well-directed, freshly photographed and aesthetically pleasing. This Nikkatsu horror / pink hybrid is angry.
