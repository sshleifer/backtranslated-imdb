Oh, dear! Ohdear! Ohdear! Ohdear! <br /> <br /> I love science fiction, but this ... there ... "movie" just puts shakes. Every scientific film I've seen over the past year has been disappointing to some extent and I'm seriously reconsidering what genre of movies I really want in the future !! (Maybe I'll see romance from now on!) <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ALERT! (And it doesn't say much!) <br /> <br /> This movie is so insignificantly stupid that it is competing for the Earth and Baby Geniuses campaign in its bad hardship. The special effects are apparently fake, the Big Mac truck has seen its stool chair stools, the killer robots look like a more idiotic version of the Power Rangers. A big fat man is first hit from a harbor frame frame. .. Space Truck School ??? WTF? <br /> <br /> Mr. Hopper can do better than that. What really bumped was the two pretty young things that accompanied him and ran in nothing but their underpants (?) For a whole two-thirds of the movie! The compulsory sexual scene between our young heroes was so weak. I almost choked on my almonds that were laughing on the TV screen. <br /> <br /> The only character worth mentioning is the pirate captain / cyborg / crazy scientist. He spoke the word grotesque and was predictably sloppy, but I believe he could have been much more threatened. He does and says things that are very funny (all the best scenes involve him!) So for the captain I give this movie an extra point. <br /> <br /> But this movie is so bad, it'll let you abuse TV or throw your TV out of the window! It can even kill some brain cells and put you in a catatonic condition. <br /> <br /> SLOT? I like the way the captain struggles to walk around on his pen bone if it is of course a false pen bone !! I would have given it 0 out of 10, but as he tears me with his awkward abuse, it gets 1/10!
