I was one of the "chosen" to see this movie in a sneak preview. <br /> <br /> First, you should know that this movie is based on the video game "Far Cry", a great time game (2004). Secondly, you must know that the director of this movie is the big one for you. it is a man who plays video games (dungeon siege, bloodrayne, post, etc.) and makes movies from them (VERY abominable people ....). <br /> <br /> I still remember seeing Boll's "the king's swords: a dungeon siege tail". there were so many mistakes in this movie (like 3 scenes playing at the same time, 2 in the day, and some one in the night .....) <br /> <br /> so we can "crying". If you expect cool action, forget about it. really cheap tricks and a plastic helicopter is far from real action. If you expect a cool story, forget about it. Orientation by the non-bad story of the game, this movie is a laugh. The actors' play makes the movie funny in many moments, but in a good way. <br /> <br /> I had the chance to watch this movie for free. so don't make the mistake and pay for this trash. its one of my favorite movie for the bottom 100. !!!!
