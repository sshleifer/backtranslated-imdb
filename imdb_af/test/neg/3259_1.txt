After watching Caddyshack 1, I heard there was a sequel and decided to look it up. The movie looks pretty bad and I told myself to stay away, but I gave in silly and actually bought the damn thing! All the reviews and everything you heard from Caddyshack II is true. The movie is only worn with ideas and the clumsy plot and jokes I've ever heard, the gopher, the play of the whole movie is really bad. (Randy Quaid was funny though.) <br /> <br /> Just keep away from this movie as much as you can, all I can say is really. I'm very sorry I watched and bought the DVD, but not sure what the wiser was. Stay away as much as possible.
