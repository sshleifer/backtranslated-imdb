I can't believe I've actually been through this whole movie. A friend hired it because the jacket made it sound good. In his defense the jacket was right; there was an alleged ghost room that slept overnight. From the jacket it sounded like it was in the same way as Freddy, Jason, or maybe "The Shining." It cannot be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of minimalist and / or surreal movies, you can enjoy it. If you're looking for a good frightening movie, or some excitement, go rent Jason vs Freddy IV - you'll have a much better night.
