One of the problems with popular culture, especially when discussing the popular culture of the 1970s, is that mass media - especially television - are usually about four years behind 'underground' media, mainly music. Many people think the Woodstock Generation was important in the 1970s. It was actually at Altamont in 1970. By 1972 underground rock or the counterculture moved east to England and Led Zepplin, Black Sabbath, and David Bowie, early metal heads and the so-called 'glam rockers', all of them peace and love was. Not in a dark different year was Charles Manson's family. <br /> <br /> This obvious pilot for a television program (unfortunately never recorded by the networks) is trying to reach a culture that was already as corrupt as yesterday's flowers. For a few years, by the time it was manufactured, writer Carlino has already been recognized for hard mafia revenge stories. And the cultural references are all "Easy Rider" and Woodstock (1969). The music referred to on the soundtrack is actually earlier, 1966/67 - at Woodstock Hendrix, Canned Heat and Sly and the Family Stone exploded this kind of doll into oblivion. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a middle-class family going on the road to meet hippies. Wow, man, far away, outrageous, this is a brand new mind. But politics counts for nothing - Vietnam? Some place in Asia, right? <br /> <br /> This average (meaning deceptive and debaucherous) TV movie is just by Jeff Bridges' surprisingly mature performa such as the young college outcry convincing his parents and grandmother to discover America. All the rest of the shows are standard TV shows by standard TV actors of the time. The director uses himself a nice place cinematography, but otherwise the movie is a bad way to spend 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> I knew it was over when Sal Mineo ran away from a youngster (who tells the characters they aren't really there): "She's a latent existentialist." Wow, far out, rough. <br /> <br /> A few extra points for 'so bad it is funny', but if you don't mind the 70's TV version of the '60s, stay away.
