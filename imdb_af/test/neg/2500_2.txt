It's strange, while the movie contains full X-rated sex scenes and violent murders, it never feels as shocking as it belongs. <br /> <br /> A group of scientists are going to an island in the Caribbean for a radioactive incident. Upon their arrival, a mutated islander goes over the happy business to kill the men and go with the women. It doesn't always look like this. <br /> <br /> Among the healthy things we find some lesbian encounters, a threefold male prostitute, diverse heterosexual links and the rape of an already dead body. Although all this is quite explicit, it never fails to shock or stir as intended. As soon as the sex becomes completely pornographic, it just loses the edge; The suspension of unbelief is broken and we realize we are just looking at people who have sex. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of blood and gore with the murders, but since it's a D'amato movie, it's really tame. For a much more rounded experience, look at the similar 'Erotic Nights of the Living Dead'. <br /> <br /> 2/10
