Usually, I am the one who criticizes the twenty-something Neanderthals for not appreciating a movie unless it has plastic tail, gunfire and car hunters. In this case, however, the movie can actually be improved with some of the additions. At least I wouldn't get bored after an hour and change channels. <br /> <br /> I don't mind surrealistic, and I definitely don't give attention to finding subtle or hidden meaning, but there should be a point on the whole thing. I didn't feel that even the writer or director really had a broad vision, but instead was as self-absorbed in their own pretentious visions that they were deliberately distributed. Or maybe they just got confused. Anyway, I don't care. It bored the crap from me for just over an hour without a saving grace. <br /> <br /> Although a lot of other viewers have followed this site with excited ravens about the alleged symbolism and mastery of cinematography, I must respectfully disagree. Maybe I didn't cut through enough movie clubs to see some inspired techniques not visible to mere mortals. <br /> <br /> Or maybe this movie is just crap. <br /> <br /> I give it a "1" and put it next to "Ishtar."
