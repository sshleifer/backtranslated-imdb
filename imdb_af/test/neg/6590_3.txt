Yes, it may not be historically accurate (actually only 6 soldiers of 9th rota were killed there), and yes, it has bugs and exaggeration (bent machine gun? Come on! conquered by someone - trained Russian officer would know history much better than that - for example, take a British campaign in Afghanistan). And yes, it doesn't have multi-million dollar Hollywood-style special effects, but it's strongest to show the soldier's life there, their relationships and their feelings when the best friends are killed before their eyes. According to me, 9ya Rota is really a good job showing all the things. <br /> <br /> Once again, film has it weaknesses, but in my opinion it is one of the strongest Russian films for the past few years. <br /> <br /> 8/10
