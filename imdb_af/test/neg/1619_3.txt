It might not be as bad as it was if it wasn't for the absolutely horrible work of Raymond Wallace! This guy is so bad, it wasn't even funny! His character was needed in the film, but why they chose this man to be outside me. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for some good Chinese movies ..... I can suggest "Raise the Red Lantern" .... "The Story of Qui Ju" .... "Red Sorghum" ...... <br /> Anything but this! I was amazed at how many people really rated it! Really ... the acting of this Wallace loser is so bad that it overshadows other good parts of this movie. It was agreed by all 6 of us who watched this movie last night! <br /> <br /> Stay clear of this piece of garbage ........
