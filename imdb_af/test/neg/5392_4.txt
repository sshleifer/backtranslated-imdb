Dear SciFi Channel: How were you? How was your summer? I was OK, but I feel that our relationship is no longer the same and that we are growing apart. I don't understand why you don't love me anymore. I just watched your SciFi Channel Original "Skeleton Man" and once again you showed a blatant lack of respect for my feelings by killing every hard girl in this movie !!! I mean, I understand you are just for immediate satisfaction. All you care about is making a movie where people are cut and cut by a murderous Indian spirit / being / legend / whatever. So you really don't have time to do something else, like finding a Skeleton costume that doesn't make him like the gay lover of "He-Man" Skeletor. Seriously, his cloak looks like a satin blanket and his skull is smooth like a baby behind. He looks almost like a killer Halloween costume for a 6-year-old while acting on the desert murder. So we throw you a leg because we're not looking for Oscar-winning performances, plot plot or realistic character responses to the prescribed situations. As we realize that although Michael Rooker, Caspar van Diem and all the girls have to be trained for Special Ops agents, they are all secretly transformed into Keystone Kops that can't shoot straight or see when Skeleton Man appears. And we also fully expect that nothing - bullets, explosions, electricity, nothing - can kill the Skeleton until there is one minute in the movie and we need to find a way to tie things neatly. We expect to see blood and intestines. But you have an attempt to take the least attractive actress in the entire cast and make her the only woman to survive. And honestly, I think you just do it to antagonize me. Because this movie is as stupid as it is, its potential is to be a "bad-it-good" class and just force all the hotties, ruin everything - and force me to lower its rating . All I ask is that once you take my feelings into account and let the sexiest girls survive the movie. Please.
