First, I must point out that Wendell Corey's role was exceptional. Corey is usually rejected to support roles, but here he is who helps carry this very slack film. Without him and the character he played, the movie would have been much worse - hardly 2 or 3 earned. <br /> <br /> So why did I hate the rest of the movie so much? Well, one of my pets is when characters act "too stupid to live". You cannot base large plot points on the assumption that your main characters are completely stupid (unless you have a brain injury, is of course part of the plot). But that's exactly what happens in this movie. Wendell Corey is a crazy man who killed three innocent people and they know his next target is Joseph Cotten's wife. So, what are they doing? Yes, they really offer insufficient police security and a plan that doesn't make sense at all (no marker and guys with shotguns so far away, they probably won't stop this madman). And if it's not bad enough, the marked woman inexplicably walks away from her hiding place and runs right into the WORST possible place where she can be! Is anyone so stupid?!?! Arrrggghhhh --- I hate when movies have such stupid characters. In fact, I chose myself for Corey because I felt the idiots who deserved to die for their behavior! In addition to these clich√©d characters, there was also a little player who died. Certainly, since your husband has shot, it can cause someone to get tired, but in real life it is a rare occurrence - people rarely get tired unless there is medical reason. So, combining it with the above-mentioned character problems, is a real nightmare for people looking for realism. There should be Movie Noir movies. <br /> <br /> All these serious issues are even more troublesome because Wendell is Corey's character. incredibly well written and pregnant. It was his chance to shine as an actor - too bad the rest of the movie was so slack that Corey and the basic plot idea sank. It's a movie that can really use a remake - but this time without mindless characters.
