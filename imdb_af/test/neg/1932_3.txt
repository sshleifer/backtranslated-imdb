This movie has more on its plate than a sumo wrestler and the result for the viewer is digestion. There are some good performances, but the subplots are extraordinary and largely unsolved. <br /> <br /> In addition, I found all the characters unknowable, and if you can't identify with at least one character, there's not much to get excited about. All in all, it's a classic example to do too much too much.
