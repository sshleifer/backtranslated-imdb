It is fairly rare for a movie to be so useless that I allowed the use of negative scores with IMDb. In fact, I reflect back on this movie and I really can't think of a movie that is not so much for it. Acting: Your joke right. Direction: No. A Plot: No. This movie doesn't matter if you take it as a serious movie, this is often the case with movies from this genre, but most movies of this nature can look as if they are a comedy and you can laugh at how pathetic the characters are. and situations are and get almost your time. This movie is so empty that it can't even fit the purpose. I have to give it a -1/10, three points lower than any other movie I've ever rated. I really feel that the staff involved in this movie have to pay me for the 83 minutes I spent watching it. I don't really have the words to describe how bad it is. Nobody should ever look at it again for any reason.
