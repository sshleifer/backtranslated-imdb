While I'm a long Shatner fan (as our Trek looked again over the lunch hour in the early 70's), I can't think of any possible reason why he wanted to do this movie, either for personal development or business reasons. Did he lose a bet? <br /> <br /> As a movie fan, I love to appreciate the bad movies with the big ones. But "shoot or be shot" has no flair or funny bits, unpopular or not. <br /> <br /> While not counted, there were no offensive scenes (shine or you'll miss this nudity, cartoon-rich firearm "violence" with the endless bullet gunfights), so one has led to believe that the producers just want to save the fee to get the MPAA to determine it. Of the eight people with us in the theater, four of them left halfway, murmuring statements like "This is stupid". <br /> <br /> Shatner is playing an escaped escapist who has been denied release because he views himself as a scriptwriter. The examination board stamped its request "INSANE". He runs a group of Z-grade filmmakers who "shoot at video because it's 80% cheaper than film" and decides to force them to shoot his screenplay. There are some small subplots that develop some of the secondary characters, but for the most part it is the whole movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to spend 90 minutes on a Shatner art movie, see "Free Enterprise" instead, it's a much better movie.
