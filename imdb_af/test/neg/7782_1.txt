Look no further, that's the worst movie ever made. There may be others who are tied up, but there is no worse. There can't be. <br /> <br /> I found this movie on a clearance sale laser disk for $ 3.25 and thought no movie with those actors might be worth the price. It seems to be worth it to drown. As a minimum, they had to pay me to see it. <br /> <br /> I am almost certain that the girl in the package cover does not replace the girl in the movie, they have replaced someone else, someone younger and more scared, so it looks more attractive. Whatever was "plot" there was about three minutes of real movie, the rest being stuffing. And I don't mean the kind of filler you just realize is stuffing when it's over, or it's a kind of eyeball that you don't want about it, I mean filler that thinks about your shopping list. I think the music should be made by someone with a friend who had a radio that he once listened to. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> If there was a nice mountain, a river valley, a forest, anything, there would be something positive about this movie. There is no. Even with the speed button on the remote control, even at the top laser disk speed, you can't get it fast enough. <br /> <br /> After years of commenting on movie commentary, it is requested but not registered with IMDb. I finally crashed because I had to do my part to push the user rating on this stinker as far as possible. <br /> <br /> The guidelines ask you to "focus on content and context". I can not. There is not enough content to focus on, and that's exactly my point. Sometimes bad is just bad, and this movie should be much better than striving to be.
