There are spoilers, but trust me, I'll do you a favor. <br /> <br /> My friends and I love to watch crappy movies every time. Inspired by the Mystery Science Theater and our talent for terror jokes; We've found movies that are worth checking out what actually is ... not worth watching. But the trouble comes in paradise when these movies can only be found when you buy them. And I'm a solid believer not to give one cent to such a group of talented scumbags. So, like another reviewer said, movies like this are a reason why downloading movies should be legalized for free. I prefer the idea of; Instead of going straight to VIDEO, you're straight to the internet. That way, the ass bags made by this travesty will never make a profit. What you unfortunately know, they do. They hire a lot of actors who can't act, special effects from a high school classroom, rubber hoses you can get at the dollar store, constant vomiting of green jell-o, and the two main characters that seem to vary between borders jumping Mexicans speaking only Spanish, Arabic to be 100% fluent in English, random nudity, a man shot like 10 times, including one on the side of the head and life and the most delayed end in the history of film, book, cave drawings and hustler magazine. The fact that I actually predicted that the Jell-o Puking Snake Girl would actually turn into a snake in half the fear of me ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is great to make fun, but make sure there are at least 4 of you and you all spit jokes into quick fire, because if there is even one second to watch this movie where you do not laugh your ass, you will physically feeling sick. I don't kid you. My friends and I ate chicken wings and now I can't even see such a thing without reminding of this piece of Sh! T. <br /> <br /> This movie is one top Alien Vs. Hunter who is by far the second worst film ever made. And I saw very bad movies. By the way, it's the same production company as this movie and that bare man is both. Just thought you might want to know that little fun fact. -100 out of 10.
