After the lush, inspired aerial shot in rapid motion in the opening of the movie, it went to absolute boredom and a one-ton end to the end. <br /> <br /> Where to start, well, I start with the characters. I really enjoyed them in the book, here they were all types and one dimensional morons that had either "Victim" or "Asshole" on their foreheads. How someone who didn't see the shop owner Lealand Gaunt (in a hammy and out of place performance at Sydrow) is outside of me. <br /> <br /> This movie is lacking in excitement, excitement and in some sense yes, entertaining values. It has not paid off much for far too long. Why set too many annoying, fast-paced characters, and then half of them forget halfway through? In the book, everyone who went into the store met a frightful fate. Here was, besides one of the only decent scenes that translated well from the novel (the battle between Wilma and Nettie), a decay and did not have many balls. I'm sorry, but after that, one of the screens died, a boring shoot, and a few bikers and then some explosions just didn't do it for me. The cruelty and mean enthusiasm from the book was unfortunately missing. The explosion of the ecclesiastical scene was so over and poorly executed, suddenly the whole city was in a noise? It didn't make sense and characters that were not completely imported are suddenly, who are these people and why should I care? <br /> <br /> The story is everywhere in the place and nothing of the scenes had momentum. . I thought Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedeila were good actors in this, but the movie didn't give them enough dust to give me a damn. Amanda Plummer was credible but too pathetic to be really sympathetic (in the novel she was a sad and depressed character) here it was too one note. J.T. Walsh was entertaining, but the role was far from interesting or low. Too predictable. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was too classic for the material it supports. It looked like a sore thumb. Easy there friend, easy. Something that would take a little less theatrical work would have worked. <br /> <br /> I will admit that some of the gores it achieved were good enough, I think. The director looked a lot of times though. If you are going to make a movie that reaches the 2 hour point, you will have to do much more than this disaster of an adaptation of Kings' better novels. <br /> <br /> I often laughed myself at the scene. was supposed to take seriously (Ed Harris's speech at the end, or the character Hugh Priester in general), and was mostly bored and uninteresting. Personally, the director had to do so much more with this story, his approach is too tame and hides behind too much sharp cinematography to ever come out as a decent movie. The movie looks good, but not the look I think this story deserves. I mean, this man helmed ALASKA, not a good sign. <br /> <br /> I'd rather just read the book as you should, as if it were more entertaining, layered character development, horrible violence and chaos, a boring sense of humor and much more oomph. It's a slaughtered version, which doesn't have much to offer. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
