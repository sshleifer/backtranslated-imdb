This movie was on pay channels today and I had nothing to do with it. It must be the worst footballer ever made. It must be one of the worst movies. The premium service on the cable system has a rating system, and they have given 2 stars out of 4. This movie is not even half a star. Bad acting, Scott Bakula sinking as usual, Larry Miller ?? Sinbad could not act if he tried. Rob Schneider's one linen completely bumped. Fred Thompson should be ashamed that he was even in this movie. The only saving grace for this movie was the hopes of seeing Kathy Ireland's naked shower, not even close. A full waste of time and movie. If we can give a negative number, minus 9.
