The problem this movie has is the same problem the TV series had and it's the loose Stan and Jack. There is nothing wrong with dear characters, but Stan and Jack are played by actors who appear to be in their late 40s / early 50s! And there's something offensive - not to mention credibility, because they are young enough to be daughters with girls. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the bus holidays, I immediately forgot. It's basically a 30 minute episode spun up to 90 minutes with all the action taking place on a holiday camp instead of a bus station <br /> <br /> Amazingly, almost a third of voters on this site have it a 10! Come on guys, this movie doesn't earn more than 5
