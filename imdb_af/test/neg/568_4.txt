A very funny story idea with good actors, but it somehow misses. The actors are older, but no one looked very good at them. They need better makeup, photography or something. It's supposed to be a love story and yet the film had more of the rough look of a street movie. I like the movie, but I think the performances were pretty slim. That's where the weakness of the director shows. Maybe as Mrs. Spielberg mr. Spielberg ordered, it would have been a much better movie.
