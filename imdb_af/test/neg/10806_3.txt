When a movie's claim to fame is Martin Sheen's younger, lesser-known brother stars in it, you know it's not going to be a good thing. "Soultaker" is a low budget, stupid movie about a group of 20-year-olds pursued by an angel of death. It's a stupid movie, but it's pretty entertaining, and somehow a little fun in the stupidity. <br /> <br /> The plot in the movie is very small, and it is stretched as far as possible. Joe Estevez is not much of an actor, so happy for the audience, he has very few lines and his role in mostly just walking. This movie really feels like it's a horror / fantasy franchise, as it has the same plot layout as a slasher. 4 characters, each one dies at a time ... will anyone live? Who really cares. Although I seem to have hated it, I didn't do it. I just didn't like it, but I was most interested in it, so I think it counts for something. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 from ****. 90 minutes. PG-13 for language, violence and nudity.
