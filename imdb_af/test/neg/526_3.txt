I finally got a DVD copy of this production and was excited with curiosity as I read so many people who praised it on the air, especially Angela Lansbury's depiction of Mrs. Lovett. I saw the Tim Burton movie a few months ago and thought about the top and exaggerated bloody; Fortunately, this version is not so frightening, but it does suffer dramatically in many other ways to be at least satisfactory to me. <br /> <br /> To start with, the decisive. George Hearn suffices and shows at least some expression (unlike Johnny Depp's unusual wood face in the movie). Angela Lansbury is simple, annoying. She has at least enough power in her voice to convince the point as opposed to Helena Bonham Carter's pipe and expressionless girl's voice, but subtly just a word in the dictionary for me. Lansbury. One cannot be drawn into the story if one of the main characters spends her all the time and blinks in a "look, Ma, I work!" fashion and is too aware of the audience. It is not something typical of stage productions, heaven knows. For many years I have participated in many productions at the Stratford Festial and actors do NOT respond in this way (at least those who want to continue regular employment!) ... <br /> <br /> Betsy Joslyn . Oh, dear, oh dear, oh dear. Did anyone notice me that she couldn't even sing this role vaguely? And her play George Hearn's daughter is just creepy, since she was married to her at the time. Shouldn't she be a lovely sixteen year old? Yes, I realize this is what it's about, but not once did she convince me that she was any younger than thirty-five, and the phrase "mutton dressed as lamb" looks like she just created her is. Her slaughter of "Green Finch And Linnet Bird" clipped me and fixed my teeth. The song was done so well in Tim Burton's movie, and it was a sad shock. The song requires the vocal series of Julie Andrews in the 1960s and a purity of voice that is only comparable to that of a sonoprano. Any vibrato kills it and mrs. Joslyn strangled so hard all the time that I thought she was going to drop her leather down because she was so scared of bothering to keep color notes with a voice that made a Mezzo at its best. Let's show at least a quarter of the spectacle of her vibrating at least three of the higher notes. It's simply not a coloratura role and maybe a critical director should have told her - but the fact that she was married to the star probably tied the director's hands. <br /> <br /> Cris Groenendaal was sufficient, but of course already too old for the role and there is zero chemistry between him and his wife. Joslyn which makes the whole subplot fall completely flat. I am reminded of a bit of the previous stage productions of Wagner's Ring cycle, as the result of the vocal power needed for the singers to bump over the sound of a full-fledged Wagnerian band should throw them on the ground of the ability to penetrate as opposed to any appearance. or acting ability or even a good voice, therefore you have the caricature of the massive mountainous Viking horny Brunehilde with a triple chin and a beard, when the libretto is looking for an ethereal beauty that is eternally young and staggering. The casting of the "youthful" leads is exactly the same. If you close your eyes, you can almost believe in Mr. Groenendaal's Anthony, but as soon as you look at the screen, the illusion is broken. (And never can you ever believe in Mrs Joslyn's Johanna.) For me, the rest of the production was completely lost because three of the four main characters were so clearly overlooked. I can't give a proper overview of anything else because they were so distracting that they spoiled the rest of the production. I really can't understand why people are raving about this bad-shot and self-conscious filming of a stage play. Surely there is more work in the theater than just picking a camera in the front row? If I want to, I'm going to a decent play, preferably at the Stratford Festival, where they at least work together for the production and don't constantly look at the camera. I give it only three stars, because the quality of the production, besides the antics of Lansbury and Joslyn, seems adequate if it is not spectacular. <br /> <br /> Probably, the best thing one can do is buy the soundtrack of the movie and take a shot of this play, and then combine the two to make a portable whole. That's what I'm going to do and try to forget that I've ever bothered to rent this totally unbeatable production.
