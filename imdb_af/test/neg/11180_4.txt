There are so many movies where only the title tells you everything you need to know about the movie. Such a movie was I was a communist for the FBI. Another example would be that I was married to a monster from outer space. <br /> <br /> The very interesting thing about this movie is how in heaven's name it was named for an Oscar in the documentary category? It's not a documentary in any sense, it's not even in that hybrid category of docudrama. It's just a rather disturbing movie about the work of an FBI undercover agent, Matt Cvetic, who infiltrated the Communist Party in Pittsburgh and was active in persuading the Steelworker Union for the Communists and about the activities mentioned to his handlers. report the FBI. <br /> <br /> A documentary of that work could have been interesting, but what we got was a movie to match those paranoid times. I find it fascinating that when Cvetic finally broke its cover, it was for the House's Un-American Activities Committee rather than the New York trial of Communist Party leaders. There was a moment in the film where main communist James Millican told his followers to start spreading the word that the House Un American Activities Committee consisted of a bunch of right-wing yahoos who wanted to get their names in front of the camera. Now, what could have given him the idea? Anyway, just connect the dots and undoubtedly the word they came from. J. Edgar Hoover tries to give HUAC faith by having an effective shelter rather than a real trial. Small thing called it cross-examination. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers who produced was a Communist for the FBI, later produced Big Jim McLain, who played John Wayne over a HUAC investigator in Hawaii. HUAC grabbed to pay for the work done by the Honolulu PD to break a communist spy among the dock workers. But at least in John Wayne's movie, no one claimed to be a documentary. <br /> <br /> Frank Lovejoy is in the title role as Cvetic and his FBI handlers are Richard Webb and Philip Carey. Dorothy Hart plays a Pittsburgh teacher, who says there are 30 or so in the school system that indoctrinates the youngsters Ron Hagerthy, Lovejoy's son. She has a heartbreak over the Communists and Lovejoy has to save her from a murderous fate planned by his superiors. Ironically, Hart leaves the movies and goes to work for all places, the United Nations which, as we know, is often accused of being a Communist nest in the US. <br /> <br /> More than half a century later and we really have very few objective works on film or in print over the Communist Party of the USA. They were in fact a very active bunch in the labor movement. The real heroes to stop them were work organizers such as Walter Reuther in the UAW or David Dubinsky in the ILGWU. But since they were left to the left, they just didn't have the right to be suitable propaganda material. <br /> <br /> In any case, I was a Communist For the FBI is a real life-based work. character and a will for those paranoid times.
