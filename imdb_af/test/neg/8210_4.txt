"Dungeon of Harrow" had many things that could make it a good horror movie. Creepy mansion, a torture chamber, a paranoid host, a henchman, a dungeon in the dungeon, etc. But, unfortunately, to say that, it's not done very well. <br /> <br /> An author and a captain are wrecked on an island owned by a castle, his slave, and a dumb girl. The score is becoming increasingly suspicious that the two shipwrecked men are pirates (of all things) and are more likely to turn and subjugate them and torture and imprison the dumb girl they befriend. Doesn't sound bad right? <br /> <br /> Not quite. I mentioned this one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but now I hesitate. Because it has so much potential, it can't really be called "one of the worst". However, wasting all this potential is a huge hit against this movie. All in all, it's not a very good movie. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of Gothic tension scene when our hero is chained into the dungeon and is confronted by the mad and leper brown bride, adorned in a tattered wedding dress. It was both creepy and disturbing the first time I had unfolded the horror in this scene. Man I wish it was a better movie! <br /> <br /> This movie had all the right things to make it a fun late-night chiller, but eventually took all the wrong turns. I suggest someone try this one again.
