This movie suffers from the fact that Hollywood has for years had no idea how to pack Jackie Chan for the masses. His low-budget Hong Kong movies were all fast-paced kinetic thrillers emphasizing his tremendous gymnastics skills and talent for light comedy. His early Hollywood films held him in the same films packed for Stallone or Chuck Norris. There is nothing about Chan's character in this movie that requires character to be Asian, except he is the star. In his Hong Kong films, Chan is never sowing, with the movies being a fast-paced archery series to others, but "The Protector" is lifelong throughout. Danny Aiello is also not given much to work with and the lack of chemistry between the two is probably more a result of the writing and direction than the two actors got together. Both are better in worse movies. The best thing about the movie is the Hong Kong institutions. The worst part is the terrible way Jackie Chan is so colorless and dead. It won't be up to the in-Canada "Rumble in the Bronx" that the West will finally find out how to make a good Jackie Chan movie.
