I don't feel strong enough to put anything about a movie. However, it was just the worst movie I've ever seen. The performances were at best ridiculous, in the worst case they were, there is no other word, terrible. Especially the main woman who is a random sexual arrival must be seen and heard to be believed. Honestly, the plot is stupid, the dialogue terrible and the characterization ... there is none. I'm surprised it's not an Alan Smithee movie. I can't emphasize it highly enough ... avoid at all costs. How are movies like this ever made? It's not a budget movie-making at its very worst.
