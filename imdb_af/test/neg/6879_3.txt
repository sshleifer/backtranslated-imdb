I see this movie as a poor tribute to the old slasher movies. Because it really does not hold a candle to the 70's and 80's golden era of horror, it is of course where personal taste comes. <br /> <br /> This movie just falls into the "New generation of slashers" category in my book, the cast being the typical kids aged 18-24 years and potential models. I'm personally quite tired of the image in horror movies, the old movies had at least some variation in people. One or more fat people, and dorks in general. Usually people watch, of course, with some good viewers, they are always there. But if the whole throw is just a bunch of nice shelves and bumps, it gets stupid. I mean, OK yes, I like to watch HOT chicks. But not in an abomination that is supposed to reflect some ordinary people by, for example, getting a knife wheeling maniac. You expect people to be hunted to see something like any random you see on the street. I think. There are, of course, some movies with just good viewers that are perfect, but they're not many. "Wrong turn" is one example of the better. <br /> <br /> The next point is the deadly scenes that slashers are about. In this poor movie, all you see is 2-3 screens of sudden high sound / screaming and music in crescendo. And that's it. The little you see is not at all graphic, not for people who have seen horrors over the years. The old-school slashers compared to this had much more and better death, blood and gore. Not to mention the killers in that movie, which surpassed the one you'll see here. <br /> <br /> As for true horror fans, it is more fun and exciting to see horrors with new approaches due to the originality. what appears, the killer in this one doesn't add anything new and fresh to the genre. I have to agree with what someone has said before, CGI is something I hate to watch. Personally, I make the make-ups in that respect conservative (unless the CGI is really well done). But most importantly, setting a good atmosphere that allows you to get into the movie, a good background story is one very good thing. To reveal and explain too much of everything in a movie to the viewers, remove all feelings of mysticism that add much to the mood, and don't give you much to think about. Just like an example: keeping the killers' background a complete mystery to the viewer is in many cases a good move. I mean if everything about the story or the people in it has to be explained or shown in detail, then there is not much content left because the viewer should not consider it at all. It's like watching a porn movie and hoping for a wonderful story in the meantime. <br /> <br /> Why some school slashers still work, at least for some people. Is because their cult movies have emerged from the era when they were a new thing, and today it is difficult to make new ones. The exception can be for people who are naturally newer with such horrors. I noticed that many people do such horror movies, so there is of course no real taste for horror movies. <br /> <br /> But for people out there who can share my opinion; here you have a frame of reference to expect from this movie.
