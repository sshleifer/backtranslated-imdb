As a big Jim Carey fan, I have my seat in the cinema with optimism. After all, Fun With Dick and Jane seem to have all the raw materials to make this another Carey success. After the opening, five minutes of good humor seemed to provide this movie, but it went wrong as soon as the plot kicked. The idea that a charming, charismatic, top-VIP employee could suddenly get him in his nearest supermarket is just as hard to believe and then to get your head on the fact that this man has also become a master-writer is virtually impossible. The actors also seem confused with the situation. Of course, the stereotypical, rich, incessant head of the operation doesn't even bother to pull out one dimensional character, but for Carey and others around him the work is much more difficult. One day Dick is seen as a shark office pro, with possessions obsessed. The next moment he is a bumbling mess that can barely twist two words together and eventually he becomes a small thief who can make a gun in another popular. man's head. Jane is equally confused with her role and her character never really gets going. <br /> <br /> The idea behind the story is such a good one and it is a pity that this movie failed to make it work. The strange moment of aloud comedy can be found, but it is usually more physical humor than something spectacular or clever. Carey tries his best in parts to save a sinking ship, but his comic talent can never thrive in a character who has so many gaping holes to his personality. Carey shines when he is presented with a strong, brave character (The Truman Show, Ace Ventura), which this film never presented to him, despite his best efforts.
