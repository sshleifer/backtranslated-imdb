There are those who see that it is not the opera, but then they do not bump into CABARET's film, which was not the original show either. All movies of musicals / operas are and must be "adaptations" or they work. CABARET took more freedoms with the original show than PORGY AND BESS's film. Yet, it retains its original integrity, processes the material and is judged to be an artistic success. The same goes for PORGY AND BESS. It processed the opera in a dialogue / song libretto, because the public at that time had musicals, but kept away from the few truly filmed operas. It would have been economically suicide for Preminger to produce a film from the opera. It would have been a fortune for the Goldwyn Studios. <br /> <br /> It is said, this is a fine adjustment. The acting is excellent, Andre Previn's Oscar winning score is beautiful, just like the choir song, and the individual vocal achievements are incredible. Robert McFerrin (Dad of popular musician Bobby McFerrin) called Porgy and Adele Addison Bess. While Sammy Davis Jr. sung his own songs in the film, his recording contract would not allow his voice to be heard on the soundtrack album, so Cab Calloway recorded his slides (spectacularly). Brock Peters' bass / baritone is extraordinary and Pearl Bailey is her own unique self. Diahann Carroll, although a singer of fine note, has the smaller role of Clara, which required a high soprano, called old trusted Marni Nixon her song. <br /> <br /> The Gershwin Estate hates the movie and refuses the musical rights, although the dramatic rights are in the public domain. This kind of hate speech has detained the video release of CAROUSEL for nearly fifteen years (though in that case it was the dramatic rights in the litigation) and prevented both PORGY AND BESS and ANNIE GET YOUR GUN from being released on video. <br /> <br /> Of all the stage productions given in the movie versions, it's the last two to be the only slots in the video. Only a campaign of letters to the Gershwin estate in NY can detach the reserve.
