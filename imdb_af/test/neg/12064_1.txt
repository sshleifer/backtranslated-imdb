I'm a fan of slasher movies, especially from Scream 1-3, but this one is just one that kills another. To my surprise: Part II is much better and you get the whole story of part one summed up! So don't waste time on this one and go straight to Part II, you won't regret it, because Part 2 actually has a plot and is very ironic. First Part: 1 out of 10 Second Part: 4 out of 10
