Brilliant play, excellent plot, wonderful special effects! This is what I would say about this movie if I watched it with a bag of diarrhea on my head for the whole movie. Instead, I did a 2-hour crap-o-rama. Our "brilliant" story starts with a few billionaires who can do nothing better than to look in volcanoes in a vain attempt to find its happy charm. Instead, he finds a 5'4 man in a cheesy rubber dinosaur suit and some bare cave men. <br /> <br /> In his infinite wisdom (along with his infinitely large nose) he decides to enter the volcano with a team of special people. Traveling to this underground country are they going by plane? No. Boat? No. They use this giant tinplate with a "solid metal" drill at the end I swear I saw. In this summary, this movie was faster than .... Oh, that's right! It was the best movie I saw! For those of you who haven't seen it and think of a Sunday afternoon with this wonderful movie, I warn you! If you watch this movie, be prepared to cut any shit from your masculinity and give yourself a full frontal lobotomy. <br /> <br /> ECCCHHH !! The rating system only makes it possible for a minimum of 1/10. I give it a -10/10!
