OK, this movie looks pretty good through previous comments, but there are some items I want to add. The mad scientist produces a serum from the blood of a herd to make a man in a werewolf. If we suspend our unbelief, we must buy it well. But the animal in the cage is a coyote. It would make a varcoyote. Did audiences in 1942 not know what the difference between a wolf and a coyote is? They are easy to tell apart. It's weak. <br /> <br /> Secondly, this movie is covered in the third episode of MST3k (on the Comedy channel). It took Joel and the clashes several episodes to rise to the full reefing steam, and they were not quite on this one yet. They didn't add enough to this snoozer to wake you to the end, but it wasn't one of their better episodes. They never even mentioned the glittering omission of a real wolf, and that joke just hangs in the air and waits to slap.
