This very crafted film connects the unforgivable (which is ironic, given the film's theme). No one coming into this movie knows what they are coming into. Worse than that, 3/4 of the way in the movie, nobody has another idea of ​​what they are involved with, because everything up until that moment is another movie. <br /> <br /> As an advocate of the first two films of Dutcher, which has so far competed for the best 2 Mormon films (with Saints and Soldiers, and now, New York Doll - it has a show seen), Dutcher wanted to see me for a very long time. I was there. I wanted to believe I would see the next big Mormon movie, one that would keep the Numero Uno place for a long time. But no. Three-fourths in the film took the sharpest left turns and dragged me through something I never wanted to go through. He picked up the mountain. All of all moral issues, yes, both with little time or emotional ability to address them, but instead they both blow with a nod to Jesus as if it would do all right. (It is true that Jesus saved. Don't blame me for not believing.) That's not the problem of Dutcher.) Is the movie shot well? Indeed. Do the actors act? They performed their pants. Was the music appropriate? Everything except the last credits. Everything about this movie was wonderful, except the story, which was so grateful and grateful that everything else didn't matter. (I learned "thank you" from New York Doll, very decent performance, incidentally.) The third act of the movie was not desirable or pleasant, or belief confirm. I know Dutcher bent over to make it so, but I was moved so far out of the movie that nothing could bring anything back. The turbulent disbelief of dozens of details in the final minutes didn't help. Anyone who is on a mission knows what I'm talking about, especially someone who is familiar with "Spoiler Alert" about the events around someone who is timely sent for moral and / or psychological reasons of a mission. It is as if a parallel universe has suddenly sprung up where normal rules or behavior do not apply. <br /> <br /> There is a million things about this movie, but they were created and beautified just to be trampled and thrown into a knee-jerk fitness of "ooh, it'll really get them" elitism. So, unforgivable. I can only hope that next time Dutcher finishes on his next movie ("Falling"), he remembers that film critics can buy as many tickets and that it is the fans who pay the bills. Therefore, the first God's army is such an unqualified success. <br /> <br /> Dutcher's shock and awesome approach prove that the big issues are upside down and that he doesn't have spiritual or creative maturity. business sense needed to tackle it. I pray ?? Pray! ?? He learns his lesson and the years from now he and we all look back with a chagrin and rejoice that he has drawn his head where the Light does not shine and really takes success on that and other issues and changes the world forever. as a result.
