I was really disappointed with this movie. Big actors in it, and potentially a good plot, but it looks like it just looks. <br /> <br /> Charlize Theron was masterful in her role and beautiful, but it seemed as if 90% of her work was on the screen in the Austin Minis car hunt. Product placement went wrong, so much wrong. <br /> <br /> The direction was also right. Edward Norton is the bad guy and it was so obvious right from the start. Every time the camera overtakes it, it will go too long and Norton will grumble or something. Let's go, Hollywood, give us some credit! It's okay to surprise us with a plot violation without telegraphing it. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but this movie was just below average. I've always been one who appreciates the work and talent that goes into a movie, but this one just didn't.
