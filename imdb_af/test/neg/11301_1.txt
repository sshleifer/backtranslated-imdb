Hollywood has exhausted another rubbish that is considered first. Hannibal is bad, horrible, indecent, crippled, maimed, idiotic, confronted, ridiculous, and completely horrible (no pun intended). Minor spoilers follow ... <br /> <br /> This movie has big logical holes - more than any Bruckheimer / Bay movie - or for the case - any movie that illustrates Hollywood exaggeration. It's a great Hollywood production designed to run cash on Hannibal Lector mania, produced by a "hurry-he-take-this-way-too-serious" hack director, Ridley Scott, and through a hack Italian producer is made with an inflated ego whose credo is "no matter if film s ** t, money is good." <br /> <br /> I can't believe the well-known authors, Mr. David Mamet and Steven Zaillian and pretentious book by author writer Thomas Harris. David and Steven - well-known and highly talented screenwriters - wasted their efforts on a poor performance in exchange for fat payments. Another factor in the disappointment of this movie. <br /> <br /> There are too many ridiculous scenes to list that are ridiculous in clunky execution and poor logic, eg. Starling / Pazzi cellphone in the middle of Lecter pursuit that inspector Pazzi emerges as the victim. Not to mention nice bad dialogues delivered by Tony Hopkins with a smirk and Julianne Moore, Ray Liotta and others who can't act with the straight face. Hopkins gives the true meaning of "scenery-chewing" with hammy performed by Gary Oldman as a distorted psychopath bent on compelling revenge against Lecter. <br /> <br /> The gore effect is good, but only serve to hide rather than provide tension that is especially absent from Hannibal. The predecessor - the silence of the lambs - is more credible with tension and tension. Suspension is what the Silence of the Lam works as a spectacular mix of psychological horror and thriller, not to mention beautifully written and tightly directed. The "brain-meal" range is so legally fake that it borders on self-sufficiency. <br /> <br /> The end is kinda blatant and idiotic - should we believe that Lecter is still a threat to society with the last shot to establish its glittering eyeshadow? Oho, scary ... <br /> <br />
