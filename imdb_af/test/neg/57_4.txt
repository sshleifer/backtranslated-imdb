Generally, I'm not making negative comments here. But since it's a feast, I don't want you to waste your time if you see something else that might not play again. <br /> <br /> I thought the actors were pretty bad. For example, they didn't completely play each other, but they waited to recognize their lines that were pretty poor to start with. The dialogue really forced. Norman or who tried his name, or it looks as if he was biting into the lines he chose in the lines he chose, but only very briefly. <br /> <br /> After the words he asked if anyone was coming to the end and some were all "yes" and he called them all liars. Look, there were so many clues, the biggest is a briefcase full of cash for a $ 500 per hour whore. I mean John gave her at least 20g ... tell story sign. No, you couldn't see exactly what was going to happen, but by the time the turn actually took place, I didn't even care. I was just happy to get out of there. I asked him what design he shot and he said 8.1, maybe next time he'll wait to shoot at 15.3 because it needs a lot of work. <br /> <br /> But he looked like a pretty nice man, he's If he makes his own movies, he'll probably get better and I hope he does, not in a sneaky way, I mean, I wish him good luck. Just remember, it's just my opinion.
