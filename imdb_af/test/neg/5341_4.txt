"Black Friday" made this plot so much better, so it's remembered and "The Man With Two Lives" is just a forgotten pot boiler. "Shed No Tears" was this working title and it would have been better because he was a very evil character for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Philip Bennett is new to getting involved in a traffic accident. Dr. Clark (Edward Keene) was involved in some experimental animal operations - bringing them back from death. His colleagues asked him to try his operation on Phillip, who died. While working, a dangerous criminal, Wolf Panino, goes to the electric chair and trans-migration of the soul takes place. When Phillip wakes up from the operation, he has the soul of Panino. He's a changed person, he's rude to his family and starts to hang Panino's old haunts. He takes Wolf's old gang over - under the name of Philip Bennett, he also has the earlier friend of romance Wolf - who smells like a mess. Bennett, like Wolf, is determined to pick up his scores and start eliminating his enemies. Biedjies, including the girl and a policeman, start their own family to fall victims. <br /> <br /> But - I hate those "bad dreams" movies - you always feel lowered. This movie would have been better if he stayed in character as Panino and had a final shoot. Eleanor, his fiancee, would have been worse, but wiser with his brother. <br /> <br /> The star Edward Norris mostly had a great career in B movies. <br /> <br /> Not really recommended.
