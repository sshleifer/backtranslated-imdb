Larry Clark is not known for his talents as a writer or director, but undoubtedly made important films. Children, Bully, and to a lesser extent Ken Park all achieve their intended purpose: shock, aversion, and even horror. These films are compromises in their content and use their controversial nature to uncover very serious problems in modern youth. Children exposed us to the spread of A.I.D.S. and sexual promiscuity among the boys. Bully has similar problems. Ken Park treated somewhat ham-handedly with sexual abuse and suburban ennui. Amazingly, all these movies have revealed something terrible and a bad taste in your mouth. <br /> <br /> Wassup Rockers is about a group of poor Spanish skateboarders from South Central Las Angeles who randomly go to Beverly Hills. to skate. This is it. <br /> <br /> Wassup Rockers is nothing. <br /> <br /> It has no substance. It has an essentially non-existent story. And, like Kids, it has a movie of the first time actors drawn from the movie environment. But, unlike Kids, none of them has a sense of talent. There is better performance in porn. This film is undoubtedly the most horrible performance I have ever seen in a feature film. One can respect Larry Clark to expose these young men to the movie process, but these kids are absolutely worthy of people. Perhaps I add that these men also created the soundtrack. It contains some of the most dismally unknown garage punk you will ever hear. My advice is to pop a few migraine pills before entering the theater, or you'll regret it. then. <br /> <br /> But then it's not as if they've had much of a script to work with. Every line spoken is a faced, pathetic, and annoying over all measure. The story itself is ridiculous. It starts pretty enough, but quickly slips into unprecedented absurdity. Of course, it starts with a voluptuous sex skate with some rich white girls, followed by a series of clich√© National Lamponic encounters, characters are destroyed without cause and eventually a ridiculous anti-climax. Shots go much longer than they need. Be prepared to watch people from skateboards fall for about fifteen minutes straight, oblong shots of characters who do nothing or skateboarding streets. But then, with the writing on a scarce 32 pages, they need as much useless as possible. Maybe Wassup Rockers would have worked better than a short movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I can go on like that. This is Larry Clark's worst movie yet. For those of you interested in seeing a Clark movie if it's just for his shocking pederast antique, look elsewhere. It is by far the funniest movie he has ever made, and that is also the worst. It's flat out awful. Like Uwe Boll, terrible. Definitely the worst I saw at the festival. <br /> <br /> 1/10
