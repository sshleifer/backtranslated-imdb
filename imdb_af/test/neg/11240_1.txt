I just gave a 10 for thief highway, I call it two reasons to prove I'm not a git that only gives bad reviews, but 2 because the theme of the movie has the same thread, namely to fall in love on a woman of the night. <br /> <br /> We all know well. Woman is a chick flag, but you can't avoid them all, they will eventually get you. Pretty Woman For Me Do Two Things, Two Terrible Terrible Things. First, prostitution appears as a career similar to that of a dancer. You know with absolutely good friends, the leg warms very giggling, borrowing each one's loan. You see in the reality of Pretty Woman the prostitute and it is a street walker. A prostitute we are talking about here has a good life, she is healthy happy with only the opportunity to explain her predicament. My feeling is that this happy Hooker type of protagonist is much more palatable than an even almost realistic character that asks me if you are making a movie about a person, but is too chicken, afraid to decorate that player with the features known to that role, why do it? If I make a movie about a chef, but don't want him to cook or talk about food or wearing a white hat, why first make a movie about a chef? By pulling out the hooker and making the hooker into a respectable dancer, the story misses the point altogether and, as a result, he never gives the moral or social questions he can have, which a policeman really is really paralyzing. <br /> <br /> Secondly, "Pretty Woman" insults romance itself, Edward Lewis played by Richard Gere has no idea how to seduce this "lady", it's without his plastic friend, you shouldn't leave without the house no. This, especially if you are a moron in a suit that has no imagination. 8 out of 10 of his romantic moments involve strenuous money in one way or another, even when he first meets her, it is the Lotus Esprit turbo that does all the work, necklaces here diamonds there limousines, money is money, where is the charm? Where's the charisma, don't call that piano. <br /> <br /> Girls who love this movie will also be girls who want to shop more. Children who like this movie will not even notice that the old Eddy has less charm than a calculator, as it is probably not so used to. Most importantly, anyone who likes this movie will hate "Thieves Highway" a wonderful story of what part is based on the same topic. <br /> <br /> I end up with a song: <br /> <br /> Pretty Woman hangin the street Pretty woman, the kind I like to treat Pretty woman, I don't believe you You're not the truth Nobody can spend as much as your mercy. <br /> <br /> Beautiful woman, Don't want to forgive me Beautiful woman, I can't help but see beautiful woman, and you look beautiful as you can, you have a lack of imagination, just like me . Pretty Woman, shop a while. Beautiful woman, speaks while while Pretty Woman, sells you smile to me. Beautiful woman, yes, yes. Pretty woman, look my way. Beautiful woman, say you will stay with me. And I'll pay you. I'll treat you right.
