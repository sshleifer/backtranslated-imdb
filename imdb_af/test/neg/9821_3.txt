The book gets 10 out of 10 stars ... <br /> <br /> SATISFIED SPOILERS OF THE BOOK AND THE MOVIE !!! <br /> <br /> If you've never read Geoffrey Household's Rogue Male, the source material for Man Hunt, you'll probably enjoy Fritz Lang's treatment of the story. On the other hand, if you are in my camp and the book is almost memorized, the movie will be a cracked disappointment. I'm assuming you've already read a summary of the story, and continue with my complaints. Housekeeping's little novel is one of the all-time great stress classics, stiff and savvy, with just a bare handful of characters driving the action. Fritz Lang and his author, Dudley Nichols, feel the need to throw in the protagonist's brother and a sympathetic floozy. The latter reduces the depth of the story by injecting an extrinsic motivation into the script where the novel does not need anything. In fact, the true climax of the book was not the nameless narrator's escape from his underground army, but rather his self-acceptance of his true motive to go first and foremost on his hunt. And that's another thing: if David Fincher and Quentin Tarantino can get us all through Fight Club and Kill Bill 1 without announcing the names of their respective protagonists, why can't Lang? "Thorndyke?" What hat did they pull out? Bringing me to my worst complaint: Domestic hunter is so typical British, he'll bleed a Union Jack if you cut him. But Walter Pigeon, who plays him, is Canadian! He can barely support the accent, which is only slightly deeper and more convincing that Kevin Costner is in Robin Hood. He looked right in the role and was a good actor for the 1940s, but as Rogue Male's reluctant hero? Let's look at the Sceptered Isle itself for a more convincing version. Repeat with subtlety and with, please! Will I free of charge?
