This movie is Hilarious, what is better than watching two creatures fight each other? GIANT cgi versions of these animals are fighting! However, I need one of the guns used in the movie. Because they apparently use fraud. Count the number of shots they use before they have to ... o wait it's right, they never have to load again. Regardless of the shots counting ... it's hilarious. <br /> <br /> The sound effects used in the film range from a tiger to an elephant. Oh, and did I forget to mention that this GIANT Komodo dragon apparently is stealthy than hell? Because somehow, even when the actors look in the direction where the animal comes from, they are surprised when it occurs. <br /> <br /> When someone dies, you can tell his arrival because they all support it, they put their arms up in the air and cross them to save themselves ... it never works. <br /> <br /> The final jewel is that these writers' brain is just a gland full of knowledge. With "facts" as both of these creatures are amphibious to comment on "helpless animals", they are just full of fun facts.
