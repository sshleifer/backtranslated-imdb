Back to Frogtown was a hard movie to find. Well, I got that mission and it put on the shelf for a good time. Wish it was so held! First of all, Sam Hel is of course not Roddy Piper. He is being replaced by a man with a big face, less charisma, and this poor actor is very gentle on the part! Sam Hell is supposed to be rebellious and awesome. Here he is caught THREE times! What kind of a hero is it? Spangle is also replaced here by another actress. Why didn't we find different characters here? It was stupid! Lou Ferrigno stars in this movie and he is not even the hero. Common sense says Lou is the hero of the movie! Bad effects, poor acting, and just a forgotten movie. Funny as they shoot at Ninja Turtles 2 with the whole concert scene in this movie. At least Ninja Turtles 2 was funny and not a bad movie! I really wanted to return to Frogtown, but I just clipped when the combat scenes would begin. This movie makes Turtles 3 like gold! Avoid it or you'll be the one song "Wiser, greener, talk turtle TV dinner!"
