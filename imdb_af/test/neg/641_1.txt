"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, look at these strangers. They are like - bite people and things! Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! <br /> <br /> It must be among the worst movies of all time. It is absolutely brave for anyone with a brain image. , you have the judges on the payroll who give glowing reviews and decide highly for this horror, but it's easy to know who these sales outs are, their reviews are too good to give a movie like this, even ' A mediocre review claiming a B-movie remedial appeal would be a glowing review! <br /> <br /> But that's enough. <br /> <br /> This movie is over All the bad features that a movie can have without being so bad that it's nice to just laugh The old Japanese 60's monster movies have a quality that this movie lacks - at least in the 60's movies you can just laugh at how bad the rubber monster pack looks, or laugh at seeing the strings showing the space ships like how the models threw on the strings and how the flames UPWARDS bent out of the back. Those movies made fun of how BAD they were. Alien Express (aka Dead Rail) actually looks like a good movie by itself - which makes it incredibly absurd. <br /> <br /> The effects were terrific according to today's standards. Except terrible. However, not as bad as the 60's monster movies, so they lacked the comic appeal. The plot and dialogue were about as social as I have ever seen, which made it even worse with every prediction than you would expect. I won't even point out the plot and logical holes in this one; it would not be fair for this spicy plot (plus it will take a long time to start). Most of the acting was terrible; Lou Diamond Phillips had to be very desperate to achieve this. <br /> <br /> SciFi Channel is rapidly becoming the "cheap excitement channel", delivering movie to movie without a iota of concept or intelligence in the lot. I can only wonder - why save? <br /> <br /> Don't save with these tripe. It doesn't get any worse.
