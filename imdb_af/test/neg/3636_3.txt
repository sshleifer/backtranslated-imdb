The only time I ever actually laugh while watching this show is when I like it. Jamie Lynn Spears just got the acting job because of her big sister, and I don't think anyone can argue with me. There is NO expression in her face (even when she smiles) - just look at the show and you will see what I mean. Let's talk about the show now. Zoey 101 is one of the most unrealistic shows I've ever seen! As many people have said, Zoey Brooks is absolutely perfect: everyone loves her, she is a straight student, and all the boys think she is "warm". PCA is a hostel full of rich children who give all their students flat screen TVs and laptops, serving children's sushi from the sushi bar. In one of the latest episodes, Zoey is completely clueless and thinks Chase is not in love with her and acts like she doesn't want Chase to love her. Then, when she hits Chase's dormitory to prove her friends wrong, she finds Chase kissing this girl named Rebecca. Zoey, of course, freaks out, probably because she likes Chase's attention. Anyway, just look at this show if you have nothing else to do and the only thing on television is Zoey 101. At least you can have fun laughing at how unrealistic it is!
