I had no idea what these movies were about, it jumped from plot line to plot line, banning inconsiderate ideas. it just doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> The cut timeline doesn't help either. We start today to get a flash back to the past and then return to the future just to go back in the past. <br /> <br /> This movie is also filled with terribly juicy lines and cliché themes like princess and the pauper, "you can't even line me in my death," you didn't even love me "line. cliché to the maximum! <br /> <br /> Battlefield was terribly grainy, lighting was constantly misplaced which set the CG off with the actors. (Meanning you can tell the backgrounds were clearly CG). <br /> <br /> Although the moon in this moon was very interesting. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone, avoid as possible. <br /> <br /> This comment is difficult to follow. The movie will be just as bad.
