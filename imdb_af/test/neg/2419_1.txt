If the directors / producers / publishers want to promote a movie than "based on real-life events" and create a movie that is meant to inspire and have meaning to start retaining any kind of creditworthiness and integrity, you want to keep a movie as honest as you can. <br /> <br /> A team wearing a whole black sprinter and doing the haka in America is just stupid. Any semi-intelligent person will know that the All Blacks are the New Zealand National Rugby Union team and their jumpers are all black and the Haka is performed by them as part of a traditional Maori dance. <br /> <br /> With such folly in a movie, without explanation, the credibility of the movie diminishes and denies the message and inspiration the film is trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> The question is "Why"? Why would you do such a stupid thing and for what possible profit? <br /> <br /> I can only conclude that the authors or directors or producers saw it on TV before an international rugby union game and thought "wow, it would be great in our movie, no one will know that never happened, they are too stupid to know about NZ and the whole black, it would be great. "How would an American audience respond to a film made in NZ about Americain grid iron, with" a team wearing American Indian costumes and warfare, doing a native American Indian war dance, running in circles screaming: "Oh woo woo woo, oh woo woo woo" responding? They're going to knock off their heads! <br /> <br /> The people who made this movie and the industry that made it really should read their heads. For some reason, the industry thinks they can deceive all the people all the time. <br /> <br /> It's not stupid!
