I watched this movie and got more bored with the foolish plot going nowhere, then suddenly the story took a surreal turn for the worst and played an actor himself. Oh how I threw. Because it's so funny, isn't it? We know Julia Roberts plays the character of Tess, and here they are in the movie the joke that looks like Tess's character like Julia Roberts. Julia therefore plays someone who portrays Julia. How good she does, we'll never know, because 99.999% of the audience doesn't really know Julia Roberts personally (and read about her in Hello magazine doesn't count). <br /> <br /> And then Bruce Willis appears! Apparently he is Julia Roberts's best friend. Well, he's in the movie ... how will I know if Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts know each other? I'm not at least interested in the personal life of actors - I just pay my money and expect them to do the work they need to pay. Anyway, they start the jokes in the movie where Willis (rather convincingly) plays a psychiatrist ... the one with the little child ... ... you know the one? I didn't, I forgot what it was called. Willis even commented on how well that film was at the box - no matter how modest you were. Willis! <br /> <br /> The problem is that these scenes are not only meaningful and terribly self-sufficient, it also reminds us, the viewers, that we only watch a lot of actors and pay huge amounts of money for very little effort . You see, if I see a movie, I want to stop unbelief and forget that I'm watching actress - I want to believe in the story I see. If you start to pull off the scenery, mid-movie, you just ruin the illusion. <br /> <br /> You know that a TV series jumped the shark when it started to introduce celebrities, play themselves (get up and is counted The Simpsons, backup, etc.), but it is the first time I've seen a movie jumping the shark. I usually stay off such movies (eg Scary Movie, The Naked Gun, etc.). The problem is, I honestly never thought the Ocean's 11 movies would go in this direction. What a shame. <br /> <br /> So with the suspension of unbelief the window threw, and the plot now weakening in the movie then breaks the worst joke of everyone on the audience - the heist has actually returned to the story , and the last 90 minutes or so of the movie was pointless. Yes, that's right: Steven Soderwhatsit and his actors all stand up, show us the audience, and say, "Ha haaa ... you had everything ... thank you for your money!". Then they give us the single finger salute. <br /> <br /> Right, back to you. I actually didn't pay to see this movie ... I didn't download the DVD for anything. How about their apples? Now it's a plot turn.
