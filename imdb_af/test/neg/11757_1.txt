Yes why? Among the filmmakers who came out in the 80's and 90's Gus Van Sant is one of my idols. There are others, some. Steven Sodebergh, PT Anderson, Tim Hunter, Danny Boyle, Martin Donovan, Harmony Korine, Wes Anderson. Idiosyncratic, sometimes uncompromising, but consistent, surprising, unpredictable. Their names let me turn on the TV, go to a video store or even buy a ticket and go to a movie theater. However, Sant's "Psycho" gives me a break. Why? I wonder. A shot by the shot massacre of one of the perennial classics. The color was shrinking, the performances, horror. What was Vince Vaughn doing? Was it a parody? A bad joke? What was hell? Anne Heche as Janet Leigh? Who dressed her? Viggo Mortensen with a cowboy hat. Viggo is an excellent actor, but in this case he can't forget John Gavin and if Julianne Moore was introduced to the world by this show, there wasn't "The Hours" for her, The Minutes. So, here I am, bad, with the work of one of my idols. The crashing question remains: Why, Mr. From Sant? Maybe, in the words of President Clinton, because he could. I'm afraid it's no excuse.
