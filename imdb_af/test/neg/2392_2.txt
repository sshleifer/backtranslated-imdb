A good idea dropped by heavy-handed production. <br /> <br /> Much of the dialogue was incomprehensible because of the level of music / background sound, and it didn't help this reviewer. Also, the Welsh accent, sometimes impenetrable. By the end I lost the will to try to follow the dialogue. <br /> <br /> This movie didn't know if it was a farce or a black comedy - and they needed different approaches. Some of the incidents are so thick that they just deserve a grumble, some were so incredible, even for this kind of plot that they just didn't make the story worthwhile. <br /> <br /> The play was in the lead - although the American was just like a clone of the "Back to the Future" mad scientist. The little boy was very good. <br /> <br /> I totally watched it, but God knows why: I can't even remember laughing.
