Every time a movie plays a dwarf or a miniature in a prominent role, the chance is 10 to 1 that the director threw him because he didn't know what to do to keep the movie interesting. In this case, the leading little man is not that bad - he manages his dignity for most of his scenes (except the part where he tows the front man in the stairs of the dungeon), but the film itself uses it as a doggie chew toys. <br /> <br /> The problem here is common with low budget exploitation movies - there's a glow of a decent idea here, but the director and the screenwriter don't know how to develop it. A good director will take the different story elements: brain transplants, crazy doctors with secret labs and a dungeon, car hunters, fist fights, dull raging Frankenstein style assistant, mind control, betrayal and conspiracy. exciting, with movie full of cheap tension and fun. <br /> <br /> Instead, what we get here is a lot of people rushing around and arguing in the doctor's lab. A cheesy operation where the patient blooms tempura paints, followed by some of the same people who stumble and argue in the doctor's lab, followed by another subgroup of the initial group driving and crashing. followed by a dungeon escape scene that was mostly about a woman to put her shoes back on, followed by a movie rally, followed by a confusing series of events where everyone in the movie apparently everyone escapes, followed by a beautiful walk in the countryside where everyone either chases, attacks or escapes from everyone else, behind, followed by, well, not much else. <br /> <br /> Somewhere in this is a scary peroxide blonde dressed in white, a very meaningful heroic type that looks like a shiny beautiful look, a three foot lab assistant, a big lick with a mass of molten rubber pasted on one side of his face, a child wondering in the middle of the movie to provide more of the frankenstein factor, a brunette who falls in love with the hero and the crazy doctor himself, who must be the happiest man in the history of evil super-villains, because nothing goes according to his plan, but things work out for him anyway ... and because he remembered to put an electrode in the transplanted brain at one point in the operation like. <br /> <br /> It was by no means the worst movie I saw, or even the worst mining film I saw, or even the worst mining film I saw, but it was just there, which made cheapness and inattention Applied at every point and there is no real reason for even bad movie lovers to see it.
