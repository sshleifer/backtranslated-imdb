The other reviewer was completely correct about this one. The writing was terrible, the acting was terrible, the subject was terrible. The actors looked as if they were not really in the movie, as they were almost there. There were some unique camera effects, but they weren't really gorgeous for the story (or what about a story), and they weren't very well produced. <br /> <br /> I think they've been trying to improve the success of other eschatologically influenced movies (Omega code behind). And yes, it makes Christians embarrassed when these types of films are produced. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, especially a non-Christian.
