Well, your hippies are probably wondering what I have against an "education" and "insightful" show like "Barney"? Well, I hate much about it for these reasons: <br /> <br /> 1. It teaches that a personality and individualism are immoral. No one at the show has a personality. Everyone's dress looked right, spoke right, acted right and dancing. Even in the episode called an individual, children try to tell Barney what they want and everyone on the planet should do what I want. Want to teach your child that an individual is wrong? <br /> <br /> 2. "A stranger is a friend you did not meet" section. Although the shoulders of the shoulders are seemingly harmless, it can also be extremely dangerous for young children. In fact, several young Barney lovers from across the US have become victims of pedophiles, using the show's friendly message to lure children away from their parents. The episode has since been pulled, but the damage has been done. So-called "innocent" programming errors, like this one, clearly show why parents should watch television with their children. <br /> <br /> 3. If you're not always happy, you're a bad person. No one seems to show any other emotion, but luck, no matter what situation they are. If the child's parents are angry or sad for some reason, the child may think of Mum or Dad otherwise. Not a good message. <br /> <br /> 4. Get rid of everything! Looks like every problem is solved by magic. At least in shows like "Fraggle Rock", we learn that magic can jump back at best to solve problems on your own. Does Barney Teach It? NO, of course not. There must be magic. And the problem is that many two-year-olds can't tell fantasy of reality and may think their parents, brothers and sisters can use magic to solve everything, but get confused when they can't use magic and think they're strange . Another boner pulled again. <br /> <br /> 5. Barney makes no distinction between stealing and sharing. He even specifically said "stealing is good if the person you steal doesn't mind". Children can learn that if you really want something, it steals a perfectly acceptable way to get it. This is not something that preschool educators need to tell authority figures. <br /> <br /> 6. "If I just have the right thing, I can solve all my problems." When the kids have a problem, Barney gives them everything they need to fix it. The message sent here is, "Don't try to solve it! It's too much work, and the solution probably won't work. Just use this." As a result, children can stop thinking about things (Barney said it is too much work) and depends on the "real" object. (The real shoes, the right food, the right computer, the right exercise machine ...) Of course, this is a good message for the Barney marketers, but it is not good for toddlers. <br /> <br /> 7. The message of fraud is good. In another episode, the kids are involved in a game of carrying a peanut on a spoon without dropping it. One child puts peanut butter on his spoon and wins easily. The child is then rewarded for his creative thinking, when the child has indeed bowed the rules and changed the game so that he could win. It teaches that falsehood is good, you win and people think you're creative. When you are in real life, you will often be disqualified, or worse, and severely harmed by other competitors who have played through the rules. <br /> <br /> 8. Do the children in this show eat anything other than cakes, cookies and candy? It teaches that it is good to eat tons of spilled food and avoid healthy food, despite Barney's so-called "Health Food" song. Other than that, everyone in the show eats junk food. No wonder there are so many obese children in America and Europe. <br /> <br /> And finally ... <br /> <br /> Most other kids' television shows teach creative problem solving without resorting to "magic". Barney could have done so, but decided to use the method A was the best for the marketers and B) had the least time and money for scripts. It's a blatant sale that shows how little the Lyons group actually cares for kids. <br /> <br /> It's all about me.
