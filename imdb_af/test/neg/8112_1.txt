The first word I can find to describe this movie is Awful. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. First, the plot is a very thin plot (No more comment on this section) and a plot that follows many movies from this genre. This makes the movie so bad, because you know what's going to happen. Secondly, the movie contains many questions that are never revealed. One of the questions (and it's not a spoiler) is: WHAT IS THE HELL THE CHILDREN DO IN THE CEREAN !!!!!!!!!! Thirdly, the characters are very bad, not only because the movie is bad, but also because of the sorry actors. They are bad as they can be. <br /> <br /> The last thing that makes this movie bad is that it is a horror movie. You must be afraid of the murder or the sudden shocks, but you are not afraid, you are not scared because you know what is going to happen. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: The movie is as bad as the movie about the killer ants! I was hoping it was a very good movie, but because the story is bad, the actors are bad, the movie has many questions and because it is not terrible, the film is the best unseen.
