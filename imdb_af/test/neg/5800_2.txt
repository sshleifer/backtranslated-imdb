This movie has NO plot. It was supposed to be that a guy goes with his grandmother, and everyone thinks he's a loser and he has to leave himself. but what happens after everyone finds out who he lives in? they have a big pot party at Grandma's house. the climax of the film did not even relate to the rest. that whole plot was launched within minutes of the end of the movie. I can see how it relates to the supposed story - that Grandma's VG skills are releasing him - but it just wasn't there. <br /> <br /> However, the movie was funny like hell and clearly relied on the jokes. <br /> <br /> "Her vagina smells like the big depression." "He just sucked his first titty ... yes for 13 hours." "It's for you ... I think it's the devil"
