Whoa. I mean who. I mean, whoa whoa. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie, returning when I was eight. In 1996, CGI films were a rarity; and goods even more so. Also, then we listened to CD players. But I deviated. I was earlier from this movie like this, and until it is looked at again, I really liked good memories. Hey, it's Don Bluth! Anyone who hates "All Dogs Go to Heaven" is clearly a robot. But I stop again. <br /> <br /> Then I saw it again. It's really not one of its best, I can say eleven years later. I saw a lot more movies, and I got a little more knowledge. Now, sure, the tuner is good, I'll give it. Story says ... okay. I mean, we see it all the time. VERY. But it works. The musical numbers are what I am irritating. It would have been more at home in the 1980s, with this kind of music numbers. In '96, most children's movies had epic numbers, such as the Lion King (which appeared a year or older, but whatever) or such things. Here you get a show, vaudeville style. <br /> <br /> The animation kind of hurt too. With temporary brackets, and with other completely changing styles and styles with a shot changing, it's really hard not to notice. <br /> <br /> I still like "All Dogs Go to Heaven, but it could have been waaay better. <br /> <br /> 4/10
