Targeted teenagers in summer break in a small Ohio city cannot find meaningful ways to fill their time. Some consider driving to Chicago; Others are happy to drink and bully their peers. In a random action of arrogance with alcohol, the bulls touched a homeless man and stole a strange book. The handwritten text appears from archaic proverbs designed to evoke demonic powers. A night or two later, one of them reads a promise and is quickly owned. He becomes an evil murderer and begins to silence his former counterparts. <br /> <br /> "Demon Summer" is an amateur production with a microscopic budget. The production values ​​are low, but the filmmakers were clever enough not to be ambitious. Little in the way of special props or shooting places was needed. The acting is particularly poor and there is virtually nothing original in the screenplay. On the positive side, the special make-up effects are surprisingly good by low budget film standards. Despite this, the gore is minimal. Aside from makeup effects, there is little going for this movie, even for the hard-core Gore-Hounds. Not recommended.
