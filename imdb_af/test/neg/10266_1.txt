Please, why, on earth, was Bava offended by injury that made this pathetic piece follow up? <br /> <br /> To begin with, the viewers at home are treated to a story of an unknown thing -bat telling us about the aftermath of the previous episode that man's victory over Demons indicate, (right). <br /> <br /> Now I can tell you that this is not what-so anyway. Everyone has nothing to do with Demons, because it is a completely new story with a different background. Bava as usual, makes a random appearance that doesn't fit in the main context of the story. Acting in this one which is quite awful and the whole concept of the demons appearing on a television set, oh God, I will not continue. Look for yourself. <br /> <br /> As usual, you'll be treated to ridiculous dubbing, crap non-sense scenarios and especially non-answering questions. How typical of a successor who bought the first pack. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you are one of the DVD Argentophile collectors, then you might want to, otherwise you avoid the plague.
