"Tank Girl" was, I think, meant to be the "90s Buckaroo Banzai" and was marketed as such. Although the equation is appropriate; both movies have so many things going on in a given frame of film that is as impossible as the story is to sort out, it is certainly not boring. <br /> <br /> "Tank Girl" is a fun ride if you switch off your brain before the movie starts. Otherwise you will end up with a skull-like headache as I do.
