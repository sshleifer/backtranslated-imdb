I don't mean to sound pretentious here, but to call the next cult classic is another example of lowering standards that filmmakers have for themselves. This movie is a violation of everything we keep sacred and not in the good "artificial" way of offending. This film becomes the archetype for PAINFUL dialogue, which is delivered by even more pathetic actors.
