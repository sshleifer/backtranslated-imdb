If it wasn't for changing swear words and an excess blur if one character gave another finger, it would be easy to miss this low budget snoozer for a Sci-Fi channel pilot. The plot of government's efforts to destroy a group of telekinetics, originally trained as military weapons, ends unequivocally with the hero, gifted himself, in pursuit of a telekinetic survivor bent on revenge. Unfortunately, the movie is talky, boring, predictable and even without interesting special effects. Supreme Court Louis Gossett, Jr. has a small role as the evil government office that comes from the program and now wants to eliminate all traces. He walked through the part and it is difficult to understand why he was bothered. Other cast members do a decent job with a script that requires little.
