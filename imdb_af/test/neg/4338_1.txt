Do not pay attention to the ravic reviews of this movie here. This is the worst Van Damme movie and one of the worst of any kind I've ever seen. It will appeal to someone with no depth that requires nothing more than entertaining firearms and explosions. <br /> <br /> As directed by Peter Hyams, it made me realize that Peter doesn't have talent as a director. , but is very good at filming explosions and the like. However, movies also need other elements; for example, a story. This one didn't have one. This may be the horror of some of Mr. Hyams's recent films, barely better than this, really declared. <br /> <br /> One can't help wondering how some people were ever sitting behind a camera.
