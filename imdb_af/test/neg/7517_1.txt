This movie is a shame. How to use one of the greatest science fiction stories of all time and turn it into a kind of half-hearted love story. The whole beginning of the movie was not in the H.G. Wells story not and doesn't have to be. The Eloi were also completely wrong. They built houses or formed any kind of real society. They didn't care about each other at all. It was an important part of the story. The way they formed a world without suffering or complex emotions. They were barely even aware of the Morlocks. I don't know why this movie was made as it was, but some stories have to be told as they are or left alone.
