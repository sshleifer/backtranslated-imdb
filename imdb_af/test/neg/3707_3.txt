Bill Rebane's "The Capture of Bigfoot" is one of the scary horror movies ever made. A greedy sawmill owner Harvey Olsen (Richard Kennedy) decides he wants to take up Bigfoot at all costs. But local ranger Dave Garrett (Stafford Morgan) learns that the Bigfoot was at peace with a geological expedition, and expands the creatures to protect. There is nothing even in this piece of crap at stake. The film is extremely boring and filled with horrible songs and cheap special effects. No. Gore, no tension, just gigantic boredom. Execute this terrible litter like the plague.
