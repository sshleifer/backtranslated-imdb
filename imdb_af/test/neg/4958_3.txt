I saw a lot of horror, puff, monster movies in my life. And of course, many 50's and 60's monster movies. When I first stumbled upon this one, I thought it was from the 60's until I admitted it was from 2007. <br /> <br /> In fact, the character of Jack Brook is interesting and the acting is all for a spicy movie. good, but .... I expected a flattering movie and not a drama about an aggressive plumber. The movie runs 80 Mminutes and I think the first murder is after 65 minutes. Although it takes hours to explain the story, the reason why the monsters come from is at least 3 minutes ... the another 20 minutes of boring dialogue and finally a, I think, not well-managed splash. Although we have starred Robert Englund here, I only recommend this one to real hardcore horror fans.
