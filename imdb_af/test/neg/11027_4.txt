Carole Lombard and James Stewart gamely try to inject a life and meaning into this bizarre constructed film about the tribulation of a newly married couple. The screens play as if they were separated by different directors, each with a different purpose. Some are Capra-cute, some screwball, some melodramatic, and some surprisingly noir. There is even an extensive adventure sequence, when the plot suddenly focuses on a small plane flying through a snowboard. It's hard to say which scenes are the most uncomfortable, if the movie as a whole is so volatile in tone and the storyline isn't exactly credible. Only worth watching for film students or actors - some smaller parts, such as Judge Doolittle and the fearless pilot, are also very well played.
