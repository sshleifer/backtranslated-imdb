Whoever thought they should have a Iron Eagle successor should be shot. In this case, once was enough. Iron Eagle was a great movie to watch. Although it is unrealistic, it is still entertaining. Iron Eagle II has a senseless plot and can be used as a cure for insomnia. I didn't even watch Iron Eagle III, but looking at the R rating, I assume it's more violent than the last 2 movies. Well, Iron Eagle IV is probably the most unfinished successor. Lou Gossett Jr returns as the always delicious "Chappy" Sinclair. Another Jason returns to fill the role of Doug Masters (Canadian Jason Cadieux, like Jason Gedrick of the first Iron Eagle). But wait (here comes a possible spoiler) ..... Wasn't Doug dead in Iron Eagle II? The writers must be desperate for a story so that they revived Doug Masters by saying he was a prisoner of the Russians. This movie was the cheapest of all Iron Eagle movies. Why do filmmakers need to make prosecutions for unattractive movies? (eg Police Academy films). I've always liked Gossett Jr's work in these movies. He was the only one to keep this turkey together. Let's hope this was the last of the Iron Eagle sequels. let it rest in peace.
