I have never seen a movie that irritated me so much. It's a movie about stupid people doing stupid and horrible things. It's not a funny movie. I must say that the plot line is terrible. I didn't have the patience to see it so I only saw half, but it was enough for me. The characters are not very inspired. Just terribly annoying. This movie is about a good-natured man who tries to join his tyranny boss's daughter. When he finally speaks to her, she asks him to go to her home at night to see her father's owl and he thinks she has invited him to join her for a party and at her home at 18:00. to be. He is very disappointed and finds out that he has to look after the owl and that she has a boyfriend. After her father left home to give precise orders, care for the home and his beloved bird, a secretary, apostate son and all sorts of NON-funny things appeared in the house. But he eventually ends up with his boss's daughter. Trust me this movie is terrible !!!!!!!!!!!!
