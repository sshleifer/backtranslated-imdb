Owen (David Krumholtz) and Chloe (Denise Richards) are a young couple living in Manhattan. Owen is a moderately successful magazine writer while Chloe is an aspiring actress. Luckily for her, Chloe gets big on a sitcom and moves temporarily to Hollywood. Missing her, Owen books a flight to LaLa Land, as a surprise. However, when he arrives at her setwa, the "house" shakes, because Chloe and her brave star-star have a bit of a romantic try. The author and the actress are through. Bad and evil like a hatred, Owen goes back to NYC. Sympathetic friends decide on a blind date with Nadine (Milla Jovovich) to get him out of his swimming funk. But it's bad like the duo mix like oil and water, mainly because of everyone who has a strong personality and Owen's big shoulder chip. Yet, over the next few months, Nadine and Owen are surprised, pals, who trust and hang out. Can it change into something more? Well, who is the mind that cares! This movie is so foolish that most people will get out of the DVD player after the first ten minutes. The writing is pathetic, gloomy, and, oh, stupid too. Then again Krumholtz also gives a very unpleasant and offensive performance. Jovovich is not much better, but who can look good with the lines she needs to spray? William Baldwin also achieved a lower career with his coarse and sex-crazy role as Owen's brother. The only cast member who is any good is Richards, but she must ring when she looks back at this one. Well, the costumes and production values ​​are sufficient. Then there is also ONE smart element to it. The characters will sometimes speak their lines, but cartoon bubbles will appear above their heads with the words of what they really think. It does not save the movie of "bomb" status. Don't be stupid, dear movie and romance lovers. Don't rent, buy or borrow this giant turkey. Today I am the stupidest person on earth to look at this DING till the bitter end.
