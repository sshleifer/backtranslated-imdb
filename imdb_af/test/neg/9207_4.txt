The first half of the movie is actually not that bad. Although there isn't really too much depth in the characters, the story is somehow funny and generally ok with the potential to get better, which doesn't. <br /> <br /> In the second half things start to turn, not just for the characters in the movie, but also for the viewer, who will basically wait for the story to its obvious end. <br /> <br /> The previous user commented: "It's a love story, a road movie, a thrill, a comedy of flaws, an 80's movie and especially a Jonathan Demme movie." <br /> <br /> Well, allow me to reformulate it: "It's a boy who gets girl story, they're driving around in cars, the excitement is gone, because that's how clear things will develop, there wasn't a scene in this movie that one could laugh out loud, it did feel a bit 80's and yes, Jonathan Demme was really the director.
