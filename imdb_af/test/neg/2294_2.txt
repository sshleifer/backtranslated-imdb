Once in a while I like a good horror movie, so I thought it would be a flattering and gore movie. but it was a boring boring movie, perhaps because I saw a cut version, because there were only two things where a little flushed, once where some people cut someone's arm and where someone shot an arm, but this is the only thing. Wismaster, for example, had more cool nerves than evil, it is more boring than an evil. and some actors where it's uncomfortable
