It's based on Michael's life from 1983/4 to 2004. Flex Alexander did a good performance but didn't look like Michael. I feel Michael is portrayed as a stupid person I don't believe he was (although he sometimes trusted the wrong people). I thought Flex Alexander looked at Chinese when they made Michael look. I think Latoya should be portrayed in this, and she was always pictured with her brother in the 80's. I never thought any of the supporting casts were like their peers. There were a few things that were inaccurate. Lisa-Marie Presley's son looked at the marriage scene about 4, although he was not 2 when Lisa and Michael were married. Also, when Michael tells his mother, Katherine, he thinks he and Debbie should marry if she carries his child, it was Katherine's idea that the two should marry.
