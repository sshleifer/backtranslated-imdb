Apparently, in the eyes of some - there aren't enough horror movies nowadays that young people are being hunted by a desert by a mysterious, bloodthirsty man in a truck. I mean, all we have so far is Joy Ride, Wolf Creek, Jeepers Creepers, Monster Man - among others. REST STOP can be the worst. It's about a girl and her boyfriend leaving their lives to start together in California. Along the way they stop at a grim toilet so that the young woman can relieve herself, but when she comes back, she finds her boyfriend and his car gone. From there she learns that the culprit is a man who drives a yellow bakkie that moves to the stalk and hides her terror as she is in the toilets. This movie is so original that it is flat boring. The play is annoying, the gore is soft, and the killer, whose identity is not revealed throughout the movie, is anything but memorable. Terrible - Terrible movie ...
