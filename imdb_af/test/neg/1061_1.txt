This movie is surprisingly poor. It was on television when I turned on an action scene and got away on the cheesy macho dialogue and waited for Leslie Nielsen to appear. It took me a few minutes to realize that it wasn't really a comedy, it had to be taken seriously. What should be remembered is that someone actually sits down and wrote this movie, and worse - other people funded it and gave it the green light. <br /> <br /> Of course, Rutger Hauer doesn't read movie scripts before he signs whether he has serious bad debts. <br /> <br /> Oddly, this movie is so poor, you're staring at it and wondering how it's actually funded and how a TV channel has to pay money for the rights to air it. The dialogue between the hero and the bath while trying to shoot each other out of the air is particularly painful, with a dialogue that sounds like it was generated by a Texas Instruments "Speak & Spell". <br /> <br /> The Hollywood money machine at this is the worst. Funny though.
