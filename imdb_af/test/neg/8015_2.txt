I rented it because I couldn't get the chance to see pre-Hollywood celebrity Clive Owen and Catherine Zeta Jones together, but it was definitely not worth it. The only reason I give it two stars instead of one is for the novelty to see them before they made it across the dam. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones, who is usually fun to watch, though she is not The biggest thesp in the world is terrible. Owen looks really awkward to be in such a turkey, and he wears a ridiculous, genuine bad chin-length wig (I hope it's a wig and not his real hair). And the scene where he is dancing with Zeta Jones is just ashamed of him. Joan Plowright walks around in a foolish movie - she probably wondered how she caught herself in such a mess. <br /> <br /> The actress playing Clive Owen's wife is not terrible, but just about everybody else. Oh, and the writing stin too.
