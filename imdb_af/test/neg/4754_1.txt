The review on the main page acknowledges that the movie is horrible, but that you have to forgive it because it's pretty violent. No, you shouldn't. There are spoilers at the end of this review, but how I can spoil this rotten movie, I have no idea. Even if you are a strong Alien / Pred fan as I wait for the DVD. It's also not worth a 3.99 rental, but you'll be much less likely to really hate this movie if you pay it $ 12 or better per person plus franchise purchases at a theater. <br /> <br /> In the theater I watched AVPr. There were exactly two laughs, both by a girl sitting next to me. Other than that, there was total silence throughout. No ooohs, or "it was bad ass!" Nothing. Imagine you are a patient at an operational table and just given the anesthetic. Now you know what you will feel after opening AVPr in the theater. <br /> <br /> What was the budget for this movie? Like the World War, MI 3 and other f / x driven movies, the director looks much more involved with what CGI people can build up as characters or a plot. Spielberg has tried and failed it several times, usually with Tom Cruise. Sure, the movies make money, but should they? World War and Minority Report had the budget to pay for a decent writing, Tom Cruise et al, and SS himself, but was still terrible. I am sure that AVP wasted 90% of their budget on CG and had no choice but to enter any actor who would say yes, although the decision agent would do better by going to the supermarket and choosing random actors. <br /> <br /> No scene has evolved in any scene, so we're never close to surprise. Who cares for who is killed? We didn't know any of them, we all know what happens when the strangers leave their physical exit. We all know that the blood is acidic. In Alien, Aliens, 3, Resurrection, and even AVP, the directors use the fact that the Aliens can think, hide and fall. This director has decided that Ridley Scott, James Cameron, and other idiots were for the development of characters you really want to see or live or be killed. In this installment you will never care who lives or dies, not a child, a parent, a pregnant woman. The characters only serve one purpose in this movie to die. The opening styles confirm the fact that the movie will be a predictable joke. The character development mixes clich√©s, bad humor and bad acting and plunges the viewer to the point where we really don't care if they are killed as long as they die in never-seen ways. But they don't. The director has tried to do something different than those that preceded him in the Alien franchise, but only managed to reject the good parts of the first movies, the human protagonists, and the rest of other recent scientific films. steal. <br /> <br /> There is no original use of either the Alien or Pred characters. The Pred actually has little trouble killing Aliens by the dozen, although the last movie led us to believe that Pred honored the aliens as a deadly enemy for using the death of one Rite or Passage. The AlienPred is never really developed as a scary creature. The ability to inject parasites into a host has been torn from several different movies. Just probably Hellboy was probably where Hellboy where Samiel's fused tongue injected into Hellboy or Doom, where the mutated creatures would leave their scenes after playing a victim's throat. <br /> Simply put, we have no reason to care about anything in this movie. There is violence, but it does not shock or surprise and is not seen in any of a hundred slasher flicks. The CG is OK and both species of alien are made to look and move as they have gone past. But since the characters are never developed and the acting is so bad, we hope they all die. The girl was probably the best actor of the bunch, but unfortunately we were not made to care for children, women or anyone else. We just want the movie to end. Ultimately, this does not happen before another stolen plot of Resident Evil 2 has an inquisitive aim to eradicate Gunnison's "infection" way. And not yet another stupid scene that is supposed to open the door for further prosecutions, but does it? In a movie full of bad scenes, the worst was possibly saved to date. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the repetition, but everything is repeated: bad writing, no intriguing, inextricable action scenes, uninspired direction, improper acting, decent f / x wasted due to the many bugs. <br /> <br /> I don't mind going to an indie movie and being disappointed. The actors and directors and crew are likely to run their careers and work on a shocking budget. For a movie with this type of budget and hype, I feel disappointed with disappointing. This movie is a painful boring waste of time from the opening scene to closing credits. Unfortunately, to say that a Hellboy 2 preview was the best part of AVPr and HB2 didn't look that good.
