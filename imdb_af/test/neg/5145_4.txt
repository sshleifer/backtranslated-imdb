This well-covered film just falls short and unfortunately in too many areas. <br /> <br /> The scenery is beautiful, with views of north-central Vermont offering the setting for this mid-century story. Quebec Bill tries to go back to his whiskey run past to save his farm. <br /> <br /> Go back and forth between screens of magical realism and straightforward action, and this movie rarely touches its battle. br /> <br /> Kris Kristofferson as Quebec Bill looks pretty quiet, or else it's his lines; or else its cross of Yankee and Quebecois accent. Anyway, he just comes down if a low key blows hard. His dialogues with Gary Farmer's Coville character, however, shine. William Sanderson's Rat Kinneson is solid. Charlie McDermott shows a real potential as a young Wild Bill; but his part is not big enough to carry a scene and he never steals one. Luis Guzman points to Lake Memphramagog (with a fine impression by Lake Willoughby) as a monk with boys and the hood accent: who knows? And then there is Bujold's Cordelia: an oracle like her namesake, she channels Yoda, as his songs like "You will marry a Quebec woman!"? Just too strange and nowhere near enigmatic enough. <br /> <br /> The end is really slack. Again a bad mix of magical realism and the concrete. And Yoda never gives an answer we can understand.
