Rarely will anyone deny that Hitchcock remains one of the most creative, resourceful and productive directors of all time, for he is probably all these things. It takes genius to frighten generations of filmmakers as they take showers and wear necklaces. However, Saboteur is neither creative nor productive. On the contrary, Hitchcock has created with the soul's intention to create a film that supports American Pride, a certain call to arms, our troop title, which was a popular theme of the time. With that in mind, Hitchcock has highlighted many other important aspects of the movie, including but not limited to a logical plot, characterization, credible dialogue, and a flowing, running story. <br /> <br /> Typically, Hitchcock does well with espionage films, just a few years earlier, with the Foreign Correspondant and The 39 Steps, the movie of the movie, but apparently lost his pursuit to create Saboteur and just Recycle an exciting story once. lines that both provided its previous outings readily. Without a great deal of depth here is a list of some of these movies big problems: <br /> <br /> 1. Despite his face plastered on every newspaper about America, the only person Kane recognizes is blind. <br /> <br /> 2. At dinner, Kane and Patricia don't want to run for the door, because the bad guys can grab them and tell the party they were "gate crashers". Logically, what prevents the spies from grabbing and saying it at any time during the evening? Besides, someone should be reminded. Kane is a hopeful terrorist? <br /> <br /> 3. Since then, a fan belt can be cut by handcuffs? <br /> <br /> 4. No one recognizes him ... his face is on every newsletter !!! <br /> <br /> 5. The spies take in Kane in the ghost town and assume he is the man Freeman sent with them. Shouldn't he have some kind of credibility? I know spies don't walk around with name tags and photo IDs, but a secret handshake might? <br /> <br /> 6. Cop picks up Kane from Freeman's home, apparently no one recognizes this man. <br /> <br /> 7. How does the FBI come with Kane with no evidence? They don't even show that Kane is talking to the FBI, the scene simply disappears and we have to think everything is now kosher. <br /> <br /> 8. When the police are looking for the Carnival Caravan, how do they know that Kane is now with a woman? The blind man believed that Kane's story would not have been so logical that his daughter was kidnapped, kidnapped or even more important to Kane. Why doesn't this movie use logic? <br /> <br /> This is a running list. The movie is not exciting, the plot doesn't make sense and the world is full of people who want to take terrorists in their homes and cars, because that's not a big thing. Hitchcock failed carefully on this one.
