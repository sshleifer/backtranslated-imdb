Well, I have to agree with the critics on this one, who all said "leave it alone." Why did they have to make this repetition of the 1960s "Psycho," I don't know. My guess is that they wanted to reach a new audience, and mind color and contemporary actors were the answer, as they were the most important changes. The dialogue was the same and the story is the same. <br /> <br /> On the one hand I complain to them not to make it with a lot of curse and nudity and make it a messy movie. Still, if they kept everything the same, why not save Tony Perkins, Janet Leigh and the original cast? <br /> <br /> Did they honestly think Vince Vaughn would be as good or better than Perkins? Do you play? Ann Heche, with her short male hairstyle, will be better than Leigh? I do not think so! <br /> <br /> Yes, the colors were nice in this, but it's the black-and-white photography that helped make the 1960s so keen. It's perfect for the story, not a lot of green and pink! Again, I think the filmmakers were banking on an audience that never saw the original. <br /> <br /> It was just a stupid project that should never come off the ground.
