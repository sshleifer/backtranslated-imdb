I don't care what someone else is saying, this movie is the worst piece of garbage on film. What was John Landis thinking? <br /> <br /> I know it's based on a series of children's books, but I'm sure! Even children hate this movie. It is senseless and boring. Tom Arnold once again shows that his only talent is wasting production money. <br /> <br /> I think the only reason. The Stupids did not appear on the 100 worst movies of all time, but it will only 20 or so people admit that this garbage is being watched. At least Hobgoblins made it on MST3K.
