The Shanghai Cobra starts as gangbusters, with a rainy dinner scene straight out of Shack Out at 101 or Gun Crazy (the first one). Unfortunately, the movie continues its tired way through a standard Chan formula that is barely enriched by the always wonderful Mantan Moreland. It is as if the director Karlson had blown half of his budget for the first five minutes, just setting up the way he wanted it. Look at the beginning and think of The Phenix City Story.
