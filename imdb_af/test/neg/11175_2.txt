Ring! Ring! Is the horror director's hotline, how can we help you? About ?? yes ?? Pronto! I mean hello, my name is Rugge? miss, call me with my initials R.D! Good Mr. R.D, what seems to be the problem? Well, the reviews on my latest movie "Dial: Help" were all negative and hard and, frankly, I feel that my career also saw better days. Good Mr. R.D, and why do you think this is? Well, I gained celebrity and well-deserved cult status thanks to my controversial and shocking film about jungle tribes of cannibals that maneuver a film and another one on relentless villains who terrorize rich people in a house on the edge of the park, for which I borrow the idea from Wes Craven, but "Dial: Help" turns on? wander ?? Do not worry! No no, Mr. R.D, go ahead and tell me what the movie is about. Um, it's about a mentally owned phone line that beats a sexy model and kills the people around her. Ah I see. This performance sounds a bit silly and not as petrified as cannibals or rapists, but I think there are deeper themes in your movie, right? Oh yes, sure? Um, what do you mean by that? Well, isn't that the phone line symbol for a different kind of terror? Or maybe it just happens in the mind of your female heroine? Um, no ?? It's just about a phone that berserk and kill people with the cord, vibrations, electricity or even ordinary coins. Interesting, Mr. R.D, but how do you explain all these supernatural things to the viewer at the end of the movie? You see, I thought the slow-unraveling phone riddle would not be as important or relevant, so I just concentrated on processing all the possible phone sims I could think of. Tel gimicks? What do you mean? You know, like the wind blowing through the horn, thought-penetrating bells, and turning tables that are catapulting in the air! Very original, Mr. R.D, but not terribly terrible and as an experienced director, you need to know that people are expecting a reasonable explanation of all these events. Oh, but there is! It has everything to do with negative and unreleased energy, if I remember correctly! It's been a little vague, I admit. Hmm ?? I see. Oh yes, as they always say, makes a good movie based on more elements than just the story. Did you process at least some of your regular brands in the movie so your fans at least recognize your style? I tried! God knows I've tried, but the murders and bloodshed are simply not shocking! This is a pity, Mr. R.D, but what about sex? Everyone loves a slice of sleaze and nudity in their horror movies and you have put yourself in the middle of a sexy fashion model! Yes, but ?? But what, Mr. R. D? Well, to tell you the truth, we're kind of "Dial: Help" as an erotic thriller with revealing shots of Charlotte Lewis on the cover, but in fact there is no sex in the movie and Charlotte even refused to topless to go. Mr. R. D! Now I'm really disappointed, it's just shameless to snatch people and lure them with false promises! I know, I know, and I am ashamed, but I just wanted everyone to rent and love "Dial: Help"! Well, to upgrade, I can comfort you by saying that each chief director is entitled to some faulty decisions without immediately affecting his career, but be careful next time and do research first, okay R. D? I shall; Thank you! You are welcome. Tell me, have you already got ideas for upcoming movies? Yes, as a matter of fact, I do it! I thought to make a Giallo with a murderous washing machine! Doesn't that sound fascinating? Hello? Hello?
