I hate guns and have never killed anyone, but if even half the events happening in 'Shuttle' happen to you or your neighbor and you get a gun, YOU SHOULD SHOOT YOURSELF. THREE TIMES. FIVE TIMES. Whatever the pulse stops on them and increases on you. I think even God will say, "Good call." In a very 'Hostel' type movie, but more realistic ?? as it can really happen to anyone, well, if you are a pretty young woman, is it? Shuttle was a decent movie, though on the long side. A few good shocks (always call AAA to change a band), basically just one surprise, but for the most part, you can see what's coming. And apart from the typical "tie him" instead of the previously mentioned shoot him, the most annoying part was the revelation for closing one best friend to another. To go past, it's nice for what it is. Basically, we have two unsuspecting women traveling alone from the home of Mexico (wow, it's original) and one lost her luggage so they didn't leave the airport. And after an obviously prescribed sign language scene, they enter a "too-good-for-true" half-price ride. Clich√©d jocks, previously introduced, are on the shuttle, to join together what Alan Ruck's stunt appears to be double from 'Speed'. From here it goes without saying what happens (I said it was a 'Hostel' knock), but I haven't found too much yet, but nothing spectacular. Although it would have meant better hearing removal by about 15-20 minutes, I would recommend having almost 2 hours to kill and be in horror.
