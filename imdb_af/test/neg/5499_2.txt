I loved Tim Burton in the past. I loved Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, and even Mars Attacks. But I hate this movie. The costume drama scenes in the beginning were kind of done poorly, stodgy things that used to plague historical drama 25 years ago. Then there were all the headboards, which just let me go cold, and that's the kind of thing that would mean something, I would think. Yes, there were some pretty bare trees and misty evenings and the rider jumping out of the tree was a nice special effect, but overall the movie was just boring and useless.
