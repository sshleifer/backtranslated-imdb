You know, I hate IMDb's censorship, because my entire review is almost gone when you take out the curse. But here we go. Edit Time! <br /> <br /> Holy moley is so bad. I thought it might be a cool little movie, judged by the plot summary, as I had previously hired like jewelery such as Frailty and American Nightmare. But it's just abominal. It's about a murderer using Edgar Allen Poe's work as a reference for his murderous exploitation, and the story of a detective who has to stop him. Can't these lightning hooks make a good movie, ignoring the grave of a great horror writer? I mean, death in here is completely without thought or originality, and the references to Poe are hokey and fake, without enough thought in them. They are shallow and they shame Poe's work. Full of holes, with terrible order. The acting is also bad, reminds me of the abortion known in some third world countries as "Fear X", which is with all the breaks and unmotivated lines. <br /> <br /> I realize it's an indie movie, but it's no excuse. I saw high school children acting better than these morals, and I could have had better off-the-shelf and better plot, which gave enough time. <br /> <br /> It has no reason to exist. Avoid at all costs.
