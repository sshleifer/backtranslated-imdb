So many bad judges, it made me wonder, what do people think as they look at a simple movie made by a very bad director ??? Did you all expect a super-hit flawless movie? No way, you can see, Raj Kumar Kohli loves multi-star movie ... All his previous works where multi-starrers, but no one was flawless. Take the first Jaani Dushman for example, so many mistakes, but still fun. The movie Jaani Dushman is anyway a Hindi fantasy film about a snake who can take any form (Armaan (Munish) Kohli) who takes revenge on the suicide of his lover (Manisha Koirala) on the people who cause it has. . It's pretty good, with a big star-cast. But I think it could have been much better. For example, take the script, it cannot say flawlessly. For example: Take the ages: <br /> <br /> Still 40-48 years old in college? <br /> <br /> There is a lot more, I will no longer list, but there are dozens more. A solid 5.5 is good for this one. <br /> <br /> **. 75
