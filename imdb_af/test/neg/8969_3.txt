Any chance to see Katharine Hepburn in something I haven't seen or her early movie career is a surprise, and at that level, the movie is amusing, but she's terribly disappointed as Hill Billy. Her famous New England verdict slips through and makes lines like, "I'd better get some Vittles riot" pretty ridiculous. She is so beautiful and so young ?? it almost exceeds this big mistake. The story is an old-fashioned melodrama, and for that a younger generation can think of these beautiful chicks, but it was American Entertainment's staple food well in the 1940s. It has its moments, but you might have to be a hard-movie movie to appreciate it.
