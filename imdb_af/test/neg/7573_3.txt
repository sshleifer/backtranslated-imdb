This film has again seriously doubted whether Armando de Ossorio was a good filmmaker or not. His BLIND DEAD movies are praised by many fans. I can understand that. But wanting to be Gothic vampire, like MALENKA, shows no signs of a gifted movie maker. And this also applies to SERPIENTE DE MAR. It features frightening acting, a dumb plot, stupid events, many other things you can expect from a bad monster movie and also veteran actor Ray Milland, who does his best to mumble his way through this movie while not much of a clue about what he does about it. Apparently Milland was already very sick while shooting SERPIENTE DE MAR (his last theater function) and going out with such a ridiculous stinker, it made it all the more sad. One last appearance with Peter Cushing in a TV movie directed by Roy Ward Baker (also in 1984) does not change much. <br /> <br /> But the sock doll / sea snake is a hobby to watch. See how it rolls up and smashes a lighthouse. Seeing it destroys a harbor with miniature boats. See how they demolish bridges and hit striking miniature trains. <br /> <br /> Good Bad? Yes. 3/10 and 7/10
