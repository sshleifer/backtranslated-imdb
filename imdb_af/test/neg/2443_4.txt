Miserable movie. Not even comparable in one breath with killing a Mockingbird 'or' In the heat of the night '. Yes, there is racial prejudice, but the movie is at most ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Come on now. Do you really want Elizabeth Patterson, of all people, to preserve a jail to avoid a line string? Patterson played in everyone's mother's day and was the housewife in "I Love Lucy" before Fred and Ethel Mertz bought the building. <br /> <br /> Imagine refurbishing the body so that black Claude Jarman Jr., who was so fine in 1946's "The Yearling" will not appear in this mess. He still had those sad eyes. My eyes will also be sad if I appear in this terrible movie. <br /> <br /> For me it was nothing more than a Faulkner flop all the way.
