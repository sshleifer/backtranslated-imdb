I can't believe this movie has 6 stars on IMDb. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was not an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. The plot is predictable. I couldn't care about any of the characters. The dialogue is cheesy. Several moments in the movie made me hear aloud (including Kiefer Southerland's crazy neighbor and the incredible lame joke that ends the movie). Jeff Bridges's accent is goofy - I can't tell which country he's supposed to come from. It must be one of the least exciting thrillers I have ever seen. After Sandra Bullock's character disappears, nothing happens to promote the story for a good 45 minutes. I will give this movie a negative amount of stars if I could.
