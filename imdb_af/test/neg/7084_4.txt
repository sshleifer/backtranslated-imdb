This movie has lots of action and little heart. Let's forget for a while that this is about every aspect of the Russian Revolution going wrong. After all, we only have an hour here to tell our story. In fact, the Chatar who left after the First World War proved a disaster for the country and a preliminary government tried to rule as a pseudo-democracy until the Leninists took power nine months later, mainly because they promised had to withdraw Russia immediately from the war. Now, back to our story. <br /> <br /> Here is the revolution in Russian newspapers rumors that still seem to be a functioning country until violence suddenly breaks out and the life of the nobleman Baron Nikita 'Nikki' Krasnoff (Douglas Fairbanks Jr). He fled his home with his former servant Tanyusha (Nancy Carroll) in the trailer, and they started a new life in Constantinople. Before the revolution, the Baron made a regular habit of making a play for the girl, not of any true passion, but of boredom as a distraction of the kind. The revolution does not change it, and he tries to take advantage of what is, of course, a very simple girl. It certainly doesn't make the audience like this man to see him play. Tanyusha follows the Baron because she literally has no place to go after the revolutionary took over the Baron's house, and she had no other life except to wait on Nikki's hand and foot. Once in Constantinople, Nikki quickly lives as a strange laborer, and then meets his former lover, Russian aristocrat Vera Zimina, who has a plan to get them to Paris where the Tsarists gathered after the revolution. Unfortunately for Tanyusha, Vera's plan doesn't contain her. <br /> <br /> This movie manages to completely wipe out the significant actors of early talkie actress Nancy Carroll. She does a good job with how little she is given to do, but it's not much. Lilyan Tashman is the statue here, although she has only a small role as Russian vampire Vera. Lilyan is so often given supporting roles just as she is here, but her earthly voice and glamorous looks are the center of attention in every scene she appears. Guy Kibbee even appears in a humorous bit like an American tourist who is curious about the Russian kingdom expelled from their homeland.
