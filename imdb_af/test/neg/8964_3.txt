As someone has already mentioned on this board, it is very difficult to make a fake documentary. It requires tremendous skill, pacing, patience, live 'distance', a probable point of departure, a story 'flow' and REAL credible acting (aka GREAT acting). <br /> <br /> This is not the case with 'Love Machine'. It starts with its faux hand over the 20-minute point (with 60 minutes to watch), and the viewer begins to realize that he or she is being overtaken. There is downhill from there. <br /> <br /> Director Gordon Eriksen has spiked too soon. But to be honest with Eriksen, his problems started early: as he explains in the extras, he started making a real document, couldn't get money and he has a cheaper way to make his movie. <br /> <br /> The premise - people who have secret life by placing themselves on a porn site - may have been more interesting in 1997-98 when the film was made. Eriksen does very difficult things - a solid "host" hand cameras, zooming, grain blacks and whites - though I think, to create a sense of authenticity, but it just doesn't work. The film is confusing and forced, but it ultimately brings the promises of the actors and the pretty terrible dialogue.
