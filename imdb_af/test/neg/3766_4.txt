I only saw it when it came out in the theater. Although I was only 13, I was an avid reader of scientific fiction stories. The technical gaffes of the film are burned in my memory. <br /> <br /> Some of the following may have significant spoilers. <br /> <br /> Even as a youngster, I knew the point of departure was stupid. The rocket decreases for a moon mission, in a cosmos where there is always a gravitational effect on the crew (although loose objects swing as in zero gravity) and as a result, the "cabin" (the area with the Controls, regardless of what they were called, were gyrostabalized to maintain the "correct" orientation (so when landed, why did they not land on their heads?) and where the rocket engines were in the near-Earth space anyway. had to run - discarded with propellant without an oxidizer. When the engines stopped, the rocket _dead_ stopped in space and could not start until a PhD chemist determined it at a little oxidizer. This time, the rocket remembered that it had momentum, and the next thing our heroes know they are near Mars (even a 13-year-old nerd knew that such a minimum energy journey would take more than 200 days) . <br /> <br /> They land, find the air breathable (although scientific data revealed at that time that the pressure, even if the atmosphere is pure oxygen, is too low to do any good). They decide to camp outside the ship and even build a campfire. They come armed, though they go to the Moon, where firearms would not be needed. <br /> <br /> They see a collapse of civilization, meet stray martyrs who just like humans, develop an anti-nuclear war philosophy, and those who survive try to return to the home planet, and die in the attempt by crashing on the earth! To do so would require such a long job period, they would have died from starvation long before they reached their destination. <br /> <br /> The leading movie, Destination Moon, used the most effective science (though their "rescue" with the oxygen tank forgets the momentary arm of the tank's center of gravity towards the outlet nozzle). This film showed furious ignorance of even the most basic science. Only the most technologically illiterate should regard it as a science fiction movie: this is in line with the old Flash Gordon series, where their rockets have climbed out of their bows and climbed into spirals, and whose engines were always on. <br /> <br /> The story about this one I considered banal, and I can only recommend it as a movie shown to students to take out technical gaffes.
