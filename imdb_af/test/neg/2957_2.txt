This movie is far too long. I lost interest in the story about one hour. Saratoga Trunk tells the story of Ingrid Bergman, who is the child of a prominent New Orleans man and his mistress. After her mother dies in Paris, Bergman returns to New Orleans to scan her father's "legitimate" family and chant them. She meets Gary Cooper, who is also looking for revenge against the railway tycoons that his father defrauded in his country in Texas. She pulls him into her schemes, and the movie climbs onto a Saratoga resort. Long and boring, but worth checking out if you are a Bergman or Cooper fan. The midget Cupidon offers the only clear place in this winding story.
