I start by recognizing that I enjoy many movies that have low ratings on this site. I find that if I can see what the creators are trying to do, I can appreciate their work. Sound of Thunder was a story that interests me. I wanted to see what angles the filmmakers would attack to tell the story. In general, they were trying to create an entertaining movie. The plot is confronted, but most action movies are plots. Ed Burns does not know how to carry a gun, but still holds his own good as an action lead as he is not asked too much. The biggest problem, destroying the whole movie, is the horrible CGI. It is quite unacceptable that the animals and backgrounds look sooooo much fake. In addition, animal concepts could have been really good, just as the action could fail because the production failed. It could have been a very memorable movie if they had finished it first. It really seems as if they intended to go back and fix all the terrible CGI, but went out of money and still released it. Save your money because someone has failed this movie. I give it three stars because it really could have been good, but was completely failed, I can't say enough.
