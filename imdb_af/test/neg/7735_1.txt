Impressive vision and some hot chicks with swords flying around, oh and those hypnotic Chinese violets too ... Let me think, "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"? <br /> <br /> I like CTHD, with its Earth Symptoms and well-developed characters, which left enough room to enjoy the vision without thinking about its DEEPAA meaning. <br /> <br /> "Hero" on the other hand is painfully pretentious and demands visual and conceptual. The greater-than-life moral was terrible. I mean, sacrifice your life, sacrifice your beliefs, sacrifice your love so that your mighty nation can succeed ???? WTF ?? <br /> <br /> No, thank you. <br /> <br /> But, hay, Mao and G.W.B. would be proud! <br /> <br /> Viva
