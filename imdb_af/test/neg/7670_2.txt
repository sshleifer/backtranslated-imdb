I just gave an airport '79 'two stars because it's a real movie. No one who has anything to do with it deserves praise (except for Charo's Chihuahua, who does a pretty good job in his role.) It is not to say that the film is not worth watching. It helps if you have a buzz, but it is not essential. <br /> <br /> A'79 really looks like an early version of the "plane!" Each scene has an essay and a discount, and the screens blunder to each other as if they were completely closed. One of my favorite recurring points is that the passengers, crew and aircraft will continue, no matter what. You are a news reporter and a foreign man killed at your home in your presence? The hoodman then chases you on your greenhouse roof? No problem. You can still catch that early morning flight to Paris ... no need to get the police involved. Your plane dodges an unmanned 'drone' missile, four heat-seeking missiles, and cannon fire from an unknown Phantom fighter, doing trolls, an unmanned dive and an accident-only landing without inversion in the process ? No problem, we will monitor the mechanics of the oil and get you on the road within hours. It's really funny. <br /> <br /> And I will admit that there is a bit of the anarchist in me coming out if the passengers don't pay attention to the cabin crew. The highlight is when the servant tells Jimmie Walker that he needs to break down his saxophone (God, save me a flight before a saxophonist who plays jazz!) Before starting. Jimmie basically says, "No." Later in the flight, the sax is damaged during a barrel roll and Jimmie actually points to the next leg of the flight with another scissors that he won't throw away. This aspect of the movie is just nice. (A passenger actually keeps the servant in. When Charo is told, she can't take her dog on the run, she leaves the plane. Of course it's because you can't get a good view on her ass and boobs while she sit down.) <br /> <br /> In summary, a terrible movie, but awful enough to be a little amusing. Unfortunately, the filmmakers and role-players do not deserve credit for this, as it was probably completely unintentional.
