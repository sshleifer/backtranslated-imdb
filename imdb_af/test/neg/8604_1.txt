I watched myself Sex Lives Or The Potato men with a folded forehead, amazed why so many talented and witty comedians have decided to engage in a movie that is so utterly humorous. <br /> <br /> Pooh and shaky jokes are funny when you are eleven. Eighteen plus, and you start losing friends around the water cooler. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one can enjoy this movie if you are the kind of person who regularly plays practical jokes, doggy, brown bags and games, or maybe participates in "man" competitions at dinner. emotional companion's hour, etc. when you are not back at your parents' basement that hits your teenage wife. <br /> <br /> Even then, "Sex Lives ..." it's hard to recommend. Perhaps, if you are really great in masochistic cranial surgery, and spend your evening, happy to hit the elderly or flush toilets, you might think a close-up of a bogie is worthy of film distribution. <br /> <br /> I'm not discussing characterization, narration or actions I didn't quite singularly to the long tuna paste / vagina equation.
