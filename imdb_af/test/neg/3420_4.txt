Review: Not quite familiar with Macbeth's Shakespeare story, but my wild guess is that it's very close to the original, just in the present time. It tells the story of Macbeth, a member of a crime syndicate in Melbourne (?). He is a valued hit and in favor of leader Duncan. But he and his wife have higher ambitions than that, and plan the murder of Duncan, and any rivalry of the throne. It is a story of betrayal and cold, brutal death. <br /> <br /> Comment: Very interesting idea, I have to say. To use the story but change the setting to offer time, but still keep the original (?) Dialogue. It contrasts a great deal with the classic poetic work and the violence. Promise to be extremely violent, that's a promise it keeps, but not in the thought I thought. It's very bloody, but the violence is slow. Not only figuratively it is calculated, whatever it is, but also literally. Much action is actually slowing down to slow motion and that is what brings the film to its knees. <br /> <br /> What could have been a unique strength, the contrast between the abundant and poetic dialogue and the extreme violence, is now changing completely into something else. Now both of them slow down the move painfully, so much so that it actually gets boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Also, I can't figure out the context of the three witches. Suggest to present time and reality. I find that such a magical magic had no place in the movie. It does, but it seems to me completely out of place. Not a subplot, but a complete sub-story with its own rules, quite different from the rest of the movie. Seems completely out of place. It must have been possible to turn that part into something new. Drug-induced hallucinations perhaps (which I suspect the director is winning, but then he left too much witchcraft to be credible)? Now they just bring pieces of the movie that are clearly next to the story, and I just waited for the right movie to start again. <br /> <br /> A clear disappointment, but perhaps something for Shakespeare buffs? <br /> <br /> 4/10
