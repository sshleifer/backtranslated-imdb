Oh God, why? I'm afraid with the sheer dissatisfaction of this glorious blatant nonsense ... as everything that makes sense. Well, like this movie of the poverty line of the 1940s Hollywood, nothing in this widespread horror made on three sets, a lot of sense ... besides the clumsiness of Dr Markoff (jerkoff?) What after some plonky piano player's daughter with big melons and a flouncy hairdo. It's just awful ... and even a gorilla and a big dog for useless distractions added. More Elephant Man as Elephant Man and it's just 62 minutes away! .... THE MONSTER MAKER is the kind of movie children in 2005, just crying with disbelief and wondering what hell saw their grandparents in their youth who made them the lovely movie cooks they are today. I think you just had to be there. In 1944 or when hell, this bad bravery was shown to impressive 13-year-olds in glorious 3000-seat velvet films on a wet day. Somehow. It was made for no reason. By botchville crapshooter movie scammers PRC Photos in the war years escaped by German refugees who knew to make a movie since they came from Europe when the Nazis progressed to UFA studios ... the monster in this movie, like the mad scientist is actually a Nazi nightmare.
