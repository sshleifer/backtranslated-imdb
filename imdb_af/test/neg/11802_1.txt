Well, they tell you it's real. They don't mention any screenwriters or directors, but one show of this movie will prove to anyone. It's not really like you were waiting. The talk rarely sounds like a real natural talk ... but also not healthy to be written. (possibly loosely written). To me it sounded much more like they always try ad-lib. (which they almost always did poorly). So they knew they were making a 'movie', not just the collection of real natural material. So I'm sure these people knew what was going on, knew they had some places to look for things that were set up ... and they were just telling ad-lib to do it all. <br /> <br /> ************* 'Major Spoilers' **************** ********* ******** *********************** <br /> Well, it's so bad. Every person, place or thing that can be strange or used as a fright, is stunned by these people. Let me remember the ridiculous, obviously flawed things that have happened: <br /> <br /> 1) Less than 2 minutes to enter the house, they turn on a light switch. The light sparks and a candlestick almost fall into an old one. <br /> <br /> 2) They find an old medical bag with a bloody butcher's knife in it while the basement is being explored. <br /> <br /> 3) They hear a noise in a dish so they open the door slowly. BAM - A cat comes in and jumps straight to the camera as he screams. <br /> <br /> 4) It happens that there is a hole in the wall, so let's keep our hand ... wow, they have a baby doll wrapped in a mummy band, removed. <br /> <br /> 5) Let's go to the attic, oh, oh, it feels heavy here .... BOOM - a chair is flying over the room. <br /> <br /> 6) Time to eat. Oh no! The girl who was afraid of bugs had a ROACH in her sandwich! LOL! .... ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 7) Let's go out of the Ouija board ... oops, one of the legs on the shelf fell from the side of the board. It can't be because people pushed, can it? (They find a ghost there is called Charles) <br /> <br /> 8) Wait! What was the noise in the chimney ... CLINK - o my chains fell out "I think she kept people here". <br /> <br /> 9) Now the wimpy girl is brave to look at the chimney shaft. ... oh, what is it that she sees something ... and asks people who don't see the chimney what it is. SWISH - It falls straight to her. (perfect camera shot) She just moves in time. It was more chain. <br /> <br /> 10) Now we have to divorce and each one cleans our designated rooms - if it doesn't matter if things have started one by one for these people ... okay: <br /> <br / > CHICK # 1: Wow, suddenly her room shoots ... but no one does. <br /> <br /> DEATH # 1: Actually saying to himself "Charles, is it you Charles ... it can't be you, because you're just an imagination of my imagination, you're not Charles. "Well, guess what he gets, knock over and drag across the floor. Another happy camera shot. <br /> <br /> CHICK # 2: Hear things. Try to communicate ... and stand there to get scratches or something. <br /> <br /> DEAD # 2: He was on the loft, got his arm through a hole in the floor and got a splinter .... I don't remember what else. <br /> <br /> 11) Dude # 2 runs, gets Chick # 2. They hear chick and guy # 1 screaming ... they find them chained to a wall and tied to a table. (*) Their departure. Cut to black. Final text tells us that they have escaped safely, were treated for small cuts. They have had nightmares and insomnia since then, and the next day we find a 911 call by calling them a person called "Charles". <br /> <br /> ************ * 'Major Spoilers' **************** ********* ********* About ********** ********** <br /> Well, when I first heard, this is movie, I couldn't wait. I thought it was going to be real. Actually, actually. - and more professionally, with more professional type people. I love the idea of ​​this kind of thing, I want to see real haunting footage. Before this movie was released, I saw some of its reviews by people online. They both claimed how false it was and how stupid the people were. Time passed, I forgot about the movie .... then I realized that it was never released at theaters. So I found out it went straight to the video, rented it .... found that every cruel review was completely true. It's too bad, I really wanted it to be good. <br /> <br /> Random Thought: The house didn't have TVs, radios. Cooking appliances that I remember ... that reminds me no One has lived there long ago. Especially the house is really known because it's been pursued ... I'm pretty sure no one lives there. But it looks so clean and neat ... and what did a cat do there? The property is not near the neighbors. <br /> <br /> All-in-all, you just want to rent it if you and your friends want to sit there and enjoy it or if you've heard it for a long time and it has encouraged you. (You will be disappointed if you expect a good movie ... or a real movie). <br /> <br /> Random thought: I believe the producer says: "The" footage "you see is actually. Well, technically it is real footage, isn't it? A true picture of false ghost games? Maybe it was she loop hole <br /> <br /> I give it this movie one star - just because they told the story of Madame LaLaurie, a true New Orleans story. <br /> <br /> The best thing was by the guy who initially teaches the ghost hunting equipment participants, of course he was really ... or a good actor. <br /> <br />
