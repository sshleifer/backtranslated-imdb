... how a porn movie would look if you had eliminated the sex and just left the bad dialogue, cheap sets and bad acting, would have had Galaxina. <br /> <br /> This movie came out when the original Star Wars proved that there was a science fiction market. This leads to a few gems such as Alien and a revived Star Trek. Unfortunately, it also led to bad movies, which was one of them. (Of course I say because I didn't even hear about this movie a few days ago. I missed it when it came out in 1980.) <br /> <br /> Here's the underlying problem. Dorothy Stratton couldn't act, so for most of the movie they didn't even let her try. I understand her tragic death has given this film an undeserved cult status, but for my life I cannot understand why. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the movie Star Wars, Star Trek and Aliens have played, but they clearly don't understand it when you spoil something, it should be FUNNY! This movie wasn't, or at least, the comic timing of jokes that could have been funny. Science fiction is ripe for parody, as Spaceballs and Galaxy Quest prove. However, this movie did badly.
