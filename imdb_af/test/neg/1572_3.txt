Such a highly anticipated remake of a cherished musical classic and such a bitter pill it had to take. Very, very hard to swallow ... everything. It didn't have a gram of credibility. And if you don't have a rose, you don't have a show. <br /> <br /> Bette Midler was born to play this part. Yet everything she could produce was a cute, funny, glittering brand, Bette Midler ... Deviated with all the famous Midlerisms. Roz Russell has nothing to worry about. She can rest in her grave because she knows she is still the definite Mama Rose (of the film, anyway). <br /> <br /> I thought Midler would really put it over time ... to throw herself into what is one of the greatest musical roles of all time ... like she's in "The Rose." But no, she played it safely. She played herself. She made Rose a total dinner scene cartoon. Even her songs were uninspired. It was angry to watch, because Midler has the talent to make money above her. She only once showed in this "Gypsy" promise and it was with Rose's Turn. But then it was too little, too late. <br /> <br /> A sincere Cynthia Gibb as the titular heroine gave the film its only true spark and when Gypsy's role pours it out of Rose, you know there's trouble in River City. <br /> <br /> A big, big deduction.
