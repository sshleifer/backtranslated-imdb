This is definitely a DVD rental movie. I'm a big fan of the cast members, but the storyline never really caught me. Don't expect "Oh brother where are you" in any way shape or form. The finest part of my opinion is when the war hero explains what happens in the Argon. Seems like they're trying to copy some of Clooney's funny facial expressions from "Oh brother, where are you", but you can say they tried. John Krasinski was the brightest place and was solid throughout. Ren√© Zellweger plays the role of an avid reporter who is willing to do everything for the story. Overall, it's a movie worth watching at home.
