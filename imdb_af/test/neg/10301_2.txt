I work at Memorial Hermann Hospital (TMC) and also at Texas Children's Hospital, Women's Hospital, and West Houston, during Allison. Unfortunately, the shots of the hospital are unfortunately suburban. The Texas Medical Center has a daily population density similar to Wall Street !! There are large skyscraper professional buildings and hospitals. TCH was the biggest children's hospital before it doubled, TWO! Methodist, with its 1500 beds, is one of the largest hospitals in the world. The Texas Medical Center skyline is larger than that of Memphis. Still, Hollywood's best photos are those of a doctors hospital in the middle of nowhere (except the actual photo taken by the hospital decades ago). They also combined several real characters and depicted them all in one (super-nurse). I actually know the medical technologist (s) working in the blood bank. Two where actually work, but the movie just shows one pregnant MT. There was a pregnant MT, and another MT who took the precious patient antibody rolodex (research "alloantibodies" for more information). I won't call their names (privacy). There was no nurse in the actual lab scene. Hollywood combined these two techniques (probably saving time and money). In the movie, military helicopters (real) had to transfer our babies (NICU and PICU) to UTMB to Galveston! Why can you ask if we have the biggest children's hospital just down the street? Because Texas Children's Hospital refused to take them. You read right, they refused !!! To employ them, I was ashamed. Needless to say, I'm no longer affiliated with that facility. Any other comment will be repetitive to those who have already been posted by people, who actually live here, or have lived through the experience.
