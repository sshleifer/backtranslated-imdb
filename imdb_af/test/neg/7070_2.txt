I was invited to view this movie at a small art gallery screen. I had no idea what to expect. I was initially optimistic about the opening credits to see Judd Nelson, Bill Paxton, Wayne Newton, James Cann, Rob Lowe and Lara-Flynn-Boyle. But after a couple of very disturbingly drawn-out scenes (which did not add much to the story enlargement), this movie quickly became a weapon of torture. The gimmick of the vestigial growing poor story was never really developed. I waited patiently for this movie to pay. In the end, there was a small payout, but investing and shouting the endless gross, rough, sexually distorted, in your face, I took too much money for myself (even for a free show). What were these established actors in this terrible movie? The art was very convincing and creepy. At a minimum, it should be just a 75-minute movie. It's a movie that will embrace Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld.
