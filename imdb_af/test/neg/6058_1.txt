I don't know how expensive this movie was, but the effects were terrible. Half of the film was filmed on stage before a film cloth (it is sure blue box will not look as artificial). When traveling on a boat, the background of the wallpaper moved to the waves, but the characters did not move. The CGI effects: terrible (I don't know, but I think the effect was created with Paint and made a GIF sequence from them - next time the creators need to appoint a professional CGI maker team). It seems the CGI creator would pull on the picture strip with shaky hands. Terrible, that's for sure. When I first saw the trailer, I thought it was created in 1983. One of my friends told me the correct date: 2005. My khaki dropped, I was so shocked, I thought he was joking. People, I advise you to skip this movie, the story is also twisted, you won't enjoy it.
