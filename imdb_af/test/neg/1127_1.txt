To quote Clark Griswold (in the original Christmas holiday): "WORSE? How can things be worse? Look here, Ellen. We're on the threshold of hell." Little did Chevy Chase know he described the "successor" to one of his best films. Christmas Holiday II sets a new high (or perhaps LOW) in bad movies. My wife bought this DVD, thought it would be a sequel to the original, but we were very disappointed. This movie is LAME. It does not like the original, is an absolute waste of film, and an embarrassment to the otherwise good actors who had the misfortune of being part of it. It should have a record on IMDb for the most bad reviews. I really think we have a good case to take a lawsuit to recover the money we wasted on this movie.
