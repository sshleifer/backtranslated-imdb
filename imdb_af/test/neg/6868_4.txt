I didn't like this movie. It didn't make much sense. It was hard to figure out what really happened. I also didn't think it was scary. However, I thought it was stupid, even absurd, but not in a good way. Radha Mitchell is the main character in the film, released in 2003. She was also coincidental in 2006's "Silent Hill" I hated. Also I found confusing and useless. "Visitors" It's not that bad, but I think it's definitely below average. It's just nothing special about it. The script is just too confusing and there are things in the movie that don't have to be there, in my opinion. I think Radha Mitchell is probably a good actress, if she does more work. My vote for "Visitors" is 4/10
