An American werewolf in London has some funny parts, but this one is not so good. The computer waswolves are just awful: the perspective is everything, it's like seeing them through a distorting mirror. The authors walk on the throat of many of their gags. American boy says to the Parisian girl, "Is there a cafe here?" Instead of just leaving it, they must sigh and respond to the girl: "This is Paris."
