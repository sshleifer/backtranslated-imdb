When Uwe Boll, a superior filmmaker, released the first House of The Dead adaptation, it was quite with fans of the source video game that it would be incredibly moronic to consider making a successor. Hollywood's per capita ratio of moron should indeed be high, because not only do we have a successor, it is distributed in the antipodes by Sony, a company that is not normally known for its taste in expensive depreciation. In most cases, the successor in America is released directly on television. The successor is in most respects improved on the original, but in doing so it becomes blister rather than interesting. The scope of the scenario is increased. The action takes place in a deserted town that just happens to surround a university where experiments in a virus that the dead can revive took place. In particular, the action is spread across the university, where the first infected residents can be found. Simply, the film differs from the original because it actually occurs in a house where dead people can be found. <br /> <br /> The cast, on the other hand, is a real step backwards. Emmanuelle Vaugier is specifically designed to look like a lower-rent Angelina Jolie, while the rest of the cast never reaches the level of a slumming-it Jürgen Prochnow. In fact, the only name that will appear under this broadcast is one Sticky Fingaz, which is unlikely to be easily recognized by the people he saw at home. Simply put, these people couldn't order pizza on the big screen convincingly, even under the best direction. Say what you want about Boll, but at least he inspired the actors like Ona Grauer to fight against his incompetence. That said, the people involved here at least seem aware that their movie sucks and that they can have so much fun. Much of the problem with the original was that the director thought he was making a kind of misunderstood masterpiece, and he took himself seriously. Unfortunately, with the actors who do not take their characters or the preacher seriously, the dramatic tension could be undermined. <br /> <br /> Much of the plot relates to the search for a generation-zero victim of Whatever the plague causes the dead to rise. Or to translate into more practical terms, they try to mutate someone who was infected just after the virus into a form that was threatened by humans. How it will help if a non-mutated strain is usually needed to create a vaccine is someone's guess, but the way this search is exhausted suffers from its own problems. The our-to-back plot device is used to push the run time, but the actual timing of the extra quest is also problematic. We are told at one point that the city will be destroyed by crucifixes within ten minutes, but the heroes return to university, find the monster they are looking for, and fight enough zombies to eat the army of China, all in this space . Filmmakers note: it only pays to be on time when it can serve rather than prevent dramatic tension. <br /> <br /> The special effects used in House Of The Dead leave the original in the fabric. While your Boll simulated the death of the characters using idiotic rotating camera tricks, Michael Hurst uses all the graphical details that allow his budget. Nails are bitten, arms are cut, heads are shot. All this makes for a far more convincing throughput, but it is also the mockery of obvious fakery. Photography is also much improved. As the DVD-Crypt puts it, the fact that it is in focus is an improvement on the original, but it also deprives us of something to have a laugh at the expense of. The writing is also an improvement and a setback. Throughout the script, references to other horror and survival horror games, the most obvious Run Like Hell, are being presented. The first few times they work because they offer clever ways to work titles in ordinary, everyday dialogue. However, after the eighth time they only touch the nerves because they remind gamers of things they prefer to do with their time. <br /> <br /> Interestingly enough, House Of The Dead 2 costs just six million to bring to television screens in America. Since Tom Savini, on his own, would cost more to work on a movie today, I have to say I am somewhat impressed with the visual results. Unlike the highly-crafted original, the zombies here look like real zombies rather than extras in bad makeup shot down. In a further contrast to the original, the actors seem to have an idea of ​​what they are doing. Completing the transaction is the fact that the characters are separated from actual people, apart from the actual singers. However, the story is nothing we have not seen a thousand times. When Aliens, the real Dawn of the Dead, or The Evil Dead is extradited, the praise came that these films also did something we hadn't seen before, or did so well that we didn't really care. The house of the dead 2 is capable enough to not mock it, but it does not bring anything new or particularly brilliant on the table, so we don't mind either. <br /> <br /> For that reason and many others, I gave the House of Death 2 a two out of ten. It's too good to be bad, but too bad to be good. Unless you're as much as I'm in sucky movies, you're best off removing it.
