I went to see "TKIA" with high expectations, which may affect my opinion. I've seen all the Dogma movies, and this TKIA is by far the worst. The story is related to themes from Shakespeare's play: King Lear, but never fails to capture and care for the audience. Directing the actors is very loose, even for Dogma style movies, and leads to poorly definable plays. The story lacks any dynamics, and I lost very little interest. There are a few scenes in the movie that shock the viewer, but I don't think they have the story at all. Mifunes last song and Festen are both Dogma movies that were well-directed, and have good storylines, so I will look for better Dogma movies in the future. Perhaps Aake Sandgren's "An Invisible Man Dogma 6" will raise the quality again. Because he is like Vinterberg and S.K. Jacobsen is a skilled and educated director.
