It is supposed to be based on Wilkie Collins's _The_Woman_In_White_, but the only match with this story was the characters' names, the period, and the settings. If they changed the story so thoroughly, I don't understand why they should stop the look that comes from Wilkie Collins. Read the book. It's much better.
