This movie was one of the longest movies to see the experiences of my life. As I liked how the director, Chan-wook Park, dealt with the revenge, the move as a whole was terrible. Oldboy is only billed 1 hour and 55 minutes, but it feels like it takes at least 3 and a half hours to tell this story. I would say that the English dubbing was done very well and the movie was easy to understand. I felt that some of the screens were unnecessarily long and repeated a lot of the dialogue. Also, if you have an aversion to annoying voices, then avoid the trial of Hye-jeong Kang (she's playing Mi-do). If you are looking for a movie to kill time and make you feel morally better towards others, then look away. If you don't want to see a movie with incest, bad dialogue, unnecessary fighting scenes, brutal torture and confusing flashbacks, then it's not the movie for you.
