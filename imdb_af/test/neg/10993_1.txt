One of the worst movies I have seen in 2009: The story hesitates between a stupid dreamer or a stupid comedy. <br /> <br /> As it doesn't, the void is filled with long, boring dialogues that don't make sense! <br /> <br /> The movie is well-known but does not bring emotions except to advance the game! <br /> <br /> And this happens in a soft seaside hotel that looks really gloomy. In comparison, one of the "Shining" is funfair! <br /> <br /> NB: Many users think it is located in the French Riviera! They're wrong! It's not the south of France (Nice, Cannes), but quite the opposite: Cabourg & Normandie, to be simply the D-Day beaches! That is why the sea is as gray as the sky and there is no sun!
