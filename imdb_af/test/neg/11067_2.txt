I haven't laughed for so long - or seen a movie so improperly! Talk about it so bad it made me laugh! <br /> <br /> First, I estimate that about 40 percent of the movie length couldn't tell what's going on, or even what I saw. I can only describe the camera work as scary at LSD. There are whole segments, minutes long, where everything you can see is vague flashes and fragments of cave wall, people and various other unidentifiable things. I asked half of the movie to my teenage daughters what happened, but they couldn't do better than I did. <br /> <br /> Then there are the "black" moments, when we try to scare us woooooooo) everyone's lights go out and the screen gets pitch black - and I don't mean just a few seconds. I think the longest lasted almost two minutes. I think blank movie is one way to keep costs ... <br /> <br /> I suspect the "director" recently read a book about all the "must-do's" to make a scary movie and decide to throw it all in - about 20 times each. <br /> <br /> There are three good things about this movie: 1 / It is short after 90 minutes (though half an hour!) 2 / All the characters die (it's impossible to care about any of them) ). 3 / There was a really good scene. When the group looks up the shaft, they come down after they have stuck their rope (see it coming), a large stone is pushed over the opening, they are sealed. One expected it, and it was really cool. <br /> <br /> And what are the early campfire scenes with the shot, after the shot, to the lap from behind the camplights. I swear the director uses about 20 times in 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> And I am positive that after the first kill the EXACT same footage of blood on the cave floor is used twice in about twice. 90 seconds. <br /> <br /> All in all, a CRAP filmmaking piece. I'll almost see anything, but it's near where I will draw the line.
