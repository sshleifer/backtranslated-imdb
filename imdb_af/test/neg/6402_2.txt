A few move in their dream home, unaware that it and its neighbors are built on land previously used as a cemetery. The film is said to be based on a true story, but how much of it is supposed to be true is not disclosed. The plot is hardly unique - see Spielberg's 'Poltergeist' (1982). Within a short period of time they experience various supernatural phenomena: they range from the disturbing mysterious shadows, the serious illness of the daughter - to the frankly ridiculous toilets that are constantly flushing and the garage doors are out of control. There is little depth to the story: once it is established that the land has been used as a cemetery, we learn nothing more. The plot doesn't seem to develop. The characters are not very well drawn or in any way unforgettable, and the atmosphere is not exceptional either. The movie may be disturbing to some viewers. There is no sense of catharsis or any kind of positive message from it.
