I saw this Hallmark television movie when it was originally broadcast. I lost interest in the story because a character said it was a witch. I just wasn't in the right mind to watch this movie. But Hallmark stands for the best quality films. Now there's a reason to give this movie a second look. Clive Owen, who plays "Damon Wildeve," may be given the chance to be chosen as the next James Bond 007 when Pierce Brosnan sends it. Clive Owen may have to wait until the year 2008. The other reason is the female lead, Catherine Zeta-Jones is now a celebrity (she was unknown at the time) and in 2003 became an Oscar winner for Outstanding Supporting Actress. Joan Plowright as "Mrs Yeobright" is also in this movie. I like the opening line in this movie: "Deliver my heart from this terribly lonely place. Send me a great love of somewhere or else I'll die, truly, I'll die."
