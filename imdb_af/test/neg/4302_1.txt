As much as we may be welcoming a movie dealing with people who have different challenges in the field of romance, I do not feel scared that this movie is intended as a porn movie of live-to-video porn in which A or A the actors did themselves from the explicit scene, or B) the producers ran out of money to rent for the inserts (a great thing if it was true). <br /> <br /> I had to go back to Blockbuster to figure out why on earth I rented it, which was due to an amateur awareness of blurbs coverage, which is an excited John Waters style humor festival with a sexual theme. Well, I laughed a few times and it certainly has a sexual theme (although most cannot be described in any way). But on some movies you can rewind to make sure you've heard the dialogue correctly - on this one, you are fast ahead because you already know what they're going to say. But there is nothing to move forward, so just move forward quickly on the shelf.
