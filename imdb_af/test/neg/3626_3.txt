Okay people, I have to agree with almost everyone's reviews here. The characters. Is. Stupid. They are ALL stereotypical, yet have nice clothes and are always slim. <br /> <br /> Don't start me on Jamie Lynn's role as ZOEY. Zoey is a beautiful, brown, brown, blonde young teen who just loves everyone! She has a "rebellious", great personality that everyone agrees, no matter how stupid or extreme it is. Most annoying of all: her voice is so dirty and stupid. "OMG!" <br /> <br /> Take the first episode, for example. The moment she studied on the big PCA campus, everyone seemed to love her. The boys want to ask her, the girls want to be her friend, etc. Think she's all, the episode plays out with Zoey always the center of attention; She is the so-called best player of the unofficial girls basketball team, confident and she is all sorry for her when she falls ill. Oh, hi-ho. <br /> <br /> My favorite character is far away this whole series is a girl who appears much later in the show, Lauren or something, who is the only person ever introduced in the show to hate Zoey. <br /> <br /> Sometimes Zoey doesn't seem to be very loyal to her friends. In one episode she even calls her friend a freak without ever apologizing and not showing the least bitterness. <br /> <br /> Zoey is ALWAYS the best: <br /> <br /> -Development of professional T-shirts and backpacks (which has become a big hit) <br /> <br /> -Follow many EXTENDED SCHEMES TO REFORM to teach a single person a lesson <br /> <br /> -Full degrees <br /> <br /> - For the sake of things not even related to her, just as everyone else can be happy. <br /> <br /> Come up with a commercial that was so good, it was on TV. The list goes on and on ... <br /> <br /> Ugh. She has no acting. She is always the perfect person. She acts on a snotty and rebellious and preppy and ... UGH! Can't stand her. <br /> <br /> Not only that, but everyone in the show always has good clothes. Even the north! Her wardrobe is better than mine, and mine is pretty freaking properly. <br /> <br /> Nobody cares if everyone at PCA loves you, Zoey, and will do anything for you, even if it means giving them their right arm. <br /> <br /> BUT regardless of these cardboard characters, the plots are creative. Not everyday things. They are interesting and amusing. The humor is usually good and of course, but the characters are such a paper level that it's hard to enjoy. <br /> <br /> This show will really be good if Dan Schnieder gives a little more time to think about the type. Point: Nobody is the least overweight, everyone has attractive clothes. Zoey is the definition of Mary-sue, The story lines are well thought out, and the humor is laughing. But again, I want to emphasize that the characters spoiled the show. Look at the show if you have to, but don't say I didn't warn you if your eyes were bleeding.
