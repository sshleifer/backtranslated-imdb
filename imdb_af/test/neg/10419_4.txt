"Yesterday" as a movie, it's hard to rate. The cinematography is excellent and earns a 9/10. The story is eager and real and does not compromise. But the translation of the story on the screen by the actors did not work with the camera. <br /> <br /> As a person born and raised in Central Africa, I appreciated the authenticity of the film's appearance and honesty. portraying daily life for the Zulu. But this and the camera work is not enough to recommend the average viewer to watch this movie. It appreciates true film and not just a love for movies to see the purpose and strength of "Yesterday". <br /> <br /> Unlike the 1980 film "The Gods Must Crazy", which was a comical look at an African culture that deals with modern technology, "Yesterday" is not going to have any crossover audience. to address. The movie is simply not suitable for the common western mind - and I doubt it was meant for the Western brain. The screens are long and slow, editing is not appropriate for a 60mph + instant gratification world. The dialogue is not vague or funny, it really is. Movies about health crises do not make the best of entertainment and this movie is not entertaining. This is education. <br /> <br /> This movie is best seen by those who know and appreciate the lifestyle and the culture in sub-Sarah Africa. If you don't have a broad enough worldview to understand other cultures, especially African cultures, this movie should be left over. Don't waste your time with it. Check out "Talladega Nights" or "Larry the Cable Guy" instead of your cross-cultural look. <br /> <br /> I give it a 4 for most people who may want to watch the movie but have no accurate understanding of African cultures. . For the viewers appreciating films about the human experience all over the world, I'd give it a 7.
