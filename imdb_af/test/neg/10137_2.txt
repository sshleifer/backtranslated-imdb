My parents may enjoy this show, but I don't find the humor in it. What is so funny about a dentist man who fertilizes his hygienic assistant and the oldest daughter is impregnated by the captain of the high school soccer team? Absolutely nothing! It's sometimes a shock to me that people today think is humor. Blame it on shows like "The Dating Game" and "The Newlywed Game" that highlighted the issue of sex in the mid-1960s. Sure, the series she touches moments, but it is no excuse for the content that went different in this series. It's nothing like the family-oriented days of "I love Lucy" about five decades before. <br /> <br /> An answer I should have why this series is playing on the cable channel is because the buyer's channel thinks women can relate to Reba's character! I absolutely don't like the character of Reba Hart's daughter, Kyra. She is best described as a ditsy and bitter teenager! Funny, I wonder if the actress who played Kyra; Scarlett Pomers is so away from acting in real life. Who plays the block-up ex-husband dentist, Christopher Rich, is not much better. Barbara Jean, played by Melissa Peterman, is in herself! The characters of Van and Cheyenne are also very annoying. <br /> <br /> Something else that baffles me is why the dingbat-of-a-range creator, Allison M. Gibson, decided to set the series where I live 25 miles away; Houston, Texas! Reba McEntire is not even from this state, she is an Oklahoman! Why is it decided, during one or more seasons, to make the accidental music sound like a pigtail? What I mean by that is where we hear this baritone saxophone is played with drums that accompany it, but the melodies are basically voiceless!
