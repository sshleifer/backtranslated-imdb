I bought this movie from the local family video on sale for $ 1.50, which was probably the first sign that it won't be good. To watch it with 2 friends, none of them even wanted to finish because of how terrible this movie is. I couldn't stop watching it. But this movie is definitely a textbook case of how not to make a movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple enough and sounds good: Chuck Norris has nightmares over a serial killer he sits behind bars. The serial killer escapes and his nightmares start to become reality again. Serial murder, Norris, roundhouse kick ... it sounds like a good movie. <br /> <br /> And some of them are pretty good. The play-back scene where a man breaks a ladder with his teeth is intense, a scene where a fan of a cliff falls and gets bruised is wonderful. And I learned how to get out of jail, with nothing more than Chapstick, gun powder and dentistry. flossing. But there is much wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> One: the editor is a moron. If you make an action or tension movie, you need to move the energy. There are too many scenes that are not essential to the plot left in this movie, which slows it down and distracts from the general story. At least 10 minutes could have been cut and the pacing would have improved and the movie would be slightly better. Two: The good man is a moron. Apparently, someone tried to film most of this movie in an area where you can't get decent sound, so most of the dialogue is voiced, the stereo is killed and not tied to the mouth. Also the music is too dramatic in some scenes. Three: The deciding director is a moron. They throw Billy Drago as a psychiatrist. Billy Drago is a great cult actor (from Brisco County, the Hills Have Eyes, and others) and would have made the right serial killer or some villain. His character is so vanilla that Drago's skills are wasted. Four: The author is a moron. Two stands are in this movie - the hunt for a serial killer and the romance between Norris and his pregnant girlfriend. Every time I see that woman on the screen, I want to knock out my eyes. And probably enough, she never plucked into the other plot, and made her story completely useless. <br /> <br /> Will I ever see it again? Can be. But unless they remaster this movie at least a dozen times, you should never. Not recommended.
