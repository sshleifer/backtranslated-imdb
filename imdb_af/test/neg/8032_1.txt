This movie just knocked. I know some people will say that anyone who thinks it isn't good just doesn't get it. "I like Wenders in American Friend and Wings of Desire. But it's absolutely craving. The main character is so annoying that I can't care less what he does. He's a bit like he did in another review. like a little annoying monkey, I couldn't stand him or force me to give in. This is the case with most characters who just have a hard time trying to be goofey or weird. I like the Mel Gibson character and the Milla Jovovich characters and wish they would have focused more on them, of course, Milla is beautiful, sorry and you really feel her and what she is and why she is the way she is, I see Gibson's character as almost Frankenstien I just wish he would have saved Milla and save the hotel with all the worthless, boring characters in it. Save Milla Rating 10 Movie review 0
