When I typed Savage Intruder into the IMDb's search engine, Savage Garden was: International Video Collection: The Story So Far (1999). The only reason I call it is because I am a great Savage Garden fan & you have to do yourself a favor and some of their music like Affirmation or To the Moon and Back rather than using this average pot boiler Too bad, sorry I just wanted to say it. In any case, Savage Intruder begins with a bizarre montage of what looks like MGM musical and premiere footage and some scripts that need no meaning in the long run. It is Hollywood's late 60's and amidst the brilliance and shine. A serial killer is at work to choose outdated actresses, kill them, and dissolve their bodies. A young man named Vic Valance (David Garfield as John David Garfield) picks up a tour bus looking for work at home of an actress, Katharine Parker (Miriam Hopkins), who is now one of the biggest stars of the movie ', but now resides in a large house with an elderly housekeeper named Mildred (Florence Lake), a personal secretary Leslie Blair (Gale Sondergaard) and a young girl named Geta (Virginia Wing). Katharine recently broke her foot and needed a personal assistant and gave Vic the job. Slowly Vic charms his way to Katharine's passions and more importantly her big purse. Vic started turning Katharine against the other employees, but Vic wasn't what he looked like. Vic is a drug addict wage Greta conceives while still having sex with Katharine. Greta threatens to tell Katharine and fancies Vic's devastating plans, but she has a close encounter with an ax. No one in the house is safe, as Vic brings drugs, sex, rock'n'roll party and gardening to the Parker mansion while his sinister plan begins to become more and more clear ... <br /> <br /> Written, produced and directed by Donald Wolfe I thought Savage Intruder was a bit of a mess, but a little entertaining at the same time. The writing is everywhere and it can't really decide what it wants, Savage Intruder suffers from an identity crisis! The movie begins with the discovery of a cut head and limbs, immediately after another woman (Dorothy Kingston) was killed by a mysterious unknown figure, but then it is the slasher movie elements that have just built it up. not gone back. Savage Intruder then becomes a kind of good movie as Vic's friends with Katharine and shows her how to enjoy life again. With an implied sexual relationship with her, it is actually uncomfortable to think because she is old enough to be his grandmother. Katharine stops living the life of a drink and gives up alcohol while Vic seems to be happy when they go and hold festivals for Katharine's friend, as she also used. This part of the Savage Intruder will not look into a Disney movie! Sometimes the tedium of the good-goods is interrupted by firing Vic and having his dominee over his mother (Sybelle Guardino) and cutting out her hand with an ax. He also has sex at one point with Great. Then, after Greta was murdered, Savage Intruder becomes a bizarre horror movie, as Vic is being revealed for the reward he is. Savage Intruder just doesn't feel good as a movie, as it mixes several genres with little success. Likewise, the murder mystery elements don't work and is it a mystery, why are the adults hiding the killer identity during the murder scene, but does it make it absolutely clear who they mean in the rest of the movie anyway? Vic as a character has also not worked for me, one moment he is a cool, calm, smart and devious man and then he is a messy angry! Why are all his other victims killed, but with Katharine trying to confront her? What makes her so different? If that's because she has money, why not go to her to start with? So many questions and so few answers ... Some of the 60's dialogue is pretty funny to listen to these days, such as when Vic Greta offers a painkiller, in fact hard drugs, and Greta says: "What do I have a painkiller? need? ", Vic kindly" because your pain "wow, this man knows how to charm the ladies! Or when Katharine suggests that Vic gardening and asking, "Do you have green fingers?" He replies, "No, but I'm good on grass!" There are not many gores in Savage Intruder, a few cut limbs and a few stripped heads. There is also a pretty impressive shot when someone has cut off their hand with an ax that is likely to be repeated three or four times. The foolish looking drug hallucination scenes should be seen to be believed. Technically Savage Intruder is OK, the location filming in the grandiose mansion & Hollywood hills probably gives it better than it deserves, the acting is average as the rest of the production. In general, I want to say Savage Intruder feels like trying to be a murder mystery that unfortunately gives away the murderer and as a result it just doesn't work. It's a fun entertaining one-time watch at the best and a complete mess of a movie at worse, you decide which one!
