Deadly contact: Bird flu in America: 3 out of 10: This movie is both funny and sad. The funny part is pretty obvious, as it is certainly not a sober look at a potential threatening crisis. This is a modern version of The Swarm. And as many as the murderers' bees (and the so-called killer bee crisis they asked) bird flu at a pantheon of the media-inspired end of the world scenarios (SARS, Y2K, Global Warming) which simply refuse to really reach. /> <br /> The sad part is the blatant effort of the filmmakers to inspire panic. Disease pandemics were historically quite common after all people did not die from heart disease in their forties. Even recent pandemics such as AIDS reflect the old-fashioned VD crisis (Dink syphilis) that used to kill more soldiers than dots. <br /> <br /> The influenza pandemic of the early twenties was a nasty business killing millions, but life was honest. on. I wonder if our dramatic media and their power hungry government allies would allow life as normal today. <br /> <br /> The movie itself blows a lot of pretty skillful scenes (Triage in Grand Central Station) to the ridiculous (Rednecks try) to trap the national guard in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> The scenarios themselves are pretty useless, because the filmmakers don't look exactly how infectious the bird flu is, or whether the symptoms are an Ebola downpour. or simply a long illness. Indeed, one scene will show everyone in bio-danger packs and the next one won't even wear a mask. <br /> <br /> The film also refuses to give practical advice on what to do in a bird flu crisis. (Outside was your hands washed, what was the band?) The acting and direction are capable of a TV movie, but the writing is across the map. Lastly, the movie has a strange non-exponential death rate on the bottom of the screen. Just like the Swarm.
