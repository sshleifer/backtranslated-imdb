The definition scene for this movie is when the fat man stops, but the evil doctor just gives him one duty, look at the dinosaurs. Keep in mind that he no longer has this job and it is absolutely not paid. Keep in mind that this is a divine dinosaur and the doctor he is supposed to trust is angry and doesn't like him. But he's still like, yes okay. It just defined the stupidity in this movie. One Melissa Brasselle proves it's serious that someone can bolt some breasts and be in movies. I can ride a mountain bike between them, but hey in addition, the people of Paraguay are very beautiful. Honor Roberts gives his absolute worst performance so far, there is no adjective to describe how bored he is. Corbin Bernsen strikes what is there to save and you start rooting for him, but of course they should stick to the formula. And I wonder how much your life sucks when you play, one of the army guys in this one? How low can your stage run? The special effects are so embarrassed It's not even fair pulp, it's all taken from 'Carnosaur', which even sucked on its own. And then I wonder why just someone might make a sign to make a sign. Movie.
