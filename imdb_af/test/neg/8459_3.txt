Pointless and beautiful, silly movie that is basically a compilation of clips from horror, science fiction and suspense movies. There are unnecessary shots for an audience watching the tracks and Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen are among the audience who go to the camera and explain why we like horror movies. Not a bad idea, but all the explanations are obvious ("movie horror helps us deal with real horrors", "you're in the grace of the movie maker in a theater") and pretty tough. Also the cuts are shown very quickly and the changes are kind of shooting. And, out of context, these bits are not scary at all. And it's really short - I saw it in a theater in 1984 and was furious that I paid $ 5.00 for an 84 minute movie! <br /> <br /> However, it is fairly well edited and Allen and Pleasance enjoy themselves. For people interested in knowing more about terror, it can be fun and interesting. But if you're a horror fan (like me), you'll probably be bored. Good idea, bad execution (no pun intended). I give it a 3.
