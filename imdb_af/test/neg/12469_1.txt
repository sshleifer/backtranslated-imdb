Basic structure of a story: Begin, Middle, End. <br /> <br /> Sometimes this structure is played, and we get Memento or Irreversible and the story plays backwards. Sometimes it's just not linear, a la pulp fiction. Regardless, they all have a beginning, middle and end. <br /> <br /> It's the first movie I've ever seen that didn't stop. <br /> <br /> Starting: Meisie's best friend was suspended. <br /> <br /> Medium: Girl needs to handle without best friend. <br /> <br /> End: Not exist. <br /> <br /> Not that an end would have This movie was saved, but at least it would be complete. <br /> <br /> This is an exercise in apathy; we get a party mix of characters, and they all seem to be dudes. Drilling, in vain, flight and pallid counterfeit people. <br /> <br /> And here's the action in this movie: nothing happens. Nothing happens. Mischa Barton tries to speak with a spicy English accent, Dominique Swain eats a lot and Brad Renfro gets a slap of an old guy. End of the movie. <br /> <br /> By the time the credits rolled, I had a horrible feeling that many prisoners should feel: periods, the precious minutes of our lives, were just wasted. <br /> <br /> The only prudent point (and it's only a very impressive one) is Brad Renfro. He does well. Lacey Chabert I tend to like it, but no luck here. Due to good work in other films, I will forgive Mischa Barton this travesty, but I hope all cast members are slapped in the face for their involvement. <br /> <br /> Please, I beg you. Avoid. Don't fool yourself into thinking: "I'll make up my own mind". My sister told me to never see it, and I ignored her and wanted to make my own thoughts. It was a bad decision. <br /> <br /> I've never hated a movie. There is a lot I don't like, but I've never hated a movie. Until I saw it.
