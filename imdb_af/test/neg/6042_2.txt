Someone said WEBS is much like an episode from SLIDERS, and I have to agree. Spoilers: I never liked the actors at Sliders, and rarely saw it, unless nothing better. WEBS is the kind of movie to see if you have no other choices. Read a book. WEBS had those kind of TV actors who seem to be there as part of their PROBATION or employment program. Some low-budget TV movies have actors who at least look enthusiastic. The actors in WEBS look like they pay minimum wages and work on a clock. They have that desperate, "The-Paycheck-Better-Not-Bounce" look. The Queen Spider looks good, except it is rarely seen, and there are no other spiders (and no webs). The Queen Spider bites people, and they become Spider Zombies, which means they are trying to keep their eyes open when they attack the people. The people are fighting each other for various reasons, and they are not sympathetic. After meeting all the people, I would have recommended the charming school to the characters. All that WEBS makes me feel was APATHY. I was numb to the characters, and hoped for some interesting gores and special effects. The gore was minimal, and the special effects were reserved for the ugly spinning queen that looks good. If WEBS had a lot of Spider Creatures eating people, it would have been more entertaining. Apparently, they can only budget "spin-zombies". "WEBS is a sad entry to the SPIDER-oriented movies. It can qualify as the worst Spider movie ever, because Eight-Legged Freaks had great special effects.
