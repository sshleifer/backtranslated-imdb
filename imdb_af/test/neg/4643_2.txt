I know that Full Moon, or any other movie studio for the case, could never recover the fun and cheesy scientific feelings that the original "Trancers" were. And with the last two entries in the series that Jack Deth had in the Middle Ages instead of futuristic Los Angeles, it became clear that there was really little hope of reviving the Trancers series. Breathing a new life into a movie is one thing, but taking our main character out of his element and putting him in the past has not worked! So now, with Trancers 6, Full Moon has so much new life in the series that we don't even go with Jack Deth any more. We're going with his daughter, Jo. Jack is in her body and has to go back in the past and fight the Trancers again. <br /> <br /> * MINOR SPOILER: FIRST SCENE OF THE MOVIE REPEAT * <br /> <br /> To prove how bad this movie is, you only have to watch the first two minutes of the movie when the movie original Jack Deth appears on the screen. But it's not actually Tim Thomerson. These are clips of him and banded sounds (trust me, you can say they've been excavated) to give the viewer the last of the real Jack Deth humor. And from that point on, things are just going down hill. To have this girl, Jo Deth, as our main character, while Jack Deth should be in her body, is the worst idea in the world. Acting this cute young woman as a rough and difficult man is not the right way! It doesn't work and it really comes out foolish. <br /> <br /> I don't go into the aspects of special effects and make-up, because most read it know what has become Full Moon: A real, really, low budget venture. I don't know what to say about this movie except what I really want to be Full Moon as it was in the days of Demonic Toys, Puppet Master and Trancers 1. When the special effects were not good, the story told was. They made serious b-movies for serious B-movie and horror fans, and this doesn't happen today with the new Full Moon Studios. I long for the good oil days and really hope the Full Moon can pull itself out of this terrible slump they are now entering. <br /> <br /> Trancers 6 get 2 out of 10.
