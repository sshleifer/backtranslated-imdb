Corny and some very bad plays, but for a Golan Globus movie about the same. See this movie back in 1985 mostly because I liked sword and magic movies (what did I think?). Arnold is playing a high gentleman who tries to make sure an ancient talisman is destroyed before it destroys the world. Belitte Nielsen is the title character who was Sly's girlfriend and a very bad actress. women who can't play low budget B movies. Brigitte chews it up as Sonya and Arnold acts as Lord Kalidor. There is also Sandahl Bergman (who was in the original Conan movie as Valeria) here she plays the evil Queen Gedren, a clear camp for her Conan role. And then one of the most annoying child actors on the screen (not reyes) is Prince Tarn, who had been hard and sent to bed. Pouring a little annoying. Some of the sword fights aren't too bad, but the music really sucks. Special effects are cheap and look like 70's, like the explosion of the evil queen's castle in the climax of the movie. <br /> <br /> Generally, a very low parody is a breeze, but b filmmakers can keep it for his campus.
