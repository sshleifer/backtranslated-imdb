John Madden's cinematic interpretation of Edith Wharton's Ethan Frome is not right on a large literary piece. While the story is maintained, the elements that give the senses its soul are skewed and lost in the film. Madden fails to convey the innocence and the total tragedy of Ethan and Mattie's relationship instead of converting it into a morality story. The point is missed and the point lost in additional details and poor dialogue. Zeena (Zenobia) in the book is almost entirely the antagonist, the book of least sympathetic figure, where in the movie she can almost be fed, even if it is a piece you feel bad about being informed this sick woman . The book describes Zeena's tyrannical control of the house and Ethan more accurately. The movie just rejected me. The addition of the fox was pointless as well as the scene with Mattie trying to kill herself. It was just poorly interpreted and done. Movie Errors: Ethan's ecstasy in the church dance scene, interactions with Denis Eady, addition of love image, fox scene, shop scene, say his plans allowed, lack of exhibits of Ethan's inner emotions and thoughts, introduction of the priest instead of unnamed engineer, leaves much to Zeena's knowledge of the growing relationship in which the novel reader never knows what Zeena thinks or is aware of. Just too many mistakes and poor straightforward decisions.
