I can't believe this horrible movie was made by the same people who made Lepa Sela Lepo Gore. Look it over and skip it. The plot is clogged and the characters are mostly two-dimensional stereotypes. I suspect that the editor went halfway through the movie because fast, slack cuts appeared that confused things rather than brighten them. The end doesn't make sense either. <br /> <br /> It is predominantly a propaganda film made so that Serbs can feel sorry for themselves and America disregard for the 1999 NATO bombings. They do so by continuing to lie about the Serbs' being our allies during World War II, the whole world claims to be unfair to them and ignores everything Slobodan Milosevic said, such as waging war with three neighboring countries. They seem to make a political film, but show only a few seconds from Milosevic on a TV screen without sound. Of course, a nationalist agenda replaced a consideration of art that was not the case with Lepa Sela. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I recommended this movie to a teacher when it was played at the Seattle International Film Festival last week. He also quoted the bad editing and confusing plot, and I had to apologize for the bad advice. You're warned.
