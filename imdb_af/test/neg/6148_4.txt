My overall feeling about this movie is that it was a slow, protracted, structurally wandered through some of the world's truly unhappy situations with a little redemption and a clear message. The film is made up of fairly uninteresting video films from the countries he visits with bad reenactments, which slowly fades into a snail and becomes overloaded with depressed music. Certainly some of the material and interviews contain some compelling stories, but contrary to what the description suggests, it was not so much the victim's story being told, as it was the director's story. Ripper is, and he does not say this is good. This movie could have included longer, better interviews with the people themselves, so they told their stories. Instead, Mr. Of course, ripping the story to himself, making it a kind of personal journey, and unfortunately it doesn't get much of one. I never really got a sense of growth as he researched the subject, and he never pointed out what had taken the subject in the first place. He just dragged us from one place to the next, brushing lightly on the situation and characters, hanging around and showing too many unconscious, slow-moving footage of people just walking in the streets and then moving to his next destination. He does it over, and over, and again without any real development. I felt that this movie could be cut to 45 minutes, but it is explained to make close to 2 difficult slow hours. We feel morally obliged to take care of the subject, but the director's self-reliant, tortuous, memorable delivery of his journey makes you fade after a while.
