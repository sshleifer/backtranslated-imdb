To paraphrase the previous reviewer's comments, if you are a Stooges fan, avoid this one at all costs! My basic question is, if the experienced troops were comedy that Moe and Larry were, why did they insist on continuing the action when it was so clear that their home studio, Columbia, was so clearly not interested in giving them serious writers and veteran comedy directors? This movie plays like someone who gives a pale imitation of the trio and you can see how very hard Tire and Larry work to make every little piece of slapstick relevant. Joe De Rita, despite his background in Vaudeville, is not at work as a replacement for Curly, Shemp or even Joe Besser. If that is what Moe and Larry have left to choose from, they just had to shop and enjoy their retirement years. Let our fans with better memories of better-performing movies they did earlier. Always let them loose is the motto for comedy and always stop while you are up. So, Seinfeld leaves the sitcom while he is up there, instead of holding on to the inevitable decline.
