For all the role players who worked on this apology for a movie, another payday in L.A. For any audience requiring a fair return on admission, a huge waste of time and money. The saddest aspect of this ugly exercise (to me) is that we watch an extremely talented actor, Pacino, who apparently plays a parody of himself. That's what stayed with me as a total mystery. I can fully understand the need for film industry people to work and make such a life. What I don't understand is an artist of Al Pacino's talent that satisfies him with this level of senseless mess. Hopefully he will choose better value projects in the future ... and for value, save your time and hard earned money. Skip it! Let's send Hollywood and All a message.
