This 'documentary' does not shed any light on what it would be like to be back during the Hard Knock Life tour. Granted, I wasn't there, but I didn't watch this movie. And for a movie like this, it's not exactly a compliment. All the time I watched it, everything I could think of was, "What are they doing?" When it's over, the only rapper you feel like is insight into DMX, and it's mainly because he just talks about his dogs. A waste of time. <br /> <br /> 3/10
