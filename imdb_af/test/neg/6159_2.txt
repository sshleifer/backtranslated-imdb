This movie was strange mainly because the plot was so incoherent. The title refers to an evil wind that makes the surface of the earth almost uninhabitable when it blows, but it has nothing to do with what is going on. The movie seems to be a very bad rip-off of Bladerunner, ie rogue android is driven by bounty hunter (or ruthless cop in this). Luke Skywalker turns in a surprisingly good performance as the former rogue cop. Nothing seems to be solved at the end of the movie, we never find anything of any substance about the Android or its intentions. There's a shocking scene where Bill Paxton (who kidnapped the android) plays a specific song in his cardboard plane for no particular reason. The song is called "Shape of Things" by The Yardbirds. This happens again in a later scene where the same song is played for no clear reason. Does this song have any relevance to the movie? Don't think so.
