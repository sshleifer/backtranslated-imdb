All in all, don't expect much and you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> And if you want to see a movie that takes you back to 1983, it'll surely do it. The only reason I gave this movie 2 points more than it deserves is for 2 reasons: <br /> <br /> # 1. Michael Caine <br /> <br /> # 2.the people, the Brazil's sights, culture and music <br /> <br /> The film is almost entirely worn by Caine, as he tends to make the seemingly impossible task of turning it into a viable and semi-credible story. Even Joe Bologna and Valerie Harper pick cards. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is pure class, as always. In addition to a gifted classical and comic actor, Caine brings a mix of introspection, viciousness and sensitivity to every movie he does ... the focus of his charm as far back as his role in Alfie ... and why he the Academy award for Hannah and her Sisters 2 years later. In this farce he is cheating ... funny and vulnerable ... melancholy and sentimental .... and besides the jewel Rio de Janeiro is the only reason not to look for a better form of entertainment . <Br /> <br /> Well ... maybe a look at the 2 lovely young actresses, Michelle Johnson and Demi Moore, would be a reason. But look, that's all you can do with Michelle. Although her outlook is hardly dated, there may be no more painful movie experience than trying to act. Demi's acting and look is 100 times better and you can transplant her as easily as in a movie today (she really doesn't look quite different from being honest). Mrs Moore is certainly unused, especially since she was the larger star of the 2. <br /> <br /> Save the fact that it's a stupid farus, in the end, I'm actually like the maturity with which all these people deal with this scandalous situation ... that it doesn't end friendships or marriages and that a relationship, even with your best friend's minor daughter, can be forgiven and everyone can continue. The injured parties show anger and disappointment about what happened, but everything works for the best .... a little unrealistic, but surprisingly refreshing. Hope is always.
