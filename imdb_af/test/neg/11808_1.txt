The video box for 'Joyride' says "the main roles of the second-generation superstars," and one can't help but feel sad. Granted, Melanie Griffith went for bigger and better things ... but who cares for the rest of the cast? So, with the pathetic touch on the box, I was foolish enough to buy the movie for a dollar that I think would be the bad-good 70 movie. Eh, not so much. While so many purposeful 70's youth films (or equally cute 70's movies) have tried so hard to say something deep and meaningful, "Joyride" doesn't even try. It's just aimless. It's without any interest. Every character is so badly noticed that it is not surprising that these actors seem so lethargic. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, the movie is about three 20-somethings going to Alaska to start a business, but instead is robbed and then found work. They are made up, eat dog food, steal cars, rob banks. It's all very typical, but in addition, it's done in the most common way. There are no surprises and the flow is so bad and the actions of the characters are so ambiguous that you can miss out on several scenes and not care. <br /> <br /> But if you're a fan of Melanie Griffith's breasts - then it's a must-see. It's still not enough to get it above the lowest score I can give. <br /> <br /> Best Line: "Jesus, everything is biology with you." * from ****
