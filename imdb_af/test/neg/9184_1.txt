"Wagons East" is known as John Candy's last movie, when he died on the seat. It's just what makes it so sad: not only that Candy had a fatal heart attack, but it was on the set of such a crummy movie. I don't really know what they thought when they got this piece, but the movie has NO redeeming features. It's as if they've taken every unused script for dumb western and just mixed and filmed them together. No wonder John Candy wanted to make the movie; Perhaps his contractual participation was what he did. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the point is that Candy performed much better than that during his career. To be sure, he has already completed Michael Moore's "Canadian Bacon" in which the United States declared war in Canada. Just stick to that one and you can say that Candy ended his career honorably. As for Richard Lewis - who co-died earlier with Candy in Eugene Levy's absurd but hilarious "Once Upon a Crime" - he has been counting regularly with Keith Olbermann for the past few years.
