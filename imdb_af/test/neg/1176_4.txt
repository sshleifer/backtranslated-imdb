I watched this movie pretty confused. I'm not sure if it was trying to be a horror party in a kind of Rob Zombie type or an exploration of real events. <br /> <br /> In both cases it missed its point. This is not particularly historically accurate, as characters are chopped and changed for the sake of the story. <br /> <br /> The shows weren't compelling or bad. <br /> <br /> For me, I would have preferred a more psychological approach and this movie could easily go off this trail without spoiling the overall effect.
