Take the secret agent / James Bond craze of the sixties, mixing in some concepts of Sax Rohmer's female Fu Manchu femme fatale and stirring an absurdly twisted revisionism by director Franco - you have the man-hate lesbian Sumuru, or "The 7 Secrets of ... - better known as "The Girl From Rio" in the US, remembers "That Man From Rio", which has nothing to do with it. Yes, it is in Brazil, we have to give it. Sumuru, or Sumitra as she is also called, is like an evil version of "Modesty Blaise" played by actress Eaton with the well-known celebrity that most of us first announced in Goldfinger. There are many close-up photos of her staring camera, which slowly opens her mouth, probably while watching something unpleasant (however, she is doubling in her key lesbian scene). She manages a whole army of female warriors, bought colorful, and governs a city called Femina or something (just outside Rio de Janeiro?). These concepts, which previously appeared in "The Million Eyes of Sumuru", sound great, but, despite an intriguing set design and visual, it follows the same camping atmosphere of, for example, the very dated "Some Girls Do" that came from the same time and also had a female army. At first glance, the eyes of all these armed women, who are usually in the queue, see your interest, but after 15 minutes you realize that there is nothing but compiling the visuals. <br /> <br /> The plot follows what looks like a secret agent, a man who arrives in Brazil with $ 10 million. He draws the attention of the local crime commander (Sanders, picks it up as an elderly Bond-type villain), who sends in the bowler hats with dark suitcases. This sets everything up for a three-pronged conflict between the agent, the crime officer and the mysterious Sumuru (the crime master wants Sumura's secrets). Sumuru also holds several prisoners in glass cages - perhaps it is one of the secrets. It sounds exciting, but there are problems that go beyond a slow pace; There are many shots that made a lot of excitement. For example, one shot of an aircraft remains on the vessel, as it stops, as if it had never been captured on film before. There is a similar approach to a typical sunset, as if something unusual about it. The battle scenes are very substandard, as if the filmmakers had to use the first tasks. To add some production value, there is a play of the real Rio carnival about halfway. I guess there were several budget problems, especially in the climatic battle, where fake sound effects and smoke were covered, are very deceptive actions, such as the lack of equally real guns. It calls the times when children use plastic guns and pretend that the bullets are being dropped, convincingly. There are feelings of sadism, such as interfering with a character to get answers, and female nudity, an early representation of such, after some limitations have been lifted. But mostly you roll your eyes. Hero: 3 Villains: 5 Femme Fatales: 5 Henchmen: 4 Fighting: 3 Stunts / Chases: 3 Gadgets: 4 Cars: 4 Places: 6 Pace: 3 Overall: 4
