Doll Master is an example of a bad horror movie, somewhere in space case with two not so well-established genres, a horror movie and an emotional drama movie. Looks like The Doll Master is trying very hard to be a horrible horror movie, but it fails. The sound of the dolls as you move is as taken from Kayako in Ju-On, and the creeps are like sadako esquire. The murderers will remember you a cute version of "Chucky". But compared to Child's Play, this movie is better. But the story looks nothing, the brilliant camera shots and the brilliance of acting are the cause of the plot taken away. <br /> <br /> Don't see it when you expect big shocks.
