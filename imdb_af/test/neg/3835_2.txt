I admit it now. This is one of the lambs ever made. But in Mr Sjogren's defense, the "Not really" scene was not bad! <br /> <br /> And you have to go to Sweden just to find a lovely Swedish 15-year-old blonde, speak her Swedish as the Jewish mother of Henry (dennis hopper). <br /> <br /> What makes this scene so perfect is that Henry's father answers the blonde Swedish-speaking (Jewish) girl in German ... <br /> <br /> The best actor / actress of all in The movie must be the nun who cares for Henry's mother, it is a woman who has no experience, but continues to be the most convincing achievement of all! <br /> <br /> Everything and everything, this Flick is nostalgic for me personally, that's what gave me a post on IMDb's database. : D <br /> <br /> // Feelin like a movie star *
