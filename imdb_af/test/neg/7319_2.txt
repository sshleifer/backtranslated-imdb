Romance is the story of a man who loses everything except his incredible friend and an idea for a maize dog he plans to patent and sell. Immediately, his uncle dies and leaves him a home and a car, and he gets a few householders to help pay the rent and get work. Then his girlfriend gets drunk and cheats him, so he goes and writes a book about roommates and becomes known. <br /> <br /> 88 minutes. None of these details of the plot are investigated in any detail. What you read above is more or less as interesting as the movie will be. When his uncle dies, there are breasts on the screen, one of the potential roommates he is interviewing is about 40 seconds funny. The end is literally the worst I have ever seen. I want the other 87 minutes of my life back! <br /> <br /> I didn't think anyone could make a movie with so little earnings. Surely there are rules against this kind of thing that is made available to the public? The script cannot be longer than twenty pages, and the budget should be trivial because the entire movie has about 3 places and a car. The only conceivable use for the Roman is, in my opinion, if you hold someone hostage and want to frustrate them beyond human thought. If so, get it on repeat and you will have a ready-made wreck in the day. <br /> <br /> one and a half out of 10
