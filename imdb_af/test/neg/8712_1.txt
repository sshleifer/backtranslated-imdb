I almost fell asleep during a show. From a boring story that seems eternal, it follows a few days in the life of a male prostitute who falls in love with one of his tricks. After a heated case, the trick leaves a long letter explaining why they can't be together and how they should go in their separate ways. <br /> <br /> The male prostitute then goes on a downward self-destruction spiral trying to find. she "one true love", repeatedly returning to the same places they visited, looking for more clues or signs about where he can find his love. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, he ends up with one ugly man (who I thought was also a male prostitute), a gay basher, and a guy who had a three-second sex session with him. A back stitch ended. <br /> <br /> It never ceases to surprise me how films still portray random sex acts as scenes that can take place in a short moment of seconds, as in this case where the trick has hardly washed up his pants before he pressed and experienced orgasm wonderfully! <br /> <br /> All these random encounters end up with the sexual partner, and ask him to call them, then dispose of their phone numbers. <br /> <br /> There is a short margin in which the main character visits his busy mother who seems to have no time for his lifestyle. There is also a brief summary of some random conversations with a young woman who saw him several times on the bridge of her window. And there is also a brief overview of him who shows the letter to a male expert, but the audience is not advised to have his relationship with this person. <br /> <br /> Neither of these things really works with each other, just to show us how lost and confused this young man is. He seems to live life like a ghost. There was one good play in the entire movie that involved him with a site sale that was looking for a specific record with the world's saddest song. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this movie just looks forever. Filmed in black and white, it may look very dreamy, but for about two hours in the theater it will look like a nightmare! <br /> <br /> I found that the end was confusing as I wasn't. Isn't it sure if the young man died and went to heaven? It would be a great discount to end the misery that both the audience and the main character had to endure in this meaningless trip. But since it is an "independent film", movies with endings like this should encourage you to use your imagination. <br /> <br /> For those of you who are looking for nudity, there are only short plays and most of them are filmed in such a way that everything that is obvious is hidden within the shade. In other words, don't waste your time with this one. <br /> <br /> My rating - 2 out of 10
