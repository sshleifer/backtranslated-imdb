Author-director Emilio Estevez shows a definite shortage of talent here with this inseparable, supposed comedy. The writing is completely hopeless, let alone the fact that it worked inexorably and poorly. The comedy just doesn't work. When Estevez does not taste bad sex jokes, he uses loans and uses them very badly. You'd think Estevez's team and brother Charlie Sheen would be cool ... but ... it's not. <br /> <br /> The whole role is uninspired and unfunny, never running to lift a laugh, and barely a smile from their audience. Do yourself a favor and leave this one on the video. <br /> <br /> Thursday, June 25, 1992 - Video
