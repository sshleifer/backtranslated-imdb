Although it is very promising, a woman in a car in the middle of the forest winds around dark roads until she almost hits a man with a lizard! It gave me the impression that we would see something special, something almost David Lynchian (if there is such a term), but unfortunately the movie starts everywhere, without a core center, just a winding story about a woman trying to solve a mystery from a small town. The character study is all over the place, and I couldn't really care about any of the characters it looks like, especially if some of the story suddenly goes into the back mode. I had a little hope for this movie, but it was a bit of a fall.
