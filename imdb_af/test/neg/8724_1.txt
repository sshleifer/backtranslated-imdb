This is the "Battlefield Earth" of the mini series. It has, with a few exceptions, all the disastrous ingredients that condemned that movie and will follow it to the grave in the turkey cemetery. They are both adaptations of books with an endless number of pages altered by a scriptwriter and director to a complete mess. In this case, they are the same person. They clearly don't know what they are doing both have a messiah wannabe that doesn't really deliver as a hero (played in this case by a man who looks like Mark Hamill, but unfortunately the power isn't with him.) And A lot of stupid bad guys who like to betray and destroy life for each other, they both have scenes stolen from better productions and they are both cheap productions trying to look expensive with some (often weak) computer animation. The exceptions that really make the whole thing worse are the terrible work being done by the lighting man, who doesn't even have the skills to turn on the light in his own living room, working the camera that has been tilted for no reason at all no. Battlefield Earth mode, but most of the time is flat like a pancake, the extremely cheap and small desert set containing just a heap of sand in front of a desert painted wallpaper. It gets very old very quickly. because it appears in almost every scene, and the bad idea by the costume designer tries to imitate the fashion frenzy of the fifth element with the addition of the silliest hats ever made. Just moments to remember: 1. Every scene with the guild guys, who look like MST3K's acting guys, but with stupid hats. 2. Irulan appears at the party dressed in her butterfly clothes. (Why were the birds? Was the one with stuffed parrots in the cleaner?) With an appropriate silly hat, along with a few guys with stupid balloon hats. 3. Paul the stand-up comedian. 4. Baron Harkonnen in more than an exaggerated cry, shouted, "I, I live". 5. Every scene with the background, because it fits newer in the foreground. 6. Every scene with the Fremen's false religious ministers, especially the "water of life" fair. 7. The battle scenes where the same guys are killed a few times and the same things explode over and over. It's a lot more, but it's a 1000-word limit on this, so I better stop before I get carried away.
