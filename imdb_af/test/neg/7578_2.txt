I don't know, but the movie was just too similar to other movies I saw. The Ring, The Eye, Dark Water, they are all the same to me. Don't get me wrong, it's beautiful, beautiful camera work, good graphics, but the story is just too general. In the end, this is the score that makes the tension, you know: the screaming, rumbles. The characters in the movie do not react very naturally, move very slowly, surprised by everything they see. I know some people who love this kind of movie, and if you do, a well-made movie, I don't think it hurts to see it. But if you saw the movie I mentioned above and didn't like them, then I suggest you don't bother.
