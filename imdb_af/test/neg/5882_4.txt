The Hebrew Hammer is a clever idea that is wasted because execution is poor. As if this is often the case with iconoclastic humor, it is too much on indignation to generate laughter, which is simply not enough. Poor taste humor has two elements: poor taste and humor - and both are needed here, but the humor is fairly scarce. Consequently, it is often painful to watch, all the more because of good efforts by the artists, especially Adam Goldberg and the HH itself. The Shaft references, however, are funny, but only for those who know those movies, and they certainly don't carry the Hebrew Hammer. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that many jokes rely on knowledge of American Jewish culture, and many in the audience will simply not understand the jokes.
