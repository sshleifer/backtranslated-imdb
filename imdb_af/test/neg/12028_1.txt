It was honestly the worst movie I've ever seen. The acting was terrible, the story line was also bad. However, this was a good idea. If this movie were to have better filmmaking, and much better actors, I might have something better to say. Edgar Allen Poe was a great Gothic writer, and this movie just ruined it. why people should always kill good stories by making bad movies. The only good part was when the killer put the head under the floor with a band going, it was pretty good. the swing ax was just awful, there was absolutely no tension. And even when the killer finally drove everyone around, he went from one place to another within seconds, making absolutely no sense.
