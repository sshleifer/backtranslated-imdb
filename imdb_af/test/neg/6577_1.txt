What about studios like Paramount who have a tried and tested series of movies and figure it out with budget and formula? Paramount spends less on this movie than they did on TMP. It doesn't sound bad until you realize that there is a gap between the films made. The cost of the $ 40 TMP would be equivalent to about $ 75 million in 1989. This film is why Shatner has never been given a fair chance to target other films. Every time he turned around, the studio cut the budget and made demands on the storyline. The fact that it was the one storyline that Roddenberry and Shatner generally agreed with, made the provider's direct job hard enough, but after all the edits were made, everyone who eventually ended up was an uneven story and a cargo poorly carried. special effects not worthy of the original series, much less a big movie. The most striking examples: - All Phaser effects are heavily saturated and fake. - The lap of the Enterprise entering the big barrier was so clear that a zoom frame shot was stormed. At least the popsicle stick that the Enterprise cut out was successfully cut off. - God "chase" Kirk on the mountain ... Egadse, they can also only cut Godzilla shots in the volcano at the end of "Godzilla 1985", and use thumbnails to scratch the emulsion of the film to make electric Bolts come out of his eyes at the disturbed Captain Kirk .... Yes, friends, I have a real problem with the appearance of the last scene, especially. <br /> <br /> Thanks, Star Trek VI was such a savior of a movie ...
