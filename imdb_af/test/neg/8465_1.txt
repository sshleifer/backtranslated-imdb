Five fingers rely heavily on barbaric, shocking Hollywood tactics to apparently trigger a positive movie-sensing reaction. This is where this movie fails throughout, mainly because it is too graphic to be taken seriously. I was apostate and disgusted that Five Fingers were even made, and I had to force myself to continue to watch it. Torture in and of itself is gruesome. Even the sounds that come from a room where someone is tortured are gruesome. But the makers of this stinker of a movie clearly felt it wasn't enough. It had to go far beyond what was necessary, and simply and effectively threw the chance this movie had to make a kind of valid point. For this reason, this movie has nothing more than to be self-pleasing. Five Fingers also establish themselves in a B-movie, just by his concession on the manipulation of time. In other words, we are shown the present and then the past is revealed in snippets. It's a bit of a normal Hollywood manipulation of time. While the viewer is normally shown pages 95 in a 100-page script as the beginning of the movie, and then the rest of the movie is essentially the end of it, Five Fingers are devoted to flashing back, which at the end of the movie. In general, Five Fingers made me feel foolish about watching the whole movie, because torture is, of course, obscene, and it was certainly not necessary to use graphic mutilation to make this point. I'm surprised that Dick Cheney didn't even get a guest like a torture superhero. This movie is a perfect example of what happens when an important subject falls into the hands of greedy, senseless daggers.
