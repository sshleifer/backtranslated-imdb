Well, it certainly was a waste of Dave McKean's talents, wasn't it? Don't Understand Me: When it comes to graphic design, Dave McKean can be the best in the world. The layered, structured look he can achieve with just a few pencil lines on rough paper makes the efforts of people like Peter Greenaway and David Fincher look like they are: hackwork. McKean is the godfather of a revolution in the appearance of comics, film, even magazine advertisements that lend the distinctive collage effect he has learned as a pioneer. <br /> <br /> But this movie? It's mess. Complete junk. The story, by Neil Gaiman, is unfortunately exactly what Gaiman has given us since then, when he tore off Clive Barker for the first time: a pseudo-mythical, overwhelming dream image populated by characters who have titles in all capitals, rather than . Everything is allegory, to the point that it is impossible to get any human drama, emotion or empathy from anyone involved. People make spicy postulations, talking in riddles that keep in mind what Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead might have sounded like Tom Stoppard suffered halfway through his composition. Really, Gaiman, come over yourself. You are not a prophet. You're a poser. <br /> <br /> McKean's direction doesn't help - his pacing is poor, takes up half an hour to actually set himself up for the main picnic plot and then just a seperated sequence of events, none of them having any given weight. The monsters do not threaten because they are not shadowed, just thrown on the screen. The plot doesn't get involved, because we don't really care about the bitter little protagonists. Half of the dialogue, mumbled in shirt fronts and ubiquitous masks, is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Some of the visuals are beautiful, and I'm sure the fanboys will leak it. Sorry. Think of the amount of work McKean really did well if he didn't hold on to this lame project. <br /> <br /> Degree: D / D-
