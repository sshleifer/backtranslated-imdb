Adventure in Dinosaur City, though a creative idea, was a nauseatingly horrific attempt at movie viewing. To be sucked into a TV and into a new world is interesting. Three teenagers who are obsessed with half-animated dinosaurs are not. Don't waste time or brain power to see this loser. I won't even let my kids see.
