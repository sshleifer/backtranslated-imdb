as I am sure other people have said this man is not a very valuable subject. Certainly, our society has a morbid fascination with death, and it's funny to hear him talk about how much he smokes and how much coffee he drinks, but he gives himself an unworthy mysticism. Anyway, the bottom line is that he is a moronrasis using poor methods to reject the mountain of evidence of the holocaust, and thus he must be forgotten over time. but Morris is in love with any kind of curiosity, which I would not normally owe him.
