OK, we went along with the stereotypical bad orphanage experience and explained to our son, adopted from Russia, that it was top-notch and dramatized so we could get the dog to play soccer (since he played soccer). But the last scene, in which the dog returns to its original owner, put my son over the edge and called out for 15-20 minutes, "he was replaced !!!!" That of an elementary child. I do not recommend this movie to any family who has an adopted child; It gives adoption, orphanages and adults badly - and eventually, even though they win the game - the boy with whom the boy is bound to leave - and this is too much. Please be careful if you have any adopted children, and beware of families with biological children, because the impression of children adopted is not positive and outlines a stereotype that is unhealthy and dirty. (The dog is cute, but not enough to save our family's response to this movie.)
