First, I will admit that I have not seen Vampires: Los Muertos, but I have seen and love the original Vampire movie. I rented this movie and didn't hear anything about it. I didn't expect to be impressed. I wasn't. <br /> <br /> I love the idea of ​​moving the action to the Far East, which had to open many new roads for action sequences as well as the story line, but not enough of them. The battle scenes and the motorcycle chase were painfully boring. <br /> <br /> There were some parts I liked, such as the way the battle team was not seen as heroic guys, as they were in the first movie. <br /> <br /> I was hoping I saw the old Hammer movie Legend Of The Seven Golden Vampires a few years ago that someone would make another good Asian vampire movie someday. It wasn't.
