The best thing about Shrieker is the dialogue. As I scream and I know what you did last summer, this movie is aware of the conventions of this kind of horror movie and lets you play some good lines and scenes on the conventions. Unfortunately, Shrieker is not boring. The plot is your basic Ten-Little Indian, with a monster controlled by one of the suspects / victims. You know from the beginning that each of the characters will be deterred until only the hero (ine) remains to defeat the evil one. And that's exactly what happens. Absolutely no surprises and no tension. Production values ​​and acting were ok, but I had no motivation to look to the end (although I did) because I already knew how the endings would play. The end surprised me a bit because it managed to literally fizzle instead of throwing out a bucket of special effects. Perhaps the special effect budget was spent at the end.
