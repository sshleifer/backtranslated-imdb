I gave it a 3 out of a possible 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Unless you waste your time watching an anorexic actress, it doesn't bother Carly Pope, who is worn like a dinz. /> <br /> Carly Pope plays Sara Novak, a young college student engaged in game puzzles, leading her into the subway tunnels under the city - a dangerous thing for even a well-armed man to go alone. <br /> <br /> There are several intrigues in the film - a strange classmate who supposedly bumps Sara, a cynical merchant, operating a kind of indecent hole-in-the-wall foundation that apparently lies is. in the back of a ghetto, a nerdish dull hanging around the synika's shop, and a woman named Emily Gray, who is in prison. <br /> <br /> Sara's father is a lawyer who handles Emily's case. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, Emily Gray tried to drown a 12-year-old boy. Emily has been in a mental hospital for 5 years, and for some painful reasons, she left her out, even though she is still dangerous. <br /> <br /> The only explanation Emily ever gave her was Crime: I never sinned. <br /> <br /> It's all part of the design. <br /> <br /> Well, my friend, don't expect to ever get a better explanation than that, because you won't.
