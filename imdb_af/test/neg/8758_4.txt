Oh, the horror! I saw quite a few Gore movies in my day, but this one just makes me laugh rather than repulsive. It's definitely a crazy movie and is very low-budget. I might add, but if you can see the inexpensive sound, horrible dialogue, ugly girls, the obviously fake gore screens and the total madness of the movie you might find this movie almost entertaining. The story is about a cat murderer going on a deadly spree every 5th day of the 5th month of the 5th year. (Wow, how original), and it's up to two detectives (one of whom made a brave effort by trying to make the crapy dialogue good) to stop the killer's bloody rampage. The deadly scenes (made with a plastic toy knife) are pretty brutal (which is a good thing), but very annoying because of the constant repetition of a naturally-recorded scream (which is very overbearing). As far as the gore is concerned, there are many of them, but it seems very false; especially the bloodchild, come, purple blood? But if you're a fan of gore videos, like me, you'll find something in this video to cherish as I did (the detective detective ... he's the best thing for this movie). Other than that, everything you will find is a bunch of senseless nudity (which is also a good thing, but too bad are the girls OOYY) and a very idiotic, hippie-necrophilia series killer. Sorry, but this one sucks.
