There were only two reasons for me to see this movie. First, Stellan Skarsgard and Marisa Tomei were (who were both good actors) and I had nothing better to do. While watching the movie, I immediately thought of something better to do: SLEEP! This movie is a total waste of time. This is a standard ex-cop flick. The ex-buyer is the best ever there, but he was fired. He keeps things on his own the aversion to his former friends and he saves the day. All great surprises (NOT !!!). Go to sleep, or if you have insomnia, try this one. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
