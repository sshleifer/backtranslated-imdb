I love comedies and I love independent movies, but it was way too slow and humor was extremely regional. I think it would have been better if the main characters were similar, but they were just typical gen-x slacker types, just like those who have had problems in high schools for forty years. I can understand High Praise for a young indie movie maker when it's meritorious, but it's an extremely average movie.
