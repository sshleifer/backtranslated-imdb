This movie was such a mess that I actually compensated my friends for dragging it. The only reason I went was that my friend was a trainee editor at the shoot. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this movie was meant to be camp, but the approach was so harsh and self-reflexive, it really got flat. Judd Nelson stars as a haunted garbage man who is a hack comedian on the side. His life is hell and gets worse with his petty and deceitful companion Bill Paxton (whom I feel ashamed of - it was a very tasteless role for a talented actor). A Freak accident changes Nelson's career course and a chaos. <br /> <br /> The attempts at humor were corny, predictable and often base and tasteless. Wayne Newton in the role of talent agent is a novelty, but he adds nothing - comedies or otherwise. <br /> Overall, this is a very poor and unashamed attempt to make camp humor like a main balloon. At least you can laugh at plan 9 of outer space. This one just makes you wonder who thought it was a good idea to fund and film. One of the worst bombs you'll ever see.
