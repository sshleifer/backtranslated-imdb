Vigorous and Enthusiastic is a documentary story of a male choir in Berlevåg in the northern part of Norway, where the weather is cold and hostile, the days are dark in winter and the villages are confronted with young people moving to the more populous parts in the south of Norway, where the climate is warmer and there are more opportunities. <br /> <br /> The most beautiful part of this movie is the people themselves. The people in the choir, aged between 30 and 95, all have unique, colorful lives and are very pleasant creatures. They are characterized by the harsh climate and the recession of the North and adapted to the way of life needed. In the course of the film we learn a bit about many people in the choir and we follow them through songs, events in a church and on the harbor, and finally a trip to Murmansk. <br /> <br /> The outdoor film filmed in the film is very beautiful and is characterized by Norwegian nature. The painting is also natural and is taken directly from the choir and some of us live what we meet. The living rooms, the bathroom, the kettle on the oven; There is nothing artificial about this movie, not the people, not the environment, not their music and not their feelings. Everything is as real as it can be. <br /> <br /> All this, however, loses when it comes to giving a story. It is very beautiful and real, but why do we see it? Is it because of the songs? Is it because of the nature? Or is it just to see a story about man's Berlevåg choir, about their lives and about the journeys they have. The message, if any, is that this small society with life goes through such social events as the choristers. The choir has kept the people together for many years. <br /> <br /> It's nice, but it's as popular as it has been seen, seen almost 200,000 in Norway, there's something wrong. There is no beginning or end to it. Nobody gets something or loses anything, no one reveals any message or tries to convince the audience that it is good or that life is big above it. Why was this movie made? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry. It's a good movie about good people, but compared to the average European, Scandinavian or Norwegian movie, it doesn't earn a 9 out of 10. This is closer to 4 out of 10, and that's what I will give it. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie in a theater, expect the average age on the audience to be about 55-60. It reported consistently high in all theaters. Perhaps this is also the reason why it receives so much praise in the news and good grades, also on the IMDB: This is a movie about elders, for elders. It is a movie of "I regret nothing in my life", and a story that says you live in a small town like Berlevåg can also be a nice life.
