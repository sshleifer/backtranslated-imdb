This movie is bad. I saw the graded and the ungraded versions. They are terrible !! Now, I know it's supposed to be a low budget, spiderman's porn spoof, but Spiderbabe is just not good at being bad. It's not funny! Not at all funny !! I wanted to laugh. I tried to laugh. But this movie has dropped me. At least, the unprecedented version has a lot of nudity to look forward to. And this is me, because Mundae is not a pretty woman. From the middle, his eyes are okay, but on the way a lot goes wrong. She looks good in that schoolgirl outfit. Please, if you have to look at this spiderbabe, rent it first. Graded or ungraded, no matter, they are both bad for me !!
