Let's look at it, it's a very bad movie. But when you're done enjoying it, you can survive the experience. Okay, you'll shout a lot in the heart. The jungle of the jungle is dull. <br /> <br /> Tom Conway (who carries most of the movies with a funky chapeau) uses the local witch doctor and crazy science to create a "perfect" creature. It looks like a warmth of six weeks. drunk and in a pocket dress. Unfortunately, that's good. But it won't kill him because he uses a good girl as his subject. He needs a bad bad girl. <br /> <br /> Marla English and Lance Fuller are two little crooks in search of African gold. Work lessons for me English had to be at the top of the search list. She is a bad girl and lets everyone know it in a performance that plays a junior high school. "Connors is the white guide English and Fuller, who leads the expedition. <br /> <br /> English & Conway eventually come together and this is a game made in hell. She is the perfect subject for b from his voodoo being because she will do anything (stress anything) to get what she wants, you will do anything to stop the suffering of this movie at this stage. <br /> <br /> What has this movie been for made me interesting was Conway who wears the funky tribal hat / headpiece! Still trying to figure out what kind of dead animal it was. He thought if he pulled it low enough over his eyes, nobody would recognize him. /> <br /> Really bad theater.
