I picked it up because I spent time in the Albany region in New York, I knew a few people in the movie and I happened to touch it. The comedy's efforts are paralyzed, the compulsory girl-on-scene is sick, the plot is inconsistent, the play is one of the worst I've ever seen, and doesn't even get me on special effects. I realize it's a very low budget film made by a small independent company, but if you're going to do a sci-fi horrorflick with giant insects, don't make the huge bugs incredibly incredible. People want to see giant insects. It's half the fun there. And if you make the huge bugs completely unbelievable, at least make the actors such a kind of tongue-in-the-cheek ("You idiots! It's not them! You caught their stunt doubles ! "). Be prepared to waste two hours of your life so you can never return.
