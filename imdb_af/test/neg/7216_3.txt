The original Road House is by no means an award-winning film. But this is one of the great guilty pleasures of all time. It should not have been so difficult to make a successor. There is no need for a big budget, big name stars, and spectacular visual effects. Even the story wasn't supposed to be original. All it needed was a good time-lapse, and some great fist fights. I do not mean Matrix-style "wire-fu", just a few well-choreographed bar-room crawls. Many of them. There are some decent battles in the movie, but none of them is memorable, and the focus is more on rifle games. Plus, the way it connects to the original movie is ridiculous and insulting. Johnathon Schaech plays Shane Tanner, an undercover DEA agent who is good with his hands and feet. But here's the kicker ... he's the son of Patrick Swayze's character Dalton !!!! What do you say????? Let's see, the original Padhuis was made in 1989. So, for Dalton to have a boy in his late 20s in 2006 (maybe even 30). Well, you get that idea. They give it a cheesy explanation that he lived with his uncle Nate (Will Patton) while his father traveled a lot. Oh please. It itself is almost fair to end this movie. But I deviated. Schaech is completely out of his element. Probably he could throw a few kicks, but he did not act as an actor. Plus, he is referred to in the movie by the bad guys as "nice boy". I've never looked at the men so carefully, but I don't think this man is too good. He looks sick. His face is far too thin, and his sunken eyes make it seem like he's going out at any moment. I have never heard of him, but I think he must act and go back to his work. Jake Busey plays the local drug runner Wild Bill. Busey is not a terrible actor. He was good at Starship Troopers, and even made a threatening villain in Hitcher 2. But here he just walks through the landscape in the standard bad man. Even his "threatening" dialogue is worthy. We have to buy him as the man who has the whole town in his pocket. But why? What does he do? Because he wants to buy a Patton bar "any way necessary"? Ellen Hollman has the token friend role. A woman with a secret. Sorry, the secret is about as hard as 2 + 2. She is the local primary school teacher who is a former army soldier. Guess what it means? This means that while fearing the bulk of the movie, she will be ready to head when the fur begins to fly. Oh yes, at least she is warm. Actually, the battle between her and Wild Bill's girl is the best in the movie. It's fast, cruel and entertaining. Which leads me to my next problem with the movie ... the battles. As I said, Schaech knows how to throw a punch. The same cannot be said for anyone he sees in the movie. Of course, the movie will all come to Schaech vs. Busey. Busey is an actor, not a fighter. He doesn't have the skills to take a movie fight. Swayze may have been a trained dancer, but his athletic ability gave him the means to pull off well-choreographed battles. He also confronted some worthy opponents, and moved one killer (literally). Not one of them. With a few exceptions, the battles are forced, poorly staged, and routine. The punch sounds like someone beating a 2X4 on the concrete, and there are even a few parts where the sound doesn't even match the punch. This is embarrassing. There is not even the good southern / redneck music of the original. Road House had the Jeff Healy Band, which was a somewhat popular band at the time. This movie has a singer called John Otto, whose music is lower, and his acting story even worse. He made one line in the movie, which was probably added to saturate any fans he had out there. Either this, or someone owed him a favor. My last complaint about the movie is one that is just picky ... the continuity. Movies are shot in order, and then it is the editor's job to put it all together. Well, somebody has to move the editor of this movie a little. The problems range from small things like people who don't look the same way to a shot, to RE-USED footage at the end of the movie. In the beginning we are introduced to the pub, The Black Pellican. As the camera moves through the bar, you see the band, the bouncers and the people dancing. At the end of the movie, when the bad guys were defeated, we got another shot of the same bar, with inserts from our hero sitting at the bar with his girlfriend. The problem is, the footage of the people in the bar is the same footage from the beginning of the movie !!! I don't kid you. These are the same people standing (or dancing) in the same places, with the same clothes. Want to know the funniest part? You see bouncers in the lap that were killed earlier in the movie. Do yourself a favor, don't see this movie unless you feel the need to go out and hit someone. This movie will make you angry.
