It's supposed to be Charlie's masterpiece, but I would say it's actually one of his weaker movies. First of all, it's not funny. Not one thing in this movie made me laugh. Well, there's a quick jump in a box that was a giggle, but it was one of despair. The Tramp's first and only talkie where he speaks (he sings in a previous movie), but his flat dialogue shows exactly why he was so happy to look in the "Modern Times" and "Gold Rush" - two films that is at least ten times better than this movie. There is literally just one good scene in this movie, the one where Hitler plays with the world like a beach ball. This is it. <br /> <br /> Well, so much praise for the first movie to make war, even long before we entered the war. Nope. Not true. Simply not true, so the price may be a little off. The Three Stooges did it on January 19, 1940 with "You Natzy Spy" - ten months earlier than the October issue of Chaplin's movie - and that movie was really funny! If you want to watch Chaplin's biggest movie, just watch it. And then pop in "Modern Times", "Gold Rush", "City Lights", "Limelight", "The Kid" or even "Tillie's Punctured Romance".
