I have the mr. Magoo cartoons I saw when I grew up enjoy. And I enjoy Leslie Nielson's comic skills. So, I thought, this marriage should produce a funny child. <br /> <br /> I couldn't be wrong anymore. <br /> <br /> This movie was just awful. I don't remember a single funny moment. It's one of two or three times (in hundreds of films over the years) I wanted my money back. You will reject this movie because you will never use it again in that time. In a comedy, the plot must draw the viewer and serve as a framework for gags. This plot doesn't. It's just a little nice there, like a stranded fish.
