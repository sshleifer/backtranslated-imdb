Maybe James P. Lay knows what happens in the audio department if a director oversees him. <br /> <br /> In 'Dreamland (2007)', however, he cannot achieve anything as a writer or director. <Br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing in this movie, no story, no character building, no events, no atmosphere, no plot, no twists, no acting that name deserves. <br /> <br /> In any of those departments, this movie is billions of light years behind any short film that has a real thought in it, even one minute. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with any of David Lynch's works! <br /> <br /> I actually think it can be used as spiritual torture or as negative propaganda material against the West. <br /> <br /> Only recommend it to your worst enemies!
