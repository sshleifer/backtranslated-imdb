Ordinary horrible movie ... I won't bother you about the synopsis. Just the Core, Armageddon, a Bose Planner, Military Officer and one or two Solve-All Nukes, and you will have the movie if I can call it so. <br /> <br /> Serious, nukes in this kind of movies are more useful than Swiss Army Masses: <br /> <br /> The Big One approaches? Nuke some places and it's over ... A Tornado wants to destroy "Put important city name here"? Nuke "Put another important city here" ... A volcano is an eruption? Nuke it! A nuke is close to going down? Nuke it! Coffee is cold? Nuke it! You didn't like Transformers? Nuke yourself, but I can't guarantee it will fix things. <br /> <br /> In the end, how much more movies like this can be made before they start copying each other? I doubt there are many things to blow up with a new one ...
