I'm shocked to see that this movie has been given more than two stars by some people. They should also be sheep or completely blind to the art of acting, directing and other errors of the movie. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I just couldn't force myself to sit down the whole movie, it was just too bad. <br /> <br /> The first three characters, not including the "digger", were just horrible actors, and I mean WILD! Perhaps the director didn't care, or maybe he's a worse director. It was like a bad school game. The movie is of course filmed with a video camera (low budget - not real movie), and the audio settings were not very good either. In addition, the soundman (if they had one) had to be a newbie or a drunk, as the sound was amateur. Even in one of the first scenes from the kitchen (AWFUL acting VAT), the sound of the dialogue was pretty bad. For example, as the woman moves her head as she speaks, you can hear her voice disappearing and coming back. It sounded like they were trying to improve it in the after-production by turning the volume a bit when she turned her head. In addition, you had the constant annoying humming sound of camera equipment or other sources in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> All these squeakers in the first 5 minutes or so. Should I say more? <br /> <br /> A good school project or a fun project for friends to watch, but never had to be released for a real audience, especially not for a PAYER. THIS IS A RIP OFF, unless you have a very low standard regarding movies, or just bad taste. You have been warned! SB.
