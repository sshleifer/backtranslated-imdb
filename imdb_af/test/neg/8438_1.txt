The sound is terrible, the picture is worse than worse, the acting is terrible, the female front actress is plump and the story is ... wait a minute ... There is no story ...! The plot is really bad and the title of the movie is misleading. If you expect to see Piranhas, you may be disappointed. This film has nothing to do with the Piranha movies of 1978 and 1981. Actually, I can only think of one scene in which Piranhas is involved. <br /> <br /> The only thing I like about this movie, except the fact that it runs for just about 85 minutes, is the song at the end. It's written and sung by Jim Stein and it's called "Love all things that love the sun". <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie. It's so bad, it's not even funny to look at. I fell asleep after the first 20 minutes and I'm the kind of person watching anything.
