Doug McClure died in some of these British-made genre adventures and this one must be the worst of the lot. I know the country that has time has its critics, but at least that movie has place filming and relatively good production values. This is the problem with this movie. The production values ​​go much further than "so bad that they are good", and it gets so bad. I think I'm going to see what the other channels are. <br /> <br /> One point in the run is the first scene with the fearless Cushing and McClure meeting a monster. It is painfully clear that the sample is an average-sized man dressed as a rubber sample made to look over twenty feet long through overhangs of rear projection. It becomes even more painfully clear that our heroes are trying to escape the monster by running on the spot. Did I mention that this is one of the more convincing pieces? Not really it seems to have been filmed in someone's living room, with the savings being left over from the year's doctoral budget. Even the former doctor, who is Peter Cushing, is slim and what was an amusing line. "You can't admonish me - I'm British" is delivered in a very flat way. (A very similar line is spoken by Cushing in HORROR EXPRESS) in a script without characterization, plot and memorable dialogue. It's not just the fact that the dialogue is irrevocable, but it's also rare and rare because the monsters don't speak. It would not have been better with the main bad guys humanoids as in WARLORDS OF ATLANTIS so they could explain the plot. Does anyone know what the plot is? <br /> <br /> A very boring British movie that can't even save the twin talents of Caroline Munro. The whole sphere of the movie is summarized by the final series with two keystone people
