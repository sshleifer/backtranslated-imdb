The start of the movie is promising. When Jeanne Pollet (Anna Mouglalis) hears the story of the incident on the day she was born, the possibility that she is the daughter of a well-known pianist, André Polonski (Jacques Dutrone), has established whether it is true Or not, and the fact that she also plays the piano is not such a remote idea. Jeanne meets André and his wife, Mika Muller (Isabelle Huppert) and their son, and on the way they discover that there are so few secrets in the family. <br /> <br /> O.K. We've seen it before, and it's done in a more interesting way than here. The character of Mika Muller is left by us and understands her motives for her action and she is not interesting enough to care for her. The piano-tone looks fake and the entire piano sub-plot does not add anything to the character's insight, but serves to make the film longer than it should have been in the first place. <br /> <br /> In short, a very disappointing trip from Chabrol, which can do better than that
