I was very interested in watching this movie despite the article I read about the director in Tattler Magazine. I don't judge movies by what the director may or may not have done. This debut feature was very difficult to watch. I found the diverting screens to be a distraction for the drama in the movie, some of the supporting characters were performing badly, and the film is a copy of several other movies I've seen. There really was nothing fresh about this
