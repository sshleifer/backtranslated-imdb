You get a good deal of Steven Seagal environmental issues, and some breathtaking mountain views along with cow shrubs (or use some of the remains of the HORSE WHISPERER). You then add a large piece of OUTBREAK virus or similar (attention should be more lethal and at least Biohazard Level 4) wrapped around a fat Militia group leader. You add one teaspoon of martial arts, and a zipper of explosions and gun fire for the taste. Add the classic red Indian herbs for the extra flavor. Apply immediately. <br /> <br /> What is the name of the movie you get: The Patriot. Perhaps the worst movie by Steven Seagal. I'm sure Seagal was trying to say something in this movie, except the usual I-am chef, but his recipe was confusing and the taste was terrible.
