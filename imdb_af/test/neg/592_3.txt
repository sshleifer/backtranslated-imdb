Everyone in the PC culture is concerned about the dogmatic Christian view of this film, claiming it contains racist ideas and / or religious intolerance. <br /> <br /> Those who don't care but are focused on fine production values ​​and skilled acting are upset about the lack of such here. <br /> <br /> Those who deny both of these things believe that this production has been lost to the general public, as shown by comments here. br /> <br /> What is an interesting presentation, which is not original but is a combination of GHOST and FROM BEYOND, is dealt with in an immature manner in this film, but with gusto. What the crew and actors lack in sensitivity, professional skills and technical expertise is somewhat offset by the intensity they display. <br /> <br /> It's not nearly as bad as many here think, and would have been good in the hands of someone with maturity and common sense, and that's enough in mediocrity to provoke laughter and groaning. However, it deployed with enough intensity to hold interest throughout and is compared to a Corman-made entry from its earliest working period, or the material of Arkoff or Sam Katzman. If you get it for $ 2 (or less), you haven't been disappointed, but wish you could have had a say on how it was made.
