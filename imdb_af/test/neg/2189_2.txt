It started pretty well, with the accident and the decision not to return to LA. But everything falls in place too quickly. There is a decent plot at the end, but so many scenes that don't make sense. Randy (played by Brian Austin Green) gets angry and ready to confront people and he takes the time to dress the club when he parks his car in front of his house in the middle of nowhere? I don't want to spoil it for anyone who decides to see it, but the last 45 minutes are ridiculous. Even the acting, which was not bad, became bad at the end. Don't bother unless you want to see how bad it is.
