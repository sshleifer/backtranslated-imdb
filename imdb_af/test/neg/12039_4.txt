They prove that the police, when they can't find the actual offenders, always blame the parents and accuse them of sexual abuse of their children. These movies always show the press as a bunch of animals and the parents come out of court to feed the press's hunger to humiliate the grief. Didn't anyone in this movie ever hear of a court building? Here you have a psychic who tells them exactly what happened and WHERE the body can be found, but the police are not told and no one holds its findings. <br /> <br /> Police are portrayed as blockheads who do not know what they are doing and there is always an outside detective, as Ed Asner, who comes late in the case, believes in the parents and looses the riddle. <br /> <br /> Even after the parents were cleaned, they didn't spit in the faces of the stupid dominee they were in prison, taking their child away and accusing them of killing their own child. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie many times. for.
