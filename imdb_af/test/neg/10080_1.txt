You couldn't sit the characters on the island for any reason and had the same movie. The first one had an original story, the second stole from King Kong, and finally (hopefully) from this trilogy the story seemed to be completely bypassed. Create a few people on an island full of dinosaurs and watch them run for their lives. It was about everything there was. The special effects were decent but not worth $ 8. If you have a discount theater in your local area, wait and see it for a buck. I won't even bother it. That would be too much money for this unsettling thriller.
