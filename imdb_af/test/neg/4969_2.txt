I watched Mandy Lane almost an hour ago and felt the urge to come home straight away and warn someone to spend money on the DVD - DO NOT. <br /> <br /> The supporting characters are level, the failure of acting is higher than that of Matthew McConaughey movies, and to the end, the plot is all but obvious. In nine out of ten you can see the next scene that lasts 5 minutes before it starts. The whole movie is more or less without a motive or message, and the halfway revelation of the "killer" that is simply omitted kills what little interest you could have left at that time. What could have saved this shallow, boring movie is a decent splatter or at least worthy of the genre "Slasher". It also failed. <br /> <br /> If you need a background movie for a party you can jump inside and out without missing something, I recommend buying All The Boys Love Mandy Lane. <br /> <br /> If you want to sit and actually focus your eyes on the screen for more than 15 seconds, I don't.
