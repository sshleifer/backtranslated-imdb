First, I must say that I saw the '39 version at least 100 times; knows all the dialogue, and reads the '36 game, which differs from the '39 and contains nuggets of gold of its own. This version is as flat as a lifetime film about adultery. There is a reason you didn't see an expensive TV advertising campaign for it. According to Entertainment Weekly, Bening hated the fussy tone of the original and how the women were fighting each other all the time. GUESS WHAT??! That was Booth's intention. It was a lick, theater gossip, adultery, and backbiting among a set of well-kept Manhattan socialites. The crowd that made this new version did not intend to honor the original source material. They choose it strangely and put it in half a scene and half a scene coming out of the first version. Bette Midler (who is only in a few screens and enters the old Countess part in a broad, grinning style) has no context in this version. She calls 'Buck' afterwards, which is an important element in the original - then he is never mentioned again. This movie is so boring that I won't over-analyze it, but here are some things I've found incredible:> Mary Haines shouted to her domestic staff: "I can suck the nails out of a plate!" Right. Great writing. Norma Shearer could have done a line reading about it and got an Oscar nom, right? > A compared Sylvia Fowler !!! ??? Annette Bening has what she wanted, and the movie is just a little awake. Claire Booth uses Sylvia as the comic engine to be thrown through the scene. As immortal depicted by Rosalind Russell, she was an ignorant, indifferent woman who provoked the small and ridiculous, irresistible dialogue that is still classical and quotable. She was no more than Paulette Godard's ankle bite. The 2008 filmmakers decided that this character had to die. While killing her, they killed the movie.
