"The Core" meets "Crack in the World" (1965 made for TV). The acting is stock, the voltage predictable. Once you've pulled off the plot from "The Core" - basically the manned drilling machine - you end up with the plot of "Crack in the World". "Crack" was an excellent movie with Dana Andrews. His team of scientists, who worked in South Africa, were put down at the crust and hit by a nuclear device to provide a steady source of geothermal energy. One of his subordinates, also a brilliant scientist, does not differ. He believes that the explosion will not drill a simple hole, but rather form cracks in the crust. (Possible spoiler) He's right. To stop the resulting crack to destroy the earth, they must place another nuclear device in the path of the crack. <br /> <br /> Although I posted a spoiler warning, I don't know if I really spoiled something for any movie. And since "Crack in the World is only available in a very scarce VHS format if my decision not to disclose or the counter works is probably academic or not. <br /> <br /> All in all, I rate "Descent" just below average.
