Piece, it would have given a 0 if I could. Animation is good, but not quite good enough. Storyline is absolutely the most ridiculous I've ever experienced, and it says a lot! This 'movie' was so hard to try to be interesting, but unfortunately failed. It's almost as if the author has started one story, then they have a different idea, and try to work the two together. Don't waste your time on this; believe me, you will be marked with you as I was. The only actor of any note was James Woods, and his part was at its best periphery. I'm all doing things that are edgy, pushing the envelopes, but it just didn't cut it.
