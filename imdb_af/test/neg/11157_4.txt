Looking through the end of the days, I have the feeling that the filmmakers are trying to make it unique to the average Hollywood action movie. Of course they failed, but you have to give them credit to try. Peter Hyams actually tried to target this time, instead of just working out a working movie. He tried to inject atmosphere into the film by darkening the lights and adding tons of blood. This method can work if used correctly (see "Se7en"), but here it feels like a cheap trick trying to scare us. Hyams is a decent action director and offers nothing more than basic shootouts and battle scenes, except for the thin, sub par f / x end "battle". As a photographer, Hyams demonstrates the real ability to show good work and movement, but it is nothing more than solid work. <br /> <br /> Author Andrew Marlowe is the movie's greatest enemy. In parts, the script actually shows a good religious excitement, and sometimes it even shows some quasi-intellectual thoughts (the temptation center between Arnold and Gabriel Byrne), but these little pluses are pushed out by a river of negative. Generic dialogue / characters, gapping plot holes and convenient plot points that just happen to show all the characters in the right direction are just a few of the standard Hollywood black holes. Marlowe's script comes in. The shadow of the good movie could fade very quickly. <br /> <br /> The movie has a surprisingly good role. Arnold, who is still bigger than life expectancy, is trying to play depression, on the rand head with no more than average results. Keep on being the invincible hero Arnie, that's your good thing. Gabriel Byrne is the strong point of the ensemble, which brings a nice air of cynicism to Satan's role. In an ominous role that is ripe for survival, Byrne limits himself and adds a little more threat to the character. Kevin Pollak, as usual, can bring at least a few chuckles to the movie, but he did better. Also look at a star-like role of Rod Steiger. <br /> <br /> Hyams seemed to be trying to separate it from the sightless mass of Hollywood action movies. He was in the right direction, but didn't take the writing or originality there. <br /> <br /> 4/10
