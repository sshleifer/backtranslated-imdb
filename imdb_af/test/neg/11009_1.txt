Let me first say that I really wanted this movie. For the most part, the actors and actresses watched their parts, and they had pretty good roles, but the movie had no real plot. It seems so wraped in seemingly 'wacky' that no interesting story ever shone. Also, the camera work was often sloppy, attempting to work flawlessly and failing. Most of the time, shots that were meant to look, eventually became confusing. Maybe something was lost during translation, but some of the characters were just ... stupid. The crazy, beautiful boy who sniffs people like a dog? Uhhhhhhh. OK. Overall, a fat smelly 1/10. Not worth your time.
