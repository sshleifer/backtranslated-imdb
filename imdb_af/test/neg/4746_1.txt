If I just read the review by Alex Sander (sic) here, rather than looking at more than 6 judging a choice of the ignorant public, I would not have seen this desecration. Alien was a fantastic, dramatic and well-made horror / sci-fi. Predator was a wonderful sci-fi / action. I really only have to blame myself, although I've seen Alien vs. Predator. It also has an average rating of more than 6 stars from the movie connoisseurs visiting this site. <br /> <br /> PLEASE STOP PLEASE IF YOU DO NOT USE ANY BENEFIT OF ANY SUMMER RIDING PLOT FOR YOU. /> <br /> From the beginning, this movie was ridiculous. No explanation was offered to the Predator's ship overwhelmed / not overrun by Aliens. OK, so maybe they're going to throw strangers back to Earth to hunt them and something went wrong, but how did it cause an Alien / Predator hybrid and why the rest of the crew didn't realize sooner despite their big technology? The start was actually the most coherent and interesting part of the movie, because we had an idea of ​​who was who or what and what and why. From then on, it's really ridiculous. I leave my unbelief strictly at the door of the screen before I enter it and get out on the way out. I couldn't get here. <br /> <br /> A father and son are hunting in the forest. The damaged shipping accident ends up (from the point of view). I will calculate at least 10 strange miles through thick bushveld. The man and son trace there alone and find the ship and get a face cut. Even at this point you feel very little to them, mainly because the face spreaders are almost comical, rather than scary in their movements and actions and the father looks like such an irresponsible, dull redneck muppet. <br /> <br /> An Edgy, a vibration-type scenario is set up with an ex-con returning to the village near the crash, to meet his somewhat emotional, dull now police friend of the bus. When I suggested, I mean a poor effort with rogue actors and no feeling is played out. A slasher / horror element is then introduced with a sexy girl and the usual so-called nerdy or somehow unwanted cute man beaten by the overprotective, crazy, nasty Jock (American sportsman, not a Scottish man) no. Oh, the cute / not cute boy was the older brother at the time. Yes, they are smartly this director brothers whose name I will investigate to prevent any other shite from bringing them out again. Then a modern role reverses oh so boring attempt to PC, Ripley credibility type character introduction comes with a female soldier returning to her husband and child. <br /> <br /> Guess what happens next? I won't tell you much more about the real thing (smile sorry for the story of storytelling in the vast majority of recent films). Just as far as you are and not the brightest star in the Alien-run universe. <br /> <br /> The Predator is stupid for the reasons stated by the previous poster, whose post I read. The strangers are boring. The Predator Alien is ridiculous. The action is sometimes exploitative, free, disgusting nonsense. The hospital scene with the pregnant mothers?!?! Oh, I was well shocked. Shocked at how low some people are going to get what? A scare? Some shock? To titillate the perverse? What? If you really wanted to shock, titillate and frighten people who aren't pregnant, or expect fathers or have no souls, why doesn't the Alien / Predator not only have the bad women and teenage girls, rather than kill them? The characters have no depth or plot. It is filmed and fits badly. It's done by interested people, not that I can blame them. It unleashes two more interesting and good sets of sci-fi characters. This film was rubbish and if you enjoyed it, I really should worry you. If you haven't seen it well, please make your own decision. <br /> <br /> PS Did I even mention how the trained soldiers are killed in about 20 seconds while amateur citizens survive?
