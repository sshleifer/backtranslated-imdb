Sometimes Full Moon makes entertaining movies. This is not one of them. Full moon is like a low key Troma. Their movies aren't as violent or from the wall, but they are usually just as without talent. The acting in this movie is not terrible, but the writing is pretty bad, and generally it is pretty boring and it doesn't even contain a nudity (like many Full Moon movies) to loosen it a bit. Skip this one and go hire "Head of the Family".
