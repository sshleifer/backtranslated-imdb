The title comes from a passage in the Bible (Deut. 28:28). Let's just say it's taken awful out of context - but that's where the title of this disturbing movie originates. The other reviewers cover the plot details, so I won't rehash again. But the man who is a psychiatrist gives a lecture on "inferior function" where he discusses how a person can meet another person and they can experience a "disastrous crisis" in their lives where they stop being masters of be themselves and incapable of just judgment. He says it on stage at the exact moment as he sees Leonora Vail in the audience - the woman who will become his mistress. Not very subtle to show that it will indeed happen to this poor man. <br /> <br /> I think the whole movie assumption is unreliable and just didn't work. Here is an overarching psychiatrist, and we must believe this young, beautiful woman falls for him and comes between the happiness he and his wife shared. What is even more impeccable is how the betrayed woman responds when she learns of the unfaithful. Not only does she understand, but she claims her husband starts a few months' holiday with the tramp - "so we can all get some relief from this unbearable tension". GIVE ME A CHANCE !! I wanted to reach through the screen and the throttle, not just the adulterer, but the dull woman. <br /> <br /> The fact that the whole movie takes place as a flashback after the start of the movie has already been announced at the beginning. (The fact that the man had a terrible accident) - it leaves no doubt about the outcome of the miserable case. I think it was a bad decision, as it absolutely didn't show any plots, as the whole movie is completely predictable. You already know the woman's resignation at the beginning of the film as she calls the mistress to the dying man's bed and does not express any bad will to her. <br /> <br /> Not only is the writing defective, but Noel Coward is terribly misguided (even though it is his script). He and Leonora have absolutely no chemistry on the screen at all. Interestingly, Michael Redgrave originally cast in that role, but was replaced during the filming. I wonder what that is about? Eventually the man or woman does not leave you sympathetic to any of them. I think Margaret Leighton played the piece well. But she couldn't overcome all the negative things this movie had. Also, as in the case of many British productions of this era, the dialogue is difficult to understand due to the cut, fast-paced speech pattern of the actors. I saw it on TV and couldn't even rely on closed captions to fill in the spaces for me. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this one.
