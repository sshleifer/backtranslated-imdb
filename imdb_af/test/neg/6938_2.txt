If you are a six-year-old boy who is in dinosaurs, you will love this movie. If you are someone else, roll your eyes every 15 seconds. If you want to start on things like the acting, the special effects, the dialogue or the absence of a coherent plot that makes even the slightest sense, you will have enough material. If all you want is a safe dinosaur fantasy movie for your child, it will just go well. There is a lot of children's entertainment out there, it is much smarter, and some are even portable or enjoyable for adults. Unless your child is in a compromising dinosaur state, you're probably better off looking for something else.
