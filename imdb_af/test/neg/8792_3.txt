It is painfully clear that all efforts in this film are aimed at cinematography and very little attention to everything else. The most obvious mistake is the miscarriage of the entire female cast. Many of them are very experienced and skilled, but they all got out of place, and with an amateur director it certainly did not help. The story is a very common Geisha story, and characters behaved very contradictory. This makes it very difficult for me to connect with the heroine. <br /> <br /> This movie's theme is "modern prostitution", but it was still annoying how Tsuchiya kept Anna's main character talking like a female motorcycle mobster, while everyone else in the old Japanese fitting for this institution has spoken. This movie has very nice vibrant colors, similar to Zhang Yimou's "Hero", but viewers can easily film it in a cheap, elaborate set. <br /> <br /> The two rows with Shiina Ringo's songs were really nice, in the middle of the movie. I actually liked a lot of her music, but they fit perfectly into this movie. Although Ninagawa Mika is a complete failure as a film director, she has a great potential in PV (music video) production. <br /> <br /> I believe the story felt very clear because the director didn't focus on character development, and because Tsuchiya Anna acted as an Oiran unconvincing. If this film was directed by a well-known Jidaigeki director with any other famous actress in Japan, it would have had the potential to become a masterpiece.
