The direction of Wong may be the worst in film history I have ever seen. This movie makes my all-time worst movie of 2000, Courtney Soloman's Dungeons and Dragons look like an Oscar winner. The errors in this movie are out of the question. The biggest one is the lack of depth. Each scene does not quite develop as if the editing room does not know how to do their job properly. It is a pity that such an all-star cast of talents and a well-known popular traditional story can be destroyed by this lack of vision. <br /> <br /> I'm so disgusting and hope that a great director like John Woo or Ang Lee decides to regain this movie and do it right. I'm not even sure if I can rate 0/10 ??
