Well, I saw the wrath of the Ninja. <br /> <br /> It's not something I recommend to people who aren't serious in Japanese fighting movies. It's a kind of Japanese fighting ninja movie, with a complex plot. It's about these 3 old ninja schools that had these 3 "swords of magic". I saw the caption version (NOT recommended by the way, it's easy to miss something) and I didn't really keep up with it all. It ran some good scenes, but in general it was not much to my liking.
