I always wanted to see the movie because I loved the novel, but was warned because I heard the movie was a stinker. It is. Fowles wrote the script and I could follow it well, despite the fact that I read the novel more than thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is impeccable - frightening, jingling and totally inappropriate on the mystery or mood of the movie. I suspect that the director has to take a lot of the debt, because even Michael Caine is terribly concerned and he has done some excellent work in ALFIE a few years earlier. <br /> <br /> The "Mysteries" that the Book does not translate well on the screen. I'd love to see someone try this one again.
