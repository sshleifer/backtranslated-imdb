Something not that big. "Silence of the Lambs" remains Demme's only good movie, and of course I include all the over-rated, big-screen concessions that I haven't seen before - and never will. <br /> <br /> This is a light comedy that takes a thriller, moves halfway somewhere. The first half is a bit difficult to go through; It's not funny or particularly interesting. Daniels plays an exaggerated stupid-as-dirty naive moron who is so faithful and confident that it convinces faith. His animated acting is often annoying and hardly funny. He lies in the beginning with Griffith and tells her he is married, with children, if he is actually divorced! In all the history of mankind and movies, any man who is married and meets with a woman, as he lies, says he is NOT married. (Later, the credible or credible rationale behind it was revealed: he wanted to "protect himself." What a little patch ...) The fact that his character makes all the wrong decisions and does all the stupid things in the movie really looked forward to Liotta who was frightened at him when he caught up in the former apartment. <br /> <br /> What then happens in Daniels's flat is the classic end of the movie-to-death movie that the good guy - albeit the very stupid good man - wins predictably. Yet at least the last half hour has an action, something going on, and Daniels no longer gets the opportunity to get animated. The film does not have credible characters (either main or marginal), and its feel is too 80s, which means the movie has a rather blatant appearance. visually ugly. Sayles makes a como again as a policeman. The movie may also be a bit too heavy on the casual side. Griffith once again plays a soft dumb-sounding bimbo, but as usual she is convincing because she is a gentle dumb-sounding bimbo. It was a previous film, before her lip augmentation and breast enlargement surgery; compare the natural breasts she exposes in this film to the ready-to-explode balloon. She flashes shortly in "Nobody's Fool". <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading my "biographies" by Griffith and Other Hollywood intellectuals, please contact me by email.
