Do you know they want to escape the Moon for real? And in Geneva there is the debate about the possible time machine. Everything I can say about this movie based on facts about the future (at the time of the film) is actually scientific projects. Hope the moon will exist, does not happen like in the movie. Now about the movie itself, I also saw the original movie, and I also read the book. The book I didn't like, but the movie yes. I totally agree with a previous remark that this movie was depressed, unlike the 60's. It was very good with violence, this one was just a parallel future of what is good. Movie.
