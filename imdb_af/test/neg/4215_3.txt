Margaret Mitchell turns in her grave every time someone sees this mess! Fine costumes and sets can't even overwhelm a spectacular show by Joanne Whalley (as the title character) and everyday Timothy Dalton (as Rhett). Even worse than the acting - and this may partly explain it - is the writing, which is surprisingly clickable and predictable. Add a score that will nod you to the brightly bad script, and you have a disaster I wouldn't want on any viewer. SCARLETT is just incredibly mean, and I can't imagine how it ever was made, much less made it video.
