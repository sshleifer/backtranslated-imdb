It has been commended to be a fast-paced helicopter comedy and the best German film of the year, so I've tried it, although I've already seen films by Dani Levy - or at least part of it. <br /> <br /> I have what I expected: no comedy unless you think heart attacks are funny. It's a good example of sloppy screenwriters, with an unquestionable plot and characters, loaded with cliches that can be true, but it's not funny either. <br /> <br /> The most annoying character is that of Zucker's wife, played by Hannelore Elsner. She must be incredibly strange to move the plot. For example, she does not know one thing about Judaism, but for reasons probably even unknown to preserve herself, she gets the idea of ​​playing the charade that she and her family are Jewish laws that obey the Jews for her husband's family, what really, and of the many orthodox and self-righteous variety. To make it a little more complicated, she invites the four of them to stay with her city, because they come from Frankfurt in Berlin without prior booking their hotels, something not 60 years old, not really a big German . will ever do. Zucker and his brother Samuel have not seen each other for forty years, but it turns out that his daughter - now a lesbian - and Samuel's son - now a militant orthodox - was once loved, and he is her daughter's father. Samuel's daughter - a nimho - goes to Zucker's gay boy. Is it supposed to be somehow humorous parody of Jewish turbulent tendencies? It is probably just an ill-considered way to add a "love action turbulence". And, of course, it also fails to make jokes. <br /> <br /> The praise for this movie is pure politics. Therefore, only people who like watching movies that are supposed to be politically important will enjoy this one - though "Everything on Zucker!" clearly has no interest whatsoever. <br /> <br /> For the rest: Don't see it without a "Fast forward" option. I really missed it.
