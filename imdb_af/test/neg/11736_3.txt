Norm (s) ally I don't care. There are some nice stuff out there, BUT this one is a stinker! Since it was practical for the scene, it had a good story and good actors. Van Sant copied Al's direction virtually flawlessly, and it added color (I'm not one of those who think it should be B&W classic). It must have been at least a mediocre movie ... but it was tiny ca-caa! I don't understand how it could be screwed so badly. If you have to, watch it as a curiosity, but I suggest you don't bother.
