New York's independent film maker Andy Milligan directs this little "treat" as his version of the Sweeney Todd legend. Sweeney cuts the calyx of customers in his barber shop and his cohort. Lovett turns them into meat pie. Thank you, I was well informed about the plot before I saw this movie. Milligan, for my money, must indeed be in the forefront of the worst directors of the all-time race. Ed Wood looks like Orson Welles. This movie is so bad in oh so many ways. Let's take Milligan's direction for starters. The film quality is granular. The sound quality is granular. Many scenes look like Milligan is using a video camera to film. The credits say "Photograped and directed by Andy Milligan." He wants to take credit for ceilings that appear at a death toll? How about the horrible musical score chosen for the movie? The movie cut with one poor transition to another. Little logic is used in creating the plot. The story has little to do with Todd's real legend. The murder tones are plentiful, but not terrible in any way. Hands, legs and other additions are cut with the skill of editing: choppily! And let's take the breast in the circle scene. Yes, it's there. The cake maker didn't know that a whole breast with nipple had filled a whole tart crust? Later, we hear from our characters that they were "careful not to be caught" for the 200 plus murders they did. Obviously they are a few boobs that are not able to keep abreast of what's going on (sorry it was too tempting). The actors aren't too bad to be honest. Some even have talent, and everything looks like they are real English articles. Many non-erotic naaktonels are forced throughout. Milligan seems to have some sex issues. Plot strands are detached. The end is almost inflexible due to poor camera work. I can go on and off. Did I like something about the movie? Not much to be true. I have a high level of acceptance for films of this ilk in terms of low budgets and marginal talent, but this film has no purpose other than to be rough and sick.
