"Blame it on Rio" is a romantic comedy 80 style, with more than an eye full of sex during the 101 minute time. <br /> <br /> The plot relates to two middle-aged men in crisis, one sorting through his divorce, the other dealing with the possibility of the same prospect. Both good friends, they decide to take a vacation in exotic Rio de Janeiro, each with a daughter on their side. Complications are instituted when one of them becomes involved with the other's daughter. <br /> <br /> This potential riot of a story is pretty funny and there are some good lines, but it never really gets hilarious as it may have. Any attempt to deal with the moral issue seriously does not work, and perhaps director Donen must have kept the humor of the situation. <br /> <br /> Not a bad movie, but what ruins it is Michelle Johnson's terrible performance as the naughty little requester Jennifer. While using her body fully, it's the only thing she has. Michelle's acting skill leaves much to be desired. No wonder we haven't seen her in the past. <br /> <br /> Friday, January 7, 1994 - Video
