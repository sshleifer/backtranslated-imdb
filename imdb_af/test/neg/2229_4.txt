A few of my co-authors covered this movie's album elements, so I would stick to some of the cuff comments ... <br /> <br /> 1. It's entertaining - but not for the reasons you think. It's cheesy, but somehow it is always viewable. <br /> <br /> 2. Tamra, Daniel's love interest should be about thirty. The Christian girl who ignores Dan is much better. <br /> <br /> 3. Muriel has his shirt from Mr. Spock stolen. Also, if my guardian angel looks like Muriel, I have to apply for a transfer. <br /> <br /> 4. Good ... so apparently ... Then responsible for his parents' divorce! What kind of terrible debt trip is it? Muriel says it was Dan's prayers that his parents held together. I just thought it was absolutely ridiculous. Listen, I can pray for my parents as much as I want, but the only way they will stay together is if they decide they will. <br /> <br /> 5. I will comment on the atheist's remarks on how this film is non-Christians. Apparently they are all messy bulls. <br /> <br /> 6. For something positive - David White is a decent actor. He gives the film some credibility, though he is the only one. He just keeps this movie alone.
