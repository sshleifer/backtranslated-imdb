It's one of the most horrific movies I've ever seen, probably just surpassed by the terrible and completely meaningless Blueberry. How can Harald Zwart even make his name on this shit. I felt every ounce of respect I had for him deviated quickly. <br /> <br /> So what about this movie that makes it so poor? Is that the story? Yes. Are they the actors? Yes. This is the whole "look and feel" of the movie? Yes. <br /> <br /> Starting with the story, my god! It's about clich√©-ridden and predictable as you'd expect from a drunk 14-year-old writing his / her paper on "What I did this summer". The feel-good atmosphere that the artists are trying to achieve is simply drowned out, as we are still embarrassed by the story. <br /> <br /> The actors are amateurs, so I can't expect them to be of the same quality as professional actors. But to make it work, the characters have to be charming and / or funny (preferably both), so the viewers don't consider the turbulent acting, or even add it to the characters. In this case, not even near baby! You'd rather disapprove of the characters, and by the end of the movie (I think it's about 90 minutes, though it feels like 4 o'clock), you have a strong desire to hurt someone to give you understanding of this annoying stupid guys! It will be impossible to successfully find this movie's attempt at humor unless you are actually like this stupid guy. Their previously mentioned lack of talent and credibility as far as it goes, just makes the foolish and overly simple scenes harder on the ground. Even the family of the people involved will find it hard to find anything, but very, very embarrassing (I'd rather have my sister make her a fool on American Idol). Finally, why in a lot of misplaced Norwegian acquaintances? They look even more out of place than the actors, if possible. This celebrity cameos just adds to the cheap feel of the movie and is in itself a nice translucent shot in the dark to improve something that has been broken before the start. <br /> <br /> I can't even begin to stress how much, I'd rather watch paint dry than ever, look at this movie again ...
