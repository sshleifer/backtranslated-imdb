I saw it at my local supermarket and I knew Debra was in it, and I decided to buy it (from the support of that sexy woman!) The plot and acting in this movie was terrible (except for Debra Wilson; I'm not just saying I love her, she was seriously the only actor or actress who had emotional in their acting and voice!) What I didn't get at the beginning was why the woman didn't just return not her car instead of running randomly. It was so stupid. And it's LA (Neither kidnapped her on a public residential street - NO ... yes it's realistic!) Also in the park, when Charlie stole the woman's cellphone (for some stupid reason), they were hell bent to find him (and at one point) when they did, they had him on the firearm - about a CELLPHONE! In fact, I doubt the LAPD would go for a stupid phone like that! The lady could walk to one of many cellphone kiosks and replace it! The children's acting skills also sucked (I think they were reading a cue card or whispering someone from the camera who lined up their lines) because they would be asked and would look and then answer in a dubious answer (e.g. "Yes, I do miss daddy?") How can all those snipers be in the trees and build on roofs in LA without being seen? I see it being played on the US at 3pm. <br /> <br /> Debra Wilson fanatics will enjoy her parts. She is the only actor with any real skills (Debra, sweetheart - stop this cheap D degree, live on video ... maybe it will change with the upcoming movie Whitepaddy.) She puts jokes there (like when one of her superior comes up and asks her who she is talking, she yells at her computer and goes "Damnit, Charlie!") I gave it a 4/10 ... a 4 because of Debra's good acting skills.
