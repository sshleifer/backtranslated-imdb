It must be the most boring movie I've ever seen. The only positive thing I can say about this is that I didn't pay to see it. We had a free show at school and everyone in the audience just sat down and wondered when the fun started. This piece of junk is a badly filmed, too long film. The real idea of ​​the movie took about 10 seconds to host. The only one interested in this movie is those who have lost their jobs and want to know why. They may find interesting interviews. Another editor may have made an interesting documentary of this, but I doubt it. The interviews experienced were by no means involved. As it is, it's just a tragedy, both to see and to be part of. Avoid this movie at any cost!
