I'm deeply disturbed by some posts I read on the message boards for this movie, people say it's actually a good movie! Just because this movie is your Boll's best to date, it doesn't make a good movie at all, not in hell! Far Cry is a clichéd rubbish full of bad acting, poor direction, and an uninspired story with a crazy script. This is Boll's first pure action movie, and news flash people, action movies are not too difficult to make, because for a basic action movie, everything you need is spreading and gunfighting spread over a thin plot and hay, Mr. Boll does it. House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, and Bloodrayne, all horror games customized by Boll in movies, are much worse than that (they have no redeeming features). Far Cry boasts two things that make it even better: two good leads and some well done actions. Til Schweiger is very good as Jack Carver, and Emmanuelle Vaugier is a strong female head. The usually good Udo Kier is acceptable as the klichéd villain and the supporting role play is pretty damn damn. At the end of the film, there is a surprisingly tense sequel that is regarded as a shock, since Boll was behind the camera. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the rest of the movie has an incredibly cheap feel, with bad CGI, loose one-liners and clichés around every corner. Oh, and the worst is a sex scene I think I have ever seen. Not only have the two known only six hours, but all that is needed is that he should stay while staying in the army, by saving his fellow soldiers. He's got her to take off his clothes just by telling her. Then he got down and climbed into bed because he was afraid of hypothermia. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a bad movie. It's a senseless action movie that can kill 80 minutes if you're completely bored. One can probably be worse than hitting and watching, but I would personally like to see a classic action movie like Die Hard or Predator watching and staying away from this derivative mess. <br /> <br /> 1½ / 5
