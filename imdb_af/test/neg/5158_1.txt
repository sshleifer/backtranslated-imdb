Worst movie ever !! It's not smart or funny or thought-provoking. 84 minutes of bad actors did their best with a terrible script. <br /> <br /> The work was so bad you could see the dead people breathing. Perhaps the author / director combination believed that they were Quentin Tarantino or something (you know a movie about nothing is still cool), but failed. <br /> <br /> I hope the author never makes a movie ever !! Not everyone is born a writer, sometimes we have to count our losses and return to a bathroom clerk or whatever. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie, even on dumb stereo it will still be a painful 84 minutes.
