Russians never filled children's toys with explosives over Afghanistan, it never happened !!! Who made this invention? Hollywood depicts Russian army as terrible, terrible troops of evil! This is disgusting !! US President Jimmy Carter has accepted the view that "Soviet aggression" cannot be regarded as an isolated event of limited geographical importance, but should be a potential threat to the Persian Gulf region. The uncertain extent of Moscow's ultimate goal in its sudden southward dive made the American game in an independent Pakistan all the more important. There is a lot of damage done to the population of civilian children by landmines.
