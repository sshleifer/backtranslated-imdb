Sadness was the emotion I felt after the screen became dark. Surprised, was another. Why would two seasoned fencers, such as Matthau and Lemmon, sign on to this turbulent project? I'm under the impression that they didn't read the script before the cameras started rolling. All the movies are wasted, in this unparalleled, uninteresting and unimaginable movie. Unfortunately, it was one of the most elegant Edward Mulhare's latest projects, here and there. Dyan Cannon tries, Hal Linden looks bored, Donald O'connor recites a few lines fraught with curse. (?? !!). I'm not at the "Legion of Decency." My point is that they are purely mocked because the strangeness of him is not using color. It is a desperate attempt to add "humor" to a picture. He did, however, render the film's only entertainment item, but when he patented on the dance floor. I save my strongest criticism of the lead. Walter Matthau had to know better. He still performs great solo performances (IQ, Dennis The Menace, etc.). His character, though lovely, is rather dull and one dimensional. Once saw him, saw him. Jack Lemmon still gives one of his trademark, asphalt, "just to darn sensitive" male portrayals. When he starts that mode, I want to give him a box of tissue. OUT TO SEA is painfully unfunny, and anyone who produced this mess must be made to walk the board.
