For some of us, director Ernst Lubitsch, devoted to his underlying resentment and ironic comic touch, it was quite wet when it came to picking material. It's not that Lubitsch is overestimated - on the contrary, he was probably ahead of his time in terms of a visual story - but the projects he attached (or assigned) are not quite the landmarks of comedy fans they want to label . With the "Heaven Can Wait", a screen adaptation of Lazlo Bus-Fekete's play "Birthday", Lubitsch is sown with sleepy Don Ameche in the lead - and the combination of an anemic plot, a colorless star and " a director framework stymies. An evil man at the beginning of the century "falls asleep without realizing it", presenting the facts of his life before the entrance of Hell. Ameche ... evil? It was problem number one. The promising opening sequence (in the Hades lobby) quickly gives a brave refuge, and the supporting role is of little help. * 1/2 of ****
