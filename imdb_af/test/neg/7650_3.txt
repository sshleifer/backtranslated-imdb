John Sayles, what did you do? <br /> <br /> "Silver City" had moments in which I could see the glittering hope of a good story, well-drawn characters, thought-provoking dialogue. And then those moments will be quickly covered by layers of poor writing, awkward direction, and improper acting. I really love all John Sayles's work, but "Silver City" is terrible. <br /> <br /> I have the feeling that Sayles might have worked out a good story at the beginning of the illegal labor and industry. Corruption plot lines, but then he rushed and fixed the secondary plot line satirizing the Bush administration on it. The two stories do not really make contact with each other, and the weaker elements of the political theme dominate the first three quarters of the movie, which makes me lose patience with the whole issue. <br /> <br /> The other big mistake is Danny Huston's play. His dialogue in every scene is rendered with a grin, regardless of its relevance to the mood. I hated this guy by the end of the movie, reminding every bad actor in every high school game I've ever seen. If I haven't seen Huston anything else, I don't know if he should blame him or give Sayles direction any more. Regardless, he is the unfortunate focal point of a very unfortunate movie. <br /> <br /> Right down to the last sledgehammer subtle final scene, I was disappointed by "Silver City." Sayles at its best, or quite, even Sayles in mediocre, can be so much better than this movie. See ANY of his other works. It's not even worth a rent.
