I remember that Hey Hey Fuss and I saw the Jackson Jive, it was a pretty straight forward comedy skit But I saw it and it's free and is in the clear? Did I miss something? If the black community had to complain about any racist comment in a TV show, it should be and if you read my previous comment, I'm not the easy to condemn man. The Basic Plot Is This An African American Movement In Next To This White Guy & They Make These Racist Remarks Like The Value Of A Home Will Just Fall Because Of Black Neighbors And The White Guy Make References Like (If You Are Easily Attacked by racial slurs Don't read) Nig-Still Jungle Boy Sambo. (I apologize, but it really does happen in this show, I'm really a guy who is fine with the black community). People can say that he is relieved, but even when you take the race off, it's not funny. No new jokes. Can swear in one episode, I've seen someone's eyes focus on something that doesn't relate to the situation. All In All Terrible Comedy.
