QUESTION: How does a movie earn two different titles such as "The Librarians" and "Strike Force"? <br /> <br /> ANSWER: The movie is soooooooo bad that movie makers couldn't even decide on a title !!!! <br /> <br /> This film is a hodgepodge of martial arts, death wish vendettas, melodrama, romance and other clich√© film techniques. The story focuses on a vigilante group called The Librarians led by Agent Simon (WIlliam Forsythe). The group is hot in pursuit of a deadly, multilingual, pockmarked creature called Marcos (Andrew Divoff) who captures women and holds their hostage in the lawless urban world of South Florida. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds appears as a cameo in this movie, and his scene is completely out of action. Burt delivers a long monologue in one of the strangest traits I've ever heard. It may have been Burt's attempt at an Irish dialect, but the overall effect is a kind of perverted imitation of Marlon Brando in "The Godfather." <br /> <br /> Also in this movie is Erika Eleniak, who infiltrated the inner circle of Marcos bizarre world. Erika's character kicks her way in an alliance with Simon. Librarians and Erika become a powerful strike corps against the evil in a movie delivered directly from the editing room to your cable TV converter box.
