Barney is that idiotic dinosaur who (unfortunately) didn't die many other centuries with the other dinosaurs. Instead, he sings stupid songs and has stupid morality about life that is 100% worthless and / or extremely dangerous. This is "STRONGER IS YOUR FRIENDS YOU DON'T EVER!". Why I say he's angry? Well, on YouTube, there's a video of a barney song about toy balls. When it is played backwards, it comes out like, "We'll all hold your heel! Let us bump the climber!" Don't believe me? See it for yourself! I also read on another review that they are now reading PC folklore and fairy tales. Now it's just stupid with a capital S! I mean, really! Anyway, I do not recommend that your children show this filth, because it contains stupid morals like strangers are your friends (as said before), there is never a reason to be sad, and if you are sad , eat this mess taboo, magic can solve all your troubles and heaps of other ridiculous crap.
