The things I find annoying on the screen, the things I'm going through, and the people trying to watch movies with me, are the moment the writer, director, set designer, screen caterer or someone who doesn't think to the end, and through a single act of failure - or commission - all other work that was undone by anyone working on the movie. That moment of "Wait a blue minute ... What just happened?" It stops the narrative death in its tracks. (Not that the film's narrative was much needed, because anyone who has ever seen it will know that Quintet's narrative has frozen quite well before the end of the opening shot.) There are several moments in this movie. And you get so long to think about them too. The movie was two hours long and the written dialogue probably ran up to five pages. There is plenty of time to consider the shortcomings. <br /> <br /> The movie is put in a frozen earth. Another ice age has set in and the whole world dies. It's cold. Very cold. It's really very cold on the screen. The movie was shot in Canada in winter and there are icicles and real snow and people's breath in their mouths in every scene. It is reminded again and again how cold it is. People wear great hats and layers and low clothes and wander like overcast Weeble people. Must have been a terrible shoot. My nitpick comes in a sequence when our hero goes into a hotel room. He woke up in the middle of the night by voices from the room next door, and he heard a conversation of great importance for the scanty plot by a large grid in the wall dividing the two chambers. I don't ask why there is a convenient grid in the wall between the two rooms. What annoyed me was the fact that the timetable was not blocked by the long-term tenant at the noisy visitor. If you try to keep warm, the last thing you need is a large gaping, dry hole in your wall that leads to an uninhabited unheated room. Trust me. I live like this, I watched this movie sit on a lounge sofa under a duvet with a hot water bottle. My breath was as much as the actors. If that big hole was in my wall, I would lock it up with something. Maybe not the best choice of the movie to see in midweek, but the boy showed that I see the bad isolation in the movie.
