<br /> <br /> After the white and vitality of Highway 61 and Roadkill, I expected this movie to shine, but it was so bloated and confident than the hard rock stars it had parodyed. The pass has dragged, not helped by an excessive hallucination sequence, the characters were flat and irrevocable and Art Bergmann is not a Jello Biafra. I had to wake myself to stay awake.
