It's a horrible movie, barely recognizable from the book, although they have similar plots. The time it takes to watch this movie (which lasts just 1.5 hours) will be much better spent doing anything else, including seeing grass. Adding badly done fantasy scenes makes Catherine immaculate. The actress who plays Catherine also comes across everything as good as everything and looks constantly surprised, even though she's supposed to look lovingly at her Tilney's eyes. Honest !! The film ends with a fantasy-like scene of the Catholics that one cannot help but wonder if it has happened, or if she is just cruel, and not in the good way that makes you think, but on a completely terrible way that basically summarizes the terrible movie. The only good thing about the movie is the title, which is by Mrs. Austen himself was written. I generally love the BBC's productions, but this one is terrible.
