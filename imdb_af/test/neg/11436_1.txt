I can't figure out what Jon Voight might think when he got involved in this tenth, incoherent, pretentious, ingenious slap. He helped write the alleged "script" himself, and he must be ashamed and ashamed of it. The movie (I can't call it a movie because it's hardly moving) is suddenly pretentious, like a very bad Oprah Winfrey show, but worse. It winds back and forth from the Middle Ages to contemporary Los Angeles, with Voight as a television producer who thinks he is the reincarnation of a medieval prince who has to save the kingdom from the evil of his evil brother, and somehow it transferred to modern times where Voight has to save the country from the evil hijackings of an oil company chief executive. If the bizarre decisions (Wilfrid Brimley, Frankie Valli (!), Kaye Ballard and Armand Assante, among others) are not enough to kill it, it is stupid, the flushed photography (it looks like it was shot with a real cheap 16mm camera), the almost complete lack of editing (screens are actually going and ending or cut in the middle of a sentence), and Voight's embarrassment, seemingly stream-conscious, "acting" is enough to bury it. , which is exactly what to do with it. A Jaw Drop experience. Avoid this dog at all costs.
