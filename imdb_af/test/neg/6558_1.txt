Welcome to plan 9 from the outer space of Star Trek movies. Come on, tractors, admit it. This movie is so bad, so terribly inactive in every section, it has become something of a classic. <br /> <br /> The Shat gives the worst performance ever dedicated to celluloid. "BOONE! Hi, Bones" Brilliant! It's not just Ham - there are several great pig farms in Kentucky! <br /> <br /> The "special" effects. Must be done under the trade description law for the use of such term. The Enterprise is a moving piece of cardboard in this movie. Really! Even the Star Trek TV show is better. <br /> <br /> Bene, Spock and The Shat sing! Yes, Spock is riding a drive driving your boat. After struggling over the meaning of the words !!!! "Capt. Life is not a Dream" Poor Leonard Nimoy, he must really strangle Shatner for this. Couldn't The Shat tell us his version of Mr. Tambourine Man did not give, or harmonized with Nimoy on Ballad or Bilbo Baggins? Very disappointed. <br /> <br /> A Sean Connery watch-like-play Spock's half-brother. Just because they couldn't get Sean Connery! Uhura does a fan dance! It would have been sexy in 1966. In 1989, it's like seeing your drunk grandmother find herself at a Christmas party. <br /> <br /> Catwoman jumps on Shatner's back! Shat twirle her around a few times like a WWF Wrestler, and chucks her off. Yayy The Shat! Looks like Connery 2.0 was a bit of a Vulcan rebel. What explains why Spock hasn't mentioned him in 79 episodes and 4 movies yet. McCoy allegedly killed his father, but they found a gesture. Tell me it's not funny. <br /> <br /> The 11 covers Enterprise suddenly grows another 400 decks for an escort in a lift. Spock's antigrav boots also incredibly support Bones and The Shat. Also use em on the retreated whales in Star Trek IV! Shatner meets God! Or what it says is God, but I suppose it's really a kind of stranger. God looks like Charlton Heston in the 10 commandments. Sean Connery calls the 2nd God to share his pain, and immediately dies. Or something. God punishes the Shat for questioning his identity. So Spock kills God with a photon torpedo. I want to know what Jehovah's Witnesses have done about this scene. <br /> <br /> After killing God, the Shat goes back to his singing song with Spock and Bones. All in all, Drive Your Drive Your Boat .....
