OK, I just cut channels and caught DW3. I looked to know that it would be trash. But if anyone has seen tons of movies, this one is one of the most pure bad movies I've ever seen. I'm not joking. It's so bad you have to see it, like a bad accident you can't turn away from. Sometimes these types of movies, IE, Troma movies ... but watch Martin Balsam and Charles Bronson get it, because it's painful. What's worse, I pulled in IMDb to see what other people were saying and it actually counts a 4.1 / 10 ??? I can't believe it made it past 1.5! Just as funny, it's not even the highlight of this series. Somehow, this garbage justified parts 4 and 5? And to conclude all this, some of the commentaries from a few have referred to this as the best of the series and its favorite movie of all time ??? Statements like that, scare me about this world!
