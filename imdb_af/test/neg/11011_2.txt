For me, this movie was just confusing, slow and uninteresting. Why did the strangers decide to communicate through ants? It does not make sense. The end was stunned and didn't make any sense. Eventually I hoped the ants would kill everyone. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one at all costs. Not even MST3K can save it.
