This movie was not the best, but it had good actors in it. Isiaiah Washington was pretty good as a homeless man, Guy Torrey was good as his disabled brother, Ice-T was humorous as the landlord and surprisingly ... actress Tami Roman was good as the judge in the movie. I didn't even know it's her and I'm a dying Real World fan. She was completely credible. Hopefully this movie will not hamper these actors' development. I know that Isiaiah left this film far behind with the success of Gray's Anatomy, Ice-T with its regular role on the NYPD Special Unit and Tami Roman has a recurring role in Sex Love and Secrets (UPN's new soap opera) landed. I wish the same for the other actors because one bad movie does NOT make a bad actor.
