No matter what you heard, "Fame" is not a good movie. The investment of more than two hours is not worth watching stereotypically upset teenagers dancing, singing, learning and staring at girls in the locker rooms. <br /> <br /> Every clich√© finds a cozy cottage in this movie. There is a gay teenager looking for acceptance. It would have been good if it were treated as something other than a secondary plot point. There is a ghetto child who has too much attitude - what was I surprised? And guess what? They all want to become big stars, find fame and happiness, and they will all be willing to crawl their bodies to get them. <br /> <br /> Oddly, this movie is remembered for its music. But in fact, the only moderately good song is Hot Lunch Jam, which is still too cute to be of any quality. The two most popular songs are also nothing. "Fame" is a meaningless fluff drowned by the sheer spectacle of a massive dance-in-the-street scene. And "I sing the Body Electric" (which in Bubba's name means even?!?!?!?!?) Is just an incomprehensible joke. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, tasteless dialogue and hack direction (after all, the director of "Evita") was only helped by Michael Seresin's appropriate regular camera work. But cinematography alone cannot carry a movie, especially one as uninspiring and useless as that.
