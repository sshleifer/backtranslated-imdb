I'm usually a very generous voter on IMDb and don't bother commenting on movies I didn't like, but it was just lame. I actually finished it 15 minutes before that, to see it, "This Is It" (because my gf wanted ... I just chose the lesser of two evils). <br /> <br /> If you want to watch This movie: picture this movie as a collection of worse-than-average "horror" stories, such as "scary short stories" you put in a "Reader's Digest" issue find in the waiting room of your dentist. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect anything special or scary, I'm not the "I want to see blood!" - Kind of person, but this "movie" is not "horror" or "comedy" or entertainment in any other. <br /> <br /> It is probably frightening / funny and entertaining to watch the movie print of "You Got Got Mail" 90 minutes while drinking chamomile tea. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: A "horror comedy" for people between 4 and 7.
