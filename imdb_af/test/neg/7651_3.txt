When my parents rented this movie, I expected a very funny movie, as Randy Quaid is funny in comedy movies. However, this movie is not so funny and it is also boring. You can see the surprise coming a mile away and it takes a long time for a movie that is thought to be only eighty one minutes long. So I can honestly say this is not a movie on my favorite list. It may work for some people, but it didn't work for me at all. It seems to be slow to build up with almost nothing that has amused me throughout the movie. Randy Quaid is wasted and the rest of the cast is a list of many beautiful actors and actresses. The prospect of the movie had potential, just like the Casting of Quaid, but it's just sputters and the inclusion of the horror element just seems very unnecessary. Granted, the one dream sequence the child had when he jumped on the bed and it suddenly became a bloodbath, was very well done and would have worked very well in a movie that was supposed to be pure terror, in instead of one who calls comedy as his first genre.
