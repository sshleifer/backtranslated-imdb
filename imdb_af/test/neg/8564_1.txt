Films like this make me wonder how modern horror would be if someone (graciously for movie friends) put an end to M. Night Shyamalan in the womb. This garbage is an excellent example of what kind of lame, random, uninspired, last minute, generic plots have become the norm since movies such as "The Sixth Sense" and "The Others" have been released. It was a good movie until the authors wrote everything about the mediocre script they wrote. They decided, "Hey, here's an interesting idea: let's throw a crazy twist to the end and make the main character the killer! It'll throw the audience for a loop!" What an original idea.
