I have seen this movie several times, this is probably one of the cheapest action lights of the eighties. So, I think many viewers will definitely change the channel if they come across this one. But if you're in big trash, "Dragon Hunt" is made for you. The main characters (the McNamara Twins) play big mustaches and look so ridiculous in their camouflage dresses. One of the best scenes is when one of the shots is shot in the leg and still kicks his enemies into nirvana. This movie is really terrible, but then it's a nice party band!
