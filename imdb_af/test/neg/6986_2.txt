Don Wilson stars as a police officer who enjoys the occasional virtual reality game, but things go wrong when people behind the game decide to take the virtual reality to a new level by making real people out of the video game, okay , actually they make the cube rule as a prototype, but the main bad guy of the video game is awakening and killing people and now the only man can hit the man, Don Wilson, who in the meantime falls in love with the cybersex model. In fact, with all the things considered, my biggest confusion was trying to understand whether the people of virtual reality brought land, robots, people, cyborgs or just some kind of unknown computer program. It doesn't matter, it's all just an excuse to see one of the worst actors ever slaughtering dialogue as if he were a deli. Don Wilson's complete lack of charisma is the biggest mistake of the movie as one just doesn't like the guy, he's too good, well, his voice is too high and doesn't look very impressive in the action series. Saving this drill festival of my lowest score is Athenia Massey, who looks super warm in a high-quality outfit and sometimes gets naked. Also aboard is Loren Avedon (a good martial artist), Stella Stevens and Michael Dorn as the main stamp of the bad guy, but their efforts are in vain because they are all hidden by Wilson's very bad play. Another mistake that is the biggest mistake of the movie is a lack of action, as we are asked to unfold the story, but apart from Massey's nudity and perhaps unintentional entertainments due to a nice convincing play, there really is nothing of interest. It also extends to the action sequences in which flat choreography, badly directed and totally drained of all possible excitement. This makes it virtually unshakable. <br /> <br /> * From 4- (Bad)
