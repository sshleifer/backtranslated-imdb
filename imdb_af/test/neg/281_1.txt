I was forced to write about this movie after joining IMDb because I thought it was the worst writing I have already seen. <br /> <br /> The acting / direction / other parts of the movie are fantastic. I love Brad Pitt with George Clooney. It works. The spectacular banter was also there from the first movie. My question is how in the world did they drop this script from the essay process? I thought the plot didn't just develop as a snail racing up to the end of the pavement, but it turned around? (I can name it) was so incredibly stupid that I wanted to ask for a ticket refund. I have never played like this and used a movie in my life. Here I expected something similar to the first movie (good chemistry, good acting, good direction, great plot) to just find that they took me $ 8 and made a mockery. <br /> <br /> The part that still gets me is that this movie has now earned more than $ 125 million. <br /> <br /> In summary, I felt this movie insulted my intelligence. I still feel that the only part the authors concentrated on was the little thing about Julia Roberts acting like Julia Roberts. This movie made me sad and angry.
