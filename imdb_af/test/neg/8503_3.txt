I wasn't impressed with the Graffiti Artist, despite being artificial (low budget improvisation). There is little dialogue and at least I was disappointed that it no longer gave credit or promoted the work of guerrilla artists like that. Instead, it was a well-known story. Two guys who basically do little like tag buildings become friends, tagging partners, and eventually experimenting with a relationship. They look like opposites, rather uncomfortable together. Little is explained about their backgrounds and the things between the two young men happen at fast speed (though I can understand it because it is just 70 minutes or so). There have been countless numbers of similar plots and productions to the point in recent years that the sphere of independent film is just as saturated with this particular storytelling as the mainstream has become saturated with this and more. <br /> <br /> Much of the movie can endure the viewer who needs immediate dialogue and purpose. The primary figure of this story (at least in detail), executes its routines with almost no dialogue, no insight, and nothing else to carry the viewer. And for a short movie I wished they could reach much faster. This, apart from the typical plot, irritated me. Yet there was something about a brief overview of the daily habits of at least two graffiti artists, even though it was mostly uninhabited. <br /> <br /> Recommended if you are tired of the ordinary crap and don't mind an indie picture and are interested in this underground, urban art form. But you really have to look for yourself, because it seems to be one with a more acquired taste. For more recent indie films focusing on graffiti artists, go to Transit.
