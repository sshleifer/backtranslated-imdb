Christopher Guest is the master of the mockumentary. Werner Herzog is one of the many documentaries out there. Zak Penn is also not good, but he can definitely take a lesson from the other two. Guests often play around with reality and fiction, but the line between the two is always evident in his films, a necessity with a mockumentary. Penn can also take a lesson from The Blair Witch Project. Although you knew it was a fake documentary that bought you all over the world, the filmmakers created it. It seems to the audience that the whole thing is real, even though you know, deeply, you are watching fiction. In other words, it was fiction that was successfully disguised. In fact, many early audiences who watched it thought at Sundance and other premiere audiences it was real. Penn, whose forts, according to his own admission, is writing magazine, will probably have to comply. Documentary or mock-documented movie-making (and it's hard to know where one starts and the other ends with this movie) is of course not. <br /> <br /> Penn sets the stage for what it is trying to sell as a legitimate documentary about filming a documentary, sort of a meta-documentary. However, Penn confuses the audience and loses their confidence when he comes to Herzog's house before filming Herzog's film, Enigma or Loch Ness, about the myth of the Loch Ness monster (a movie that was never finished, probably due to Penn's interference). Although Penn seems to be the director of the movie we are watching, he starts by watching the cameras and saying, "What are the movie staff doing here?" and start moving away from them. He also does so at a few other occasions. He will stop and tell the cameras to stop filming, and force the camera man to hide in the shadows to retrieve snippets of dialogue between Herzog and Penn. It looks like it's a clumsy, but it's never made clear, and Penn apparently keeps us in the dark. It made the audience scratch its head and wondered, "Who's in control?" If Penn works for his own film crew, what kind of world are we part of? This is just one of many examples of how he confuses the line between reality and fiction. <br /> <br /> Penn only seems to enter the fictional world completely (I think) when the crew has sightings of what the Loch Ness monster looks like. But by the time the monster made its first appearance, we totally abandoned the fictional world that Penn attempted to make. It just looks stupid and useless. <br /> <br /> This is a potentially fascinating movie and a truly missed opportunity, as Penn has the opportunity to document a master at work but loses focus and becomes a movie about Penn and his fiancee instead of filming a documentary. Penn's presence begins to break through and overshadow everything in the movie. <br /> <br /> The Herzog interviews are convincing and we actually believe he is not acting. We even start wondering if he and Penny, and others on his crew, are immersed, much like the audience, but you're never sure about it. Penn, in his interviews with the camera, tries to be weird and unintentionally funny, like the characters in a guest documentary, but he only manages to be annoying. In a gas film, these effects are hilaries, while they are flat here because you never know what Penn is going to do. Consequently, we, the audience, start as much as the crew believes. Apart from the beautiful scenery and the abundant appearance, from nowhere, of a beautiful model being thrown in to give the movie, there is little to recommend. Perhaps his only redeeming quality (an unintended one to it) is a good example of why the audience is important; and by completely ignoring the conventions of storytelling, you make them a disorder. For this reason alone do I think it would be a good movie to show to film students? kind of a "what not to do" kind of movie. I have nothing against a movie that has been told in an unconventional way, as long as it is done skillfully, with a thematic basis to give it dust. This movie is completely missing. <br /> <br /> I'd like to call it a brave effort, but I'm not sure what it is, except for a complete mess and ultimately a waste of time. <br /> <br /> (As a lace note, it looks like bad art always comes back to mind. This film reminds me of Lillian Ross's "Picture" book. Ross overturned John Huston during the filming "The Red Badge of Courage" and documented it brilliantly for the New Yorker, which would make a good movie, if you want a good example of meta-art, read it.)
