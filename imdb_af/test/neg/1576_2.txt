I watched this movie while watching television at the infomercials and the late night 80s one morning at 2 in the morning. I have to say, I didn't expect much, and I didn't get much. Although Rose McGowan is warm, her performance and the performance of the rest of the cast was not worthy of Oscar's to say the least. This movie has its ups and downs, and has some nice twists at the end, but it was frankly horrible. Not even a typical slasher movie. No gore, no sex, no nakedness, no real violence. Just bad acting. I'll give it a 3 out of 10.
