It's easily one of the worst movies I've seen (and I've seen Starship Troopers 2 recently!). I couldn't find anything to release this movie. The play, which is probably the best aspect of the movie, is right at its best. Michael Madsen is hammering it into his standard character character. Denis Hopper does not seem to know what he is supposed to be. Vinnie Jones accent is bizarre. One positive thing is that Leonor Valera looks fantastic. Her acting is pretty poor, but I doubt that's why shes there. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is really terrible. It's just junk. I don't know who signed off here, but they really need to get professional help next time. <br /> <br /> This movie is why the IMDB rating system should include zero stars out of ten. Avoid at all costs.
