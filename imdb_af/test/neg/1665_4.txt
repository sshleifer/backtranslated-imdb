André Roussin was a specialist of what the French "Theater de Boulevard" calls: play where you find the eternal triangle: male / female / (male or female) lover. Many of his plays gave Elvire Popesco some of her best parts on stage. ... and the big actress was the main reason to see it, because Roussin is not Sacha Guitry. The French audience remembers 'Au Theater Ce Soir'. <br /> <br /> Still with me? Roussin's plays were not made to be filmed. And this one is pretty mediocre material, even if authors call Lewis Lewis Carroll to their rescue. I love Stewart Granger and David Niven, and Ava Gardner is eye candy. But this may be the worst movie. Rough, predictable - the indigenous (Bola-Bola) intervention is ridiculous - a raid on a Menage à Trois on a desert island where Granger is a kind of Robinson, Niven, his Friday and Gardner his girlfriend Friday.
