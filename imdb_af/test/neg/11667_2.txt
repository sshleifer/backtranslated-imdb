Initially I wrote what was a sarcastic, synoptic overview of this pathetic piece, but every time I submitted the review, I "contained a very long word that was not allowed", also words that were not wrong was spelled wrongly. <br /> <br /> Now the word that has been judged too long has never been identified. After many attempts to eliminate words, I eventually had the suspicion that the IMDb website is politically sensitive and automatically rejects certain words. Nothing I wrote was obscene or racist in itself. But after all the longest words have been eliminated, the same message is repeated repeatedly, and words that have not been judged are spelled incorrectly. is everywhere.
