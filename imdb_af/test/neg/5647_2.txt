A bit of a horrible movie, I'm surprised that people like Derek Jacobi and Vanessa Redgrave have agreed to be in it, it's like an overlaid episode of a poor TV detective series. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake should be Vinnie Jones, he simply can't act. Who had the brilliant idea of ​​throwing him as a leading man to investigate their head unless he put his own money in the project? He must stand to play rogue, watch threat and NOT speak! <br /> <br /> Was there central heating in Dickens's times when there were three big jets behind his desk? <br /> <br /> No wonder they gave it for free with a newspaper, as no one would pay to see it.
