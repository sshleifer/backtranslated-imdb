No gore, no blood, no satisfactory death tones ... stupid stupid stupid. Dear God, sitting through this movie made me sick. Sick sick sick. Very boring ... very boring ... <br /> <br /> There's not even a humorous aspect of this movie! I can't find a good thing to say about it, except the chief had a nice body ... I think. Definitely not the fifty cents I paid to rent it.
