Very slow, boring, mysterious movie. Perhaps the kind of movie Jean-Luc Godard would have made if he was Italian. Certainly, how boring, repetitive, joyful and empty can be a person's life, but I usually don't go to the theater to figure it out! The plot (as it is) convinced. Why would a beautiful hotel receptionist (an exception to the boredom of the movie) be the least interested in a naughty chain smoke, silent one speaking in "deep" aphorisms, baffles me. Very difficult to feel any sympathy for the main character. One feels like shaking his throat and telling him to get it out! ". His brother is a much more human character. The end is unconvincing and mysterious. Everybody in the movie (when I watched the movie) fell apart about how they almost fell asleep. Of course it should not be a Hollywood Bruce Willis-style 'shhot-em-up' and 'crash-bang' fiesta, but a bit of energy and action would have made it much more exciting. One of the best Italian movies ever?! Pleease ... An art house, curiosity at its best.
