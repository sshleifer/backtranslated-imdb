It's a very strange movie, with a no-name cast and virtually nothing on the web known. It uses an approach familiar to those who watched the appearance of Creepshow by introducing a trilogy of so-called "horror" shorts and tracing it in a connecting tale of the people involved in the segments of a bus. . There is a narrator talking about relationships, but his talk doesn't add anything to the mix and just adds to the confusion. Regarding the stories, it's good. I swear I had no idea why this movie had an 18-certificate in the UK, which would align it with Nightmare On Elm Street and The Exorcist. Nothing here is even scary. There is no gore, sex, nudity or even a curse word to do things. This is the kind of thing you can put on Children's TV and no one will bat an eyelid. I can only think if it deserves the appreciation it really deserved (a PG), no serious horror fans will be seen dead, so the distributor has probably triggered the BBFC until they were excited. Anyway, here are the 3 stories in summary: 1. A man is dangerously obsessed with his telekinetic car to the point of alienating his fianc√©. 2. A man living in a dirty apartment is understandably upset when a living organism has developed from its six-month-old tuna boxer. 3. A woman thinks she has found the perfect man through a computer service. That's until he barely starts acting. And there you have it. Some of them are pretty amusing because of their foreign premises (my favorite is number 2), but you get the feeling they are meant to be a) terrifying and b) morality games, unfortunately they both miss unhappy. In short, this movie is a dark curiosity. For many good reasons.
