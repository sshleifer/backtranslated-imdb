Ravi Chopra wrote this role back 40 years, Dilip Kumar wanted to envisage. <br /> <br /> The movie was finally rewritten and made in 2003 and therefore the subject looks immediately and superficially. <Br /> <br /> As the reason Amitabh-Hema is separated, it's too shallow, even the way the app is shown is too bad as Gulshan in AVTAAR <br /> <br /> The message comes good, but things are presented in a clich√©d way. Salman's character is the worst, look straight from a storybook while the climax of Bachchan is good and also the final not to forgive the boys is good. <br /> <br /> Ravi Chopra does a great job. Music is decent, the songs sing by Bachchan stand out <br /> <br /> Amitabh glorified as always, he used to play an older strict father, but here he plays a victim and portrays it well. His last speech is great. Hema is good in her part. Aman Verma standing out Samir Soni is good, Naser and the rest boys and women are decent, although Divya Dutta stands out Salman Khan is fa ke, Mahima is okay Paresh and Lillete love
