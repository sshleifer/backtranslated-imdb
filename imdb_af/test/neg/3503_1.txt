I'm surprised that anyone likes this movie. I never run out of movies, but my friend had to physically stop me from leaving the theater during this abusive disaster. the white characters are saints and the Asian characters are virtually non-existent and worthless for the story. they only exist as objects, surprise. Characters of other breeds cost much better. The turn and turns were laughable and predictable. but if you read it, you already know it. Paul Haggis is a hack. Hollywood can't even do multicultural movies right. Do yourself a favor and look for a much more honest take on relationships, Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle!
