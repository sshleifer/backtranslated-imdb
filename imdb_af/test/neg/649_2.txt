If you like bad movies, this one is a real surprise. Kaufman & Peters turn around in robotic costumes, escape slavery only to deliberately wander and find true robot love. I believe this is the first movie I ever made to consider walking out. I should note that I was 12, and can be entertained by shiny objects.
