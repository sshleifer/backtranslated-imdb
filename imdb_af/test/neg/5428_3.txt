O God. Why is Nickelodeon so difficult to produce even half a decent film? I mean, this movie might have been good, but it was: <br /> <br /> A. Short B. Very superficial, stereotypical and insulting to some C. Ultimately useless <br /> <br /> First , the "dressing of the nerd to look cool" was many consumers, VERY superficial, VERY useless, and very offensive. It has never kissed the stereotypical nerd-stupid faces, glasses, holidays with his mother, etc. Well, maybe that's why the man has never kissed a girl, because he's gay! Does this mean that all gays are nerds? And what's wrong with being friends with your mother? <br /> <br /> The worst part, by far, was the end. The whole drama of the movie turned out to find out Zoey who loved Chase, and blah blah, and when Chase finally decided to tell her, <br /> <br /> A. He didn't tell her personally because he came up with the typical distraction. B. He tried to text her, but her PDA fell in a fountain and died before she got the message. <br /> <br /> The end. <br /> <br /> HOW LAME IS THAT ????? I mean, why is it that cartoon artists cannot change anything in the series? So many of us would like to see these two come together. Why can't we see it? I mean, are the producers really so terrific that they can't face new problems with changes in the series? So should they keep the same plot and outlines, and make as many episodes as they can just use them? After a while it becomes boring and frustrating. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see some real romance here, DARN! <br /> <br /> Good. I'm done with my rant.
