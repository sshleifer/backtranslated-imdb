"The Twins Effect" is the worst movie I've ever seen! Not only is the support poor, but also the characters. I'm sorry to tell your Edison fans, but Kazaf is by far the worst vampire I've seen in my life. I'm sorry Edison; Your role in this movie was disappointing. Edison did not fight completely in this movie and I'm sure if they didn't have Kazaf in the movie, the plot wouldn't be much different. The main plot in the movie is not nearly explained and the entire film focuses too much on Helen and Kazaf's growing relationship. I mean, who was hell Kazaf and why did they need his blood? Yes, he is the prince right? Approximately! <br /> <br /> Certain scenes in this movie were just stupid. Yes, the action was wonderful, but the whole outline was stupid. In one stage to the end, Duke Dekotes says Kazaf is the strongest of his brothers ... yes it looks like he's grown up now. Why would you wait until he grew up to attack? Another scene was with Jackie Chan, one of my personal favorites. In the scene, Jackie asked Helen who were the creatures they kept following. How can you be so naive as not knowing they are vampires? People die by biting their necks; surely the NEWS will be faster than you can say "Vampire". <br /> <br /> The characters were another mistake in the movie. Helen, played by Charlene Choi, is Kazaf's friend. What kind of girl won't be afraid of vampires, especially if it's your brother's job to kill them? I can beg you not to find such a brave girl as Helen if you searched your whole life. Helen is annoying, bitchy, and is a total drama queen in the movie. She tries too hard to be different and eventually fails. One of the strangest and most disturbing characters I've seen in any movie. Why would you bite someone's neck, especially if you're not a vampire? It is very strange that her reaction to Kazaf's confession does not turn him off. Kazaf, played by Edison Chen, is another silly character in the story. How humiliating for a young actor like himself to play in a movie with such a poorly constructed role. He does not stand up for himself throughout the movie and fight. Although I'm a fan of Edison, I don't want a man lying on the ground all the time. Gypsy and Reeve are my favorite characters in the movie. Their love is pure and sweet. Gypsy is beautiful and doesn't try too hard like Helen. Reeve, played by Ekin Cheng, is wise and looks like the only person who makes sense in the movie. A plot failure was the death of Reeve. The movie had absolutely no dust, but it was doomed to remove one of the only beloved characters. Another character was Duke Dekotes. The story didn't focus much on him and so he was irrelevant to his desire to make Kazaf's "rock" look. <br /> <br /> It is very sad because, by the end of the film, I have to look at me because I wanted to desperately see Kazaf battle. The end was so sudden because I was so big to happen all the time. Kazaf, who is the alleged Vampire Prince, does nothing for the movie and I'm sure if he is pulled out, the movie won't be much different. I recommend NOT wasting your time on this movie as I have. I was very disappointed. If you're looking for a good movie, don't watch "Lord of the Rings" or "Pirates of the Caribbean"? Likeable characters with a well written plot.
