I wish I had read more reviews and more opinions on this movie before renting it. A waste of money. Wasting time. Very small dialogue. The dialogue was difficult to understand in every way. The storyline and plot were both poor. The only thing that was nice was the cinematography. <br /> <br /> The characters were interesting. At the same time, you will spend so much time figuring things out, due to the lack of dialogue, that you will recover the movie a lot. <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie. It was a mess and would make you feel like a mess. <br /> <br /> You'll say what was it when the movie ends?
