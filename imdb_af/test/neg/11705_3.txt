I should not have seen the same movie as the one to which the commentary refers here. First, I think they should have chosen Ghost Story if they don't want to film it at all. The abridged version they sustained was terrible. I felt the performances were manicured and so much was left out of the story that the performances of such masters such as Astaire, Douglas, Houseman and Fairbanks were hammy. Alice Krige, however, was wonderful like Eva. Craig Wasson is a good actor, but he was just as good as the lead. The decision to throw Patricia Neal and shorten her role was not a good one. Imagine what Anne Bancroft would have done with that character! I blame the writing, which was poor. The production values ​​were dark and the pace was slow. A disappointing pedestrian attempt. <br /> <br /> The book is one of the five greatest tension / horror novels of the 20th century, IMHO. But the movie was disappointing, though it was a good introduction to Krige.
