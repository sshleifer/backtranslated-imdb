What an exhausted painful experience. <br /> <br /> It's more than two hours of my life. I will never come back again. <br /> <br /> This Film Festival director's pleasure - overwhelmed with over-exploitation of the long-slow shot .... however - it's not the only thing that makes a script. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
