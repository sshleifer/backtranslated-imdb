Are you joking? The music was so high in this show that I couldn't even hear the dialogue. And the music was nothing good. Anyone know what Jake's mom said when he was in the door? And the mushroom cloud looks pretty close to having so little instant mess. Anyone investigates the effects of nuclear waste before writing this one. I felt like a bunch of sitcom actors were on the spot and didn't know what to do with dramatic dialogue. And what does a Kansas teenager know about shopping in Soho .... can't we have a better line here? Was bored with tears and just woke up by the fright of the over-mixed path to loud music.
