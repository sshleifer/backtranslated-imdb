. . . And never, ever see it. Now I've been watching bad scifi movies for years. I like watching bad scifi movies. I think that was the only reason I could see this movie all the way. I was run by "Nukie," "Indian Superman," and that awful "Fantastic Four" movie just to mention examples. Usually I have to hit my head against the wall after I have seen a bad movie go away from the pain. No, not with this one. With "TDB" I had to hit myself in the head with a shoe in the middle of the movie. Temporary solution. I can't believe I wanted to see it. I cried. When it was finished I cried. It was terrible. It was worse than when I saw * Wil Wheaton in his underwear in "The Curse", which has never looked. Apart from the fact that Wesley Crusher is in his stiff whiteys, it's just as bad. But this review is about "TDB." The worst part is that someone wrote this movie and said, "It deserves to go on film! It's great!" and Wayne Newton, Rob Lowe, and everyone in the cast said, "Oh, that's what I want at my film history!" I will look at the "Indian Superman" until the cows come home, but I will never see this blunt hope again.
