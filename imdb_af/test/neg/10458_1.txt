A great role, a fantastic CGI monster and a brilliant writing. If this movie had one of those things, it might not have been one of the worst movies I've been messing with for another half and a half. Infinite chimpanzees with infinite typewriters have not yet written the complete works of Shakespeare, but in the way it appeared in their rubbish bin and somehow made it into a movie. You can tell the actors that they sign the contracts with every word they mumble directly into the camera. The CGI is amateurish in the extreme and they may have created more tension from the cast, attacked by the Sinclair Spectrum on which it was created. I wanted to keep this movie, it has nice cameo appearances by Gil Gerard and Walter Koenig, so I expected a fun horror movie that didn't take too much. It actually tries to take itself seriously, but is about as much fun as a trip to the dentist. Do yourself a favor. Don't see this movie, you just encourage them to make more.
