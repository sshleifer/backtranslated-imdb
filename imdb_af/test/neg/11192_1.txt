If you want a good April Fool's joke, please show this movie to someone. However, it is important that you do not criticize the movie in any way, but rather talk about what an artistic triumph is and how "they just don't make good movies like this". Since your victim looks very disconnected and uncomfortable scenes (such as a cute dog that is not watched for no apparent reason, a cow standing on the bed, a woman leaking a statue's feet or allegedly raping a woman ), make a lot of comments by words such as "brilliance", "close relatives" or "transcendents" - all the time acting as if the film is actually making perfect sense and not a complete waste of an hour of your life. Also, make sure you keep a straight face and shock when (and if) they say they didn't understand it or they thought it had all the artwork of a cowboy. Then, to continue with them, they show all the comments on IMDb, like almost everyone (except for some difficult makers such as almagz and rooprect) talking glowing about which genius and artworks this movie is! By the time you finish this little charade, they'll probably think they're idiots and will make an appointment with a psychologist. <br /> <br /> This, for me, is the only possible reason to watch this horrible mess of a movie !!! Or you can show it to the Guantanamo prisoners to let them talk! <br /> <br /> If you ask me, the well-known painting of dogs playing poker or a velvet Elvis painting is superior artistic.
