Walker Texas Ranger is one of the worst shows over the past 10 years. The script for James 'Jimmy' Trivette, sidekick of Walker, is about as pathetic of a role as Wesley Crusher on Star Trek TNG, and is played with so much conviction. <br /> <br /> On this show, people are not responding to the way people respond to real-life things - everyone is polarized - everyone is either a very good guy or a bad guy (unless Walker Speak to them for 2 minutes and then change immediately. It's not how life works, it's not how people are. This performance does not occur in this reality. <br /> <br /> The plot lines are about realistic, like Murder She Wrote, a show where an arrogant old woman can only walk into human homes without getting angry. she can claim that police officers do what she wants and they bend back to her. With Walker, all on the show, including the "bad guys", act as if he were the kind of hero who made myths and fairy tales, and the time itself bowed to his whim. Moreover, the lines that sometimes come out of people's mouths on this show are ridiculous. It is as if the scriptwriter for the part of Wesley Crusher (for the "serious" parts) and the scriptwriter for Bob Saget's funniest home videos (for the "humor" parts) came together and wrote all the scripts for this show. <Br /> <br /> This show is for people who think good always dominates evil. It is for the elderly. This is for desirable thinkers. It is for people who need to be guaranteed to always be happy. It is for people who drift into oblivion. It is for people whose drug of choice is their television. <br /> <br /> Every time I see a commercial for this show. My opinion is that this is the worst show on television in the last 10 years. <br /> <br /> I was like Chuck Norris, but this show always infested him in my mind. I can't even watch his older movies without thinking about this show.
