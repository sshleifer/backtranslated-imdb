As a parent of two girls (14 and 11) I have great doubts about this show and all the shows aimed at tweens. First of all, I am always surprised that the living conditions of Drake / Josh, Zac / Cody, Hanna, Carly, Derek, Sunny, etc. Always most homes look small and cramped. Most people work hard now to pay less than half the size, but no one is going to work, pay, rent, mortgage or insurance accounts, waste, livestock, change light bulbs, toilets, etc. Just walking in and out (and among the ubiquitous wide staircases that only exist on TV sets) creaking jokes (most involving lying and hilarious results) and shrinking work. I think children look at these unrealistic expectations about how difficult they will work and how luxurious their lives will be. Secondly, there is never an intact family, always a mother or father, but never both, who always go on sexless dates, but apparently never have one of the deviations from divorce (alimony, support, arguments). Again, children can get the impression that if a mother / father is divorced, it will be fun (actually, mom or dad is often not around if it helps the plot). Needless to say there is no mention of spirituality (forget specific religion). Finally, there is a theme that botheres me. There are "nerds" who are good at school, "jocks" well in sports, "goody two shoes" as well. The protagonists are not good at school, sports or charity, but make wisecracks about those who. The message is not good for anything, but one of the "nothings" that merges into creaking jokes. Needless to say, I give all these shows a zero and turn them off all the time and are just short of banning them in my home.
