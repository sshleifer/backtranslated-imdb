I'm a big fan of bad horrors, cheap horrors, b movies, and everything under 100 movies, and I don't deny that it's the worst thing to ever import the big screen, or even your home video for matter. Some of them, e.g. The infamous Manos The Hands of the Lot is really bad, and look at them, especially only without your friends and beer, and this is a torture for a good biomass. <br /> <br /> However, La Momia Azteca Contra El Roboto Humano wasn't that bad. Well, of course it's BAD - it's silly, dated, wheat-like, cheap, etc. There is an Aztec mummy, a tin robot, a fat crook, a mad scientist, Mexican gangsters, etc. The assembly is poor, the lines, Well, let's say the lines aren't theater, the FX and SFX are the best that the Mexican low budget production could offer, etc. etc. Yet the movie is FUN. It's so bad it makes you happy for an hour. Sure, it depends on your sense of humor, but I'm pretty sure La Momia should teach any newcomer to this kind of cinema how to enjoy it. Note: the movie lasts about an hour, and I think it's just enough time for psychology that one can easily digest. <br /> <br /> There's also another thing. See how La Momia can tell you what was the whole SF / Horror genre concept in the fifties, if you compare it to the contemporary Matrix era of theater entertainment. I think it also shows how both the industry and the audience developed, because the watches such as La Momia still attract full house in the theaters for some special shows (movies like this are especially good), and often get a stand ovation.
