Johnnie (Bert Wheeler) is a songwriter; Newton (Robert Woolsey) is an excellent inventor. Both work at a cigar stand in the lobby of an office building. Johnnie wants to sell a song to Winfield Lake, a song publisher who also owns the building. Lake's secretary, Mary (Betty Grable), is Johnnie's darling. When the lake dies, circumstances make Mary and Newton think Johnnie is the killer. Their conspiracy again to involve Mary, who goes to jail. But who really shot Lake? Who is the Black Widow, the extortionist who threatened him? The other characters in this crazy murder mystery are: Lake's suspicious wife, a self-sufficient private detective, a seemingly slow guard (Willie Best), Lake's auditor, a songwriter who thinks more of him steals and someone who think everyone is stealing from him. It is up to Newton and his truth machine to reveal the right killer. <br /> <br /> The baby-voiced Wheeler and the cigar Woolsey strike me as an arbitrary couple, but they made several movies in the 30's and some were funny. <br /> <br /> Not this one. George Stevens, who had a leading career, rectified this dull comedy with a tedious murder story plot. But two scenes are good, and both feature Wheeler and Betty Grable singing the excellent "Music in my Heart" written by Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh. The first time they sing it on a staircase (after which they dance back). Later, Wheeler and Woolsey are on silence so they can see and talk to Mary, who is in a high floor prison. Wheeler and Grable sing through the bars. <br /> <br /> The Nitwits have a few laughs, but the level of comedy is best illustrated by Woolsey's line: "Sonny, you have the brain of a six-year-old boy. And I'll make sure he was glad to get rid of it. "It is dumped Groucho? Who didn't use the redundant "even" when he said it.
