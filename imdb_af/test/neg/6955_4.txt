A car for Michael Caine. It's pretty well written and there's a bit of OK on it, but really, it's a mess - not funny enough, not scary enough. It's a thin modern cockney thriller. <br /> <br /> I like the premise - that even in the broken moral hinterland of East London people are doing things for the right reasons. A surprise result for the first proper fight Caine's old school Billy Shiner has boosted his paranoia. The second half of the film was chasing him to deal with the disappointment of the outcome of the first. My biggest disappointment was in director John Irvin's failure to make more of the relationship between Shiner and his lieutenant. / branch replacement Frank Harper. Harper's, a British Tom Sizemore, understood his role well, while those around him ignored it. Sorry. 10/04
