A waste of time, talent and shelf space, it's a really poor movie. What are great leaguers like Keanu Reeves, Cameron Diaz and Dan Aykroyd wasting their time in such a mess? Small criminal Reeves comes to his brothers (Vincent D'Onofrio) wedding and ends with the bride. A comedy, Thriller, romance? I honestly know! Reeves is timber in the lead and throws Dan Aykroyd as a policeman so terrible that it must be seen to be believed! Only shiny spot of a dark dark tunnel is Diaz and even she is not that good. Hire something different. Everyone involved with this mess should keep their heads in full shame and prey that it will be lost in oblivion in the years to come.
