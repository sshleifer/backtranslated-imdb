I consider myself a decent sense of humor, but this "movie" stunned me in my chair. <br /> <br /> It's so bad it just couldn't be worse. Not once did I laugh at the unfortunate efforts in this movie. I watched and enjoyed several parodies of big movies, but unfortunately this one will always be the one I remember best in my nightmares. <br /> <br /> The only reason anyone wants to see it is if they want to enter a coma for a short period of time. <br /> <br /> It's the worst movie ever.
