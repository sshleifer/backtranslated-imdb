This movie has some funny moments. Louie, the main character was well-cast along with some other decent supporting characters. The opening shot of the movie set the tone, but the direction and story pulled off from there. Apart from a twist to the end (interesting and funny as well), I wish this movie had better direction and a more developed story. Without leaving the plot, the whole idea is better! I just wish it was done better in this short movie. The potential was there, but it didn't just deliver the goods.
