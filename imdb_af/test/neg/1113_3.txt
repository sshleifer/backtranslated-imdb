If you have described any of the screens; nightmares of children murdering you in your sleep, your baby daughter talking to ghosts and looking for your lost child in a deserted mine at night, so stunned with the fear that you cannot move even though the blood of a murder victim falls on you from the floor above? Then I would say you had a horror movie. But some how "Wicked Little Things" was just not scary. I am a horror fan and I loved the place, the plot in principal and I love the three leading ladies. I didn't want to see them get angry, I wanted the bad guy to get his neat desserts. The rest of the casting is always just gunfire, so I was also indifferent to them and it whispered every stone in the book - even to the torch battery that goes out in the pitch, just as you start whispering here. <br /> <br /> I'd still recommend seeing it, but unless you're new to horror movies or under 12, you've seen it before.
