It is as if the Stay-Puffed Marshmallow Man of Ghostbusters was reincarnated in Rutger Hauer's body and took revenge on a rival's pregnant wife! If you see an obese Hauer chase, a very pregnant Isabel Glaser (think of the backbone of that game) sounds good to you, watch this movie! Seriously, if Hauer is after a Iraqi POW appears to be in jail for six years, hungry people have to make a cattle line in a Baghdad prison. Overall Tactical Assault rates 2 stars instead of 1 because Mike Mitchell as Hawk is great. Mitchell burned the screen as a NATO pilot until his plane was burned (by an enemy fighter), after which the film lost, which small blemish had to start.
