Masters Horror: Sounds Like in Seattle where Larry Pearce works as a computer software call center manager after losing his 6-year-old son Michael (Nicholas Elia) to a bad heart condition, he thinks he's heard ultra-sensitive. Larry hears everything in ten folds, of people typing on desktop boards, whispering people over the room, people beating their feet on the floor, dripping taps and eventually even those who breathe become unbearable to Larry as he is constantly bombarded. Eventually Larry decided he had enough. If he can't stop the sounds himself, he may stop himself with the help of a big meat clever ... <br /> <br /> This Canadian American co-production was episode 4 of season 2 of the overall hit Horror TV series and mis-masters, written and directed by Brad Anderson. I thought Sounds Like was a definite mistake. The script is based on a short story by Mike O'Driscoll. I'm really surprised at the number of positive comments it has on the IMDb here. For a start I would be very hard pressed to even describe it as a horror movie and it feels more like a bizarre sentimental drama to the last 5 minutes when Howard Berger, Gregory Nicotero and the boys of KNB effects really work perform. Larry has this strange inexplicable ability to amplify the sound and sounds from the beginning, so this episode ends like 55 minutes of exactly the same kind of repetitive build that comes to an end, though it's too late to save the episode. It's pretty slow and, while well written, doesn't mean it's a horror theme and I'm a little confused about who is it? <br /> <br /> Director Anderson does OK, but he's just holding the same thing over and over again, until the last 5 minutes there's not a single drop of blood in the whole thing. There is no terror, there is no fear or tension and absolutely no atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Technically, it's very well made, has good production values ​​and doesn't look like a cheap TV program. The acting is very good, and it is a pity. The story is somewhat limited. <br /> <br /> Sounds like one of the worst Masters of Horror episodes, it looks like many people and it's good, but it's definitely not for me. Another master of horror, another disappointment.
