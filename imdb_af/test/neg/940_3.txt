I was not so impressed with this movie, and find it very tiring and simple. The plot line was interesting, a child who created his own college and enrolled hundreds of children, but the laugh was little and far between. The jokes were not really funny and I didn't let go of any of the screens. The characters weren't intriguing and I didn't feel for any of them, even the dawky, thick child with glasses who wanted to enter the frat group. It was a good first look, but it didn't blow me away and that's not one I would recommend. To compare it to other movies in the same genre, that is, American Pie is just cruel, because there is a movie that was laughable and abundant. This ACCEPT failed to raise a smile!
