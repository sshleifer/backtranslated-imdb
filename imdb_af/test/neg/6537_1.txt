Despite many positive reviews, it is a very slow movie with three mainly good actors improvising the most banal dialogue you will ever hear. It's another road movie that doesn't really go true. The camera is often out of focus and the constant panning in some of the long screens is annoying. <br /> <br /> The three characters are attractive, but beware. The role players also set an intergalactic record for using the tired word "man". (Even Howard Stern left this tired pesudo pronoun). <br /> <br /> The three primary actors and one supporting actor show great promise. They are clearly comfortable and brave that they are portrayed as level and even goofy. The character actors all seem as if they are brave amateurs who are voluntarily willing to speak a few lines. Indeed, all physically fit their roles well. <br /> <br /> All in all, a faint 90 minute look like an eternity. . This is one of my ten worst movies of all time.
