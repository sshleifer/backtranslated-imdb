I start wondering after reading some of the views here if I watched the same movie as the other reviewers, but after checking my facts, I am forced to the sad conclusion I have. <br /> <br /> This silly wannabee screw ball comedy should be one of the longest 94 minutes I've spent, and one of the most unpredictable things I've seen for centuries. Don't get me wrong, I like screw ball comedies, but these boring, tied drives so far fall short of the dizzying heights of Preston Sturges and Howards Hawks who don't deserve it (to mix my metaphors) to think of the same breath as those sizes. Author / Director Charles Martin's dialogue is not greasy, subtle or interesting - and there are so many of them. He also does not know how to end a scene, with a relentless cut, especially of people who leave rooms and say goodbye to each other, should the pace of the movie be lifted and then the fact that the limited number of characters is stupid and impeccable things for no other reason than it is supposed to be a comedy would be a little less obvious. Characters in this movie fall in and out of love with each other, moving in and out of apartments, at a moment's notice, just to move which little plot is ahead. One day, people with a desperate desire for one person desire the next, they will marry someone else. They wooed and wiped off the screen so we didn't know anything until one of the characters told us: "Oh, they're going to get married!" (Usually after someone made a faux-pass or jumped to the wrong conclusion) . If we knew that these two characters were in love or were supposed to be engaged by hand, we, the audience, could have enjoyed the experience of seeing someone foolish before them. As it is, the characters come just like selfish, petulant idiots and we have no sympathy for any of them. <br /> <br /> The sets are limited and the action limited to them in a way that makes the whole thing look like a badly filmed play. The only moments of relief from the tedium are Keenan Wynn, who seems to have been in another movie and decided to hang around and be a little harder than all the indecent things around him. <br /> <br /> Highly avoidable.
