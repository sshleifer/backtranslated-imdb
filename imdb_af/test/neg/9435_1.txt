It is easy to tell in the beginning of this movie exactly what will happen and who will die. It's about 4 women and a man on holiday. It was made at the end of the ultra-Nazi seventies, when blond women apparently earned ultra-American survivors and brunette all. <br /> <br /> This movie, like the other of that era, aims to bring it about, and the viewer knows it. There is no secret or tension. The people squabble, but everything is so predictable for the prejudices of the time, it's laughing. <br /> <br /> The five people happen to two wild young characters and nuts. Everyone is nuts, so the director team can justify their Nazi propaganda. <br /> <br /> For some reason the guy gets attracted to the blonde, who is really not much to look at, and ignores a super hot looking brunette that any heterosexual man would go nuts. One should remember that movies were meant to appeal to women and not men in the seventies. <br /> <br /> Quite crazy and totally depressed.
