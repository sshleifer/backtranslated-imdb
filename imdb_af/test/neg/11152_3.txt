I waited to welcome Arnold Schwarzeneger's return to action after the dull movies he made after "Eraser." However, "End Days" can be added to the dim films that he has the accident. <br /> <br /> "End Days" starts well with a gripping action series, but quickly becomes a drill, the focus focuses on action and tension and rather focuses on exploring demonic events and the rapidly approaching millennium (read "Doomsday"). <br /> <br /> Performances are cute, special effects so-so, and gore plentiful. Over the fact that I saw myself the hard-hit Schwarzenegger fan, I couldn't believe I didn't like this movie, but with such a terrible lame script, what could Arnie do, except on this turkey? <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 <br /> <br />
