Grosse Pointe Blank was really a below average movie. The theme of the hit man is very dry and is more like a romantic comedy than a hit. The acting is very normal. The performances are extremely embarrassing at times with many characters that look very eccentric and that really irritated me. The whole reunion and the "Wow, I haven't seen you in 10 years!" element is extremely cheesy and many scenes just move on, especially near the end when they are at the real reunion party and the characters go through each one of their former classmates to greet them. It looks very tough, meaningless and poorly executed. <br /> <br /> Dan Akroyd's role as a 'rival' killer is very sparse. He only looks once in the beginning and right at the end in a 'final show' that is hopefully much but doesn't deliver at all. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also very mediocre. . Most of the songs in this movie are straight from the 1980s and with the exception of two or three, it is very bad. Hearing duff songs over a very duff movie just adds to the negativity that surrounds this movie. <br /> <br /> I can keep on how small things were annoying and just very bad, like the very little action It came and went very fast, the lack of character development and how poor the whole thing built in that department is the way that half the time you forget Cusak's character is even a hit, as the element doesn't exist. <br /> <br /> Even the way the comedy thinks it's funny; but it is not. I didn't laugh at this movie once. Certainly, maybe I already greeted, but my only true feeling became good when I realized the movie was almost over! <br /> <br /> Please do not waste your time with 'Grosse Pointe White', despite the relatively high (but poorly wrong) IMDb rating. I've seen movies that are better than this movie that has lower ratings on this site, telling you that there are better movies there. Don't just save this one.
