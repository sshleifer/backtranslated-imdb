That's the only word I can think of to describe this movie. Don't waste like in a waste of time (any time spent with these characters is never wasted), but wastes like a waste of opportunity. <br /> <br /> If I watch this movie, I think of all the Star Trek novels that would make a much better movie than the story Shatner chose. The setup was like an average television episode, while the end point felt like the climax (if you could call it) from the first movie. <br /> <br /> In the direction of II-IV, Nimoy focused on the character of Spock - how he faced the Kobayashi Maru outside the classroom, and how he dealt with his emotional life, as he had the chance had to start fresh. Shatner could have done it with Kirk here, but he didn't. We don't know much about Kirk we didn't know yet. Again one of the novels would have been better - try "My Enemy, My Ally" for a very interesting character study by our friend James T. The underage characters are mostly used for cute pieces, and the Scotty-Uhura subplot looks like the left-hand field, especially since the sub-text was in the original series of Sulu-Uhura. <br /> <br /> Even hardcore fans can't enjoy much here. Sorry, but this is true.
