I finally managed to get through an entire episode of this show. I was very, very tired. Clear. Previously, I always had to switch it off because I thought it was so bad. To watch a full episode, convince me it's really that bad. I couldn't even tell what had happened, but I really didn't remember laughing. For people who think it's the new All in the Family or Married to Children ... have you ever seen those shows? They are well written and well behaved and more important, funny! This show is NOT funny. You can think of it as the first sitcom you've ever seen. I can't see who else would. I echo all the previous sentiments about Arrested Development, etc. ... It is probably my own fault to be frustrated with television and not to look, dictating the stupid people who actually stay on the air.
