WARNING !!! ANY POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILERS IF IT IS POSSIBLE! <br /> <br /> Well, if you haven't found the plot yet, I'll give it to you. Two couples go out to a campsite, but a murdered killer appears and causes a lot of chaos. <br /> <br /> Now it's time for me to advise these couples. <br /> <br /> 1. Never, ever camp Camp Blood by the locals. 2. Do not have sex or protrude before the killer. 3. Do not pursue behind the killer if he or she runs away. 4. Do not shout profanity on the murderer. 5. Make sure your phone is working before you go camping. 6. Everyone must wear a sharp or dangerous weapon at all times. 7. Wear loose and comfortable clothing and bring a good pair of running shoes. No tight and binding clothes and no high heels or sandals. 8. Wear glasses or contact lenses if you need them so you do not pierce the wrong person. 9. Always keep your car keys on you. 10. Put out a campfire when you sleep. 11. Look at your step. If you're traveling on something, you're going to break a leg. 12. Recommend the back seat for uninvited. 13. If the killer cut you, at least make a fight. <br /> <br /> And guess what? At least one, but usually breaks all four of the main characters all these common sense rules. They are the stupidest characters ever to grab a movie. <br /> <br /> Now for a few brief comments. This slasher movie was on a very tight budget. So four of the 7 or 8 actors play more than one role. The acting, writing, direction, sound, lighting, camera work, plot, editing, etc. Are all down the line. But like the classic movie JACK Oh, it works so well, it's very entertaining and camping fun level. So rent it and enjoy a good time. My rating: 5 out of 10.
