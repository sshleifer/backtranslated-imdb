Well ... I like Patricia Kaas. She is a beautiful lady and a very talented and versatile singer. Her play in this film is more than capable and from my point of view the only salvation of this film. She firmly grasps the essence of the lonely singer with a very serious helath problem. But what I love about the movie is the shameless product placement for a well-known French chain hotel. The other thing is that the story seems to be twisting the road for too long without really deciding what the movie is about and what it wants to be. On a positive note, you can argue that the movie is not predictable, but you can also say it is boring because of the lack of cohesion. There are some nice shots in the film. You can't help thinking that all the parts just don't add up. It's really a pity because Cheese really shines in this movie.
