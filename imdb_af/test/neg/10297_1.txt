It must be the worst thriller I've ever seen. The direction, the acting and the adaptation of the story leave which could probably be a good plot in a meaningless waste of time. Within minutes to watch the movie, it was easy to figure out the whole plot and then there are many clear clues very early, without leaving mystery. I consulted it within the first few minutes and I was hoping I was wrong and many were up to me. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with two FBI agents driving to a remote town to investigate a murderous investigation. tramp who left three witnesses, a young girl, a drug addict and a police officer. They are fed separately under surveillance cameras and each tells their account of the day. Everyone has something to hide about themselves and unfolds the day when they tell their accounts. This part is probably the saving grace and if it developed, this movie could have made it better. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: The whole story ends in the FBI agents who are the real killers and the young girl is the only one who figured out. this and so they left unhappy. <br /> <br /> Why are they going through the whole charade to question three witnesses and to bond with the young girl if they had the idea of ​​killing them first? How did they get away with the pretense of being FBI agents (when you discovered that real FBI agents were killed and their badges found on them)? How did they know how to set up and use the surveillance cameras? <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman and Julia Ormond are so unconvincing from the start to the end. Perhaps the idea is to develop their characters for the revelation at the end. Come on, they look ridiculous, stupid and not sinister anyway. The character of the young girl is also wasted. There is no meaning to her actions and no meaning to whom she prefers to bind in her ordeal. She didn't look sad, but rather released what was not explained again. <br /> <br /> Awful movie about the whole.
