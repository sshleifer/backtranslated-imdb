Well, for each one of its own, but I thought Gibson's Hamlet was the most divine interpretation I've ever seen ... as subtly nuanced as a paper bag, and inspired by a telemarketing call. The only reason I watched the movie to the end was that I expressed hope that it would either be better or inadvertently funny. No luck. <br /> <br /> No lack of respect for the supporting role or for Zefferelli's actions, but nothing can be for the stunner of the main character. I saw Hamlet well as an African prince, as an animated lion, as a raw and warrior, as a romantic poet, and so on. Etc. Etc. But IMHO this portrayal was just a big lack of white with most poor hams.
