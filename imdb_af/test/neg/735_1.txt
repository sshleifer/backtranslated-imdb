Terrible, terrible, terrible. The actors are bad, the music is ridiculous and the filming is pathetic. I rented the DVD and had to force me to watch it to the end. <br /> <br /> My advice: read the book, it's much better and you don't have to solve all those stupid images and ridiculous dreams that Catherine has. <br /> <br /> I think I've never seen such a bad movie.
