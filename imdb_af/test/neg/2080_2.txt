Tempest is based on the classic Shakespeare work of the same name, but has little resemblance to its source material. <br /> <br /> It masquerades as cerebral as its namesake, but instead it is a mumbling, intricate and chopped exercise in tedium. The original explores the premise that people have an evil side, which would be destructive if not controlled. Here you just get an uninteresting middle life crisis (yawn) goof ball that has gone wrong in its personal and professional life. He is equipped with a supernatural force that he uses to control his environment. in other words: to get his own path. <br /> <br /> Every few minutes, after something else goes wrong in his pathetic life, he finds a secluded place and starts chatting "Show me the magic!" blowing his hands and expressing a "serious concentration". The way these scenes are shot seems to be trying to change mistakes in other types of errors. A spider in a cockroach, maybe, but by now you don't mind. <br /> <br /> The story bumped him into a Greek island somewhere from his life with his daughter, then he has an uncomfortable relationship with a girl he meets, one of the dull romances ever dedicated to film. The story just goes off and moves at a slower and slower pace. You never get a reason to keep or keep someone. <br /> <br /> I will give it a 2 because of the beautiful Greek location shots and the semi-optimistic conclusion (although it is not clear if the storm did not force this end or not). The spirit of Shakespeare's work has been much better captured in other films; One notable example is "Forbidden Planet," which gave credibility to the power coming out of control. <br /> <br /> As far as this Tempest is concerned, its only magic is to cure insomnia.
