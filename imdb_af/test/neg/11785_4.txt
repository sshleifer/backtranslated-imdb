I think Walter Pidgeon was bad in the movie. Just not credible in the role. Barbara Eden was beautiful and did her part well enough. No one else was unforgettable. <br /> <br /> I remember the TV show jumped off this movie when I was a little kid. I even thought I had a plastic "Seaview" that would submerge and was nice to play with the bath. Long ago. <br /> <br /> As for some of the other criticisms I've read for this movie: It's definitely unfair to judge special effects or science knowledge of 4 decades ago according to today's standards. The effects were OK for 1961. Not good, but OK. Regarding science, it was even ridiculous for 1961. There is no excuse. Also, the sub was terribly spacious. I understand that the fleet did not refuse any help for this movie, so maybe the filmmakers had no idea. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie got bored. (And I'm a sci-fi fan.) Can't recommend this one. Degree: D-
