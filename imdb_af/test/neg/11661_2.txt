The Hindi remake of Mrs. Doubtfire, lead roles and directed by Kamal Hassan, is a somewhat scanty version, and not as good as expected. <br /> <br /> After all these years, Kamal Hassan has been struggling with Hindi dialogues and can't handle it. even one scene effortlessly. The guy is outdated and has to give it rest. Hassan brings nothing new to the role or character as it says, Dustin Hoffman does Tootsie, or Marathi actor Macchindranath Kambli does to Mavshi's (aunt) character in "Moruchi Mavshi" (Moru's Tannie, comedy play). /> <br /> What did the kid play with fireworks when it wasn't Diwali? Most of Chachi's romantic 'cross-links' - Vs Amrish, Paresh and then Johny Walker - seem superfluous to the main story. Tabu's swimming pool was unnecessary. The family is North Indian, but must be reminded of Karva Chauth Night by a 'Maharashtrian' Chachi. Yes, right. <br /> <br /> The fine acting skills of none, but four actors, Tabu, Om Puri, the late Amrish Puri and Paresh Rawal, have been wasted in this movie. <br /> <br /> Look at the original Mrs. Doubtfire - clean, sharp and crackling with fun, totally different from Chachi 420.
