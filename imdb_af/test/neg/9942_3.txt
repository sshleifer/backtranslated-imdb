It is one of many US efforts to remember an old, classic British TV show. This is more known as this one. From what I see, none of you have said or admit that there was a TV's 50s 60s called the Secret Agent Man. The original secret agent man has the big Patrick McGoohan (the prisoner, braveheart, iceberg zebra, The Phantom, etc.) A man typed to be the first James Bond, but he turned it off because McGoohan a lot he was a good man and he considered James Bond's bed-hoods and violent ways as against his values. <br /> <br /> This performance is done in black and white, and it is a pity for those who have not seen it, you miss a lot. The character Mr. McGoohan played in the "Secret Agent Man", called Drake and after finishing the show, he had the popular, though sometimes bizarre and controversial TV series "The Prisoner". The character he played in "The Prisoner" is that of an agent whose identity is not revealed, kidnapped and transported to an island where he does not know where he is or who it is who is responsible for kidnap him. What he does know is that his prisoners want to get to know the reasons behind his resignation of the British Secret Service and on this island the people have no names, but are referred by numbers and Patrick's character becomes a number assigned " 6 "It was argued that his prisoner character was actually the same character he played in Secret Agent Man, but McGoohan himself disputed it. <br /> <br /> Ofours there is the unmistakable well-known theme song that the original secret agent man has grown. It's written by Johnny Rivers a well-known 50's and 60's pop musician and from what I've read some of you, actually think the song comes from this version of the show. You're very wrong about that. It was Johnny's and it comes from the original TV series, so let me help you straighten out the facts. For those of you who complained about the name of the show is stupid, good in England, it is actually called 'Danger Man' and in the US it's 'Secret Agent Man' titled. For such a so-called stupid name, the show did well when it was first broadcast. <br /> <br /> Allowed this current show has little to do with the original, not such a main character called Drake in this one, and I think they did their best to make this show their version of "Secret Agent Man". But it uses the redesigned version of the original theme song to tell you that this show was indeed intended to be a redone, although it is inferior version of the original series.
