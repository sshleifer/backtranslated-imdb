The director looks like a good, solid man. His parents are struggling with the same issues we all deal with. They deviated from each other. They loved each other. They misunderstood each other. And the poor audience has to sit for 90 minutes of what may be the trials and tribulations of one of the most boring families ever to come from Long Island. <br /> <br /> There are few interesting choices in this documentary- The music is banal, the filming is uninspired and the story is the same story that played on every Birch street in every American town. I don't want to sound too loud - rarely did a sweeter, more well-conscious documentary. The director is the kind of man you want to be friends with. You just wish he had struggled so much to present the material, as his parents kept their marriage alive.
