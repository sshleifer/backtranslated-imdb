If you read the book before you see the movie, you might be disappointed as I was. The book was wonderful and I was sure after watching the movie show that the movie would be good too, but I felt like I was watching a movie where the director and cast didn't even read what these characters were. The movie is short and they never really make us realize that these people really fell in love and just felt like lonely. Even if the movie wasn't in the same direction as the book, they could make the romance between these two characters feel more intense. I think both Diane Lane and Richard Gere were perfect for these two characters and they have good chemistry, but they just haven't developed a long enough storyline to see how they want each other. The book was true love story and I think this movie might have been much better.
