Wonderful production and a good comic performance by George Clooney can't save a lot of loose, sometimes turbulent, quasi-comedy from Joel and Ethan Coen. Depression-era road stories are back to yesterday with three escaped chain gang prisoners seeking a hidden fortune, and by accident land music stars are in the process! The movie meanders together, but never builds any momentum. It gets a big boost from Clooney's charismatic, Gableesque cup, as well as the artistic and T-Bone Burnett's live music. Otherwise, the script (by the Coens) is seriously lacking in humor and interest. Supporting comos by John Goodman and Holly Hunter fails to add any lift, and the second half of the movie unconditionally slips into self-sufficiency. ** of ****
