Not me. When it comes to that, I can kick a dog's ass, so this movie doesn't work for me. If it were me against the Alien or Jason .. Or ... Hell, I don't know. ANY OTHER HORROR MOVIE ANTAGONIST, then there would be no match and I gave my ass to prevent divine intervention. A horror movie works because it is people in a situation with a creature, person, entity, whatever, more powerful or inventive or intelligent than they are, and people think "good if it happened to me" "and they get scared - and that's why it's a horrible idea for a story. I can't imagine being deemed by a dog, so I'm not scared.
