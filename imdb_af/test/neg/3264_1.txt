Why was this movie ever made? They decorated the original Caddyshack with this shit. I could only see half of it and I didn't even laugh. At least I didn't pay to see it, because it was at t but I won't be returning to that hour of my life that I have spent seeing this terrible debris. There wasn't one original star of the first, except for Chevy Chase and he probably regretted doing this movie. Jackie Mason was outrageous, a funny buffalo like Rodney Dangerfield was in the first, but Jackie Mason wasn't funny at all. Jack Mason is not a Rodney Dangerfield. If you want to laugh, look at the first Caddyshack. If you like horrible movies, it's your movie. This movie stinks like a barn in July.
