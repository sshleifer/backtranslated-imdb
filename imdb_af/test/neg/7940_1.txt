Attack on Precinct 13 is the absolute stupid movie I've seen since Charlie's Angels 2. The shame lies in the fact that they had a good role and good condition to work with. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ......................................... .................... I know they said this movie is a remake descendant of Rio Bravo, but actually watched the authors of this movie Rio Bravo? In addition to the fact that Rio Bravo is a Western classic, the film's premise was that the sheriff (John Wayne) was freed by his brother and his prisoner who was accused of being released from murder. Nobody wants to free someone in area 13 assault. They all want to die. So, my first question should be, WHY DO NOT NEED THE WHOLE PLACE IN THE BEGINNING? Why not "assault" at all? I know that the contracted plot twist was supposed to be clever and shocking, but it didn't make sense and / or properly suggested. If the veteran man was from the beginning, why is the need for this whole movie? If the veteran man suddenly cut a deal at the back door during the siege, how did he get the chance? As soon as he appeared at the door, he would be shot and they would have had their access point. It's just FUBAR. <br /> <br /> What part of a city can an all-out war take place in a police station (complete with helicopters and massive explosions), but no one knows? But once there is a fire, they must "leave before the fire brigade appears" ?????? How did they plan to cover the chaos that happened outside? Police cause bullets in the walls, bullet walls, footprints, equipment usage and the fact that there will be no bodies of "Bishop's men"? How about police snipers? How can they so often miss so much? I like the fact that when the two prisoners try to run, the snipers are filled with two small hills of snow. As if it's not possible to shoot a high rifle through a heap of snow. <br /> <br /> The setup was interesting, though ridiculous, but the movie just went off a cliff when they decided to kill that particular character with a bullet to the head for absolutely NO REASON . I know the makers of the movie are shocking, but all they got was disgusting for the cruelty and anger of the audience. Don't you think that part of the reason why this thing comes to mind at the box office is that the word of mouth tells everyone that friends and family stay away from this one? That particular scene needs to be a large part of the mouth of the mouth (this and the fact that every sudden turn is thinner than dirt). The conclusion remains stupid because the villain pauses to deliver an Austin forces diatribe, instead of killing the helpless people he eventually caught. I know that several people called the end tones that occur in the forest of Detroit city (> snicker <), but why did Ethan's character first fall into the forest? He doesn't even see if the SUV gets away with the secretary and his friend? They just cut him, slowly in the bush, pistol in hand. GACK. I can go on but won't. All I can say is that you want to avoid this stupidity at all costs.
