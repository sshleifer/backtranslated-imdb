I accidentally watched this movie on television and it was so incredibly awful that I couldn't turn it off. Each piece of white and intelligence was removed from the Oscar Wilde story by the unbeatable screenwriter. It doesn't matter, because the terrific play, cleaved camera work and grim music would make everything seem like a decent script. The worst performance comes from Patrick Stewart, who comes as the most hammy, talented, small-shock Shakespeare ninjas. "Get out of here!" He shouted at one stage as he waved his arms like a pantomime villain. A real horrible movie and why wonder Stewart, who can act when he does, has polluted his reputation by making such worthless pieces like this and the XMen.
