Want to be surprised if I told you this movie is about a conspiracy? No? How about I told you the writer was a shadow puppet. What? You don't believe me? ... OK. Yes, I fixed it. It's too bad, this movie could have used a sense of humor. I understand Charlie Sheen did it at the time - another movie looked more like money - like Donald Sutherland and Linda Hamilton ... why? Don't start me at Stephen Lang. He was as much fun as the Party Crasher in 'The Hard Way' and now this litter. <br /> <br /> No matter what. Everyone involved must be ashamed. If you try to make a bad movie and be successful - it is distorted - but I seriously doubt what they are aiming for. Flat out, the story stinks and we're actually supposed to take this hunt seriously. Make yourself wondering if this movie had a gleam of hope. Seriously, I doubt it and in an industry so now with the purse strings how it has illuminated green in the first place is beyond me. Perhaps even more frightening is how this dog walk made it into the theaters! <br /> <br /> Oh yeah ... Sam Waterson, how big are you in law and order. Why are you here? Forcing yourself into the role of the United States president I can add is shot by a remote control biplane controlled by the gonzo assassin. Then it is again a masterpiece of work by George P. Cosmatos, whose "directing" credits include Rambo: First Blood Part II among other jewels. Hmm ... case in point?
