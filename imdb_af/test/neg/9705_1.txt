Sorry to say but was disappointed in the movie. It was very rushing, because I think you can understand a movie length version of Pride & Prejudice, and I felt that many of the big screens were first glimpsed to come through the story. As the movie is so rushed, unfortunately you don't really get to know and feel for each of the characters. <br /> <br /> Not only that, this movie is boring. I say this with a capital B. 1/3 of the way through, I started throwing and couldn't wait for the movie to be over. As I read the book and watched the BBC version, I knew how many scenes had to go before I could leave the theater. Mr Darcy, whoever he is in this movie, can certainly not act. He also looks too young at Mr. Play Darcy. Every word that comes out of his mouth is hurried as he needs to get through the writing or something. Where's the build up? Initially he looks confused with everything. He is not bizarre! It all seems. <br /> <br /> Don't try to compare to the Colin Firth version, but if you like the version, you'll probably be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The costumes are absolutely shocking. Where are the corsets? I know Elizabeth is poor, but I still think she knows how to dress like a lips fashion, and is not raised in a lover. Her dresses indicate that they can be the poorest farmer in England. <br /> <br /> I didn't agree with some scenes in the movie in the fact that I didn't think it would be properly considered. In that society for men to do such things, frankly, Mr Bingley, whose wealth needs to know better. There are a few things that are said to sound too old for the period in which this movie was introduced, and not at all like Jane Austen. Bingley's character is shockingly done, for me he does like a simple, not a character to keep and respect. What about that laugh of his !!! I hardly have Wickham's presence and Mr. And Mrs Hurst and a few other characters have not been present at all. Keira did well, but it's just not the same.
