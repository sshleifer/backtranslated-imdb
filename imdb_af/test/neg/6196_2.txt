This movie has a look and feel of many "fresh" directors (proximity and focus on the emotions experienced by the actors). The tip of the film is presented from many angles and is well spoken by the relatively inexperienced role. The point is, "Believe in Jesus Christ and the Mormon Church." Oh, and if you read anything that goes against the teachings of the prophet, it's just Hated. (Fuel for hate)
