It's a kids, softer Cyborg movie with a love story. Awww. It's not as bad as it sounds. The action, when it is there, is decent and Jack Palance, Elias Koteas and Angelina Jolie are always trustworthy. It's the fact that it's a sequel to the terrible Jean Claude Van Damme movie, or is it the capper for the Masters of the Universe Trilogy? I'm still confused about it. Anyway, there really was no need for this movie. What was needed? Angelina Jolie. She can play an assassin who can explode mid-coitus, but what is a way to go and although it's her first movie, she still has the presence that made her an award winner.
