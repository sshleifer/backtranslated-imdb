No, no no no no no no no! It's not a movie, it's an excuse to let people dance. It's just not good. Even the dance is slow and not half as entertaining as the mediocre "Dirty Dancing", let alone a good dance movie. Is this a love story? Is it a musical? Is this a drama? Is this a comedy? It's not that this movie is a bit of everything, it's that this movie fails at everything it tries. The film seems to be even more meaningless as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> The action is terrible on all sides. The script definitely tries to tell us something about the relationship, but fails. <br /> <br /> WATCH FOR THE MOMENT - When Patrick Stewart enters the scene and you think the movie can get better if he brightens the dull atmosphere. For a second.
