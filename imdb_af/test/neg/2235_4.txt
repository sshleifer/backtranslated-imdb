For one thing he made this movie. It has the feel of later movies with international works being baptized. The opening credits tell us we were filmed in Vienna. <br /> <br /> Bey enjoyed the Universal Adventure movies of the 1940s. He was also fantastic in a movie I saw ten years ago, but has never heard of "The Amazing Mr. X." Maybe it was Dr X. I remember it as an exciting and terrifying movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this one is beautiful wood. The plot is not easy to follow. When I dropped it, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> Francis Lederer looks good as a concert pianist. He was a very good leader ten or 15 years earlier. He never really caught up as a big star, though he should have. <br /> <br /> It's not terrible, but it's pretty heavy.
