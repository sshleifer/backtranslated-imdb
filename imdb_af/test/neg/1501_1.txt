Oh my god, this movie is incredible, it's the worst movie ever and I know what I'm talking about! I'm a scary movie fan! <br /> <br /> The story is quite stupid, a group of adults decide to make a party and a stupid man with a terrible mask comes and kills everyone ... the windows are a kind of parody, the worst, they just talk about sex with such a bad accent. The end is (oh !!!!!!) discovered by yourself! you will be really surprised ... (not possible! yes it is!) and the movie is just 58 minutes. (not possible) yes it is! Worse than House IV and Howling V. <br /> <br /> To put it in a nutshell, forget it forever !!!
