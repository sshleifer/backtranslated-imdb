The United States built the atomic bomb to show their superior military power and end the Second World War. The movie Fat Man and Little Boy is a portrayal of American physicists' efforts to develop the technology needed to create the bomb and the tension that exists between scientists and the army over the potential uses of the bomb and even the acceptability of the bomb. his creation. The scientists thought the bomb should be created as a deterrent, a mechanism that would strike the war by wasting as little life as possible. Fists, they saw themselves as in a race with German scientists, who themselves are trying to build nuclear weapons. When the Germans were defeated, many scientists hoped to stop work on the bombing project, knowing that the Japanese did not have the necessary technology to build a nuclear weapon and therefore not a threat to a major loss of life do not pose. Those who benefited from the ongoing implementation of the Manhattan project hoped that the bomb would be used as a demonstration, which the Japanese head of state would invite to see its deployment on a small, deserted island. This massive display of violence they felt would be enough to win the war. No death would be needed. The American army, led by General Leslie Groves, hoped to use the bomb as a real weapon to deploy against the enemy, first against the Germans and then against the Japanese. Due to the persistence of Japanese soldiers on the small Japanese islands, the US decided to drop the bomb on populated cities to end the war, first Hiroshima and then Nagasaki. The exhibition of that huge amount of violence has also given the rest of the world notice that the US was the dominant military force, a message that was particularly aimed at Russia, whose growing military power and economic weight in Eurasia threatened our leading global position has. Fat Man and Little Boy were a movie that had good intentions in mind, but stunned them by the choice of actors, script and cinematography. One of the main points of the movie was the struggle between the military view of science for the murder and the scientific view of science for knowledge. The keystone of this conflict is the continuing disagreement between General Groves and dr. Oppenheimer. Mr. Newman does her job in the general, clumsy, massively angry and pushes his dependence on the success of the project. Dwight Schultz, on the other hand, never resists the demands of the general, and always looks weak, deflated and phlegmatic in his audience. John Cusack offers an amazingly unsympathetic character in as flat a role as I've ever seen. It looks like he's just reading his lines. Laura Dern seems to suffer from the same ailment. None of the characters are helped by the writing, which is almost childishly ridiculous in the way it unknowingly declares scientific concepts. It offers the most unrealistic stock ratio between Mr. Cusack and Mrs. Than possible, don't even give us the cheapest. excitement to watch the army drop nuclear bombs on Japan and rely on strength - a technique that is always angry, even when a character is explained to true inner thoughts or to the story of something that may not appear on the film medium but is used here to read some absolute choices from Cusack's diary. The cinematographer gives us several shots of the ominous shadow of the two bombs, which might be striking if they didn't seem to have been cardboard cuttings instead of bombs, the false atomic fire really looks fake and why use it when stock is on hand is so stunning and realistic - and the translucent brown tone doesn't look thematically appropriate. In addition, it's not a bad movie.
