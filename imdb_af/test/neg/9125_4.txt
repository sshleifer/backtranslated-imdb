As with many persecutors, this one just doesn't have the quality or impact of the original. The first one stands there with the rest of the big ones. This one just doesn't cut it. The first movie felt a wonderful "good time" about what was completely lacking in this movie. We enchanted all these characters (little Richard Dreyfuss) in an era of innocence. Now, a few years later, they have changed so much that they are largely different people. While this is happening in real life, we don't expect it to happen to our favorite movie characters! The movie didn't have the humor that the original had, and we expected to laugh. What little humor is there is dark. The first movie has also appeared which is probably the best soundtrack ever, while this one is good, but not even close to the original. This film is so completely different from the original that it is not even a successor. I gave it a 4.
