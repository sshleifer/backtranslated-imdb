This movie was terrible. You couldn't get ahead fast to get to the end of this movie. It came down to the last 20 minutes of the movie and I literally hit the eject button right in the middle of the scene. It was one of the worst movies I've ever experienced. Worse than all Dean Cain movies combined. To start, the play was terrible. I realize the main actors were the survivors, but one would think any TV experience would give them a little more talent. The movie's other biggest problem was the campus visual effects and the poor film quality. In the film defense, the theme of the show was well-intentioned and the story was right.
