this cartoon is not right, i totally disagree with many things it has portrayed, but it ended me positively, but for me and me we will not look at it in our household, mainly because we are against stereotypes every day argue and this cartoon just confirms what most white people feel like black people act like <br /> <br /> commenting one of the little black girls made on the cartoon was that her boyfriend was so aware (he was white) who really offended me, which is not something that we as black people are gently aware of is a state of being that black people achieve when they realize their true ability
