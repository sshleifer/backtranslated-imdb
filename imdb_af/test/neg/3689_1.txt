There are good movies, and there are bad movies, and then there is Moscow Zero, a movie that is so bad that it is a month in a month with an insurance salesman, an attractive entertainment alternative. <br /> <br /> With an incomprehensible plot over the gates of hell opened in a labyrinth of tunnels under Moscow, the movie is a mess of repetitive and careless shots of a tiny little girl walk, red lights and strange wall shadows, which do not bear any fear or tension, but rather plead for the reaction of "here they go again with the girl (or lights)" of the viewer. <br /> <br /> Targeted by María Lidón, who for reasons I could only conceal as shame, was Bill Luna, movie stars Vince Gallo as Owen, an American priest traveling to Moscow in search of Sergei (Rade Serbedzija) , a friend and colleague who went missing in the tunnels. He refers to the help of a series of locals who, with the exception of Oksana Akinshina, are all portrayed by Spanish actors who try to relieve Russian accents with limited success. <br /> <br /> Along the way, they cross roads with members of some kind of underground leather-covered religious mafia led by a Vally Valmer, whose career seems to be in such a free fall that he seen in this retreat, and handcart Sage Stallone (Sly's son), apparently thrown just as well, the Stallone name can be included in the movie's exhibition. <br /> <br /> Aside from watching the troops, they are being tried through the tunnels through the tunnels using a comic map, and repetitive shots are followed. or escaped by a young girl who does not have a light face, there is not much else going on. Dialogue varies regularly between English and Russian, with actors taking regular turns in each language, and the whole conversation is half expressed in one and half in the other. The only apparent reason they feel this way adds a frustrating dimension to the viewer. and trying to figure out the cut, combined story. <br /> <br /> However, the only thing Moscow gets right right is the title that could only give a more accurate description of this movie if the word Moscow was omitted.
