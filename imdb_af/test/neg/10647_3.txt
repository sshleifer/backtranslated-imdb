By the time the Hellraiser franchise reached its film, its appearance was a bit thin. Dr. Paul Merchant (Bruce Ramsey) is a scientist in the future, while the prisoner directs his prisoner on how his ancestors (all played by Ramsey) first built the evil Lament Configuration puzzle that puts the evil on the world. and how his bloodline later had the handling of the said box. The film is a plethora of lack of continuity with other films and lack of coherence in this one. Yes, it may be due to a combination of rewriting, massive cuts in the original version of the movie, or whatever. But I reviewed the movie as it was, and not what it was or could have been. And as it is, it's a mess. Certainly, the franchise continues indefinitely directly after DVD successors, but this one was quite a nail because it's the chance to get a new one ever again. <br /> <br /> My Degree: D-
