Words fail me for this terrible two-hour waste of life. The story is about complete disbelief. <br /> <br /> The acting is loaded and so many of them are terrifying. Vinnie Jones - so wonderful in Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, is unbearably awful and incredible like Mike Sullivan, journalist. <br /> <br /> I can honestly never remember seeing a worse movie. It's just worth looking for the terrible continuity of decay. After Jones was handed a big knock, he came without a bunch on him. His girlfriend drank a drink over him and he chased her out of the crib. It is quite scary, all the worse by the talented actors appearing in it.
