There is something about this show that makes me look and hope for its future. In the writing, the jokes are little and far between, and the story lines are a drill, so I find it to be the physical comedy and the visual. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the camera movement, set dressing, and wardrobe. It is amusingly highly opposed to the boredom that prevails. And I'm pretty sure every time I laughed it was because of John or Molly's physical comedy. The two of them make an unfortunate cute couple that makes me laugh and wants to type at the same time. <br /> <br /> So here I am ready to go again tonight to Kath & Kim to see which way this production will decrease (or, as the case may be, look positive).
