I loved the Muppets. The Muppet Movie, The Great Muppet Caper and The Muppets Take Manhattan were great family movies, cleverly written and fun to watch. I never thought I'd see the day when they were jumping on the Hollywood sleaze train wagon, but here it is: Scooter as a stuffed rave dancer, Pepe makes furious and suggestive comments every five minutes. It's not your dad's Muppets. It's not Jim Henson's Muppets either. <br /> <br /> This "It's a Wonderful Life" movie has its moments but not enough to store it. I cried while I watched it with my children. I still have hope for their next movie, but this one was definitely a disappointment.
