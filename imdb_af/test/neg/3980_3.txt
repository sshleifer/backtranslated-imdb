Like most people, I saw this movie at Mystery Science Theater 3000. "Although it did get some well-deserved barbs, it is one of the better movies that appear on that show. <br /> <br /> The point of departure is better than even your average Hollywood show these days; interesting moral dilemmas, although the score is sometimes intrusive, it also offers some wonderful moments when Richard walks along the river, and if you watch the movie, you can see where many plot developments are likely to look good on paper. modern society is an interesting problem to think, and the end would probably be a good 70s quiet mindfuck if the previous issues weren't so good. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie is cheap, The "clone farm" is, of course, a university campus, and a beer can serve as a big plot point. Lena and Richard have zero chemistry - we are supposed to be a close encounter thoughts, but there doesn't seem to be a knit be between them. The "cranky old couple" schtick also gets really old, actually fast. There are also errors that can result from bad direct choices, such as the decision to keep a climate call out of reach of any audio equipment at all. <br /> <br /> In all, a noble effort, yet best seen on MST3K.
