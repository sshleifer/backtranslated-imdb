We get to see who the good guys are. The union. And who are the bad guys, a rich man who steals elections and his pampered son. The filmmaker forces us to see good from evil. All the characters hate the bad guys so it can help us hate the bad guys when we watch the movie. It's the worst kind of film making - manipulative and childish. The plot is centered on a policeman who is between the good and the bad, and he stuck in this ugly movie. It is boring and useless. The story of star Keach is really bad. And a good actor, Don Stroud, has overhauled, the man nobody likes to play, and who we don't intend to like. It takes a long time for this drill to fetch and for the title to claim itself; then when it decreases, it falls for a moment later. Boring. One of the worst movies ever made.
