I was interested in this movie because someone made a beautiful video for Bj√∂rks "Bachelorette" with clips of it. So I watched the movie. And this is indeed stuningly beautiful. A masterpiece of animation. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story doesn't stop. It starts well with interesting plotlines about people who own the Roos Bride, but suddenly the lifts fill with water and lose their walls, people drift away and eventually, for no reason whatsoever, Utena is transformed into a car. a high speed chase. <br /> <br /> I love Anime for his ability to make alternative universes, but this universe is just stupid. If you watch this movie, turn on the sound, that's better.
