Once, Quentin Tarantino was a relatively successful filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he doesn't just make horrible movies, but puts his names to such people. <br /> <br /> A suspiciously cool retro movie on biker movies of the 60s and 70s, these plumbers' new depths. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I enjoy it as a fire extinguisher than the next man in a movie, but I even have a feeling of sleepiness looking at this. To use a word, I never thought I would be his msysoginist (you see, I can't even play it.) The plot (in the bleak sense of the term) is as incomprehensible as Vinnie Jones's accent, The fact that his horrible acting is not our specifics as a will as a will condemned as one might think. <br /> <br /> It's just awful. Shocking. It almost made me cry. In horror.
