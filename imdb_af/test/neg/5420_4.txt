TANDEM is a strange cut in the Japanese pink genre, as it has the required sex screens and misogynistic tones that are both needed for these types of movies, but also an unheard of drama / dark comedy story that was better suited to 'd' another type of film. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with two lonely guys at a restaurant - every daydream about a previous sexual encounter. One is an underground underground grab, the other a very typical (for this type of film) semi-rape scenario. The two perverts meet and start talking after one lends the other a cigarette. They hang out for an evening and talk a little about their respective sex lives. The film is cut with flashback screens of both men's interactions with the women who are central to their lives. The two men fell out and the movie ended on a weird but predictable note ... <br /> <br /> I really don't know what to do about TANDEM. This sorta comes down as a soft-core, 'strange couple' kind of anti-buddy film, but doesn't really investigate the subject properly. There isn't much of the typical extreme insomnia that is so common in these types of movies, so I can't really figure out what the point was. I also can't say whether the movie is supposed to be funny, depressed or both. I think TANDEM might have potential as a more serious drama movie with a dark comedy edge - but as a soft-core sex movie trying to be smart for its own good, it just doesn't work. I can't say I hated this one - but can't say there's any comment about it either. 10/04
