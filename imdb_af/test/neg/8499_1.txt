I wouldn't have given this movie a low score (2) if its average wasn't ridiculously high, but someone had to bring it to something more reasonable. I put most of this movie on the scene and watched the scene in the theater and shoplifting. No dialogue, just coding and shoplifting. Eventually the two chains kissed. Something happened. But then back to coding and shoplifting. I left the show. I recommend this movie only to those who are impressed with pretentious film-making. I don't like the directors' previous film (a self-righteous defense of male-boy love), but the film had at least a story, interesting characters, dialogue. The Graffiti artist first had the scene after the tagging and shoplifting was written. I want more of a movie than that.
