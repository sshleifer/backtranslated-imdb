Avoid this movie. Simple because it's so bad that it's absolutely hilaries. It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen, but it was so bad my friends and I could laugh at this movie every moment. Sometimes we actually debated whether it was the right way, but we are pretty sure it is not. Characters appear from nowhere as if they were already established. The landscape is constantly changing the middle scene to this warehouse and the Vampire killer ends with about 6 clashes with enemies before finally arriving at the main vampire. You will also be able to enjoy the one and only face of the Vampire killer, as he never changes his expression, despite his obvious efforts. So, if you want to see a movie that makes you laugh over time, then I propose this one as long as you enter into an open mind. Don't expect a good movie, expect the worst ... and it'll be even worse. I want to buy this movie seriously and place it on top of my comedy films selection. Right next to Anchorman.
