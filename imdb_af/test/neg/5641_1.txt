The only mystery in this movie was how it was ever made. The British film industry has to make films that people really want to watch and not look to get taxpayers' money (a BBC) to keep Luvvies in their lifestyle they are accustomed to, without doing anything about it. <br /> <The movie was every thing wrong with British movies, it was based on stereotypes, it had to be over London where people were either Posh or corrupt, Gangsters, Luvvies or gawd blimey all kinds, the storyline was just pathetically weak, to the extent that the policeman pulled out his cellphone and the ringtone was the Sweeney theme, I just expected it. The whole movie was a happy shopper sweeney / Less rip off. <br /> <br /> The priceless manuscript I noticed left behind and lost on a few occasions and something I would not wear with my limited street style in my chest pocketed every spot, to the beach and fights etc. . Say Vinnie Jones is equal, which is about the only thing in the movie, bad blocks. <br /> <br /> When Derek Jacobi came to the end in the water because he was Dickens, oh my god, what a bit of shit, and I'm positive here
