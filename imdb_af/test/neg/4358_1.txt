I really hope the creators of these "movies" read these reviews so they know people just don't want their movies. They're just trash and an embarrassment to the killer-clown genre of horror. whether it was better than the first, does not matter, because they are both just terrible. I'm surprised they didn't learn their lesson from the first movie. Stop now !! Warning to horror movie watchers, Don't see, rent or watch the boxes of "Urban" HORROR FILMS, and above all, don't buy them !!
