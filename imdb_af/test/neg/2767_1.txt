This movie really sucks. <br /> <br /> Try to stay awake for 5 minutes while watching this baloney over a pretty girl (Joan Woodbury) who gets involved in the "underworld" because she needs money (and because she also likes to take a work of friends after they have presented it to her). Alan Ladd would be the star of this thing, but he is nowhere to be found for the first half-hour freaking and when he arrives, he stands like a cloaked mannequin. A real dud with enough talky scenes and unlikeable (as well as silly) characters to make you wish someone will shoot someone, like really fast. <br /> <br /> Bring a pillow.
