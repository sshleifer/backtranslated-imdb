I just watched that movie and was very disappointed. I didn't expect much to start, as the assumption of the movie didn't represent greatness anyway. Unfortunately, it can't just make such a silly entertainment. The biggest problem is probably the acting one. While I saw far worse actors in far-flung movies, the story would need some to act as violent maniacs, some others who caught people in a very stressful trouble, and failed to deliver. Although I watched the German edition, I looked at the original sound, so it's definitely not just bad voice surplus or something like that. In addition, it appears that the German DVD edition is being cut, the murders are all left out, which means that, except for some semi-gory scenes closer to the end, the German release is not a movie for "gore dogs" , either. Of course it can't comment on other issues. The plot has a few stupid moments that are thrown here and there and the beginning is just hilarious (ever heard of a demon visiting a psychiatrist?). Too bad, the movie itself is too serious, if it was filmed as a horror comedy and changed a little and accordingly it could work better. The end is just a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> If you really have nothing better to do and just can't do the boredom anymore, you can (and it's really a bad "power"). . If something else is available to watch or do: Choose that alternative.
