First, what is really good about this movie: <br /> <br /> - Ryan Reynolds, great play! There are very few actors I really like and he is now one of them. He has a wonderful ability to personalize characters. <br /> <br /> - The soundtrack! Very good music played at the right time. <br /> <br /> - The idea of ​​a nine lost in its own world is unable to leave. <br /> <br /> However, I only give it 3 out of 10 for some mistakes: <br /> <br /> - Horrible second part. It seems as if the director was very eager to make something new, but despite the efforts it was very boring. <br /> <br /> - Very annoying character Melissa. I couldn't stand the screens at her - it was constantly annoying. She represents everything that is wrong with American women. <br /> <br /> Terrible explanation of numbers. The director was so busy with character development that he completely missed the point of a good story. Excuse me koalas? brr ... horrible! <br /> <br /> This movie had great potential. The filming is well done, the music is really good, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> Just look if you're a fan of Ryan Reynolds, or have a lot of time to save.
