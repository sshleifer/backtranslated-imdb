... and in this series I was reduced to an annoying jock with a gay hairstyle. Remember my friend Marco, who had all the good lines in the books? Well, in this series, she has one-liners Mr. Freeze comes to shame. Remember our uber-evil nemesis Visser Three? He is a naked man with unpleasant catches. Remember Rachel, "Xena, the Warrior Princess", and Cassie, my sensitive and caring love interest? They were changed by the 10 (!) Writers in the wise bimbos. They decided that the original characters were not cool enough for TV. Remember the awesome alien Ax, who was cool, intelligent, and really, nice of cinnamon rolls? In this series he is the Token Alien with an extremely annoying voice. Remember the witty scold that our team had in the books? In this series our dialogue is so furious and stupid. Obviously, the authors refer to the lowest common denominator. <br /> <br /> Forget everything you thought you knew about the Animorphs! It was Cassie who became allergic to morphing, not Rachel, thought talk * was supposed to echo, and Visser Three and Ax, rarely, as ever, appeared as Andalites (no, it has nothing to do with budget not!). <br /> <br /> I'm not crazy. And I'm not lying. The gnomes are around us. And if you are unhappy, one of them can adapt one of your favorite books, or a series or graphic novels, to a very horrible TV show. You're warned. <br /> <br /> "Finally ... worthy of watching television." ~ (the very bare) Fisherman Three <br /> <br /> (r # 91)
