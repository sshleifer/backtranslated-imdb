Think of this movie as fan service, a wet dream for the treasure genre fan. We start with a gory prologue that is almost unrelated to the rest of the film. Flash after nine months and the right meat from the plot begins. The virgin Mandy Lane is wanted by every jock and nerd in her school and is invited to a weekend at a ranch by spending three guys thinking they can be happy, and two bimbos obsessed with their weight and boob size. So ... you have a lot of young students in a house in the middle of nowhere on a dark night, wanting nothing but having sex, drinking drugs and drinking. The only other company is baseball that may or may not suffer from Gulf War Syndrome. Hmm ... potential future might suspect? <br /> <br /> As you are likely to see, all the housekeepers are slaughtered in a variety of bloody ways, and for a change the black man is NOT the first to die. There are a few conventions that still hold, such as the slenderly dressed babe chased by a car in a field. Or the lights go out mysteriously in the evening when our 'heroes' indifferently separate to tackle the problem. Even up to the so-called shocking turn at the end, the movie is like an old 80-year-old horror updated for the noughties, and at this point it succeeds. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it also has many of the problems of the films of that era, namely the paper-thin characters and the predictability of the entire enterprise. People are cut, shot, bludgeoned, etc., but because of their innate hatred towards the audience and stupidity to get themselves into these situations, it is difficult to care about the bodies. Someone is murdered, one of their friends goes out to look for them alone, VERY they are brown bread. Rinse, then repeat. Perhaps one day we will get a script with assuming, intelligent, fun characters who make rational decisions, but still become a genius killer. Until then, we have to tolerate teens with the I.Q of the dam-life collected by a striped hoodie. Oh well .. 4/10
