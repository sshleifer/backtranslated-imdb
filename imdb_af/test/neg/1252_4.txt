This film tried to make Stu Ungar's life interesting by being creative. What they have forgotten is that his life was entertaining enough without doing things. <br /> <br /> A short list of inaccuracies: <br /> <br /> 1) Stuey was not sent straight to Las Vegas for a Gin tournament to pay off old debts, he first Spent a great deal of time in Florida, and first went to Las Vegas when he ran out of Gin games on the east coast. <br /> <br /> 2) Stuey never associated with a casino executive (or gin) (like the one that Pat Morita played in the movie.) <br /> <br /> 3 ) There was no magical reversal in the build-up of the 1997 WSOP. In fact, Stuey barely made it into the tournament as it was. He smoked cocaine this week before the evening. <br /> <br /> Tell the story right, or don't tell it at all. 4 out of 10 stars for Michael Imperolli's credible performance (the only redeeming quality of this movie)
