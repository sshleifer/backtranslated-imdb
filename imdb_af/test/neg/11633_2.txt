What a terrible successor. The reason why I give this movie two stars instead of zero, because it is a movie of violence and gore and cattle, but it is badly planned. And this divine successor has not been done by anyone other than BUM-BUM-BUM-BUM !!!!!!!!! Mick Garris! The leg head that brought you the remake of The Shining, which made Kubrick almost roll in his grave when he discovered it, was actually made. Garris is also the man who brought you the unlucky follow-up of THE FLY, THE FLY, which was a wonderful movie, but Garris's movie almost destroyed John Getz's career. Anyway, if you really want to see the crappy critters trilogy, don't do it. This is the mistake I made, renting the first one or the third or better, DO NOT STAY! This movie sucked so badly that I can't believe it, please avoid this crap. Shame on you, Mick!
