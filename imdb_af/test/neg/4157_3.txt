I like to think that I can appreciate a movie that is a bit out of the ordinary, and I definitely like a good movie that makes me think. <br /> <br /> If you like the ordinary movies that make you think, look elsewhere. This movie is so bad and so denying that the only thing you will think after it's over is how it's possible to waste 90 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> A movie of this kind has a manager to buy from the viewer. Why are we interested in the main characters? What motivates these characters through their existence? Why do they make the decisions they make? This movie makes a very poor effort to do so and fails in the process. There is no chemistry between these two actors, both are excellent in their ability to be comfortable in any role. So why did they fail here? I feel strongly that they didn't know what their motivation was, and when an actor didn't know, their audience couldn't follow. <br /> <br /> In total, I saw Macromedia flash videos being offered. more in the way of challenging thoughts, I have at least more interest in the spilled hamster that holds the moon than why this married man would dare all for a "Code 46" offense.
