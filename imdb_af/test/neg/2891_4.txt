In addition, the Australian film, BURNING MAN and FLASH FIRE are titled for its various releases, shot in New South Wales. This is problematic for its producers due to various personality conflicts and extensive shooting time which is using its allocated budget well in advance. storyline is sometimes nicely detailed, under standard post-production finishes and generally the cut is. Tom Skerritt plays Howard Anderson, an American entrepreneur with a "passion for building" who, in the process of setting up a tourist hotel in the Blue Mountains region, is unaware that his business partner, Julian Fane ( Guy Doleman, the incomplete ten million dollar structure, much more than its real value, plans to destroy it as a result of regular summer fire fires to raise an attractive sum of fraud. In line with this illegal scheme, Fane arranges for a firefighter to perform the burn, a young man who is also Anderson's boyfriend and because of the future resort in the midst of a critical fire hazard sector (one of those many inexplicable elements of the script) Julian has every expectation that his turbulent design will occur without serious obstacle. Since the local crime-victimized insurance company is owned by Fane, the policy's naturally skeptical underwriters, Lloyd's of London, use senior investigator George English (James Mason) to investigate the nature of the crimes. of death, possibly a murder, of an insurance investigator (Wendy Hughes) who apparently was near the cause of the arson following the clues. The film setting is a dramatic backdrop to Christmas, the summer capital of Antipodes in the week before Christmas, but the links in the story are not compiled at all, leading to events that are difficult for a viewer to follow, raises a problem with erratic editing, the mentioned heavy cut, and poor sound and image quality. Skerritt's semi-comatose and drone style is dissatisfied with this dull sound processing, but Mason is very effective, as always, and enjoys the best dialogue with Hughes as the premature written investigator. Doleman wins acting laurels with his performance as the malicious Julian Fane.
