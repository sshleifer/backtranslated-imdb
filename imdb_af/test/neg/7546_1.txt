Wow, this movie was terrible. It's as simple as that. It's actually the first time I've left early, as far as I can remember. However, it seems good: I had a very nice chat with two most charming girls while we all waited for the rest to finally give up what they called a "movie". <br /> <br /> Where to start. Bad acting, bad jokes. Fecal humor, which I simply cannot stand. Sorry, but snot, pie and scat are * not * funny. You saw the title photo? This scene actually takes about 5 minutes, with the two "heroes" hitting and mutilating, which is supposed to be humorous in itself. It's not. <br /> <br /> Apart from body fluids, violence and cross-linking, I don't remember much about this. At least not much good. I was really disappointed with this piece of garbage. Or let's be honest here: since I'm actually a big fan of "British" (ie black) humor, I was angry. <br /> <br /> So, my advice? Three words: don't look.
