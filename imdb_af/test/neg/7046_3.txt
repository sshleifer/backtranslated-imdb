It's really a shame. There was so much controversy around this picture (in other words, the infamous relationship between Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rossellini), as it made a lot of attention to a very forgotten film. The story is incredibly slow, cheap and uninteresting. And, moreover, the film is bordered with amateur actors who can barely speak English. I'd really prefer sub-letters - that would have made the experience less exhausting. Back to the rotten acting. The Neo-realistic movement was great in Italy when the film was made. Many of these films are absolute masterpieces (such as De Sica's Umberto D., The Children is Watching Us and Miracle in Milan) because they received so much from non-professional actors. They behaved like ordinary people, but in Stromboli they act like ordinary people. OWNED to be actors and come out very badly - like kids in a school game. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you hope that the movie has a good ending (and so brings your time to the movie), DO NOT bother. The plot was just totally unimportant and stupid - so much so that I really found that I could care less about the characters. Like the island they all live, the film is deserted and without color or life.
