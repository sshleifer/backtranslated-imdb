The start voice sounds like 'The Wind' can be quite an interesting movie, but when the story unfolded, I knew it was from there. The most important thing about this movie that was blown out was the terribly bad acting work that all the main characters did (except for a few scenes of Mic's inner unrest), there was a total lack of character development and absolutely no point on the plot - What do the authors think? <br /> <br /> Michael Mongillo has won 2 horror / sci fi 'The Wind' awards. HUH? What was so scary about this movie? NOTHING! Except for resident angry 2 video shots, the rest was more of a "made for tsv thriller" - it won't even have to be edited. If you want a much better movie about 'murder among friends', you need a scanty grave. <br /> <br /> 'The Wind' * / *****
