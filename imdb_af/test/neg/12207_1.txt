This version of David Copperfield is terrible from start to finish. I knew we were in a wasted evening's show when a little stupid to the point of embarrassing Attenborough and Olivier camp it as two bad things. It was down the mountain afterwards. Aunt Betsy was adequate but didn't have any of the eccentric flair she'd noticed. The worst was the producer's choice for Uriah. This was the music hall version of this character, previously and admirably played by Roland Young. And what was all this self-absorbed fear of David. Dickens should have thrown into his grave to see how his favorite child was in a lash in his beer. <br /> <br /> It was once Hollywood knew more than very old England.
