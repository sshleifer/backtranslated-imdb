In the aftermath of September 11 in New York, this drama about US firefighters was regarded as a salute and tribute to their professionalism. The story is told with a series of flashbacks, after which the fire brigade Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) crashed through the floor of a burning building and communicated only by radio with Captain Mike Kennedy (John Travolta). The flashbacks basically show how Jack grows from a yard, seeing Kennedy as a father figure, as a fire legend. Of course, today Jack's fellow firefighters are trying to reach him, but they are too late, and in the end, he lets them go, and it goes to his funeral, where he is best praised. firefighters they knew. Also with Jacinda Barrett as Linda Morrison, Terminator 2's Robert Patrick as Lenny Richter, Morris Chestnut as Tommy Drake, Billy Burke as Dennis Gauquin, Balthazar Getty as Ray Gauquin and Tim Guinee as Tony Corrigan. The flashes of the movie are ultimately all that I can pay attention to, and enjoy touching the characters, the rest is a bit to chat for my taste. Sufficient!
