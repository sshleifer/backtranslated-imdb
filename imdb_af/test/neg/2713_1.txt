It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After watching this piece, I felt like I needed to write Madonna for my time, but now I feel I need to write Madonna and need a big 80-year-old album (since she's not a good album can not take up saving her life anymore in exchange for this disaster. <br /> <br /> On the movie itself, which can be summarized as follows: <br /> <br /> It consists of Madonna playing around like a spoiled teenager who lost her way. She is trying to impress this impressive spectacle of an actor who plays the lawyer in the film. But the best was the end. I stared at the ground with my jaw as the credits I thought were "This is the end? What a piece of sh * t!" If Madonna wasn't a pop icon at the time of this movie, this movie would have left her career alone. And the funniest thing about the whole situation was that I just watched the damn movie to see where they put the song "Who's That Girl". Well, guess where they put it? ............................ .......at the end!
