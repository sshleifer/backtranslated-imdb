This was the first feature film for just about everyone involved, including director Teck Tan, so they deserve credit to deduct it. But this film was uncomfortable in his direction, preachy in his style, exaggerated in his acting, and too politically correct. The plot was everywhere in place, to prevent any aspect of it from developing well. Gangsters are involved in the story, although I'm not sure what their movie presence has added, but even making the movie unrealistic. They could be completely left out and the movie would have been better. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a young ethnic Chinese Malaysia returning to his homeland after studying in the West. His studies brought him back with the skills he needed to fulfill his dream of driving a rock group and taking them to the top of Malaysian maps (a decent youth prize). The beginning of the film indicates conflict with his traditional father, but as soon as the gangsters get involved, this part of the story is made insecure. <br /> <br /> But the film is trying to take advantage of Malaysia's wonderfully diverse ethnic mix, but unfortunately the way in which these aspects have been placed on film is either terribly confronted or straight-forward. There is a beautiful scene of Malay women doing a beautiful traditional dance on a beach, but the way the vision is integrated into the plot seems forced and unnatural. <br /> <br /> The acting came down as somewhat amateurish, and the male guidance was particularly unconvincing. The female Malaysian chief was a significant exception leaving the most positive point. The film also has an open gay character, and although he is a caricature, he offers some of the nicer moments in the film. But the movie was just barely a notch above a typical local television drama. Unfortunately, this film, which is not least offensive, is banned in Malaysia. 10/03
