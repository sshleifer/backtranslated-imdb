Hey, I know Angel isn't the kind of show people give a happy ending, and I know they can't just make everything perfect, but I couldn't believe Angel's end. I'm absolutely out of the show, it's probably the best show ever. However, I hated this end, and half of Angel's season 5 seemed (like Buffy season 7). My favorite characters deaths were pretty useless and did nothing for the plot. Cordelia was one of the best characters on the show, and as she and Angel finally get together, she has changed all evil and a demon. I wanted so badly to get her back, didn't get me wrong, the episode where Cordelia came back was fantastic, but I was still very mad that she was gone. Then on earth was Fred dead, just after she finally came to Wesley? There was no sacrifice, it was pointless, it didn't do anything for the plot, and blue-haired demon girl is a terrible, useless character. They spent far too much at the end. Another big problem is that they are not well connected to the elements. I know those dudes in the black thorn that wanted the apocalypse, but there wasn't even a date for it to happen. The apocalypse had to be performed and discovered throughout the season, rather than just mentioning, there are some angry dudes an hour before the season ends. One of the biggest problems is every character that the audience cares about, whether it is dead or has nothing to live on. My three favorite characters have died, and Angel, Spike and Gunn (who I'm not sure of not even surviving) have no office, are not even back to helping them out, are in the middle of a big struggle and lost all they care about. Angel and Spike are never saved, they lose the girl they care about, and just about everyone's death, and they still have to fight this strange evil army. I get the whole thing that you never stop fighting, but it was stupid to fix it right in the middle. Couldn't be a little salvation, knowing that there will always be many more fights. I didn't get why this episode was rated so high, because I think the Buffy ending was 10 times better, and I wasn't even a huge fan of that one. Why had they to slip in the end, seasons 3 and 4 and 1st half of five were so amazing, then they threw the show.
