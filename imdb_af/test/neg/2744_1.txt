I admire a secret admiration of the original Love Thy neighbors TV programs, mostly because they show the kind of exuberant brashness and bad taste that is synonymous with so many programs of their era - but I will lay my teeth (very uncomfortable position ) if I pretend that this big-screen spin-off is nothing but an abomination. The opening scenes of unholy vandalism are not only useless, but also stunning. It is never explained why the movie opens with a track shot of people wasting each other's homes. And nothing improved from that. By the time the film unleashes the oldest joke in the book - the terrible dragon of a mother-in-law seems to be unexpected - is followed by the crashingly obvious revelation that she is developing a gentle place for the black neighbor's father and rotting her moves son to ever greater depths of self-righteous, ignorant anger, most critical viewers will be turned off. Take it as a warning unless you're keen on cheap devotion with horrible acting, static direction and the overall comic flair of a burning orphanage.
