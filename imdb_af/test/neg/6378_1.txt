Comedy works best when it comes to things that are true. But even so, some efforts are needed to make jokes that everyone loves and even the most grumpy viewers can crack a smile. Looking at the Daily Show, I see the whole "it's funny because it's true", but I don't bother and often I don't do it when they're funny or just trying to make a point ( I mostly see it in the maintenance segments). The Daily Show started out as a news parade. By definition, they made lots of fun about how the media played their own news, as if they were careless and stupid news reporters and anchors, and they tackled many subjects from science to movies and sometimes politics. Stewart came along ... and it all went to hell. The first year of Jon Stewart's reign was probably golden, though he was so funny, but when 2004 came together it is where you start to see a great chance in the performance from there. The show's humor went by, Colbert left, Steve Carell left. Many of the show's best anchors are over and now it is mostly from Jon Stewart and the show is from a parody to a semi-serious news show, essentially Evening News, but with a few gags here and there. For those who haven't seen the show and are having trouble figuring out what to watch on the cable, I'll give you a brief description of what the show is about (at least until 2009): -Bush, Cheney and all Republicans (unless they also make an opinion shared by the Democrats) are stupid, evil, corrupt, and hypocrites, anyone standing by conservative beliefs is also angry, corrupt, and a hypocrite; - people who doubt the man-made global warming theory are angry and stupid; -vote Democrat; There I saved you 25 minutes of your time, go see something else. First of all, I have said that the producers hijacked the show for their own personal political agenda, but if I actually see the interviews, it becomes clear about this show (which I mentioned above), but I'll do it in an instant . The humor in The Daily Show, according to Jon Stewart, expects you to find a randomly filmed quote found by Bush, Cheney or a random republican humorous quote. Jon jokes, puts it in writers' specific context and expects the random quote to somehow deliver the punchline. So, unless you get the context, it's totally useless as bankable humor. Also, the Daily Show expects you to laugh when talking to a politician and in another separate video say another thing and put another context that the authors expect you to understand and so funny. why? Well, because Jon said it. Now imagine the Daily Show using the formula, which is many times a year, and you will begin to understand what a laughfest was now 25 minutes of just silent stars (yes, even in the Lewis Black segments). First there was a decent amount of trouble in these jokes, but now much less of this is clear. And the interview has the most strange sense of bias I've ever seen. Jon Stewart calls Bill O'Reilly a bully, but what makes him suck at every actor and democrat (John Kerry before Obama today) who looks at respected republicans and sustained conservative news stories like the weekly Standard's own Bill Kristol? He puts them in a kind of human court as if they were charged with a crime. Often, anybody on the show who stands on Bush is portrayed as delusional, as if that person is in touch with reality and accepts that he speaks For the majority of America, this is the de facto treatment for anyone conservative, unless it happens share a similar view with Democrats. If it is then it is an endless love party. But it doesn't matter, in the eyes of Jon you are already wrong before you walk into the show and it is still wrong. This is the kind of treatment you get if you are on the right. Now you have to wonder what it might do with humor. One wonders what will happen if Democrats win the White House ...
