This movie was extremely disappointing, I thought it would be another 'marijuana comedy', but don't be deceived. It's not at all. There are hardly any weed-related jokes that come to mind, I don't even think they smoke any weeds in this movie. The marijuana field is just a plot device. <br /> <br /> My impression of seeing this movie was that four friends were bored one summer and decided to set up a script (their idea of) witty dialogue and a movie. The product is mere dialogue supported by mediocre acting, to say this movie has no 'hook', is a great understatement. Don't waste your time or money.
