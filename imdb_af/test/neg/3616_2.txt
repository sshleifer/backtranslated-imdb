I really don't think it is necessary to write a review on a snake movie snake movie, but even in the abstract limitations of its own genre, it has hit a new layer So my anger must be known. . The only reason I even touched this incredibly bad movie is because I knew it would be bad, it was very late at night, I couldn't sleep, and in the past many bad movies would exhaust the energy. me and make me sleep. It soon became very early that this movie would be frightening, but it even put the expectations down. <br /> <br /> The film is directed and written by Wayne Crawford, who also dies in the movie as a tourist guide on the African River, which eventually has to be on a remote island called Snake Island. come to another boat to pick them up. They hang out, become drunk and then become subject to the attacks of poisonous snakes on a mission to cleanse their island of human beings. <br /> <br /> If your jaw dropped at the last sentence of my second paragraph, don't try to reload it, you've done it for the first time. Honestly, I prefer my essentials when the creatures just attack the nonsense stupid people from hunger, not because they have a kind of mission. These are not mutant snakes. They're not gigantic as you see in Anaconda. They are just ordinary, everyday African snakes like mambas and vipers? Only they have the brain to form armies, take matters, work together to catch people, understand our language and even dance! Has your sign dropped again? Well, this is going to fall further. At the center of this horrible B-movie, about the part I've given up, the human characters start to drink a campfire and then suddenly break into some sort of orgy. And as they dance naked and so, the snakes snake them all up and start jamming. The combination of this scene and the scene where we discovered that snakes, some of the villainous creatures on the planet, formed an alliance against humans for some strange reason, proved just too much for my poor brain. And just when I couldn't take the filmmakers to a lower level, the snakes started to sing. <br /> <br /> The people in the movie? Well, let's just say that I've never before rooted for the beings to kill everyone so soon. I just couldn't stand it anymore. <br /> <br /> I really don't think I should continue; you get the picture. If there is something that makes Snake Island different from its other rivals, it is daring to try to be even more stupid and it is not a compliment. Why, just why? I am subjecting myself to this very bad movie, I think I will never really know. But "Snake Island" hits a brand new layer. It's an inexpensive, fearless excuse for a film that makes Anaconda, a mindless snake movie, look brilliant and sophisticated and exciting as Steven Spielberg's "Jaws". You're warned.
