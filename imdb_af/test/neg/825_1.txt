My God, how bad it is. Who is this cheater who pretends to be Ali G? Avoid it at all costs. It replaces the clever, multi-patched satire and humor of his performance with a down and out toilet humor. <br /> <br /> It was, of course, an attempt to make him known in the States before he released his performance there on HBO. br /> <br /> One commentator here argues that we do not judge the movie about the merits of the show due to the difference in the mediums. Although it is true that the standard format of the show could never be transmitted on the big screen, Sacha Baron Cohen could ensure the clever use of his comic style in a more conventional movie story. Instead, we have this mess, which honestly has nothing to do with Ali G except for the packaging. <br /> <br /> Terribly disappointing. Look for the Innit, Aiiii, or Bling Bling DVDs for some real Ali G.
