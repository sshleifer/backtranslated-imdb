It was one of Christie's later stories. During her long career, she was interested in the storyline and the understanding of conflicting agents. Both are essentially the same thing and boast of whoever is controlling or creating the situation. <br /> <br /> In detective fiction, the game is a matter of conflicting realities. The murderer intends to change reality to deceive the detective, the author intends to do the same to the reader. Both the reader and the detective are in a similar battle to create what they see. Therefore, her stories often contain a writer. <br /> <br /> In her works she explores every combination of tricks she can think of. Along the way, we often have bodies that don't look like, and times, and intended victims and so on. But the true magic of the books is this understanding of control. In 'Bertram's' it was literally a building. <br /> <br /> Here it is a dead man. Well, sometimes it happens, but not so. It is as if the author is the famous man. Rafiel was. It especially loves Marple readers who remember the same character of the 'Carribean Mystery', which is in some way framed by her cousin. In that story, Rafiel was the carrier of the story to the authorities. <br /> <br /> The producers of this series have an almost vague commitment to using another creative team on each. Sometimes it is just work. The 'Bertram's' episode was quite brilliant. This one is the most beautiful of the lot and has an active camera. But unlike the 'Bertram's' work, it has nothing to do with the story. <br /> <br /> The camera moves and captures simply because it can. The Citizen Kane quote at the beginning was a bit too literal and blunt. This story is good, but the adapter has exhausted some critical things, and the irrelevant camera is annoying. <br /> <br /> Ted's Evaluation - 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.
