This movie is just crap, I can't put it otherwise. From the beginning we know it's going to be good. <br /> <br /> The story, dialogue, acting, special effects, makeup, pretty much, everything sucks. I like vampire movies and I know they will never be Oscar movies, but this one is not even worth seeing, I can't believe anyone produced this thing. <br /> <br /> It's not even about vampires, it's more about a dream / reality experience. The film's development is incoherent, the motivation of the characters is ... Not exist, everything looks like a big joke. Maybe that's what they're trying to do, but I really doubt it. I wish I knew what they were trying to do, but it just fell back. It's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life (and I've seen a lot of bad movies but nothing compared to it) Please make yourself a favor and don't look after it. <br /> <br /> P.S. This is also full of clich√©s! P.S. 2 Bad Scriptures, Bad Direction, Bad Cinematography. P.S. 3 I have been bothered to comment on this as a favor to everyone.
