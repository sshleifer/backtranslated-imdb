Before you dismiss my post as "not get", I say ... I'm one of the greatest Richard Kelly and the Twilight Zone fans out there. Donnie Darko is one of my all-time favorites and I even thought Southland Tales had his moments. I'm a big sci-fi fan. I was very excited to see "The Box", can't wait for it to come out. <br /> <br /> That said ... "The box" is terrible. Behind "Sleep Me To Hell", this was the worst movie I saw in 2009. And it just won't end! When you think you have reached the end, another change in the plot and you go out more torture. I actually went to the theater at the end of the movie. I could barely take it. <br /> <br /> No matter how you cut or justify it, the biggest problem with "The Box" is that it makes little sense. Believe me, I got it, I understood what was going on. But that doesn't mean that it makes sense to look back. For example, take the basics. The main couple ... Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, who play Norma and Arthur Lewis. Diaz loses her finances at her job and then claims to her husband that they are a "living salary bill to payroll". Well, sell that f-ing Porsche drive your man then !!! They live in a beautiful 2 story house in a nice subdivision. Marsden works what a high-paid job at NASA turns out to be and Diaz is a full-fledged teacher. And yes, Marsden drives a too expensive vehicle. But are they somehow living salary to payroll? No need to push the button, just cut off your cheap lifestyle a little! The movie would have worked better if they showed the couple unemployed and in serious debt. Instead, they are apparently desperate for money ... all the time living what I would call a luxury lifestyle. As I said, you can understand what's going on, but it still makes little sense! It's a rare combination. <br /> <br /> There was a terrible scene in a library that I would feel going to be one of the worst segments in movie history (terribly performed). It was idiotic, illogical and out of place. I can't even begin to fully describe it, so I will move to a subplot that involves nosebleed and body posture by strangers. (Yes, I'm unfortunately serious). A kid is in Diaz's class with a wicked and smiling face (a sinister smile apparently being completely obscured by everyone in authority at school). He starts asking Diaz personal questions, which literally embarrasses her before her class. No punishment is given to the child ... he was not even asked to stay with the class for a talk! Then Diaz is at a party ... and the same child is one of the hired help ... stripped shirt, apron and everyone! I don't know many odd belongings (which seem to be in Junior High), also moonlight as a party boy sponsored by parties by teachers and school officials ... but we found one here! (See what I mean ... you can understand it completely, but it still makes no sense ... a rare combo!) Like many things in the movie, the child comes and goes ... no real explanation about Not him, no ends with his character. A lady then comes to Diaz in a grocery store and tells her that experiments are being run secretly and her family is one of the test subjects. Well ... hmmm ... if strangers have the powers they can take over remotely ... and the strangers don't want to help Diaz ... who took over this woman's body and gave Diaz advice? ! Again ... The lady tried to help Diaz ... and the strangers didn't want to help Diaz ... who's got hell controlling her body? Never explained. Never spoke again. No nothing !! It goes on and on as it seems to me, 2 weeks. It won't end! I wonder if this movie had undergone a massive re-enactment at some point. It was poorly edited. Diaz's accent was there one minute, the next. Subplots started but never ended. The many reprints of the outreach date clearly show the problems the producers had with the final product. It's really a train wreck. <br /> <br /> Passing on this one ... there's no reason for depreciation. 3 out of 10, just because I like Diaz and sci-fi! But it probably earns a 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading! <br /> <br /> JD
