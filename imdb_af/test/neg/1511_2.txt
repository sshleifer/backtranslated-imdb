(As a note I would like to say that I saw this movie at my annual church camp, where the whole youth group laughed at it. I bought it when I saw it on a shelf one year later, just for the humor I derived from a bad attempt to make an evangelical movie. <br /> <br /> Lay it down, little of the great expectations of various filmmakers at different levels. Most of the problems lie within the impersonal observers. Regardless of the nice carts in the movie, or the truth in Christ's sacrifice for you, as a movie AND witness of the instrument, it hardly lies down. <br /> <br /> Most good opinions of the movies are supported by Christians who agree with the message. Although it is easy for a Christian to agree with the points being made, the audience hardly sees life outside a clich√©. The fight between Ben and his brother was terribly called. And there are at least three blatant tipos in the captions. <br /> <br /> I encourage someone to watch the movie a second time with the director's comments. It really helps you to understand why the movie was written how it was. The directors' view of secular society is almost the opposite of what the role of a filmmaker will provide: he shows a pedantic understanding of non-Christians, as well as some points of religious conflict; Most of the editing, he admits, is rushed, but "satisfactory"; he thought the overused transitions and themes would be effective; and was completely satisfied with the acting. <br /> <br /> He also added motives that he was very proud of: -All (read: most) of the names are significant. Ben Destin = "Destined", Gus Pelman = "Gospel Man", Nicky D = Nicodemus. The car that donuts is symbolic of the circulating nothing that is a life without Christ. When Ben leaves Pete's motorcycle, he crosses his crutches to form a "cross". <br /> <br /> I'm not the one. He throws such things in between and says while street runners and so on "blow their brains out with guns" and how "God is in control when you are born and when you die." Yes, it wasn't a tick. He says it really. <br /> <br /> I reserved (little) forgiveness for this movie. The "cool cars" and "good message" don't jack up to make this movie good. However, the film was made from a group of unprofessional individuals on a budget of less than 1/100 of the "Fast and the Furious's", and the time limit was unforgiving. With that in mind, I give it a score of 2/10, instead of the 1/10 I so much think it deserves.
