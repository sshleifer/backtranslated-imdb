The box is why I originally picked up this movie and the back is why I rented it. But I soon learned that I was muted. I thought this movie would be something like a Road Trip / Euro Trip / American Pie deal. But I was wrong. This movie is one of the most stupid things I've ever seen. The unprecedented version teases you to watch, but will totally disappoint you. The acting was terrible and sound effects just gaudy. It appears to be very low budget with the whole institution taking place in the same building. Get out and get Eurotrip or Road Trip instead. I can't believe the Lampoon national has put its name on it. Don't buy it, don't rent it. Don't waste 2 hours of your life on this coil.
