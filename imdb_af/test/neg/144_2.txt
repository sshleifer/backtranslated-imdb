I somehow managed to make the whole way through this movie, but was amazed by the total lack of entertainment provided. My friends and I are fans of HK movie, but WOW. This movie has it all, and with everything I mean everything a movie shouldn't have. Underdeveloped and stereotypical characters, overall overarching caseus special effects, talking robots, no less than 20 double foot jumping kicks, impossible situations, unpredictable "gags" and "jokes", basic school premium, senseless murders and also long time for the material. Throw in the fact that Gen-X Cops was a decent movie and this movie gets even harder to wear. Quite simply, if you entertain the idea of ​​watching this movie, don't do it.
