It's not exactly what I would call a Mad Max movie, after seeing Road Warrior and experiencing the excellence of that movie, I felt a little disappointed after seeing it. It was supposedly starting as a sort of desert movie, and merged with the Mad Max franchise (bad idea). The casting wasn't exactly the best, I mean, come on Tina Turner? One of the biggest problems with this movie is that there are no good villains. No Wez, no Humungus, not even a decent prosecutor! Nothing really even happens if you plan to see this sub-pairing movie (can it even be called?) Make sure you see Mad Max 2 or Mad Max, or better both. Another problem with this movie is that there are too many people, even the Thunderdome battle order is boring, Max doesn't even kill anyone! The music is bad, the characters are bad (not in the good way) and after watching this movie, it left a very bad taste in my mouth.
