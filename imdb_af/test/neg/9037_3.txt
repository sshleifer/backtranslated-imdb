Another movie that makes the story of The Beach Boys worse than it is. I especially remember the scene when Brian says he must stop tour and the other boys call him traitor. I didn't happen like that, and as the film indicates at the beginning, some scenes were overreacted. A movie about The Beach Boys doesn't have to be that way, because there are a lot of things happening anyway. The sad thing is that this movie gives the wrong picture about the boys to those who are not so familiar with the group. Hard core fans like me knew it was not the whole story and so I gave it a low rating. 3. However, it's the best movie about The Beach Boys I've seen so far, it says quite a bit about the other movies. If you want the truth, I recommend the documentary endless harmony.
