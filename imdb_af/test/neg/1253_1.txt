This movie is a disgraceful consequence of what happens when: <br /> <br /> A) It is written, directed and produced by an idiot. and / or B) It was rushed to saturate the poker / Stu Ungar craze. <br /> <br /> The story from the beginning is uneven. Vidmer spends too much time on Ungar's childhood and not enough on some of the legendary stories - such as scorecards, his blackjack escapades, the role as id. He also reports other poker greats such as chip reese, brunson etc. The movie is a complete mess from start to finish. <br /> <br /> If you want a more complete and accurate account, read the book One of a Kind. If you thought the movie was good, read the book and change your mind.
