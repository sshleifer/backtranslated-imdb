This movie sucked so badly, I couldn't even see the end. Milo's voice was too low and I couldn't understand what he was saying, as well as some of Kendra's lines. Also, where did he get all these wedding dresses; it was very impractical. The film did not work out on Milo's drowning and how it made people, Dr. Jeter and his practice mocked. Overall I was disappointed that I couldn't give this movie a zero rating, because by watching this movie as one, I felt I had given it undeserved praise.
