When a rocket from a government experiment collapses on the effects of cosmic rays on animals in a small Texas city, people begin to die. The commander is trying to investigate, but is being hampered in his efforts by other civil servants. It appears that there is a mutant space gorilla on the loose deadly teens in the forest. <br /> <br /> I like low budget science fiction and horror movies. I like monster movies. So I thought there would be a good chance I would like this movie. Unfortunately I didn't. <br /> <br /> I don't mind the bad acting, the corny dialogue, the horrible musical score or the huge plot holes that this movie has. There are many movies that have the same problems I have seen and enjoyed in a bad, that's good way. <br /> <br /> But where others of that kind and Night Fright differ, it's Night Fright just having terrible pacing. And it goes through it. There are scenes that just go on and on without anything happening - the search for the clues is just people who have long walked in the forest; There are several seemingly endless dance teens at a feast in the bush ... but nothing is going on. If these scenes were shorter, the movie might not have been so boring (although I don't think it just cuts, those scenes will save this one). <br /> <br /> I have now given this movie three views to make sure I gave it a chance before I relaxed in this review. Unfortunately, it got worse with every watch. There won't be a fourth.
