Well, what can I say. WHAT THE F ** K? There really isn't much to say about this. The only way you like it is if you, like me, are like a bad bad horror to laugh at. <br /> <br /> Acting - VERY INQUIRY! Just look at the last scene with the main roles active! Rip-off from Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE! but in a bad way! Not terrible! <br /> <br /> Gore-Really not credible. In one scene they use one of those knives that have a piece of them cut over a body part. Using it, with the addition of red ketchup, the supposed 2 is actually right, though it really isn't. <br /> <br /> Plot predictable 'kids get lost in the bush on the weekends'' film ripped off Friday the 13th. <br /> <br /> Killer Quality-scary mask if you're afraid of clowns, kinda incredible that someone would prefer it as their costume. Of course, the director realized all the good costumes were used in all the other horror camp movies there. <br /> <br /> TOTAL 3/10 * / ***** ps- stay away from CAMP BLOOD II, one made it look like the lord of the rings.
