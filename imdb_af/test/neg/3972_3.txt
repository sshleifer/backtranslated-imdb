I will first say ... the movie would have been a 70-year-old sci-fi classic if it was done much better. <br /> <br /> That said, let's examine the plot ... it starts with Peter Graves (or is it Clarence Oveur?) running for president, then he cuts to a goofy college campus-like environment full of authors in goofy trucker caps and headsets and delayed athletes who all act as they are forever old. show one man to America, with a party, then taken to a medical laboratory where he is intoxicated, wrapped in a plastic bag and then prepared as if the doctors are pouring vegetables for steam bags ... okay, actually he gets On the ice the doctors can withdraw the organs they need. <br /> <br /> It then cuts to another brave man and thinks the place he lives in is a bit weird after a beer can (from all the plots possible) found. In a river he looks suspicious (damn the beer cans!). He and an equally stupid love interest from his feelings that they need to get at the bottom of everything makes him as behind as he escapes through what is basically building a large college administration, with some evidence on the road. of cloning discovered. .. and how he is part of it. <br /> <br /> He escaped his controllers after he was shot and an old reporter helped him find his "father" - the man he was cloned on. It just happens that he is a clone of Peter Graves' brother. After the debate on what to do with him and his testimony, he goes back to the facility to find his girlfriend (who is meanwhile lobotomized to be even more stupid, harmless and ready to watch a CTC show to offer.). He is caught and stored in the cold room, just like his Nazi building, delayed friend from the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a confrontation at Graves's brother's house leads to various deaths, including Graves. The reporter and his wife are killed in the midst of an exciting conversation by a bomb. The conspirators seem to have won some ... <br /> <br /> Then Peter Graves seems to survive to run with a metal stick by the miracle of cloned parts, and to give another voice to me a speech just as reporters confront him about the cloning thing. Definitely MST3K feeds, but at the low end of the spectrum as far as the general badness goes.
