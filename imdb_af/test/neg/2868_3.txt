I just watched Fingersmith, and I'm surprised to see the 8/10 average rating for the show. <br /> <br /> Not only was the plot difficult to follow, but character development seems to be randomly applied. . <br /> <br /> The actors were adequate, but in the process of twisting, their characters are made entirely one-dimensional. Once that happens, the story really falls flat and becomes boring. <br /> <br /> And if someone hasn't seen the predictable lesbian undertones from miles away, it is hammered in the most banal way. of the movie. <br /> <br /> The end scene was disappointing and phoned, and everyone who held back went: "Ohhh, so they were already a spoon mask!" had to be the evening. br /> <br /> Two stars for the tonsil hockey in the earlier scene that was at least a little raunchy, nobody for the rest.
