I put through less painful operations than the time I spent watching this movie. <br /> <br /> If you're trying to think it will be something like a Guy Ritchie movie. Think again! The production, dialogue, acting, screenplay, film work and plot were about the worst I've ever seen in a movie. My fav part in all honesty was the end credits. In all the history of the theater, there was never a better excuse to turn the TV off and something better with your life. <br /> <br /> Did root canal work rather than waste your time and money on this!
