I bought and paid this $ 1.99 rental fee from Hollywood. I didn't expect much, but thought it would at least fall asleep. I quickly took note of the very bad storyline, the brutal persecution of all (no one speaks so much except in cartoons), and the seemingly low-making it-like-us-go-together. I know the participants of this mess must be very shy, and I'm sure it hasn't helped any careers. As for this 35-year-old movie, it has now given a right answer for the worst movie you've ever seen. <br /> <br />
