Other commentators described this movie as "classic 1950's SciFi", with clever use of inventory and documentary footage, and clever character interaction. <br /> <br /> Nothing can be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's classic 1950s sci-fi ... but 1950's sci-fi at its most blindest stupid worst. <br /> <br /> Consider that the Mantis first prey is a radar station that is first airborne, then grounded. but the station is (from the air) depicted as on a mountain top, with snow on one side and semi-cleaned dark ground on the other, but when (on the ground) investigators visit the site, it is suddenly on an apartment, evenly white plain, miles from the nearest mountain. <br /> <br /> Also consider the ridiculous pseudo-scientific babble of the highly recommended expert who is introduced to investigate a large claw. He says, "Well, we know one thing ... it can't come from an animal, because every known species has a bony skeleton. Even reptiles and birds have bones." He says some creatures ... have snails, shellfish, insects ... not bony skeletons. Excuse me? Let's define "animal" here. Not even in the 1950s can anyone over the age of six take this man as an expert in biology, as he clearly does not know what an "animal" is and also does not have the ability to cover several broad categories of animals. bony skeletons do not have to mention (sharks, rays, jellyfish, insects, mollusks, arthropods, gastropods, sponges, arachnids, echinoderms .... you get the idea.) The characters are cardboard, 2D stocks ... scientist, sidekick girlfriend, big bad monster. Nothing here shows any sense of creativity. No pulse, no signs. <br /> <br /> There are no spiritual dialogues, the special effects are even stupid for their time, and the stock exchange is serving a reckless disregard for continuity. It's a B-movie that is the worst on his death, with a production crew clearly not being bothered to even try half-heartedly. <br /> <br /> Use sparingly as sleep medicine or punishment for small children who are easily offended by bad science.
