So my friend and I cherish our local movie rental shop and look for something to go with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, so why not pick up the third installment in the Scarecrow series!?! Keep in mind that it's not just Scarecrow Three; This is, Scarecrow: Gone Wild. Now we've both seen the first two Scarecrows, so we felt compelled to finish the job. Let's start with the cover of the DVD first. First we see a photo of Ken Shamrock ("The World's Most Dangerous Man") on the cover. Apparently he was used to marketing the movie as the "main actor". By the way, he has the least screen time of any member of the credited class. Next we see a picture of a very attractive and very thinly dressed woman in the middle ground of the cover. I can assure you she's not in the movie at all. At the time of the lease, we assumed that it was the fact that the scarecrow is "wild" repeated. In the background we saw a big carnival on an island in the sea. I can also assure you that the carnival is not in the movie at all. Looking back at me and my friend, I had to know that there was something. I really mean who the carnival is on an island. Now up to the real movie. We start when a young man is inexplicably fused to a scarecrow in the middle of a wheat field. Don't ask me how they were melted, but think about when Brandon Lee wakes up in the crow from the dead. It's just stupid. But in the scarecrow's defense he became "wild". Anyone, the scarecrow, now alive by the young man, takes a trip to his local beach to brutalize those who have done wrong. Because yes, in the scarecrow world, the beaches are conveniently located in the same general environment as maize. To make a long story, the scarecrow kills everyone who stands in his way without warning, except for the scarecrow's trademark whistle. However, it is quite impossible to believe, because the scarecrow's mouth is clearly closed. Several track shots that Kubrick later rolls into his grave, and we have one of the worst third installments in a series ever. Well, except maybe the third Matrix. As Joel Siegel would say, "This scarecrow is very bad."
