I remember when they made a big problem about it when it came out. They showed clips every week on WWF TV and everyone was excited. It started the first weekend in number two behind Indiana Jones and the last crusade. Then it did a nosedive. Critics HATE this movie. I don't remember one good review. Everyone agreed it was bad and sometimes grotesque. I didn't know they meant, but now I have been making movie references to gay bars, women are banging and almost raped and a disgusting bar chair with overflowing urinal lol. When I was younger, I didn't mind. It was Hulkamania, brother! <br /> <br /> Now I find it very bad, but still enjoy watching once when it comes to Bodyslam (which has a better story). First, Hulk Hogan's acting skills are just not good. he is one dimensional like the character he plays in the wrestling ring. And actually, Rip and Hulk are not far apart. Kurt Fuller is a good actor, but he is not good at playing the bad man. He is better at comedy and nerve-drama characters. He's just not credible like Brell. There is not much character development in this movie, and the people who suffer are the characters of Randy, Rip's brother and Charlie the coach. (In the wrestling she's unheard of by a coach who leaves a wrestler to the ring lol). Tiny Lister plays Zeus as she is supposed to be playing, so there is no problem there. Joan Severence is wise and for all of her dog dogs she has a lingerie scene lol. By the end, you figure, what's the point? <br /> <br /> For this one (like other wrestling movies or movies that contain wrestlers as chief), turn your brain off. You will enjoy it more if you do.
