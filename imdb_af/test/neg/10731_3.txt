One day I rented this movie from the local video store, you know, the kind of boxing movie that just comes out and says you have to "rent me". Well, if you see this dull movie in your video store, go through. Fight the urge, hire a porn because this movie is BOOOoooorrrring. In spite of the interesting opening, the film falls into repetitive murders and a hard-hitting policeman who stumbles, copes with the common problems (wife, bastard, etc.). Wondering if the fast forward function works on your video recorder? Hire this movie and test your concerns.
