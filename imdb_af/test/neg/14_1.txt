Some may go to such a movie, but I certainly did not. A college professor, David Norwell, suddenly gets a go for adoption. He actually takes the first child being offered a bad choice called Adam. As it turns out, Adam did not soothe both the water, which almost immediately caused a turbulent tension and unrest to Dr. Norwell. This sob story has played with one problem after another, all centered around Adam's inability and attacks. Why Norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor such as an adoptive child has never been explained. Along the way, the good doctor managed to draw a woman to share in hell, and the little one came out. Personally, I think both were one beer short of a six-pack. Move this yawner.
