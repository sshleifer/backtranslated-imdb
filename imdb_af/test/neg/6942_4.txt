Marlene Dietrich is wonderful as Concha Perez, the requester who drives all men to despair in Joseph Von Sternberg's "The Devil is a Woman". Her performance has nothing to do with "acting" in any conventional sense, but she is glowing, a true star in full control of her material. But she's the only good thing about the movie (she's so good, she's keeping an eye on this villain, I doubt any other actress could've done the same.) <br /> <br /> The story is a terrible lamb melodrama (surely Pierre Louy's novel is better), in which Dietrich's amorous Concha destroys the lives of two friends played by Lionel Atwill and Cesar Romero, with a stiffness that borders on petrification. And for Von Sternberg it's an ugly movie, (perhaps in accordance with his rather ugly subject). Bunuel, on the other hand, thought enough to re-emphasize it as "The Obscure Object of Desire", with more emphasis on the surreal aspects of everything, throwing two different actresses in the same role. No movie is either the directors best hour and although the Bunuel version can be the better movie, it is Dietrich's "performance" you remember.
