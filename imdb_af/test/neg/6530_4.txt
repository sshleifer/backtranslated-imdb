With Tomas Milian and Manny Peres? 'Washington Heights' is a low budget drama in a Latino neighborhood in NYC. <br /> <br /> A young comic book artist (Manny Perez) wants to escape his Latino environment. When his father is shot by a robber's gun, the young man is forced to run the family bodega. <br /> <br /> The movie was shot in a budget (low resolution video and poor sound) with low profile actors. </ br /> <br /> The plot runs well for 85 minutes, but the last 5 minutes was just awful. We don't know if Perez and his girlfriend stayed together and ended up as Angel for the shooting in jail. <br /> <br /> 4/10
