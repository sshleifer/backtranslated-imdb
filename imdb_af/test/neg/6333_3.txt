The unpleasant "home invasion" genre can be traced back to Wes Craven's early sleavest "Last House on the left", with such distractions as "I Spit on Your Grave", "Wrong Road" and "The Visitors" in the footsteps of the movie. Here, in this early 80's Italian offer, the same plot is once again disturbed, stating that this one is set on a continental train. "La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto" ?? known in English-speaking countries as "Terror Express" ?? Starts surprisingly well, but about twenty minutes take it for the worst, as the sex scene takes precedence over the more serious behavior and tension. <br /> <br /> David, Phil and Ernie, three rich youths terrorizing and humiliating others aboard a trans-continental express in Italy. The train is full of other passengers, including prostitute Juliette (Silvia Dionisio) who regularly trains the train and enters into an agreement with one of the porter to serve as a kind of pimp, to convince the male passengers to go with their money. share for a night of passion in her sleeping place. The three cretins quickly set up the passengers with their aggressive, drunk behavior, but matters become more serious when they take control of an entire car and catch themselves from the rest of the train. Soon they will be in their temporary control. A young woman (Zora Kerova) is raped by two of the youths in a cramped compartment; Juliette himself is subjected to a long sexual assault; and later the male passenger forces the male passengers to decide which one will rape a 16-year-old virgin with her parents (a concept has been made twice palatable by her father being one of the men forced to play that game). The only passenger apparently willing to fight back is a guilty one who is being escorted to Germany, but what hope does one man have against three armed thugs? <br /> <br /> La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto gets a good start. Several intriguing characters are introduced, and the three hoodlums are shown to have a really disturbing impact on travelers. Although the story is clearly the exploits, the opening scenes are carefully built up and the film appears to be above the ordinary gutter surface of its genre. Things fall apart in a cruel scene in which Kerova is sexually minded in two by the boy in a toilet compartment. The scene has been filmed globally, and the effect does not seem to be to generate sympathy for the victim or hate for the perpetrators ?? Instead, we are asked to be turned on. It is sensational at its worst. Further humiliating rapes follow, but the rape sequence involves too much deadly camera work on acts of oral sex and the female genitals. One sequence in which the 16-year-old girl stands on the edge of a hard core feels especially "wrong". By the end of La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto, it is easy to forget that it was intended as a thrill, because the last hour of the film is dedicated to pornography rather than tension. Sleaze lovers will ignite it; Others may want to look elsewhere.
