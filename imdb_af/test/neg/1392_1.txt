What is it now that minority comedians feel good about blaming and expecting their minority to get away with it? <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia is not George Lopez. There is a difference. Looking at the comedian Carlos Mencia, I think he hates his own people. And more than that, I think he was forced to patronize his performance as the "Hispanic / Latino / Spanish" version of the Dave Chappelle show. What a terrible mistake. (Note to Mencia: Please don't do a block party movie. So much as I do Santana, Tierra, El Chicano, Christina Agullaria, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira and the reunion of the film Xica da Silva at one stage, do . <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia likes to use the word "beaners" as much as Dave Chappelle's "a" word. It is also not funny or acceptable, even if it is 'own people'. Carols Mencia also likes to say, "If you're offended, too bad". This is not the offense, it is the defense because of what is being said and asked to be accepted. <br /> <br /> Carols Mencia continues - he respects everyone for what he is assuming is comedy. It's not comedy, it's not funny. There is a finesse to look at yourself and get others out of the comedy and do not enforce stereotypes that other races believed in the beginning. <br /> <br /> Mind of Mencia needs polishing because Carlos Mencia needs polishing. Find out what's funny and not what will put more prejudices in motion and then - do it. Until then, the show, Mind of Mencia, was a success.
