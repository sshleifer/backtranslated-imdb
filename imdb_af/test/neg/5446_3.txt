It's just one of those movies that makes you constantly groan and what I wanted to be over. The problems are many and the good points are few. I feel the main problem with this movie is that it constitutes a cheesy plot and they try to make it into an epic movie, which is not a movie about super evil monkeys and smart guys, it is cheese . If you have cheese, make the movie more enjoyable. Allowed, the final scene with the monkeys and that laser was great to watch and more of those things were needed. Instead, the actors do such a serious job that you feel the movie has just a wreath-like plot amidst all the serious tensions the film is trying to create. The plot revolves around a woman trying to find what happened to her missing ex-husband, while also looking for a kind of legendary diamond. She uses these two guys who have trained a monkey to do a sign language and now wants to bring her back as a lid in the country and start the mediocre adventure of a lifetime. The only thing that makes this movie tolerant is the character of Ernie Hudson and the end of the laser attack.
