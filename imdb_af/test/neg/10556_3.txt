As a fan of C.J. 's last movie, Last Days, I really wanted to keep this movie. <br /> <br /> The best thing I can say, though, is that it's not a horrible movie. There are some good performances, and some funny scenes. In particular, Tori Spelling has some great scenes where she talks to her fianc√©'s ex-boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Overall, though, it's pretty week. The text falls back too much on strange coincidences and click movies. (The main character went on a golf study to Stanford, and his high school partner didn't even know he was playing the game?) <br /> <br /> Most of the time, this movie had no idea where it was going or what it is trying to say. There are many scenes that are cute, but eventually it gets a waste of time. And you can easily cut half of the characters from the movie without losing anything. <br /> <br /> Yet, for all its mistakes, I should say that this is one of the better gay movies of the past year. What says a lot about how badly most gay movies are. <br /> <br /> I hope C.J. The next movie will be better.
