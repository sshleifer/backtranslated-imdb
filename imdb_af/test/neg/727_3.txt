When I first looked at this series, the impression I got was that the characters were charming and funny. Lorelai and Rory were especially talented and intelligent conversationalists, though a little talkative. However, after looking at it for some time, my opinion has changed. <br /> <br /> The main characters taught themselves to be self-centered self-obsession narcissists, who treated small wounds to their pride as the worst insults in their existence. For example, Rory would not talk to her mother for months, when Lorelai did not consult her on her impulsive marriage, while Lorelai Lukas dumped for just a little time to adapt to his new living conditions. These people are level, see themselves as the center of the universe where everyone else must act exactly according to their own rigid rules, and if they do not, they will be resentful against them forever. They do not want to see other people's problems and treat the smallest smallest as the biggest offense. Most characters do not appear to be able to act adulthood. They think they have to do what they want and everyone else is condemned. <br /> <br /> The series is character-based, so when the main characters became so unattractive, the show also became impossible to watch. I still have the rest of the series, but I doubt I will ever look. I will also love someone who loves the show and his terrific characters with the greatest suspicion - they should be as horrible as Lorelai et al.
