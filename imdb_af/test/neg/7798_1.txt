I saw the preview in Femalin and thought it could be a cool movie. It turns out a terrible rubbish. There is not much nudity in the film, and not to talk. There were just a few stupid and stupid dialogues with some uninteresting dances you would normally expect to see during audition. In our case you can even see it in real movies. Conclusion: I have nothing to do with it. Leave it alone.
