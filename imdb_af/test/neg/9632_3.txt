I watched this movie a few times and I never really liked it. I'm not a fan so called "now horror", so I can't be fired on that account. I found it a little funny, I think the thing that irritates me about Hammers is the sex-fluttering aspect, not sex, but Sexploitation. I'm amazed at how many people this movie has rated so high, so I'll see it again. But for me it wasn't creepy, it didn't have an atmosphere, just a little "omigod, look at the bad / dumb London prostitute women and that little innocent Anna is raped by another nasty man, ooherh ! " Eventually I suppose the movie had no depth, just a bunch of nasty foolish men and women just for the titillation value. It was undoubtedly to some extent Victorian England, but the sets are even too clunky and boring gives a sense of Victorian threat. Roger Corman's horrors on the other hand, now it's style, atmosphere and elegant horror. For me it was just exploitation, flat-footed.
