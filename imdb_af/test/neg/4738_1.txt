AVP2 is a horrible movie. The dialogue was useless, the acting was pathetic, it has virtually no storyline and you can't really tell what the hell is going on at half the time due to the continuity errors and plot holes. <br /> <br /> BUT! You will like it anyway. Because it pushes the boundaries on gore, violence, death, destruction and chaos. They even kill children, newborns and unborn babies in this movie. You will sit there and think, "Oh my God, it's disgusting". And they surprise you by killing the 'sexy chick that is always alive' when the predator and aliens fight in hospital. <br /> <br /> It is as if the film industry says: "We know what we did in the first Alien Vs. Predator movie was bad, so we do it again, but this time we get help from psychopaths with live imagination. " It is predictable, moronic and harms useless .... but you will think about it for a while after you see it.
