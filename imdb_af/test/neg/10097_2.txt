Eric Roberts "stars" in this Tommy Lee Thomas debut prison movie. He plays the leader of a corrupt circuit of guards. Although, according to most people's standards, it is angry, its character is the kind of guy that is good enough to give you supportive wires while being chained to the ceiling, as he interferes with a "Lethal Weapon" electric prods. <br /> <br /> The movie has a complicated plot about corruption in prison that makes absolutely no sense. Thomas has Clint Eastwood's razor, Dolph Lundgren's one-liners, the acting capabilities of JCVD ​​and the body of the smallest guy you knew in school, who took steroids after graduation. <br /> <br /> Martin's "Cobra Kai" Kove's career shares this low point with Roberts, in the movie it's hard to see if Kove's character is supposed to be drunk for the whole movie or if Kove isn't so came. I can't blame him if he did. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for everyone involved, this movie has a "so bad it's good" quality that can be fun if you do ABSOLUTE NEWS.
