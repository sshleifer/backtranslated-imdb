One minute in THE UNTOLD and it's already ripped off the BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and PREDATOR techniques. Does this mean that we will see many trees? We'll be sure. Will we see an Austrian bodybuilder blowing things up? Well, this movie has the budget of a TVM, so the answer is a sounding no. Find someone like these soft porn shows like BEDTIME STORIES? Good, because there's a scene in this that looks like this kind of show. Unfortunately, the only thing you see is cellulite. Do you like it when the screen turns black during a TVM? Great, because it happens between every scene in the unceasing. In fact, this also happens during every scene. Did you enjoy MILLIONS - a huge fraud? Fantastic because one of the characters looks like a bearded Major Charles Ingram, the contestant who tried to swim the one-pound performance. Seriously, one of the characters looks like Major Ingram. I expected him to say, "This is a bear. But it can be a big foot." Cough, cough, yes, it is a big foot. I'm going to shoot it. Final answer Chris "<br /> <br /> Oh, and did I mention that all of the above are the good bits? <br /> <br /> The UNTOLD is not the worst bigfoot movie I have ever seen the award go firmly to the NAME OF THE DEMON I saw more than twenty years ago and I think I have less than Seeing a dozen movies worse at that time. But it said the UNTOLD is still a very poor film in almost every aspect, especially the editing. As some other reviewers have pointed out, it feels that whole pieces of the movie are missing while other pieces where scenes are merged in the wrong order. It's a very bad movie that earns much less than the 5.1 score. I give it 3 out of 10 and I'm very nice
