For those of us who are part of the real world of ballet - this film is completely ridiculous. Ivan Kirov was basically a gymnast, not a ballet dancer. Viola Essen was at Ballet Theater, now American Ballet Theater, and a pretty good dancer, but besides Dame Judith Anderson, the acting is amateurish and Checkov is completely over the top .... embarrassing so! I saw the movie at the age of 14 and when I had never seen a ballet, I was very impressed. But later in life, long after I completed my own career as a dancer, I bought the videotape of it, wondering how it was after so many years. I couldn't believe how naive Hollywood could be over the world of ballet. But it was made in the mid-40's, before The Red Shoes or The Turning Point, the last to give a true picture of the ballet world. Specter's entire movie is now dead ... Ivan Kirov (not his real name) dies at the age of 79. It was his only film, which was then held by a Chicago businessman. So the rumor goes.
