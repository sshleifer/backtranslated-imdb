I have no idea how anyone can score this movie. I didn't rent it to think it was the next big horrorflick, the next big horror poof, or the next big low-budget horror poof. Obviously it's not meant to be frightened, but one fatal production error has completely sowed the joy of the viewing experience. The sound editing was terrible. I had to control the volume of the entire movie. You can imagine how difficult it is to get something - even a low budget poof - when you change the volume up or down, or try to expect what you need to do next. The regular dialogue is very low, and all the screams, sounds, etc. are very hard. We are not talking about the exchange rate between 5 and 7 on volume control and find a happy medium at 6. We speak between 2 and 9 on the volume where it is virtually impossible to leave the volume alone. Again, this movie can be a decent example of what it is meant for, but you will spend so much time adjusting your volume control that you will never have the chance to enjoy it.
