Ah Animorphs. I loved the book series and consumed everyone at high school and when I heard that there was a television adjustment, I was very excited. <br /> <br /> Boy who was a final product discount. I think for me, it was the moment Nickelodeon stopped being cool programming and more generic. <br /> <br /> So what was wrong with the series? Let me count the ways: 1. The characters were MISSING. In the books, the Animorphs were somewhere between 12-14, the television shot was at least 18. I remember being scared when I saw the photos first. <br /> <br /> 2. Horrible behavior / poor writing. I don't know what the blame would be, and I knocked in the lump that it was. Perhaps that is the fact that the accelerated age of the cast obstructs the humor that is at least cute from the 13-year-old because Marco is not funny. In fact, I don't remember a single comic moment of the group and there were a few. The actors were definitely not helped by the writing that was at its best, and was on the worst bad head. <br /> <br /> 3. My lord, they were brief with the budget. The final result of the Andalucians alone had to convince Viacom's belief. Their heads had slits that clearly showed what the helmet was. <br /> <br /> 4. Back to the movie - Rachel was by far the biggest deviation, far from the warrior in the books, the best equivalent in the TV series was "scarecrow". I also know that Cassie was an idealist, but there is a difference between "idealistic" and "idiot". <br /> <br /> 5. One of the worst opening titles ever. Should the music be so obvious? 6. Answer question 6, "yes" because everything else has doubled, why should the expected less intelligent viewers not get a thick as a brick song from a lame rap-rock rip-off or whatever was hell. /> <br /> Since then, there have been bigger interruptions (Iraq, 2004), but if I didn't make myself clear - this show sucked and was an abomination to the book series from which it was based.
