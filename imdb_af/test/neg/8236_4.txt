Reviewing old movies you thought was average is not necessarily a good thing. They sometimes get worse. Champion at the Fangoria camp (in Gorezone they called the "the scariest movie since Texas CHAINSAW", no), LUTHER THE GEEK inexplicably followed a cult as an "intense" horror image. Actually, it's just an average stem and slash? Uh, bite film that briefly puts it off the pack, by holding a killer that sounds like a chicken. Yes, sounds like a chicken. For the filmmaker's credit, at least they didn't make the killer sound like a duck, but the NEW YORK RIPPER. It'll just be stupid. <br /> <br /> Narrative logic is completely abandoned in LUTHER THE GEEK. I'm not saying slasher movies are abundant with reason, but at least in HALLOWEEN Michael Myers escaped. Luther is actually a parole to a long scene where people argue that he has been reformed, even though he looks like a chicken and has a razor bite (which he apparently formed in prison). It's the kind of movie that a couple sees in the door and the girl rejects it by saying, "Oh, my mom had forgotten her keys. She's forgotten a lot of things since my dad's dead." The kind of movie where the hysterical mother in a policeman is looking for Luther and tells him, "The murderer is in my house!" So what does he do? He grabbed her and literally carried her back to the house and said, "Show me where he is and I'll do the rest." Why not call back? <br /> <br /> It's too bad, the movie is filled with such horrible action and dialogue because the Luther character is actually very interesting. Most of the credit goes to Ed Terry, a death switch for Tom Noonan in MANHUNTER, which gives Luther a real threat. In the hands of a director, LUTHER THE GEEK can be on the same level as SONNY BOY or SANTA SANGRE and be a real movie. But Albright is not that director and just places Luther's fascinating character in boring slasher steps.
