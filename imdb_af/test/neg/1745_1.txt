If it is currently the best in Finnish theater, I would say that the big tax money spent on supporting "culture" here in a horrible way. Paha Maa is the worst example of a Finnish "European movie" for big audiences. I'm sure they wanted it to be all the right time, smart and touch. The result is crazy. <br /> <br /> In short: - The story is pretentious, naive and not credible. The same goes for the characters. I think they think brainstorming how to make a movie, where "everything will be, like going to ***, and people will hurt and feel, you really know badly because Finnish people are so notorious and depressed system is so bad, "we point out that ... <br /> <br /> - The movie is loaded with clichés, mostly about" the Finnish mentality ". The way it deals with people's problems and their causes can be straightforward from a regular women's magazine or a cheap bull psychology self-help book. ("We feel so bad inside!") I'm sure they also looked at some Kaurismäki to find out what it was about his films that people loved, totally misunderstood, and with a boring, depressing story About people go through all sorts of things for no other artistic purpose than perhaps social pornography. It's a crying shame, they threw here in Tolstoy. It's just a sign to try to be smart. And not to be. <br /> <br /> - I think the worst mistake is the complete lack of vision and depth. The film is highly original. It is also frustrating to struggle endlessly and bring suffering without any real revelation. I can go through this kind of thought ** ck if the movie is funny or eventually an extended joke, or better still, something sublime as in eg. von Trier's break the waves. There was no one in Paha Maa. Actually, however, I started laughing at one point because the events were just too predictable, over and incredible. Who does this crap? And who likes it? I hope they pretend.
