Watching the PUFFY CHAIR watch out for its soft, colorful trim. <br /> <br /> The movie starts pretty well. Josh (Mark Duplass) and Emily (Kathryn Aselton) are a friendship couple who have a little difficult time with their relationship. A counseling comes one night and Josh asks Emily to come with his father's home, where Josh plans to deliver a purple LazyBoy chair for his father's birthday. Emily, along with the way they pick up Josh's brief brother Rhett (Rhett Wilkins), is an Amish boyfriend who is more in touch with other people's lives than his own. <br /> <br /> Josh and Emily are more quickly beaten by the road trip, as well as a bitter feeling for The Puffy Chair (initially very dirty and falling apart until Josh convinces the original owner to rebuild it) . Rhett quickly found out that the cause of Emily and Josh's problems is the LazyBoy and gives it a night of torch ... <br /> <br /> And that's the last thing we hear from the chair, although there are many is minutes in the movie. <br /> <br /> The big problem is that the title of the movie is The Puffy Chair, if it's not the middle stage chair. This is Josh and Emily's damned relationship and how the road trip seals their feelings for each other. Once the chair was destroyed, there was never mention of it, although they arrived at Josh's parents' place on his father's birthday without a gift. Josh never called the chair, nor his father. There is no connection between it and the lives of these people. So why does the film call The Puffy Chair and why is there no counterpart at the end? Bad writing. <br /> <br /> The other annoying thing is that Mark Duplass's brother, Jay Duplass, is not only the director, but also the cameraman (and not very good). Almost every scene has a quick zoom in on the characters that fall grainy and out of focus before the camera's autofocus comes up and the right ones. Initially, it had a beautiful and artistic feel, but quickly became unbearable. <br /> <br /> The play in the film is accessible and entertaining. All the actors / actresses did good work. But the poor production quality, stilted ending and lack of coherence of the title have caused this too many problems.
