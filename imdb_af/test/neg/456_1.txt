The One is a very suitable name display, mostly because it is close to the fact that the only network is in the lead time, which hardly looks more than one person. <br /> <br /> When I first heard of one, I thought of myself "Weee !! Another singing song show! We don't have enough of them!" and then I went on my helmet and ran over my house that hit my head on blunt objects and sharp corners. Because the constant, annual pain and suffering caused by just one or two "talent" -births run out is just not enough. We need another. And not just someone - "THE" One. The one with slightly less attractive participants with slightly less talent. One with slightly less of a point, although it is difficult to imagine a scenario where it is possible. The one with useless footage of the participants when they are not acting is included. Because I care what Johnny Sings-a-lot does in his off-hours! I really do! Now you can think "Hey! On the whole continent of North America, less than 4 million people watched the first episode. That doesn't mean this show sucks?" Well, I say fewer than 4 million people in North America have syphilis, so sometimes low numbers bring good news now they don't. Think about it. <br /> <br /> Eventually, The One can be terribly unoriginal, a show that even the air network can't be bothered to promote, as they also realize how absolutely worthless it is, but it's still not syphilis ! Yay!
