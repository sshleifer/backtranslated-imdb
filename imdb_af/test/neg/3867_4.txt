Well ... there were some big, creamy, smooth faces by Marlene, along with her "shocking" sex supplies (plus her unmade "transmogrification" from monkey to man); but generally, the generally unconvincing plot and dated acting - not to mention the less than engaging songs coming from me. Dietrich's "baritone" voice doesn't come, little to ensure Blonde Venus is a permanent place in my mind's Pantheon or Memorable Movies. Cary Grant - still in childhood fever - seemed to be eternal to find him. While Herbert Marshall was probably never anything else, but Herbert Marshall from the day of his birth to the day he died. Of course, from a historical point of view, Blonde Venus was nice to watch, as long as one could make a big expectation.
