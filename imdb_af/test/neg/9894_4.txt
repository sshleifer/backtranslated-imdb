The Texas Revolution from 1835 to 1836, including the advance and immediate periods, is depicted in this mediocre 3-hour television for television, the only salvage of which brings light and tribute to Stephen F. Austin, the so-called - named "Father of Texas" whose life story has long been overshadowed by that of legendary Sam Houston. The rest of the movie is simply the usual "Santa Anna is a tyrant" story and with a poor attempt to show the Mexican perspective with a fictitious Spanish character showing stereotypical Latin machismo. Combined with short low-budget combat scenes, such as the Alamao and San Jacinto, this movie is only recommended for real history buffs not coming from Mexico. The Mexican uniforms look to them accurately and the romantic subplot (another love triangle) does not take up too much screen time. Overall, this movie shows the violent secretion movement by Texas's Anglo-Saxon racial minority to be a positive and only revolution against the Mexican tyranny, such as by General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, the so-called "Napoleon of the West", personalized.
