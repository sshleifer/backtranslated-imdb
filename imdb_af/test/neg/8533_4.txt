This movie has all the ingredients of a great horror story and lost it in the last half. Little movies can actually give me chills. This one did. Little horror movie gives me a sense of fear. This one did. It guessed me. I care about the story. I care about the characters. The acting was decent. Unfortunately, about halfway through the movie, the story just doesn't have very good directions. It becomes clear that everything cool about the plot goes self-destructively. Do this. That builds in the first half as a big horror concept shifted away from horror and to the absurd. An observable fear turns into a series of impeccable reactions from the characters. The story ends with disappointment. While this movie looks, there is one loose end that can set up for a successor. The movie is not good enough for a successor. This movie is worth seeing in the theater, but don't expect to be surprised. It is best suited as a movie to rent. This is probably not a movie you want to own.
