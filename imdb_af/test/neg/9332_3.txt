Mostly unfinished biblical mumbo jumbo that attracts more than two hours. The only thing that keeps this film of God's wreath (and there is only one God, remember) is the unintentional funny dialogue, and a good battle scene that comes too late in the movie. For most of the two hours until the action scenes are too much talk; The dialogue is so clumsy that the movie is only attempted by MST3K. <br /> <br /> George Sanders is absolutely horrible; one of the most animated, excessive theater performances I've ever seen. Brynner is not much better; his stiff woodwork, combined with the horrible fortune-cookie wisdom props, make for a pretty boring and stupid Solomon. It seems that Brynner opens his mouth every now and again, so wise and ridiculously high and powerful, come out. To some extent, it is not Sanders and Brynner's fault, due to the crappy, comic dialogue and the typical Biblical one-dimensional characterization, but they did little effort. Brynner's accent even reminds a bit of Schwarzenegger's; this is not a plus. Only Lollobrigida controls herself by playing the role with more conviction and in a proper way that plays a role in such a silly movie. Describing these biblical characters as one-dimensional will also give them unworthy credit; the characterization is semi-dimensional.
