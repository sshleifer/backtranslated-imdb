I have never heard of Dead Man's Bounty when I saw the DVD store a few weeks ago, and I thought I had stumbled upon an unrecognizable jewel as it had Val Kilmer in a truly unique role. Unfortunately, it wasn't more than ten or fifteen minutes in the movie I realized, it's a disaster of epic relationships. The first clue you will see how truly horrible this movie is is near the beginning, if you have a lot of dirt bags in an old salon, like a lot of hyenas in a scene that lasts about five times too long. It's amazing how bad it is. And sorry, it doesn't get any better. <br /> <br /> Val Kilmer is featured prominently on the film's cover box, perhaps to trick you into thinking that it has a role in the film, but unfortunately its bizarre role as a dead man is overlooked in favor of a bunch of half-white crooks and the most unclear conceptualization of a unique city custodian I've ever seen in a movie. He is played by Boguslaw Linda, who is unable or unwilling to cover his Polish accent. It immediately makes it impossible for the film to take place in the American West. <br /> <br /> Did Poland have this kind of frontier? I do not know. My knowledge of Polish history is not my strong point, but I can tell you. The Sheriff, as he is known in the movie, is the worst representation of law enforcement I can ever remember seeing in a movie. He is introduced to a truly ridiculous scene where he wears a kind of blindfold and a room full of men turns face to face. Before they start hitting him, he explains that they can beat each one of them once, and then, after the first round, they will hit each one again. If he can identify who throws the push, they lose. What the hell is this crap? I'm totally at a loss to explain why a scene like this would ever happen in any movie. <br /> <br /> During the film, the Sheriff continues to be beaten and bruised and drunk and abused until finally he does nothing but sometimes appears on the screen and mumbles "not? the law?" You see, there is a lot of talk and preparation for a hangover, whose details are as meaningless as the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> It happens casually in a town that consists of nothing more than two ramshackle wood buildings that protrude over a flattened piece of dirt that is more of a road path. My understanding is that it is part of Poland that should seem acceptable enough to the American southwest, where none of the characters, except perhaps the dead man, might come from. <br /> <br /> I heard that Val Kilmer took the role of being inspired by his unique role, and also by director Uklanski's minimal dialogue use in favor of relying on the cleverly placed images of images in unique visual settings. <br /> <br /> Whatever. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that Kilimer couldn't overcome what the real satisfying feeling he needed to get when he was offered the role. Personally, I would really feel that I had achieved some success if someone approached me and probably offered me a few hundred thousand dollars to stay quiet. I like to think he hasn't even read the writing for this mess because if he did, I'm on a total loss to understand why he accepted the role. <br /> <br /> Anyway, open the movie With a man bringing in the body of a man played by Kilmer, seeking the reward. Soon he finds himself in a ridiculous love story involving the town prostitute, the alcoholic sheriff, and much of the chaos with a series of dumb, stupid characters. <br /> <br /> There is also an extensive and ongoing lack of understanding of American rituals. In one scene, a man cuts a cherry tomato in half and squeezes the halves into Kilmer's eyes (for whatever reason I can't imagine), and later a man makes a brief speech on Kilmer's body, in which he explain He was one of the best men we ever had, and then he went off with a spade. What the hell? <br /> <br /> Not yet convinced? Here are some other reasons not to see it. In one scene, the Sheriff looks like the ash covered, except for the perfectly clean areas around his eyes and which can only be described as bright red lipstick. A man gets a head wound that soothes his head and body in blood. In a fool he makes it with powder. Smart. By the end, it seems that the Sheriff has a broken arm. He sits at the bar, puts a rope around his neck and attaches it to his injured arm and uses his good arm to pull the rope and lift his shrubbery in his bad arm to his mouth rather than his good arm to use. to drink. Also smart. <br /> <br /> Why doesn't he just use his good arm? I have no idea. This, like everything in the movie, doesn't make sense, like the title. Summer love? Are you joking? Avoid this mess at all costs. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, there is something for the IMDb Goofs page ?? <br /> <br /> Mistakes made by characters (possibly deliberate mistakes by the filmmakers): This movie was made. HA!
