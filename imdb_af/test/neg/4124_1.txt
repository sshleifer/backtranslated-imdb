In a nutshell, this movie is over, it's so bad. In short, this movie is about a weapon factory where secret weapons are being developed. Because they are doing bad things, they are not so popular. A new female CEO comes in to fix things, and makes sure the reputation of the company is improved. She does this by giving leaking company confidential information to the press. Do you believe this? Furthermore, she began to dismiss people she had never seen before. Incredible uh? A Pacific group is trying to destroy the company's mainframe, as there is the blueprint of those secret weapons. This main frame is located in the bottom of the building in a kind of safe. Of course, the movie won't be complete without the crazy scientist and a robot that is the ultimate killer machine, which looks like an Alien movie from the Alien movies. The mad scientist likes the female CEO. <br /> <br /> The mad scientist commands the robot to kill everyone, and so protects his work, rises in command chain and makes the movie interesting. The pacifists team up with the chief executive officer and another person from the board to escape the robot. Beyond the line, they agree to blow up this evil computer mainframe while avoiding the robot. They also discovered that the factory developed a part-man, part-machine soldier. They can erase a person's memory and replace it with a veteran soldier's one. One of the pacifists is converted into such a soldier and will hunt the murderer robot. I think the crazy scientist also wrote the script of this movie. This super soldier looks and does much the same as Robocop, but not so funny. <br /> <br /> It comes down to that. People who run, are chased by a killer robot, are hurt by it, but it doesn't look that hard, except for a bit of a whine, and of course the female general manager is the main character of this movie, and can't be killed ie survive every attack, explosion, you call it. I will not bother you by the rush, let us strike to the end. They have lots of weapons, yes the pacifist and they know how to use it. If they are on the roof of the building, they all lay weapons on the murderer robot. They walk into an elevator that is used to clean outside windows. And then the female CEO also knows some magic, on the roof she complained that they were not bullets, and like the magic, the gun was reloaded. In this way she can shoot the cables and drop the elevator 70 floors and stop it right above the ground surface by pulling the brake. And to do all this, the police are waiting for them. The robot jumps to them and kills the police. Hilarious no? The robot chases them in the safe where the main frame is and when the robot is so close to her that he can touch / kill her, stop it. Because the mad scientist didn't want to kill her. A better name for this man would be the idiot scientist. Although he is the one who made this movie watchful. Right now, I've been pulling the killer robot to finish them all, so the movie ends. <br /> <br /> I can't believe this movie is so high, so I wrote this comment. Avoid this movie like the plague. It's a monster, and I'm not talking about the Dead Machine.
