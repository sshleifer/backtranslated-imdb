OK, so I have to start this review by saying I really expected to watch this movie for months, I used to watch his trailer and think it looked really cool .... little did I know the only cool thing about this cliché-driven turd was exactly the trailer. <br /> <br /> At the movie I watched the first 3 frames of this movie and although for myself "no way to be this movie, don't be an idiot, give it a chance! You only saw 3 minutes, "while letting my eyes roll in shame. All the frames showed .... get it .... a man with a poker face (because he feels nothing ... it's deep) looks straight at the camera in the middle of the frame. In the second or third he stays awake in his perfect bed (because he sleeps like a dead guy ... because he feels nothing) and his father calls and says, "John Garden State, I'm your dad." o come on! I saw a little more than a few movies to hate clothes like the "I'm yours (add parent)", how about hell, I have to respond? "Oh, he has a difficult relationship with him" .... Uh .... yes, that's exactly how I'm supposed to respond. <br /> <br /> Man, this is a crappy movie ... <br /> <br /> Anywho, as the movie goes on, teaches us about his friends, all of whom have an ALTERNATIVE EMO WALKING INDIE MOVIE CLICHÉ is. For example, one of his acquaintances is a guy who works in a medieval themed restaurant that Klingon speaks (Bizarre characters + Pop culture = Your standard American indie movie). Then we know Natalie Portman's character, which is a copy of Alissa Jones (from a movie that kicks GS's butt, Chasing Amy), Amelie and the chick of Eternal Sunshine ... you know, cleverly, original (not really not) beautiful and ... in touch with her sexuality (!). She listens to a 70-year-old band called The Shins and gives ... what? they are of this damn decade ?? Then why does it sound like that? Oh, they have no personality, OK ..... so she handles her CD player to the John Garden State and he looks at her with a silly face (you know, love). As the song played, I heard his lyrics and said, "You will love this soundtrack, it is so alternative and cool. You will love this movie, it will define you and your gender, even if it is an ideological photocopy of The Breakfast Club, Ghost World and every other smart teen movie of the past 20 years, you will drink coffee and read books that you do not understand. "<br /> <br /> By now, original sh! T. ... he doesn't care if he dies in an airplane accident (because he's already dead ... and he doesn't feel anything) and he lets us know in a scene idea straight from an unknown movie called FIGHT CLUB is coming! !!, this is a cool scene, but, oh, I mentioned that it appeared in the trailer ....... then in a party, and just when you think this guy is really deep and unhealthy, he makes with a bimbo .... so oh, he is not such an emotional zombie. clever character development or just a movie !? Well, we can analyze the scene, it puts it in motion. a coup ch with everyone else moving in really fast speed ...... scene idea straight from an unknown movie called REQUIEM FROM A DREAM! ...... so just a sh! tty, sh! tty movie ... <br /> <br /> Then they meet more eccentric (cliché, actually) characters, and finally one who lives next to a big hole in the ground. John Garden State says a bit like good luck investigating your infinite abyss and the man says .... and now I really wanted to "You too" ............. And then we are gently told that Neo Jesus is ... no, wait, it's from another stupid, obvious, repetitive, overestimated and cliché piece of crap. Finally (finally !!!!), A little more shit happens and he enters the huge warehouse confidence to defuse the bombs: he must speak to his dad he hasn't seen in the last seventy years because he ( FINALLY COOL SPOILERS) killed his own mother. .. (you see, he killed his mother, so he is also dead ....... and feels nothing ... it's deep). Now I really expect that I will only have smart and moving Magnolia-like dialogue between a father and a boy ...... but it's Garden State, so it's pretty much it: -John Garden State: Father , I forgive you, you do not know what you did when you dived me for a thousand years, but I know you love me. Director's dad: No !!! No !!!! I'm going to say a few simple things, because I'm not so deep in character anyway, like this whole movie, so no! -John Garden State: No dad, we have to get together because we are equal individuals ... I mean different individuals. - Roads director's father: No !!!!! No !!!! ............ OK, you have convinced me. <br /> <br /> And he gets the girl (because he's no longer dead, you know) and ends the movie and I'm going to eat a piece of chicken that makes my day. <br /> <br /> This made up movie sucks
