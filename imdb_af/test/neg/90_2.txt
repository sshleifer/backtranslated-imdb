The only reason this movie is not given a 1 (terrible) voice is that the performances of both Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan are excellent. Ida Lupino, who loves, is increasingly upset as she tries several ways to get rid of her. Robert Ryan is frightening as the imminent alien whose character, which is led only by his disturbed thoughts, changes from one minute to the next. Without simple and comfortable he suddenly becomes clever and threatening. Me. Lupino's character was more at risk from the house she lived in and her own stupidity than by anyone who went along. She couldn't get out of her house: windows didn't open, both front and back doors locked and unlocked with a key from the inside. You couldn't have designed a worse fire trap if you tried. She did not take the precaution to have another extra key. Also, she can't figure out how to call on help from neighboring neighbors or get out of her own cellar while being locked up inside and outside his boyfriend. I don't know how war her husband was murdered, but if it was World War II, the furniture in her house, the style of the clothes, especially the kids and the motor vehicle's car, is clearly anachronistic. I recommend watching this movie just to see what peculiarities you can find.
