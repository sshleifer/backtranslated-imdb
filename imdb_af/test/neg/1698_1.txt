The most annoying thing about "Dies d'agost" (August Days) is not just that nothing happens in this movie, but director Marc Recha has the nerve to pretend that this film is a kind of tribute to the left Catalan journalist Ramon Barnils is. Unless Barnils's name is mentioned a few times, is a "homage", this incident is a total fraud. You will learn almost nothing about Barnils in this film or about the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) or about the special role of Catalunya in that war. You will also not learn about the collective punishment given to the heroic Catalan people by the victorious and avenging Franco years ago. <br /> <br /> Of course, the footage of the Catalan countryside is very beautiful, but "Dies d 'agost" does not have an extensive and varied collection of such scenes to qualify as a travel book. what is shown - for example, not many illuminated images of the forest floor - is the clearest indication of the scarcity of ideas here, the aimless drive of brothers Marc and David during their combat tourism does not provide compelling theater, on the contrary, the strongest impression is made of a movie by and for vast, middle-aged hippies, don't waste your time, rather read a good book about the Spanish Civil War (I recommend Felix Morrow's villain anti-Stalinist "Revolution and Counter Revolution in Spain" , containing a gripping version of the Barcelona uprising of 1937.)
