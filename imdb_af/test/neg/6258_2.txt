This movie was one of those movies where it totally misled me to think it was a cheesy 80's bumper, based on the cover, but it wasn't. It was probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The picture on the cover did not match any part or scene in the movie; In fact, it didn't involve a chain saw. Not even the tagline fits the movie. The film is about a group of cheerleaders and two pots escaping to an abandoned cabin, in the cold forests, for a weekend outing. But things get extra cold when they are murdered by an unknown killer. At the same time, the local sheriff's department is looking for a dangerous killer. I mention the problems in a list. <br /> <br /> 1. The Acting. Boy, it was cheap and terribly bad. It felt unnatural and it thought it was written a lot. None of the actors seemed to have tried with good intentions and therefore they were stupid and tired. There was bad action by all the characters in the movie, so I won't point out specific people, but I say the stoners have done a horrible job as well as the police and the cheerleaders who are not a surprise. br /> <br /> 2. The storyline. This story created a perfect storyline for good cute butterflies, but instead they peppered it with plot holes, useless and unnecessary scenes and an overall stupid story. There were huge plot holes, including how the killer killed the last victim so quickly and yet was in the group of girls when it happened? The ex-con served virtually nothing in the movie, except that it was a useless plot device. There was random and unnecessary sex and nudity sprinkled throughout, even for a b-movie or my taste it was a bit too much. As far as the killer's intentions are concerned, just say it's stupid and it doesn't make sense for him / her to kill young girls. Plus, there were also some very predictable deadly ones I saw about 30 miles away. <br /> <br /> 3. The technical side. The lighting was okay, it was definitely not the worse lighting I saw in a movie, but there were points where it had to be dark, but it looked more like the afternoon. The house looks darker with the lights on, then with the lights off. The camera work was average, it didn't have good solid shots or amazing pans or zoom. Thinking it did the job is a bit of tension with its estimate. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie, in The sense of plot, character development and performance was a great disappointment and a waste of time. What I thought would have been a great movie, and one of the worse movies I've ever seen. The play was really bad and wood, there was hardly any sense in the plot and there was no emotion for this movie. However, the technical aspect of this movie saved me, because if the camera was working or the lighting was bad, I would have turned off the DVD player and pressed it into something else. I would recommend this movie to those who really enjoy cute b-movies, as well as those who follow cult classics, because this movie is definitely. I would recommend this movie in part for those who use bracts from the 80's. But for me this movie was pitiful and horrible.
