If there was ever a movie that could be considered a missed opportunity, the movie is Galaxina. What could be wrong to base a scientific film around a sexy static female android? Certainly, such a movie can never be a total waste of time? Well, unfortunately, this movie is pretty close to useless. There are a number of errors with this production, but it must be said. However, there are two basic problems that completely destroy the business. First of all, it is a comedy with no funny pieces, or at least a film where the potentially amusing aspects are presented in an incredibly unpleasant way. Secondly, the title character is badly used. This could be because Dorothy Stratten was not really an actress, but if it was, it was a terrible decision, as she is still easily the best of the movie. I don't think she really needs to be a good thespian to take out the role of a sexy android to be perfectly honest. Anyway, what we were left with is a whole lot of imaginative comedy relief, which often consists of hopeless spoof-type gags from the great sci-fi hits of the time such as Alien, Star Wars and 2001. It's bad written and not funny at all, and it doesn't even have a plot to produce things. The story is basically about a police room cruiser sent to get a rock. That's it! Steven Spielberg once said that a high concept film is one whose plot line can be described in one sentence. What he didn't define was what you call a movie that can be described in less than a sentence. It doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> It has seen me as a sure burner, but it failed. It was an attempt to spoof Star Wars and combine it with adult comedy situations. All it actually achieved is to leave you cold and a little irritated that it wasn't close to what it should have been. It's not a barbarella for the 80's. <br /> <br /> Soon after this movie is finished, Dorothy Stratten was murdered in a terrible and horrific way. And therefore, Galaxina gained a considerable amount of his cultural interest. I just think it's a great shame that Dorothy didn't have a better movie to die for.
