This movie has some of the worst plays I've ever seen. Dennis Quaid's performance was high school caliber. Although it's hard to portray an out-of-the-wall character like Jerry Lee Lewis, it can be done. Just ask Jamie Foxx (though Ray Charles had deep in his personality and musicality than Lewis ever dreamed to own). The Phillips Brillers depiction was in The Dukes of Hazzard, and Alec Baldwin who plays Jimmy Swaggart is like Donald Duck performing Shakespeare. When Robert Duvall played a land preacher, I bought it. Baldwin never made me believe a single word. Wynona Ryder's part was the best, and she was mediocre. (And can anyone figure out how she was 13 when Lewis met her and another 13 more than a year later?) Some tests on the internet show that the key facts presented by the movie are at least no more polluted than the Most Hollywood doesn't have bio photos. This movie did badly at the box office, and it had to.
