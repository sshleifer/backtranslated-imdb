Someone remembers the first CKY, CKY2K, etc.? Back when it comes to making crazy things, rather than looking at Bam Margera, like a douchebag, spoiled 5-year-old, super / rock-star wannabe. <br /> <br /> The show was cute, but Bam's fame and wealth led him to believe that we are now enjoying being childish and idiotic, more than real cool stuff that used to be. CKY2K. <br /> <br /> The acts are so repetitive, there is nothing like nothing new, except annoying stupidity and repetitive remarks. The only thing we see is Bam Margera, so busy showing us how he doesn't care. , how much money he or she has. <br /> <br /> I really have nothing more to say except, give us back CKY2K, let Bam suck. <br /> <br /> I enjoy Steve-o, Knoxville etc. a thousand times more.
