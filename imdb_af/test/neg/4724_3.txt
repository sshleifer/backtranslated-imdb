This movie was a Mexican horror movie of the late 60's. It's not that good, but really not that bad. There is a lot of shock and it is very heavy with nudity and violence, but it did have a plot and at least tried to keep it (even though the plot inspired the same damn Frankenstein.) Don't be in God's domain. There was some stuffing in the female wrestling, but it was made in Mexico and wrestling seems popular in Mexico. <br /> <br /> The plot is that a doctor wants to save his son, who go out of leukemia, the other doctors gave no hope for the poor guy, but daddy has the idea of ​​transferring a gorilla's heart to his son to save his life (I don't know, I'm a lawyer a doctor) The transplant works, but sonny-boy ends up with a male monkey who terrorizes nude women and kills anyone coming in. There is also a subplot involving a policeman and his girlfriend who wrestles is (it didn't really add too much, but if they wanted to throw some masked female wrestlers, it's a good reason to do it a). <br /> <br /> The movie was cheap but not bad for a b-movie of the day. The plot was basically just recycled and there were a few things that weren't so well-tied. However, this movie is in its own way (I don't know why, perhaps because it is a Mexican horror movie and falls into my normal bad movie diet). I think it may be because it's a mix and a bit of some very strange stuff. <br /> <br /> See if you want stockings of foreign films, nudity and female wrestlers.
