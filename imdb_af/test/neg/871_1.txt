This movie is the final straw. As two dedicated fans of the romantic comedy, this movie finally realized that nothing came from this genre since Love Actually. There was nothing good about the movie. It was an insult to love, death and everything in between. Including horses and beaches. There was absolutely no chemistry between the characters. This movie took the spark from Nicholas Sparks. Diane Lane can't help saving her life. She was unconvincing in her laughter, crying and dancing. And she needs a better cut. There is no reason to watch this movie. Save yourself. The romantic comedy is officially dead.
