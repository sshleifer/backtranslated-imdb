Ten years ago I really wanted to see this movie at the theater. But I missed it, and then forget it. Oh, son, I'm glad this movie didn't return my teens. <br /> <br /> I saw it yesterday and it has to be serious among the 10 worst movies ever made. And I'm talking about movies that had too much attention, such as the wonderful trailers on TV, and spent too much money on actors and making the movie. <br /> <br /> The writing sucks and the acting struggles even worse, should I say more? <br /> <br /> Please, Hollywood, NO MORE ARNOLD !!
