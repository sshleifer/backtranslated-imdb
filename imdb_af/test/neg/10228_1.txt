How many movies are there to be against all ODDS, a RAGTAG team hitting the big guys with all the money? !!!!!!!! There is nothing new in "The Big Green". If you want something, you want them to lose. Steve Guttenberg had such a good resumption ("The Boys from Brazil", "Police Academy", "Cocoon"). Why, OH WHY, did he have to do these kind of movies during the 1990s and beyond?! So, just avoid this movie. There are many good movies out there, so there's no reason to waste your time and money on this litter. Obviously the "green" on their minds was money because here is no creativity. At least the past few years, Disney has produced some smart movies with Pixar.
