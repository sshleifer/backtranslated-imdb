A few words for the people here in Germen's cine club: The worst crazy ever in this honorable theater. A very bad script, a lot of bad actors, and a very bad movie. Don't waste your time watching this movie, see the very good "mutantes verdes fritos anarquia radioactive", or any movie is well commented on. Say no more.
