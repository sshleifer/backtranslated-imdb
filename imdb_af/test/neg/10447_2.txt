I was tempted to watch Shark Hunter by commenting on IMDB. The movie was bad, but the shark was cool blah blah blah. So I rented it. Bad idea. This movie was bad on so many levels that I was glad I had the option to move forward. The shark itself is ok. Its appearance is decent and it's the only thing to save this movie from a 1, (I have a 2). The acting is incredibly bad and the dialogue is just as regrettable. I didn't expect much, but I was constantly surprised by this suckfest. Antonio Sabato Jr. is a kind of biologist or scientist or something, I didn't really pay attention. He goes off with the exhausted crew of this submarine to find out what happened to this underwater station that obviously pulled the shark out. By the way, all the scenes that someone shows that works underwater is not underwater. First of all, if they are just going to find out what happened to this station, what about all the great calming arrows and the harpoons and stuff. Are these things you normally carry with you when investigating an accident. The shark theory was advanced by Antonio while on the move, so it was not that they went to know what they opposed. Antonio and this young college student, horrible actress en route, just jumps to the sub control when the sub is in trouble. What's the matter? Unless everyone gets some kind of training before leaving high school, I find it a bit stupid. The director seems to think that if crew members work in the background, it is a good idea to weld someone in the background. Metal artwork is very important if you think of a sub. Anyway, I can go on, but I've said too much. Bottom Line: Go to your local video store, rent this video and then destroy it. Then email IMDB to remove all record of this movie from their site. All memory and evidence of this movie must be destroyed. We can do this if we work together.
