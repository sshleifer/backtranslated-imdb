Awful Star Wars knock-off with slightly more comical stuff. Robert Urich dies as the leader of a group of ice pirates, who steal ice, because water is now the most valuable substance in the universe (how all poor people live is a mystery). He hangs with Mary Crosby (Bing's daughter, about 25 and a total boyfriend), a princess looking for her missing father. Also in the film, Anjelica Huston is embarrassed by some hilarious sci-fi action and a spicy, short-ish Ron Perlman (which I thought was seven meters high of his other roles!). And John Carradine, who looks dead days and Hollywood Squares funnyman (relative term) Bruce Vilanch. If you ever wanted to see Bruce Vilanch get caught up, here's your movie. But then it's also not worth seeing as it didn't shut him at all (think he could have been a robot, but I snapped several times).
