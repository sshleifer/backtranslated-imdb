If you're ever in the mood for a really horrible movie, it will be hard to find something that can even be compared to it. I spent a lot of time watching very horrible movies just for the sheer joy I get from it, and man, it's one of the worst. This movie was so bad, I had to buy the third Beastermaster online. That one wasn't that bad, it's amazing because it was straight to video. It's one of those movies that is hard to understand how it's made in the first place. I mean, someone had actually read the script (or many scripts, I'm sure they made several concepts) and said, "Yes, that's it. Here's a little money." Actually, they were probably just trying to make a Beastmaster 2 before even having a script, and then with everything they had. Oh, terrible. So, if you're a fan of really bad movies, look at this one. It's a real classic, and the movie doesn't get much worse than that. And if it does, please let me know.
