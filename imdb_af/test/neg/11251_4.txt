The plot involves a new, hipper franchise barber shop moving across the street from Calvin's hairdresser. He therefore feels that he needs to change and improve his shop by getting newer things. Sounds really exciting huh. Regarding the rest of the film, much of the material involves the first film. The people who work at Calvin are standing around talking loudly and to each other and the customers. Cedric the Entertainer was once again extremely funny, but it is more like doing an uphill routine than doing anything about the movie. And Calvin is faced with another moral issue involving a large amount of money. He has already shown that he will eventually do the right thing. <br /> <br /> FINAL THICKNESS: Nothing new. I don't recommend it unless you thought the first barbershop was the best thing since sliced ​​bread.
