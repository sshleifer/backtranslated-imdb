Man I loved Ocean's 11. <br /> <br /> Slim movie. All eleven characters were of the utmost importance to the elevator, as each one had their own specialized skills needed to draw from the grand finale. <br /> <br /> What on Earth were Oceans 12? What was the purpose of the twelfth person? I suppose it's supposed to be Zeta-Jones, but she wasn't really part of the 11 if she was trying to pull them up and work against them the whole movie ?? It was more like the story of Brad and Zeta-Jones's characters boring relationship with a few bits of the original movie that was thrown in to just get bombs on the seats to see the movie. <br /> <br /> With O-11, the gang was always a step ahead of Benedict (Garcia). They were always able to suffocate him. What happened here? He took them to a hint and suddenly they were all wusses? The whole movie is such that they increased the money they had stolen, plus interest to pay Benedict back for the lift they pulled on him 3 years ago. So next film will they develop courage and brain again and get him back to pay him back for the first lift? Puh lease ... <br /> <br /> This movie could be reached with only Brad Pitt, Zeta-Jones and 5 minutes from Matt Damon for the switcheroo scene. <br /> <br /> Slow moving movie, not the energy of the first one. I tried hard to enjoy it and I am usually very easy to please, but I'm really disappointed. <br /> <br /> SPOILER !!! The turn - the whole movie doesn't have to be made, since the real elevator did everything you saw in the last 2 hours. <br /> <br /> END SPOILER. <br /> <br /> Wait for it to come on TV or if you're a fan of the original from 2001, don't look.
