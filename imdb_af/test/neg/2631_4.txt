I caught this supposed "horror" movie late on Friday night, I wish I was going to sleep! Tell me. Is a 3 m high raincoat-clad twirp on a gurly bike that is supposed to convey some kind of fear? Not here, but Mi-low can still beat the shit out of the waiter (Antonio Fargas) who is three times his size (?) Uh-Huh. And the end is so sad ... It just leaves you with nothing to go on what-so-ever! I asked myself, "Is this it ???" <br /> <br /> The action is about as good as it gets in a low-budget movie. The said Fargas deliver a decent performance; but it is my conclusion that Jennifer Jostyn may be one of the worse actresses ever in Tinsel Town! Certainly, cute face, but bad scene. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1
