It must be one of the best horror movies. Charles Band made the best film of 96 'in this little-looking jewel. Very realistic and incredibly styled - with a visual flair, David Fincher, will be jealous, and it is not difficult to see why Band continued to make such classics as "Killjoy 2: Deliverance From Evil," "The Regina Pierce Affair ',' Virgins of Sherwood Forest 'and' Timegate: Tales of the Saddle Tramps'. <br /> <br /> With a highly sophisticated story - a small body with a big head controls a family of weirdos performing experiments on naked women, this movie can be a bit too much for younger viewers and is just for the most educated kind of viewer, but for those who see it, Band can convey subtle messages about the human condition through his masterpiece. The head is symbolic of the lost love and longs for the inner self that we all have to face at some point, and so I could get involved with this film on a very personal level. Although many former critics compared the film of Re-animator and other small works, it stands upside down. It is prettier, but not pointless. The gore in this movie was made good and used to enhance the storyline, rather than just getting a cheap scream from the audience. Also, the special effects in this movie are absolutely top notch, easily the best work done in a horror movie since ... well ... ever! The work in this film makes Savini's effects look like the work of a blind, cowardly oboe. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have with this movie is the abundant amounts of full frontal nudity, which was ultimately unnecessary to reach the composer's goal - to create a timeless epic that lasts forever in history would fall as possible the greatest movie of all time. If it wasn't for this little problem, I would have given this movie a perfect 10.
