From all Perry Mason movies to 1985, I have seen, this one is my least favorite. <br /> <br /> I confess I never had Diana Muldaur as an actress. She just wants to know how to play one kind of character - a hard-hired career woman with a few unlimited slides on her shoulder, which is extremely difficult to sympathize with in any way. This one is no exception. This is true to form. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the only thing that saves this movie is a serious performance by Scott Baio as the prosecutor. to win, and the movie is worth seeing.
