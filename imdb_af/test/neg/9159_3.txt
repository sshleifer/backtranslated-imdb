I honestly thought this movie would be cheese, though I kept Alvin and the Chipmunks for a long time! I was very wrong. THIS WAS WONDERFUL !!! This is the best movie I've seen since October! According to me, this is the movie that everyone should see this holiday season! Enchanted (I thought anyway ...) was terrible, The Golden Compass was good, but the end was rather scary to its Dark Materials fans, and I'm Legend, but I haven't seen it yet (or National Treasures 2) but it looks good. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to give away anything, but this movie is perfect for everyone, especially kids!
