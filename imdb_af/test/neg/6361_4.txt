In fact, the first two Critters movie was stupid, but in a good and entertaining way. This movie is much more of a B movie, it's stupid, but for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> This is the first sequel that doesn't really follow the plot of the first two movies. Basically all the characters are new and this time there are no bounty hunters. Well, as good as nothing, since the bounty hunter appears in this movie) and of course the budget for this one went down again. To save even more costs, the movie shot back with part 4, which I will be just as bad as it follows directly on this movie and made by the same people involved in this one. <Br /> <br /> It's just a typical B genre movie, which doesn't really have originality in it or brings entertainment. This makes "Critters 3" a real redundant successor, you can do it easily without. Granted that things could have been much worse for this movie, but it's not just a good one. The movie just falls flat like a science fiction / horror / comedy. <br /> <br /> Also strange to see how the Critters suddenly changed in this one. This time they have about twice their regular size, without explaining it and they are even more Gremlins as in this movie than in the previous one. <br /> <br /> The movie is just interesting because it was Leonardo DiCaprio's film debut. He was about 17 in this movie and of course looks at baby's face as he still does. I like to watch these famous actors in their early roles. It's fun to see how they act and if their style has improved and changed over the years. Of course DiCaprio just got better, but he was already delivering his lines the same way he does today. <br /> <br /> Really a stupid and lame movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
