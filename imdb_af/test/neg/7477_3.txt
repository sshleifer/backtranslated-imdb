Perhaps the best part of the show is that it's right after Conan O'Brien and Late Night's fans suddenly look unsuspecting at Carson's performance. Carson Daly can't hold a candle to Leno, Letterman, O'Brien or any other late-night talk show host, and Last Call looks more than missing out on this hit and missing out on the genre. The only thing that delivers quality is that it is so short. But I won't call it. Carson Daly is sincere and does not hide the fact that his performance is not large (honesty is helpful), while some of Last Call's sketches and material are apparently stolen, they still find the point. In fact, some of Carson's montages were quite entertaining, and the sketch sometimes had their moments of decent comedy. <br /> <br /> As an interviewer, Carson is okay, even with just one guest, not exactly last night's stuff, but still reaching above the level through a high school AV team. However, he doesn't have the quick white that Conan makes so hilarious. I don't like his musical guests, but it's more because I'm not a fan of that kind of music. I don't like it. <br /> <br /> At home band. I don't know Joe Firstmans band and won't compare it to the CBS band, the Tonite Show Band with Kevin Eubanks or the Max Weinberg 7. Even Cleeto and the Cleetones are better. But, Firstmans teammates still do the show in my opinion. Especially the Alto Sax player that sometimes pops up (he has long dark hair and sunglasses and always plays in the upper register), anything, watch the show for him. <br /> <br /> In summary, this show is not even worth getting a full kibble bag. But it does have an audience and appeals more to the younger "mtv generation". If you do not have a cable and are at 1:37, there really is not much more to choose from, and surprise surprise, there is worse in that timeframe. So, if you're waiting for Poker After Dark to continue, 30 minutes of Last Call will not kill you during the wait.
