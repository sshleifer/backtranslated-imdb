The only thing I expected this movie to have was an intelligent motorcycle. <br /> <br /> This movie is just awful. I gave it a star, which of course means I really enjoyed it. Bad acting, bad writing, bad direction, bad fight choreography. The only true actor in this movie is Martin Landau, who does a great job of playing the villain, though the characters are your usual cardboard cutout. Even the so-called "plot twist" at the end was no shock. <br /> <br /> Enjoying this movie was so much fun, I really enjoyed it. And it had some impressive car wrecks. <br /> <br /> Like bad movies? Look at this one, ouch. Want a good movie? Not here.
