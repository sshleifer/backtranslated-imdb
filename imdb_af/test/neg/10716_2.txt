Can't Liberals like Alec Baldwin get it through their heads to lose the 2000 and 2004 elections? The ridiculous. Lame swipes at WalMart, non-union workers, George W. Bush and the stock market not to mention the prospective GWB accent that uses Balwin's character in the movie, just make him foolish and bitter on the screen. As the credit roll continues the acid grapes as "Special Thanks", Ken Lay and other CEOs of Enron, Tyco, WorldCom and IMClone are given. Let me guide you to something - if you put all your money in one company's stock, you're an idiot. We do not need this excuse for a movie to tell us. What a waste of Jim Carrey's talent - from the trailer I expected a completely different movie - what I got was a 90 minute DNC brand about how to scare people not to invest for their own future , keep them stupid and keep them dependent on the government. No wonder Hollywood is in trouble and can no longer make a decent movie. Maybe your parents can get an original idea and put it on the screen once. Although I shouldn't be surprised as Jane Fonda was thrown into the original.
