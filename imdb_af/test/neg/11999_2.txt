Ladies and gentlemen, let's introduce you? The Toltecs! This ancient Latin American tribe, even before the Aztecs, presumably had the most malicious and bloodthirsty magicians, but they got their asses floozies flogged by a few and a hundred and seven-year-old lawyer beaten be! But before you see it, you have to struggle with more than 40 minutes of boring boredom, baby games and messy rows that don't contain any real sleaze. If I haven't quite made myself clear: "The Dark Power" is an indescribable and turbulent 80-year-old horror jacket that is still entertaining due to its sheer and somewhat charming stupidity factor. Author / director Phil Smoot's intentions were of course admirable, but he ?? as well as the rest of the cast & crew ?? lack of talent and financial means to give something that is even half decent. Smoot watched "The Evil Dead" and other similar demonic theme movies, and somehow he had to think he could do it. The movie opens with an old Indian guy who dies in his isolated rural house; hardly speaks his last word above a whisper ?? Toltecs. His grandson quickly rents home to a lot of college chicks, including a typical 80's aerobics babe, a cute black girl and a racist red-haired girl. Soon they will discover why the old Indian lived like an hermit, because he was actually the guardian of an old Toltec cemetery. Toltec wizards buried themselves alive, appearing only thousands of years later and feeding on the flesh of the living. And, honestly, is there a better tasting meat than that of bimbos? As indicated earlier, the first half of "The Dark Power" is terribly lame and sleep-inducing. The clich√©d pranks, the delayed dialogues and the ridiculous oblong footage of Lash LaRue swinging around his whip seem to be on forever. Then the movie loses its last smithy of credibility when the Toltec wizards come out of the ground. Instead of threatening, they look like hard rocks with uncomfortable masks and drunken gestures. Exactly ONE greedy moment is worth mentioning when a man's lips are stretched all over his skull, but overall even the blood-related aspect of this movie is disappointing. The only distance worth it is completely pointless, like when a 9-year-old child (Cletus!) Shoots with his uncle's truck, or when the vulgar naked chick is sitting in the bath after working out. Seriously, if you're not turned on by the face of a 1940s West veteran who doesn't swing anything on his swing, I'd recommend hitting this movie.
