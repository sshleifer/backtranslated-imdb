The plot was not good. <br /> <br /> The special effects weren't. <br /> <br /> The acting was ... not at all good. <br /> <br /> Likewise, I felt there were many holes in the plot that you could fly, well, a spacecraft. <br /> <br /> I thought the end was quite incredible. <br /> <br /> By the way, guys, about the "torch in space". <br /> <br /> Blast whistles have their own oxygen supply (hence the name "Oxy-Acetylene torch"). Two snakes run out of the torch: one after an acetylene bottle and one after an oxygen bottle. <br /> <br /> Such a "torch" will only work well in space.
