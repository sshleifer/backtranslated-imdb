It was, of course, a fairly low budget production, but the throw was pretty decent, the basic premise had promise, and more could be done, but the writing was not so good. The plot is incoherent and looks almost random at times and the dialogue is quiet and awful. <br /> <br /> Basically, a girl's father is strangled by fellow gangsters, and later she becomes a robber and wants to avenge his death, and then it goes into a gang protection <br /> <br / > Alan Ladd gets the best bill, but he really plays a very small role. <br /> <br /> I have to say I found it slightly entertaining in its archaic B-grade hokiness but it's really clumsy and pathetic.
