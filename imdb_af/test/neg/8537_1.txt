I don't expect much from ghost stories, but I expect a story to make a little sense! Is it too much of the authors and filmmakers? When the bad guy suddenly becomes a killer, just because a lot of crows are picking him up, then I have a problem spending $ 9.00 for a ticket! Alfred Hitchcock will turn into his grave. Didn't anyone learn anything in their college movie 101? A good film has an interesting story at its roots! <br /> <br /> Here are some of the ridiculous messages in this movie: If you have desperate financial problems, move from Chicago to the center of the North Dakota area. grow sunflowers (I don't kid you!). If your toddler has serious neurological problems with a car accident, move away from some of the best hospitals and speech therapists in the country to a secluded little town that at best has a community hospital. Hire a drifter to stay out of the blue with you without having to check any referrals if you have a teenage vixen daughter, a woman and a toddler. (I'm glad they aren't my parents!) <br /> <br /> A city everyone knows will have no problem, a triple murder, just outside town. And of course, the man's bliss blames on a bad harvest of sunflowers! A few days after you bought your home abroad - with large vineyards growing everywhere - that reminds you of Jack and the Beanstalk, a man of the X-Files, all the Smoker, (I'm happy to see that the cigarettes did not get him, I think he did not breathe!) Suddenly suddenly sneaking up on you while working to offer your house's selling price, plus 15% more, for absolutely no reason! <br /> <br /> I think you get the picture. I've seen so many divine terrible movies this month, it's just my mind! Is it so hard to make a movie that doesn't treat the audience like an idiot? I'm glad the crows in this sorry movie have at least the brain! I wish I could say the same to those who think they are going to make money from this celluloid piece!
