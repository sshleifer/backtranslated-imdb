I recently watched this movie on VHS (January 27, 2003), just because of Paul Rudd's name on the cover. I liked much of his performance in "The Object of My Affection" and I really expected a good job. However, I found this movie a complete mess. The story has a very confused script and the characters are not well developed. Furthermore, the low-budget special effects do not help much. I don't know the previous generation of Gen-Y Cops, but this next generation is not good. I don't remember exactly why I gave this degree (and I don't want to see this movie again), but my voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Gen-Y Cops A Nova Geração '(' Gen-Y Cops The Next Generation ')
