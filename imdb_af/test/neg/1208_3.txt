This movie is the proverbial 80s movie that shows the viewer that as long as he or she tries for something, they can be better than the benefits. The main character, Doug, showed his skills to fly a Cessna plane, which was somehow comparable to the fact that he could fly a plane and kill people. We all want to play a few million dollars to play with. Maybe a good investment, donate, buy a few things, but the directors of this movie have decided to make Iron Eagle ... not once ... not twice. ... not even three times; yes four times. The thing to look for the most is the multitude of 'Hollywood ends' in this movie. Just when you think the movie ends after a nice end series, there is another cheesy finish. Then another. Definitely a movie that one has to watch to believe ... and maybe just to remember how wonderful the 80s should have been.
