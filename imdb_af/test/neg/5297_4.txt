Despite John Travolta's statements in interviewing that it was his favorite role in his career, "Cool" proved that it was a disappointing successor until 1995's spectacular and clever "Get Shorty." <br /> <br /> Travolta delivers a pleasant performance In this generously entertaining movie, but eventually the movie is flat due to an underdeveloped plot, indifferent characters, and a surprising lack of chemistry between lead Travolta and Uma Thurman. Although there is a bit of laughter, this example of an unknown dialogue (which often appears in the trailers), as it all says: Thurman: Do you dance? Travolta: Hey, I'm from Brooklyn. <br /> <br /> The movie suggests that everyone in the entertainment industry is a gambler or aspires to be one who compares it to organized crime. In 'Get Shorty', the assumption is that a gunman is going to be 'fair' by being a movie, a clever fish performer, but in 'Cool' it seems that the biz has become totally crooked ever since. /> <br /> The film is interestingly cast and the absolute highlight is a "monolgue" rendered by The Rock, whose character is an aspiring actor as well as a goon, where he plays a scene between Gabrielle Union and Kirsten Dunst of "Bring it on." Vince Vaughan's character thinks he is black and he is often seen as a pimp - it was quite funny in the first scene introducing him and almost immediately tired and embarrassed. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Be Cool" Worth a rental for John Travolta's death (which I am one of), but you might want to keep your finger near the quick button to get it through without Feeling wasting too much time. Fans of "Get Shorty" can actually avoid it, as the successor to most things is missing the one winner. I rate this movie a particularly hard 4/10.
