MAY TREAT SPOILERS. This movie was the worst movie ever. I couldn't even see it, it was so bad. This movie is actually worse than scarecrows that many say. It was worse than terror sounds that were at least frightening, sometimes funny. Not even the gore in the movie was good. The shooting was fake and the acting was worse. Please do yourself a favor and save this one. If you see it at the rental shop, then the other side runs. There is nothing good about this movie. If you want to see a good scarecrow movie, look at Night Scarecrow or Pumpkin Head. If you want to see an OK new crop movie then watch Scarecrow. I rate this movie a 0.2 out of 10. This is how terrible this movie really is. THE WORST MOVIE EVER.
