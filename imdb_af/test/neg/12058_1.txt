It's a mystery to me how this movie of a movie ever gets spread. <br /> <br /> Certainly it's horror and there's a fair share of nudity, but by God the production value is the lowest I've ever seen. , the equipment used is worse than standard home equipment, everything is over-lighted, everything gives an amateur look, called your mind after America's worst home videos or whatever. <br /> <br /> Please people, is it too much to ask you to actually make an effort if you expect to waste 90 minutes of people, live it to watch it? You had to do really short projects because it's obvious you are a lot of amateurs! 10/01
