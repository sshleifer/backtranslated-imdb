This movie was not so good at all. Here's the first idea and it's not going to be a strong movie. Harrison Ford's name doesn't even appear, but it's also bigger than the title. The music was nominated for an Oscar, what was it? That music was probably the most annoying thing in the movie. The acting was at its best in subpar, besides the Amish boy, he did a decent job to be so young. Then you have the story that was weak and a little over the place, and it has been customized! The music was terrible, I know I said something, but it was really bad. The property was really good and needs to be made again. Well, that's all I really have about it. <br /> <br /> Your Average Movie Guy, <br /> <br /> -True
