I worked at the company that originally brought out this film, Vestron Pictures. Vestron had the same problem as many small independent film companies. They didn't have much money to put into the production values ​​of their films. Not that money alone will buy you a good movie. For example, look at Kevin Costner's Water World. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, if you have a talented person doing the acquisitions or development, you can create your own new talent. But at Vestron there was no such person, and they always pushed into an important area. In this case, it was on the director and the author. It makes it pretty difficult to have a decent movie, even with the great ensemble role this movie has. <br /> <br /> I think the basic premise of this movie was: "Let's put a bunch of peculiar characters in a room and see if something interesting is happening." worth looking at. <br /> <br /> Most of the Vestron movies eventually had a very distinctive look to them, my wife and I developed the ability to see this quality even in non-Vestron Many times we could even see that quality if we just watch the trailer or TV ad, we sit there, look at the trailer or ad, and then we will turn to each one, and almost in sync, we would say, "Now it's a Vestron movie!" This is a Vestron movie.
