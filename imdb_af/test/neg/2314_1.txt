Speaking for 1 hour and 40 minutes - speaking dull, talking more and then partying. It is hard for me to understand how an actress such as Anne Parillaud, who shone fantastic in Femme Fatale, would sign for such a crap! Unbelievable. If you need a nightdress, this movie can help, although I would prefer some good classical music. Unfortunately, I just found out that I had to write 10 lines for my comments to appear - it's almost so incredible! In short, one or two sink comments that express your core take up a movie is not enough. geez, people. I made my point and don't waste your time with more, unnecessary words - like this movie does.
