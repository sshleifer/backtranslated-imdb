This movie, like many others (Remember the Titans, Miracle), follows the basic sports movie formula: There's a guy, he's a while. Jerk does bad. Jerk must play by someone else's rules. Someone else's rules change Jerk, Jerk gets well. Add tragedy (Death, drugs, riots, etc.). Tragedy Effects Jerk, change him completely. Jerk must now play championship game. Many close-ups on the welding players and the balls. Jerk wins. Quote from coach or news or something that explains the title. Credits. Were you not touched? These movies can now be used to sort out the morons of society. Anyone who pays to see it in theaters should be beaten.
