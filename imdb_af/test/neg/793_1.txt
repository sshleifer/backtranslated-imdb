First time I ever felt I had to write a review. <br /> <br /> I saw thousands of movies in my life and I love a wide variety of movies. I'm pretty open-minded, and can easily say I enjoyed a movie while still saying "Yes, it wasn't good, but I enjoyed it." I can appreciate the mastery of big movies like The Shaw shank redemption, the godfather and American history X. I can keep good movies in a genre like horror or comedy, even though the movie may not be so good. I can even enjoy a bad movie that just happens to entertain me (Blood Sports). I will also try to judge film fairly even if I didn't like it. City lights by Charlie Chapin were not a movie I enjoyed, but I can appreciate the plays and story lines for the time being. <br /> <br /> I think some people go on this site instead of randomly on a rating, should consider some ideas. Try to judge the movie based on how good it actually was. Don't let your personal bias affect the rating. Also look at other movements you have graded and compare the movie you're rating. <br /> <br /> This "movie" was the worst piece I've ever seen. 2 hours of my life where only stolen. The acting was terrible, across the board. The Screens In The Lapse The real shame, however, was the story. The first 20 minutes we actually had a story trying to make sense and the viewer from point A to B. Then take the nightmare. They tried to add new elements, but nothing was explained. Nothing really made sense, was stewardship, was he alive, hit by lighting, was it really lighting, it was aliens, he was a stranger, and so on. The end didn't bind anything and really didn't answer any questions. The only positive was that no one cared for us, but just happy to leave the theater. <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 ??? What's wrong with some of you? I will admit that the eight of us who were so fond of seeing it, we thought "what would make it better?" And we decided to tell some of our friends that this movie was good so they had to suffer and see this movie. What can I say misery loves the company. That's really the only reason I can see for a 6.5 score. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your life!
