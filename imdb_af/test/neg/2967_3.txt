There were very few good moments in this movie. Just a few characters fell out and not so well. Plots were big enough to drive a truck. The pass was like an old man. There were many moments that the film never came back like Coco stripping. What happened to her? How about Garci's sister? Is she better now? What about Leroy? We heard absolutely nothing about him. What about the electronic piano player? How about the rich girl who has an abortion? What happened to her? It was an interesting subplot. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not a good movie and I recommend another musical that was in this movie. Let's do the time to wait again !!!!!!!
