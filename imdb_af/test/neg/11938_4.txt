I wanted to love this movie, not just because it had Aaron Eckhart in it, but I thought the point would be cool, because I enjoy movies and shows around chefs. The cinematography was good, but apart from being converted around chefs, everything is just a lot of clich√©. Oh and Little Miss Sunshine was very annoying in this movie, although Abigail Breslin looks a little annoying in every movie she is playing because she plays many roles where she is whinny. It has some decent flashes of cooking, but food didn't really play a big part in the movie as I expected to be a great disappointment to me. This film had good potential, the movie was good, but they had very little to work with. I like a good light romantic comedy, but it was just fatter. And longer than it should have, it felt longer than it was. This is not a terrible movie, you will not miss anything by not watching this movie. <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 10
