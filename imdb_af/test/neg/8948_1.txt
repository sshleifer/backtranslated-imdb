It must be the worst show I've ever seen. I always kept Chuck Norris in Movies, but why we need to make these programs politically correct by adding a black sidebar that is as threatened as Shirley Temple in Little Miss Marker. I also thought the show was limited because you could kick a man and make it interesting. I know an African American who looks like this Trivette man and he gets his butt kicked once a week. He is all minded. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris is the man and he earns all the kudos he gets, I think this show has grown, but lost steam as time went on. <br /> <br /> They had to throw Chucks his kick
