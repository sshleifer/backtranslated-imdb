This movie is strange, even for a silent movie. In essence, it follows the adventures of an engineer in post-revolutionary Russia who goes daydreaming over Mars. In this movie, the producers seem to know that the Communists really screwed the country, but it also seems as if they want to do something good. <br /> <br /> Then we come to the "Marsse" scenes where everyone is wearing goofy hats on Mars. They have a revolution after being inspired by the Earth Men, but are quickly betrayed by the Queen who is tilting with them. Besides that, everything is a dream, or is it. (And since the Russian Revolution eventually leads to the Stalin dictatorship, it makes you wonder if it's all allegory.) <br /> <br /> Now I've seen a good Russian theater. For example, Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin is a good movie. This is not good, stupid.
