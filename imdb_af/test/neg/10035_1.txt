If someone tells you this picture is just fantastic, they probably have something to do with either making or taking advantage of it. This movie is a real loser and it copies situations from big budget horror movies and not to mention soundtracks. I would not recommend this one to my worst enemy. It's a low budget movie with amateur actors. It looks like it's been filmed for a movie competition. The acting is terrible and it won't surprise me if the script is written by a Hee Haw writer. My family laughed for that. A grade ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ all the way. You won't be afraid of this one. Here's a little taste of the horrible elements of this movie. When the man gets up, he is knocked by Ric White's dumb picture of the Reverend James Johnston walking stick. The guys' reactions are as if he had an amputation without pain killer. Watch the DVD extras after watching the movie. If you see Ric White and others talk so seriously about the movie, you will laugh until your stomach hurts. How people will stretch the truth and what they will do to earn a dishonest goat. Don't be fooled as we did and buy this failure.
