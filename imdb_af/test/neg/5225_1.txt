I gave this movie a score of 1 because it is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. This movie was made in 2003 and I watched movies in the 60's with better special effects. I wish I could detail, but words can't describe how crappy this movie was. I could have done better with a home video camera and $ 20! I pray that Chuck Norris will never make a movie again. Now If you think I'm downing this movie because it has a Christian theme, you're wrong. I like the fact that IL Chuck decided to make a movie that at least tried to make God look good, but why would he make poor viewers like me suffer from such a crappy movie? This whole movie can be summed up in 3 words: RE DAMN DICULOUS.
