I am a chess player and I wanted to keep this movie. In fact, the content could be fitted in a 30-minute document. <br /> <br /> There were many shots that ran and Kasparov looked out into the hall where he won the World Championship. There were other shots of Kasparov running around the site of the 1997 game and told where he was sitting and where Deep Blue was located. It looked just like stuffing. <br /> <br /> Also, I didn't find it interesting to see in detail where Deep Blue could now see an IBM technology, unsuccessful in opening it. What would have been of interest to us anyway - a small grandmaster? <br /> <br /> Also the recent game against Karpov. I no longer follow professional chess enough to know when and where it was. It would have been nice to tell: was it a one-time 'just for the money'? Was it part of the world championship cycle? What was the final score? The core of the film was the play in play two. Can IBM Kasparov show 'inside' the machine? That's where the focus should have been.
