the first toxic film was dark, stingy and hilarious. This movie is un-gory fights on cheezy jazz music, no real gore, and the worst toxic mask I've ever seen! His deep voice is now a light, happy voice, characters from part 1 appear again by actors who don't look like them (Claire, Ma Junko), change names of characters (Claire of Sara?). It lacks all the brutal violence, dark humor and political inaccuracy of the first film. If it wasn't for nudity, this movie could be valued PG. Really lamb. I'm a big fan of part 1, but can't stand this one.
