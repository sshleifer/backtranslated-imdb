Scarecrow Gone Wild begins as high school teenager Mike (David Zelina) and his friends decide to give a "hazing" to make the diabetic Sam (Caleb Roehrig) as a kind of initiative. Mike and his friend decide to take Sam to a maize field, tie him to a cross next to a fiery scarecrow and leave him there all night, sounds like fun? Well, things are burning back when Sam comes in a diabetic coma after suffering from a hypo. The merging spirit of Sam succeeds in the scarecrow who comes to life and begins to hunt down the kids responsible for Sam's unfortunate life-threatening trouble. Can Sam's best friend Jack (Matthew Linhardt) and his friend Beth (Samantha Aisling) save the day and Sam's life? <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Brian Katkin Scarecrow Gone Wild is the third straight-to-video entry in the Scarecrow series and while I haven't seen any of the two since I saw Scarecrow Gone Wild Not, I'm definitely not in a hurry to change that situation that is certain. The writing actually has a pretty decent condition as the wrong soul of Sam is looking for revenge and his friends must keep the eternal Sam alive, but the way it is told is poor and I think it's basically just an irrelevance to the fact That is a movie about a killer scarecrow running to kill people in a non-boring or imaginative way. Since there are one or two scenes here, saving it from a one-off account, the cord in the wheat field is funny and something that immature blocks can do (like me), the little when two guys bury their partner in the sand and stand Then over him and is a bit funny to him, and a cool bit when a guy starts with a terrible song, so the scarecrow throws a pole that attacks him! But these OK bits are few and far between and as a whole it is a stupid, boring, poorly written teenage treasure movie with a very annoying character that irritates. It is also very predictable and has a dull rotating end that does not contain the scarecrow whatsoever. It's a problem if you see a movie that Scarecrow Gone Wild sees, expecting a scarecrow to go wild and I have to admit it's pretty cool like horror character's going. <br /> <br /> Director Katkin really does a reasonable job here, though ending up on Earth with that hospital and everything neon relieves and the fact there is only one patient there & two staff members Cinematography is a lot better than the usual straight-to-video low-budget horror movie of late. There are some nice, if totally unrealistic, lighting. The film has no real fear or tension and some of the medical terminology used everywhere is a bit scary to say the least and I say it myself as an insulin dependent diabetic. There are not many gore here, there are a few scenes where some actors on their stomachs have gut to prepare them, but it looks pretty fake. There is also a burnt face and a few impalements, but little else. There is a fair number of naked female breasts on the show if it is your thing. <br /> <br /> Technical Scarecrow Gone Wild is pretty good considering the low budget horrors I have recently put. Unfortunately, it's still a poor movie overall. The least said about acting the better. <br /> <br /> Scarecrow Gone Wild is not as bad as some of the recent straight-to-video horror boxes, but said it's not much better. & it's still a bad movie when everyone is told and finished. Not recommended, the two previous entries are Vogelverschrikker (2002) & Bird Scarecrow Slayer (2003), which is also straight-to-video.
