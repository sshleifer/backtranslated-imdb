WEEL first and for the most part I just want to say that I am back from retirement from writing well-deserved remarks about terrible movies. Only the movie titled "Scarecrow gone wild" can bring me back, so here I am. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I would like to start with these comments. Ouch !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This movie was really awful, I think I know it's going to be bad. But I didn't know I would spend 60 minutes out of a possible 90 minute movie, because I thought it was a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the biggest mistake of the movie (to me). Ken Shamrock. Now that memory gives me the right, Shamrock is one of the world's most dangerous men. Now, if the memory served me again, he was a stupid comic relief in this silly movie (or that's how it looked at me). I mean how else do you explain all his lines. My overall favorite line of her in this so-called movie was "It has come a long time." OK ????????? The funniest thing about the line was that he didn't say more than five minutes in front of him; So if he knows, why he will try to curb it on earth as soon as he sees it (the scarecrow who does it). As I said before, he had to be the comic relief, except that I didn't think his UFC friends were laughing there. <br /> <br /> Now that I've finished the well-deserved paragraph on the movie. <Br /> <br /> I will admit that I can't remember many scenes, and it is not good, as I watch the movie just 15 minutes ago. So what I'm going to do is the top five things that are wrong with this movie. 1. Usually when horror movie monster has their own theme music, it is not heard by the victims or even by the monster itself. So why just about every person involved in this movie was this pathetic whistle here. I mean I saw the scarecrow and said nothing about it being the whistle. <br /> <br /> 2. On earth there were murders on a beach. I'm sorry, but have eliminated history. Beaches are associated with party time and holiday type feelings. But I think this horror movie thought it would be so successful that it will change everything. Plus, it was me or the beach apparently the size of someone's living room. I mean every time an actor or actress runs around on the beach, they seemed to be running in the same place. <br /> <br /> 3. The girl is wearing gray sweatpants. It really saves over the duration of this movie. I mean she looks so ridiculous. Plus, it didn't help that she seemed to be the youngest in the whole group. I mean what was she like twelve or something. There is no excuse for someone to be so thin on the camera. I mean, the camera doesn't add like ten pounds or something, so what was her excuse. <br /> <br /> 4. People are trying to get record deals on camera. Just when I thought this movie couldn't get cheese, the Gorth Brooks came, and oh man, he was lame. I don't remember the whole scene, but from what I remember, it wasn't pretty. This one man starts singing this song about something that has nothing, and I mean nothing about what goes on in the movie. The funniest part of the whole event is how everyone enjoys it. I mean the only person who doesn't really know how to respond to this is the "token black guy". And it's sad, because if I'm not wrong, he was the one to encourage the latest addition of the American Idoal. But here's where it gets funny. While this man is all in his new song or whatever. In the distant distance we see or crook the vulture. And the boy he looked at afterwards. I mean there is actually a moment when he looks like he's very jealous of this man. So, what is he doing with this jealousy, and I'm glad you ask. He waits for the man to complete his song, and then he finishes the man. I don't want to give away the death scene, but I can tell you. If the scene doesn't make you laugh, nothing will be on this earth. <br /> <br /> 5. This movie was much longer than I expected. And it didn't help them try to pull a few pathetic spinning bulls at the end to squeeze out another 10 minutes. I mean I will admit, I didn't see the twist, but it had a lot to do with the fact that I hope the movie was over. But no they had to do, they turned. Needless to say that when I say it's coming, I just turned off the T.V and said f ** k it, there's no way the movie could get a teaser. Thanks to my very quick judgment, I can say that I will never know what would happen next. But I promise I don't mind !!!!!!!!!!!!! All the movie is good for a laugh, but please don't buy it. Just move it to one of your friends and look it up there.
