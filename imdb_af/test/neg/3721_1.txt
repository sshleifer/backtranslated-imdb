Although I do not recommend this movie, I also recommend reading this review without first watching the movie. Although I did not give up the end, or most of the plot twists, this movie would be best seen without any prior information. It's hard to figure out the main problem with the movie Donnie Darko, as there is a lot to do with it. Richard Kelly, in his first feature film, has collected enough scenes of adolescent anger, late-night stoner diatribes, self-righteous justifications and unofficial, banal philosophy to inspire twenty teenage anxiety dramas; then they pushed into a single two-hour package with a sci-fi turn. The result is deeply disturbing - for all the wrong reasons. The film seeks to guide the audience on winding roads without any sense of symbolism or meaning, to make them sympathetic to one-dimensional characters, and, above all, hope they will ignore the underdeveloped plot, full of irreconcilable points, by concealing it " a veneer of CGI effects and neo-surrealism. The main character, Donnie Darko, is a young man, dedicated to therapy, misunderstood by his friends, and becomes hostile and untouched by his suburban life. We are meant to feel that he is more intelligent than his schoolmates, although it is sometimes a difficult assumption to make. For example, when one of his friends comes up with an absurd theory about the Smurfs and Donnie disappointes with a theory of his own, he complains to his friend Donnie who is "smart". Donnie's speech, however, is not smarter than that of his friend - only angrier. The only clear evidence of his intelligence is his chief's description of his standardized test scores as "intimidating"; but the director's oblique to simple categorization of human elements (as in the FEAR-LOVE sequence), it is a poor substitute for character development. Donnie is taking prescribed drugs to combat mental disorders, which are not addressed directly in this movie. In fact, the whole problem of the drugs has been underestimated, and one of the first chances the director has to release the film is lost. The ambiguity of Donnie's strange destination, the possibility that it could all be a product of his imagination, is being printed in the background, making the film 100 percent science fiction. It would not be a bad thing in itself, except that "science" behind the "fiction" is very shaky. The statements of time travel are poor, which at best sounds like detached, uninformed rattle. We get the idea that the author of the movie once read a book on time travel or some chapters, and can't quite remember how it worked, but was sure it was really interesting and wanted to use it in the movie . The scientific section therefore depends more heavily on expensive computer animations than the actual development of the particular theories. (At one stage, a teacher discussing time spent, he says he will be dismissed on the subject, no need for further explanation). Donnie's handling of a future visitor leads him to commit various malicious actions. The justification for these actions is a difficult business. He is damaging his school, but it's good because his school doesn't treat him like a person. His punishment of a creepy self-image advocate (somewhat similar to Tom Cruise's character in Magnolia) leads to the man's public humiliation. But should the audience believe that Donnie is a kind of angry angel, looking out for ignorance and dismay? He seems ignorant of the consequences of these actions after the fact. Apart from these flaws, the film is struck with flat, uninteresting generalizations of mankind. The story was introduced in 1988, just before the Bush / Dukakis election, and the director touches this point during the film. However, the focus goes exactly as far as Donnie's abomination, blue collar vote for Bush, while his generous, rebellious daughter plans to vote for Dukakis. There is nothing even distant from a political statement; merely a statement of the obvious. The former is not needed to make a good film, but the latter has to be left out. Likewise, Donnie's sincere speech not to hit all human emotions into the mere categories of "fear and love", "it does not ask the audience to make a big leap of understanding. Everyone knows that there is more to it than Two human Emotions, and particular emphasis on this fact, are worthless, and Kelly pays tribute to several symbols of the 80-year-old pop culture in his film: ET, Stephen King, the Smurfs, Back to the Future. such as the director's tribute to himself, a collection of his own experiences, interests, personal heroes and adversaries, attachments and disillusionment, which are tied together by untrained hands at the same time. Overall songs are played in music video format for the characters' actions, apparently because the directors of the songs keep characters that have little or no influence on the plot (including the aarthetic bully, fat girl, and right-wing idiot teacher) are unnecessarily focused, because the director really wanted to pack them somehow. The awkward mess that Donnie Darko is, let's wonder if Mr. Kelly had enough ideas in his mind to make another movie, or if he had lost all his creativity in one infinite, messy, winding effort. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/10.
