There's something about a movie that contains female bodybuilders that gets me in front of the screen every time. <br /> <br /> I saw 'Pumping Iron II', 'Aces: Iron Eagle III', 'Raven Hawk' and even the TV movie 'Getting Physical', which contains some big names in the sport . They were tolerant in their own ways (mostly because they had Rachel McLish. ROWWR !!). <br /> <br /> Then I looked at Nemesis III: Prey Harder. lights like Sue Price, Debbie Muggli, Sharon Bruneau and Ursula Sarcev. Love the ladies, always, but then I am glad I missed the first two "Nemesis" flashes. <br /> <br /> Well, the first one, anyway. Most of the footage here is lightly lifted (and kicked and shouted, I would guess) from "Nemesis II". In fact, one has some entertainment from the evidence provided here. <br /> <br /> But while Price and Company are bending and posting, they don't get much chance of doing anything else (like, say, ACT!). In fact, this whole movie is an exercise (Get it? Ha-ha ...) in diagonal narrative, ambiguous characters and opening movies (in terms of filming as well as storyline). <br /> <br /> Nothing makes much sense, but even if it did, there would still be problems - such as making such small parts for such larger-than-life women. What a crime. <br /> <br /> Of course it's written and directed by Albert Pyun, so what did you expect: solidarity? <br /> <br /> One star alone, taking into account all the hard work that Price, Muggli, Bruneau and Sarcev put in their bodies, did NOT do the "craft" work within the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Thank you, ladies.
