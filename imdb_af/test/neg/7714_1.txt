When one of the stars of a movie is called "Sticky Fingaz", you need to know enough to stay away. Stay away. HOUSE 2 is just the same, this time with zombies that overpower a university campus (man, what should it save on money). As usual, the "zombies" are not given any direction, so speak and provide very little makeup or costumes. They look like the zombies in one of those endless Italian zombie cheapest years ago. That is, they don't look like the kind of zombies we know and love George Romero and Dan O'Bannon's zombie flicks. The people who struggle with the zombies are all non-reactors who can shoot guns and do nothing else. Some who wrote here feel the sequel is slightly more focused than the original. All I have to say is I'm glad the sequel's director has done away with the 360 ​​degree pan shots that helped to destroy the first movie. HOUSE 2 is just the same, which means nothing happens for 80 or 90 minutes. There is one set piece, involving soldiers with a zombie soccer team, which could be funny anyway. It's not.
