Does anyone care about any of the characters in this movie? - Or does it matter to them? - I doubt it. This is the key problem. For a tragedy to work on, we need to care for at least one of the characters, and none of them inspires any sympathy or seems to have any detached features. <br /> <br /> What may have worked in the 16th century, certainly doesn't work in one can only accept "post apocalyptic Liverpool" if indeed it was what it was meant to be. The problem is the characters in the post-apocalyptic Liverpool, while still driving around in cars, watching mobile phones and watching television, again speaking in the Shakespeare language - with a Liverpudlian dialect. Oh, dear! Bad enough you might think - but it often fell into the pure face - with comments like 'eh lah, are you a cockney? And was it a Merseyrail announcement during one of the scenes filmed in the underground? Well, the good news is that in post-apocalyptic Liverpool - the trains are still running. <br /> <br /> The characters without exception are poorly drawn, wood and more like caricatures on the lines of the Joker / Penguin in Batman and Robin except there is no real story to talk about - or if there is is - it is one that does not work in a modern environment, where half of the sets are bleak and 'Blade runnerish' and the other half are blinking or just 21st century normal. Costumes are also mixed with half their daily clothes. (Parkers are big in the post-apocalyptic Liverpool - apparently) and the other half wearing costumes left over from a fancy dress party. <br /> <br /> The film explores the ideas of lust, incest and revenge in the most boring way imaginable - the tragedy is that this film is not made at all. <br /> <br />
