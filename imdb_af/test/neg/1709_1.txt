Holy sweet murder, this is probably the least funny movie I've ever seen. You can take my word for it as truth because it now plays on television. It's really one of the most pathetic productions I've ever seen. there is no single redeemable aspect of this movie. it just lacks humor. The only good thing about it is that it is so rude that it is completely irrevocable. In fact, I just sat through a ridiculous sub-plot and I can't really tell you what's going on. The only reason I can even remember seeing this movie is because it is so utterly humorous that it will always be in my mind. It is absolutely essential to miss it. <br /> <br /> An absolute must be missed. If your friend wants to show it to you, shoot him and save yourself the boredom.
