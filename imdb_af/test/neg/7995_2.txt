Frightening action movie in which Franco Nero exchanges his cowboy hat, rifle belt and coffin, he dragged in DJANGO (1966) for an overall Ninja outfit with all the snazzy accessories that go with it! Despite almost non-stop action, the movie is completely clicked and unintentionally funny - with a camp villain, starting in Christopher George. Susan George (no relationship) is the handsome woman with an excited man, Nero's warrior, who tries to push the villains to her oil-rich land - but the latter did not count on Nero's martial arts (and stunt) -handy) gymnastics. The solution to their problems is to hire a similar skilled Ninja for himself who, as it happens, seems to be Nero's lethal enemy (played by Sho Kosugi, who appears in two successors and is currently busy with another!) . The climax takes place in an arena where one-man army eliminates Nero 'George' and has remained of his gang of previous confrontations; However, the subtle way of sending his nemesis is done effectively.
