My mom told me not to go "Kadosh" - but who ever listens to your mother? <br /> <br /> I was so switched off while I was watching. I thought I had lost my feminist credentials on the way to the theater. The next day I checked with card-carrying feminists. No, they also thought it was much more an anti-orthodox screed than a pro-feminist statement, painting the Orthodox as the Taliban. <br /> <br /> While this Israeli movie is careful to show that the sect the The story is about the ultimate ultra-orthodox Messianists, it is so nasty that it is incredible (plus the non-fanatical Orthodox rock) n'-roller (!) of which one of the sisters is in love is incredibly sexy - even in Israel who has to be fantasy). <br /> <br /> The theater was pretty full, so there's a revamped curiosity to watch Israeli movies; Too bad this evil movie is the one that gets wide spread. It was almost enough to return to undisputed Hollywood romantic movies. <br /> <br /> (originally written 4/29/2000)
