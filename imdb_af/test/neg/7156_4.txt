I really hoped best with this one, but it just didn't happen. Financed and still well funded in a very non-Dutch way, with a style and fit that is much like Hollywood. What I don't understand is how with these great benefits - the director, writer, manufacturer - still made this movie a horrible picture to watch. Filled with bad jokes, cheap nudity and actors who just can't really speak in English. Kudos to pull it off, but what did this man think!
