I agree that this movie is too pretentious, and it's not easy to know where it's going. I've been teaching literature and film for years, and I find this movie one of the most overestimated, according to some of the previous reviews here. <br /> <br /> Let me remind you, however, that it's the same director who has L'ora di religione (Il sorriso di mia madre- My Mothers smile) - a jewel of a movie! <br /> <br /> Did he try to outdo Fellini's 81/2 here ???? The scene with the dogs, which has also been noticed, is absurd and excessive? just one example. Others will take too much space, and some reviewers have already noticed them. <br /> <br /> Overall, a most frustrating and annoying experience!
