Who filled this stupid idea of ​​acting and made a movie in Himesh's head, which is always hidden under a cap, which has almost covered half its face? Just hope it is first and last, for the sake of God! From Assalam Valekum to Gayatri Mantra, Himesh tried everything to create an aura of his so-called singing talent. It is nothing more than horrific statements of words like Tanhaiyya that completely kill the beauty of the terms songs. Why doesn't Himesh smile? Simple, because he does not use near Toothpaste! Now there is this friend of his, who warns him around every place, and this number one lawyer in town, who has to wrap herself sexually and try to seduce him, of all the attractive German people she might have met earlier, perhaps the male lawyers In this part of the world they can curse their fate because they have to deal with the tight, unattractive fate every day! The action scenes were shot so scary, as the event planner attacked by the thief, driving cars over the cars, and so on. The bride's father looks very hurried to get rid of his daughter by marrying her, flying back and forth. Most hypocrite, he praises MH for spreading love among people of the world, as if they were sweets, and on his back gave a cool lecture to his daughter at this show businessmen. When Himesh is proven innocent, he plunges the other man indifferently, as if it were a musical chair game! I didn't get the poor guy's face, did you? Hansika in the role of Ria, looks like she needs an eye control, for tension in her eyes! The friend in the role of a friend is good, of course, acting, and should be in better movies, such as Sharman Joshi. Trishu's short-sighted child artist is sweet but wasted. It looks like today's young generation has become utility, as they prefer this kind of ridicule of lyrics and musical scores, and add gossip to it, for example, if you sing, I have an ajaja, the ghost will come. It's a strange taste in music, and rather funny. I am amazed how such classic lyricists like Gulzar chose Himesh from all the people to give music. There is a story in Panchtantra, that a crow attaches so many feathers to a peacock, looks beautiful and attracts the birds; but the feathers eventually fall off, and the true dark crow is revealed! Hope Himesh takes a hint and refrains from producing such meaningless things, and wasting precious money he earned by burdening his short nose so much! His friend tells him, if your nose is cut, how will you sing? Thanks for showing Germany, Himesh, at a reasonable cost of renting the DVD! and correct the spelling errors, do you want? an extra e in the movie, and I'm not in love! There is also a well-known number of the old movie Sholey, Mehbooba, on which Mallika Sherawake again, but this time with Himesh, cut for her and convenient, Ria, his so-called true love and his new bride is not here! Now it was very smart, Himesh! At least one thing in this movie you did smartly to justify Sherawat's presence. But doesn't she look a little washed away?
