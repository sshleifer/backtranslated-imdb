Bad dialogue, slow story, scenes turning on and absolutely useless. I can't believe that so much money was invested in such a poorly written film. Directing and acting can't save this bomb either. <br /> <br /> 50% through the movie and you're still waiting to start it. They lay the foundation with the opening foreword and then spend the next 40 minutes to do nothing. You look at 40 minute footage that is absolutely pointless in an effort to do what I don't have. <br /> <br /> Much of this movie is like watching a very bad French movie where nothing ever happens and the characters are just as dull, lifeless and egocentric who live without purpose or care. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs. Anyone who recommends it will disappoint you and you will doubt their taste and depth.
