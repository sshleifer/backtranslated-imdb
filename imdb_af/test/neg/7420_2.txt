The development of movies based on real-life events involving cryptozoology or the supernatural was always a challenge for directors and screenwriters. In particular, you need to reconcile testimonials, conflicting information sources, and Hollywood creativity to deliver something that the audience can get. Unfortunately, it seems to SASQUATCH that nothing of these things is happening. <br /> <br /> The movie starts in typical film noir when a research team in the Cascades travels through the plane somewhere. From there, the research team disappears, and despite efforts by law enforcement officers and local rescue parties, they remain missing for some time. While one of the passengers is running, infrared images are placed on the screen (a la Predator) that subtly suggests that the legendary Sasquatch is the cause of the passengers' fate. <br /> <br /> Cue Harlan Knowles (Henriksen), CEO of BioComp Industries and the father of one of the victims. Knowles has set up its own search and rescue team with the express mission to find its daughter and the rest of the research staff, along with the valuable technology lost during the accident. <br /> <br /> Compiled by Knowles's custom-rescue team, the entire film is about the path of unspoiled characters, dizzying cinematography and a totally irreplaceable plot line. I literally had to keep myself from sleeping while I was sleeping in this movie, trying to frighten myself out of my mind. The only member of the role that was his own was Henriksen, who did not contain the transparency in all the other characters. The exaggerated sound effects were also annoying; Basically, I didn't know if I was watching a movie about Bigfoot or Grizzly Bear. <br /> <br /> The plot line wasn't too good either. This was too underdeveloped as the viewer was mainly subjected to typical scare music that resembles the genre. It was clear that you shouldn't have been a genius to find out who would wear their clothes in the middle of the movie, or what the first unfortunate soul would be for Mr. Sasquatch to be. As far as good points, there is no one, so I gave this movie a 2 out of 10.
