I saw this movie twice, once a few years ago in college, and again this past weekend. Although I forgot it for the first time, I decided to give it another chance. Terrence Malick is clearly a respected director, and the IMDb viewers seem to think at least very much of the film. But it seems my taste hasn't changed at all. <br /> <br /> Where to start? For one thing, Linda Manz's story is terrible. Her voice is so annoying with the terrible New York accent (please try and convince me that Chicagoans are talking like that - they don't). She conceded that she was just going to sit down and talk about random things, which didn't make her a talented actress. She doesn't even work! I expected on IMDb to see her torn apart, as her performance was just as completely laughable, but people were actually right! She is simply unpleasant in all respects. I was hoping Malick would just kill her. <br /> <br /> The other actors were good but definitely nothing special. Adams was probably the strongest in the cast, but she also had the only decent part. Besides the old guy, he was pretty good. <br /> <br /> Speaking of acting, how can Shepard's character be so ridiculously stupid ?? He bought the "brother and sister" act because ... uh, why would he buy it? Bill and Abby touched every opportunity to be compassionate, as if they didn't realize their lives were very platonic. It was just amazing. And finally, after a considerable amount of time, the Boer suddenly realized that: "Oh my God, they are together!" Then he goes to Bill with a gun, but rather looks into Bill's hand and ends with a dying stab wound. <br /> <br /> What speaks is the fate of the characters also stupid (and dare I say lazy). Of course, Bill must die - can it be more boring than to be shot by a pack of police in a dam? Abby continues with her happy life, goes on a train and really feels happy about the way things work out. And the turbulent narrator randomly finds her dead end friend and they wander in the sunset. But that's okay, because Malick never gave me a reason to give the characters anyway. <br /> <br /> Regarding the plot, this movie draws endless endless without any actual twists or turns. I can't believe it's only 94 minutes - I could have sworn I was sitting in my seat for 3 hours. The sudden locust was like throwing the Bible into my face; I'm quite good at metaphors and allusions, but it was all over the top. It was clear that the message was "Do not marry money or bad things will happen to you." Very original. <br /> <br /> I understand that "Days of Heaven," like all of Terrence Malick's films, is meant to be an artwork. And I will definitely agree that the movies are simply stunning, and the magical hour shots add a unique aura to the movie. But I need more than nice pictures to enjoy a movie, and this one just didn't do it for me.
