The somewhat warlike brother of a suicide finds that he and his mother grieve in the same way (by acting), but that Dad blames himself and himself. Author-director Dan Harris gives us a dysfunctional family torn to pieces, characters with question marks hanging over them, and then laying the whole story in the obvious terms: Suicide! Secrets! Gay shame! Family Illness! With the purpose of packing things with a neat bow, Harris wants to make sure we don't miss a trick, and initially consider our considerate material, but then spell out everything in an elementary, sentimental way. Sigourney Weaver's confused performance as the family matriarch is dryly disconnected and she is a joy - that is until Harris gives her a makeover (complete with meaningful new hairstyle). This is the film-like equivalent of a condescending pat on the head. ** of ****
