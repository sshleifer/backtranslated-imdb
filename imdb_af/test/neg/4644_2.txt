It's a truism that makes a lot of effort to make a bad movie. This one is no exception. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of yanks, but their amazing simplistic view of the world and their ability to reduce everything in black and white and make events (even fiction in novels) fit into an agenda that's Having little or no relation to complexity of any kind is annoying in the extreme. <br /> <br /> Wilbur Smith is descriptively astonishing but weaves more intricate stories that earn more than were produced by this horrible mishmash of a movie. <br /> <br /> Sad for those who will never read Smith. They will be left with a less than decent portrayal of his Egyptian series, which should be said to be huge in his exposition. <br /> <br /> The Indiana Jones movies were funny. To try and replicate this by manipulating Smith's novels, miss this production by landmill. <br /> <br /> Pathetic except for photography and Art Malik.
