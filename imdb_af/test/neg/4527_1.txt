This movie is in the same league as Ishtar. Very wasted talent. Who made this bomb escape? When Sigfried says that an example should be made, referring to a nuclear bomb, I said, "Please let this theater be!" Don't waste your time. Not even worth a free rental! And where did they get these shills to fill out the comment section on IMDb? I can't believe anyone who ever saw the original series enjoyed this stinker. Steve Carell is not a physical comedian. If they removed the "comedy" and made it a live action movie, it could succeed. What was the purpose of the dance scene? The fat jokes and references were also tasteless. This movie never went a chance to go for the lowest common denominator and scenes just ended. It looked as if nobody had gone through them. Not terrible! Save your time, if not money, and pass this movie!
