Who really wants to see it? Disgusting violence, disgusting sex, for such a long time. I don't want to, but I've always remained true to my philosophy of looking at any movie as bad as it may be. It was the hardest (just after "Next Friday"). <br /> <br /> It's basically just crap. How could you call it anything else? The story of a Roman emperor as an excuse for Gore and T & A. Yes, yes, "Hey, it's realistic, they're so." Good, but why bother us? I don't care if that is the case (and there are many scenes where I really doubt it). The point is, why should anyone see it? Problem is, there is only one reason why you can keep the movie and it will be that you like violence. There is nothing special about it, just cruelty. You can say "Cool!" as you want to say in a platter movie. But horror movies with violence can give you at least chills and excitement, perhaps characters you care about. But here everything is dark, boring and boring. Every character is angry. "The story of an emperor who cannot handle his power". What? In the very first scene he walks naked through the forest with his sister. I have no problem saying we got 2 1/2 hours. <br /> <br /> But maybe you're turned on by seeing Helen Mirren, pregnant and dancing. Or 5 minute hardcore scenes that some people see as the movie's message. Or castration, yes right, it was nice! Real birth scenes, how hilarious! People, animals, caring, let's just treat them as toys. <br /> <br /> I don't care what someone says, it's not a movie, it's just 2 1/2 hours of blood and sex, humiliating and disgusting. Watch a porn movie if you want sex or a horrorflick if you want violence. At least those movies don't make up for being an artistic masterpiece. And they are shorter. <br /> <br /> [0/10] [6 (1 + - 6-)] [0/4]
