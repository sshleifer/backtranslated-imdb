I like the first The Grudge. It really crept me in and it made me see something. That something of this successor is missing. There was no creativity, nothing new or original, nothing that really fits your mind. It's people who die because a scary ghost comes out of the shadows and says buoy. And most of the time it wasn't even scary. <br /> <br /> Plot-wise, this movie is a dead end. Amber Tamblyn is a good actress, but she has given nothing to do, and Karen's death was really unsatisfactory because it came so fast. I was also disappointed in the Kayako's mother sub-plot. I thought she might give a way to fight the grudge, but she died in her hands - hair? - Kayako. It was such a silly twist. All in all, it's hard to feel for characters you know will die from the first. All in the same way. And there is nothing they can do. It does not feel like a cruel fate they are waiting for. It's just boring, because you know what's going to happen. If they had something to fight it, it would have added tension, even if they failed. If there was any hope, it would justify the screams. Now you're just waiting for them to die. <br /> <br /> Kayako was very scary in the first movie, but this time we saw her too many times and it removed a bit from her. I was still scarce during some scenes, but I actually got used to the big eye and blue face. The makers obviously realized that this would happen if they added other scarecrows. Yes, I was scared of the school psychological scene - even though I knew where it went as soon as she said, "I was at home." A fun touch. However, Toshio was not scary at all in this movie. I was much more crawled by the non-blue Toshio with black eyes and an empty stare that sometimes appeared in the first movie. A blue boy sitting in the corner doesn't do anything to me. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters actually looked unnecessary - the infamous milk scene with the girl whose name I can't even remember coming. I wasn't afraid, it's just "Huh?" I'm not sure if the schoolgirls were actually needed. Karen could have brought the resentment with the US with her. It could have killed people related to her life, all at the funeral, or something like that. Yet it would have been boring to see how everyone died, but to introduce so many unrelated people really felt annoying. Hate the "I won't call you mother" scene. Aubrey's mother issues were equally boring. However, the little boy was a touch. <br /> <br /> The Ju-On sequel was much scarcer than this one. It had some new twists - dreams and reality, for example, faded - and even if it made me feel right, I was happy too. I have to think a little and wonder. This movie only provided cheap scares.
