To avoid being bored during "Love and Sex", I first tried to think of all the movies. It was mimicking: "Breaking Up" with Russell Crowe and Salma Hayek (although it had an original end), "About Last Night" with Rob Lowe, and many TV shows. <br /> <br /> The second was admiring just how beautiful Framke Janssen was, so I couldn't believe for a nanosecond that she could have a problem getting a date. She is definitely in line to give Julia Roberts a run for her money, literally - and wasn't Julia in some movie with the same plot or other? <br /> <br /> Third was finding out why the author / director saved Jon Charrea's character from giving Adam Levy the Jewish name; He even admires the eating of a ham sandwich. <br /> <br /> Fourth tried to find out why some critics gave it a good review. That's why I was in the theater. <br /> <br /> (originally written 9/2/2000)
