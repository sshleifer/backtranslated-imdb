I can't understand how this photo should be allowed. It's mostly, if not completely, inaccurate, so the main character doesn't even look like history physically. This movie made me go on the internet and go through my books to make sure I remember Nero's personality correctly. For the sake of God, I have a book called Nero as one of the worst people in the world, and the movie made me feel bad for him. I must say Aggrapina's character was close to my understanding of her, both physically and psychologically. Although the actors all did a good job, the movie was horrible and I'm sure I won't watch any other people watched by this sorry team.
