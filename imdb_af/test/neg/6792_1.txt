This TV program is probably the most pathetic show of shit on TV today. Horribly predictable, obscene use of slow motion photography, cheesy story lines. Chuck Norris is an abomination that should never be filmed in anything. The way he decides to make every episode in a public service announcement is really annoying. His play sucks so badly that it embarrasses one. I will already give the series credit ... it is sometimes entertained, but not enough, because it makes any difference. With all the negative points this series has, I still prefer it to reality TV, it can't be worthless anymore.
