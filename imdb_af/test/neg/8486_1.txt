This film is a real shame, not just for the plot, the empty display of the characters, it's for the lack of creativity of the director and all the crew, it may be one of the worst movies of all time, and It's hard to believe it's the successor to one of the 90's best-known films. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of The Mask, when I watch this movie, I expected a movie with a good sense of humor, a movie with an acceptable plot, instead I saw a very bad copy of Chuck Jones and Tex Avery cartoons. The movie wasn't funny, even for my 7-year-old sister. So I wonder: What was wrong New Line Cinema ??? Was it trying to repeat the success of the first movie, or was it trying to create another masterpiece like The Lord of the Rings? For if they did, they were completely out of their minds.
