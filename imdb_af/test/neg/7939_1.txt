It may have been the worst movie I've ever seen. Remember, it is clear that Detroit (forest in downtown Detroit! Bwahaha !!) has not been investigated. The writing was horrible, the point of departure completely impeccable, and frankly, the characters were embarrassing. I can't understand for my life why seasoned actors would push so low and participate in something that this god is terrible. Now I have never seen the original and do not know if this film gives tribute to its original form. It is my understanding that the original was not set in Detroit. Why would they deviate from it without examining information about the environment, I just said that it was more than the role the rent wanted to pay. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this litter unless you come from Detroit and wish for some comic relief.
