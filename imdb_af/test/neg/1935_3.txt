I saw it when it appeared in the theaters in 1996. I remember being familiar with Elia Wood's work (that's right, he made things for "Lord of the Rings"!) And the merchandising tie-ins for the movie were pretty much water pistols were even circulating. <br /> <br /> Adults are reminiscent of old movies and TV shows and have taken their children to see it for the sake of nostalgia. They were excited because it was a movie about a dolphin and a stupid boy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it wasn't what anyone expected and ran through. You know a movie in trouble when a boy from a Hammerhead shark swims in the middle of the sea and a pack of dolphins scares the shark away and the child - instead of getting out of the water in a boat. come - float In the water for five minutes thank you his dolphin for saving him ... apparently he did not keep in mind that the shark is still out there, maybe even under him. <br /> <br /> Another problem is Paul Hogan. He looks old, crust and tired of recovering his Croc Dundee shtick. By now no one even remembers "Crocodile Dundee" much less Hogan, and I expected half of him to suddenly pretend he didn't know what a hairdryer was for fish-out-of-water / social satire. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a very bad "family" movie that is amateurish and almost difficult to watch. I hated it when I saw it in theaters in '96 and I hate it more now.
