Every time I accompany this show on TV, I really want to put my eyes and truth and frighten my ears. It's so incredibly awful. The jokes aren't funny, the acting is terrible, and the whole show is a big disappointment. I hate Charlotte Arnold's intestines, and I just want to push her in the face or stab her with a knife every time I hear her talking. She's not a talent, a low IQ, a big waste on society, and I think she'll make the world a favor if she just closes the f * ck and goes away for a long time. Please, I say this with my whole heart, DO NOT SHOW ONE EPISOD OF THIS. It's not even worth 30 minutes of your life, and there are thousands of better things to do, including killing yourself than watching this show for half an hour.
