After watching this movie on a boring Saturday afternoon, I couldn't really figure out why so many people liked it. It was not "heartwarming" or "smart"; It was merely a merger of every other "mismatched people coming together during a holiday and despite their ideological differences learning something about each other," the film has ever made. <br /> <br /> The characters are a stereotypical bouillabaisse. We have the Blacks, Hispanics, the Jews, the Asians and the Homosexuals - and they do nothing except what everyone expects to do in such a movie. The black mother states that it is "right, then" when it is mentioned that another black character is in the church, instead of helping to prepare dinner (because all blacks are in the church), the Hispanics can only speak Spanish. talking when they greet or make each other, the lesbians do nothing but hug and kiss (and one of them carries a bandana. Because all lesbians dress like Ani DiFranco), and the Vietnamese family owns a video shop. In L.A. Imagine that. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the movie is called "Cooking" because every ethnic family cooks a different version of what they think should be thanksgiving dinner! The black mother wants to have maize bread and macaroni and cheese, the Hispanics are referred to as rolling tortillas. The Vietnamese family is deep-frying rolls; I'm surprised there wasn't a bottle of Manischewitz on the Jewish table. This is all shown by the tradition of "musical montage", where they play the "Wipeout" of the Surfari, which quickly reflects the instruments used in the melody to reflect the respective cultures. Isn't that cute? Anyway, as soon as the director is ready to determine how different everyone is, he tries to show inner humanity that we share, like all people of every race, religion and culture, unpredictable and exaggerated dramatic conflicts for each the families to deal with. It's a plot killer to mention what each of these conflicts is, but be sure they are surprises, that's when you slept for the first half of the movie. The theme of the "shame of the family" runs pretty strongly throughout. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you are the kind of person who enjoys those new-captivated movies that revolve around the stories of unlikely characters, well, you still won't like this movie. If you want extended food adjustments to be made to a table, place it in your Netflix rope. But if stereotypes and clich√©s make you encouraging, make sure you ask for Christmas. Or Hanukkah. Or Kwanzaa.
