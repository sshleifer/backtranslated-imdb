Bloody Birthday opens to a shot of Meadowvale General Hospital. There were three babies born at the same time during a total eclipse. A caption informs us that it is now "Meadowvale, California June 1, 1980". Two teenage lovers, Duke Benson (Ben Marley) and Annie Smith (Erica Hope), go to the business in an open grave. They heard sounds and Duke investigated. Both Duke and Annie are murdered. Sheriff Jim Brody (Bert Kramer) is amazed and has just the idea of ​​a child's jumping rope that Annie likes, as an idea. Unfortunately, Sheriff Brody can solve the case while his youngest daughter Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy) and two of her friends Curtis Taylor (Billy Jayne and Billy Jacoby) and Steven Seton (Andy Freeman) kill him. Just as they finished with Sheriff Brody, another young boy from their class called Timmy Russel (K.C. Martel) arrives, the three killers are not aware of how much he has seen. Shortly after the incident, Timmy played with Steven and Curtis in a junkyard. Curtis joins Timmy in an old locker room. Timmy manages to escape and tells his sister Joyce (Lori Lethin), but she doesn't even believe him. The three children carry their murder boom. Their strict teacher, Mrs. Davis (Susan Strasberg), a love couple (John Avery and Sylvia Wright) in a van and Debbie's older sister Beverly (Julie Brown) is one of their victims. Joyce starts her suspicion about Debbie, Curtis and Steven, who make her and Timmy a target for the evil trio. Will they be able to convince the authorities that these three innocent 10-year-old children are really stupid killers? <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Ed Hunt I have an intense dislike for this movie. I think it's absolutely terrible and doesn't have a pleasant aspect. It's 83 minutes. The writings of Hunt and Barry Pearson give us no explanation for the child murderers' motives beyond the solar eclipse that Saturn protrudes and therefore for this bizarre astrological reason these three children have no conscience, so these are the only children ever born. a total eclipse? If it is true, are they waiting just before their tenth birthday before launching their gunshot? I think it just kicks in, right? For his credit it is pretty good, but I still found it incredibly boring and boring to go through. The film as a whole is very unspeakable and predictable, the children are revealed in the first 10 minutes as the killers and as I have mentioned, no motive is given. This is sometimes stupid. Watch the scene where Debbie Steven stops by throwing a bowl of water over him! The sheriff's death is conceded to him, and he falls in a few steps. Yes, the injuries suffered from that type of accident will not be the same as being hit with a baseball bat, as he actually was, any competent doctor. or pathologist would have seen it within 5 seconds. There is not a single drop of blood left in the whole movie and all the lame murders are dull and unpleasant. There is a little outlook on nudity, as Debbie put 25c to watch boys through a hole while her sister strips Beverly. There is an early scene just after the 5-minute point when Joyce walks from the kitchen to the living room and the boememik is clearly visible on the screen, not even a bit. The general incompetence lasts throughout the film. The whole production is thin and immediately forgotten. The acting is poor throughout, the three children are very annoying and from the beginning got my nerves and made this film even more of a face, especially Curtis in his geeky excessive glasses. I hate this movie really simple, just like that. I can't think of saying a good thing. Definitely one to avoid.
