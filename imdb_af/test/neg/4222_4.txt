If you really love GWTW, you will find the story disappointing. Those who may think it is just about a romantic story and the south will probably be content with this decent TV production (although I consider Scarlett's importance to be a major failure). But, let me say that considering the novel, nothing could come from this. <br /> <br /> I have read GWTW more than 20 times and I can change the adjustment that Mrs. Mitchell did for the movie, much appreciated. It took me time to understand how good the end was: Scarlett knew she was going to repair Rhett because she always had what she wanted. But finally there was no kiss. <br /> <br /> Then Alexandra Ripley managed to fix it by showing exactly how perfect and powerful Scarlett can be, and of course, describing in detail how exactly she gets Rhett. back even when she had an important relationship with someone else (nothing could have been further from Mitchell's thoughts). <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the story between these points is just a long and boring ride to make ends and costumes and scenarios just to give us a clear and totally unnecessary end. <br /> <br /> If Margaret Mitchell could come again, she would die once again. she will find out what Scarlett has become to GWTW. <br /> <br /> It's not fair to compare it with the original, but it's not a GWTW error. Isn't it? Is it good if I don't compare it to the original one? Can be. Sorry to say, I really don't care. <br /> <br /> I would expect little compromise to continue somebody else's (suberb) work, otherwise you won't even try.
