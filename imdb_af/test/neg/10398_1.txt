This demented left-wing extinction slows Dante's great work, distorts the genius of the author from all recognition, places hateful ideology, incompetent satire and moronic political commentary in every conceivable place and earns a place in the eighth circle, tenth Bolgia with the rest of the counterfeiters. Sandow Birk reserved himself a place for it. <br /> <br /> Half of Republican political figures, Fox News helicopters and Christian conservatives are a work of literary sanctuary, to say nothing of extreme liberal prejudice. However, it is original, boring and thin. Nothing in Birk's unworthy and heretical review is at least relevant to the original text or is in any way entertaining, humorous or enlightening, despite its indifferent prediction. <br /> <br /> I could have eaten a video film and had a better movie. I regret the two hours of my life that I have lost this insult to the concept of poetry. Calliope will cry forever.
