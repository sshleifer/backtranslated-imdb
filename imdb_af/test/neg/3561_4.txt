This film is about a sad woman who lost her husband through suicide. She was tormented by her son who then refused to speak. <br /> <br /> Child molestation is rarely explored on film and it is refreshing to see a movie like Addison's Wall. However, due to the nature of the film, there is no tension or drama. Apart from some important emotional moments, everything in the movie is very clear. The sudden end that doesn't solve any riddles certainly doesn't help the movie to be more visible. Addison's Wall could have been much better, such as exploring the wall contents, a more intensive program to help Addison go through his trauma. Instead, the film feels very unfinished and non-engaging.
