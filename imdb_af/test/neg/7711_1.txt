I'll keep it at bullet points, so here goes: 1. Very poorly written. 2. Try to be like Resident Evil. 3. Zombies slowly and comfortably one minute the next minute. Raging lunatics. 4. Never clean up blood so easily! 5. Special effects not as good as the original "day of the living dead". 6. Not as good as the "Fat and the Beautiful". 7. It looks like it was written in 1 week and made the following week. <br /> <br /> Basicaly Med team plus Special Forces go to a zombie-infected university to find the first zombie and withdraw a serum to cure the plague. . Everyone dies except the 2 main stars that are so predictable, though they have unarmed and swam with 100 zombies that survived. But special forces (trained at the pre-school scouts) took only 1 zombie to kill them, even though they had weapons. Also the compulsory push to fill any gaps. Overall waste disposal.
