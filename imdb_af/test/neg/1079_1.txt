I have to admit that I was against this movie from the beginning, but I tried my hardest to be impartial, but I really thought of the idea of ​​lovingly remembering a sophisticated, witty, entertaining, peculiar British classic. start. <br /> <br /> People in my house watched it so that I swallowed my pride and told myself to be professional about movies (I studied them at Uni at the time). <br /> <br /> If expecting an American movie of this kind, the movie starts with a chase that wasn't bad. In fact, many of the action sequences are credible and it alone raises the point. <br /> <br /> However, the characterization was uncomfortable, the set pieces could easily be split from any American bastard you might have had. accident to watch and it did not have all character. <br /> <br /> If you want a skew on the original movie with a failed initial robbery, the US version uses the predictable thing and poses an emotional factor with Donald's death. Sutherland's character. This leaves our American cousins ​​many opportunities for sycophantic, dewy-eyed revenge-seeking against the 'evil-doers' who make it predictable surplus milks. It is never as clear as in the screens with Charlize Theron (oh nice! Oh so beautiful! Look at her beautiful, wounded Bambi eyes, everyone!) That was thoroughly misleading. Her entrance tone was especially like something from Resident Evil or Tomb Raider, both of which were a) more entertaining and b) had a better start because they couldn't waste a game like they could with the British movie that is already full of spark , people you really feel and moments of inspiration. But I deviate, the whole inclusion of a pretty girl for the sake of it looks just like the most greasy maneuver I've seen in a while and expose merely the cynical Hollywood lethargy for what it is. <br /> <br /> If you like any of these actors, by the way, and you agree with any of the above comments, DO NOT GO TO BE THE MOVIE! If I had the opportunity to watch 'Fight Club' or 'American History X' after seeing Ed Norton in it, I would have refused. Likewise, Jason Statham with 'Lock Stock' (and I suppose 'The Transporter' is good if you want that). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, all the sets are designed in the most transparent way possible to make you think, 'Wow! He's smart! "Coo!" He's cool! ',' Hey! What a tough guy! . Then there is the 'funny PC man' who speaks comic relief over his forehead, but whose humor content can be expected two minutes before. To be honest, if you've seen one or two movies, you can easily confuse the two as clones of the Jerry Bruckheimer stable. Not that Jerry is carelessly horrible, but he just uses the cliches to excess, as everyone knows (or should). <br /> <br /> That's where I need to get clean. I didn't reach it to the end, so I couldn't even say if the brilliant end in the Michael Caine version made it, but sorry, it's just one of those scarce movies. If I "If I saw it at a theater, I'd come out and have a little protest outside. It's not just that it's another identical to-the-number, but the ocean's eleven were good, but don't struggle with the rest!) With all the sheen, glamor, fake sass and pantomime heroism of such a movie, but I can't recognize anything from the original. <br /> <br /> So, if you expect the 'Italian work' and not 'OCEAN'S 14', although it is badly written with a less established cast and characters, there are some unsuitable elements and cardboard cut out script writing then do not look! I don't care for people who enjoy a little senseless fun, but it's a criminal hothouse that doesn't deserve to parade under the title of a classic. Seriously, show pride! I felt thoroughly justified in my angry and sickly reaction when I first heard that the film would be made. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> P.S. Some of the action ranges are not bad at all, so add an extra '1' to the point if you like this kind of thing.
