Like most people I saw this movie after I heard from Patton Oswalt. Oddly enough, it was easier to find than I thought it would be. Although it would not come as a surprise that I used it. <br /> <br /> The plot is summed up in the title. It's a bed that eats. Nothing more, nothing less. There is an attempt to throw in a story line, but not a very good one. <br /> <br /> A devil's blood landed on a bed and is consequently owned. It consumes everything that happens by absorbing it and then dissolving it in what orange fanta seems to be. There is an artist who became a victim of the bed, but was ill and ended up behind a painting in the room in which he lived. The story is told entirely by him. <br /> <br /> This movie misses everything, even to be bad. Yet it is not without its own brand.
