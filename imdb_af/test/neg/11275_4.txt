With some movies it is very difficult to tell who they were made. Huevos de oro looks after the well-educated Spanish middle class. There must be lots of jokes in this movie that you will not understand if you are an outsider. It can be quite irritating. <br /> <br /> Symbols and references to art and popular culture are abundant. The film refers to the work of Salvador Dalí, Luis Buñuel and the Surrealists in general. point to Duchamp's tools. In addition, the main character also has a talent for karaoke ties with Julio Iglesias songs. But why is it all mixed in a pretty nice but also free way to easily avoid me. I can only guess that this is all about highlighting the vital, turbulent, drill vulgarity of the main character, who admires and despises the director simultaneously. How all the really beautiful women run to him (the main character, I mean) is a bit disturbing. <br /> <br /> The movie has three parts. It starts in the Spanish enclave of Melilla in Africa, where Benito, the main character, does his military service, apparently in the corps of engineers. Then it moves to the resort of Benidorm in Spanin, where Benito just wants to build the tallest skyscraper of the place and become a vulgarized Howard Roark. For the latter part, a defeated Benito moves to Miami, Florida, presumably to start a new life. "But the change of places is not really explained. It is also somehow annoying that there is no character development and that The film is recorded in a soap opera mode without being convincingly ironic. It has to be said that Javier Bardem is very well pleased to play the young stud that is slow and empty. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie because I am interested in village image and Benidorm is a special place. In this regard, Huevos de oro has only partially satisfied me, and Jess Franco's She Killed In Ecstasy (1970) used this particular place in a more rewarding way.
