I was 19 in 1970 when it came out and heard how funny it was when it came out and read the reviews here, I eventually rented it and watched it. I didn't even laugh - a very unique movie - and I usually like Reiner. I can't tell my life why it's seen as funny. I didn't have one visit. And I love comedies! Oh well, at least now I know what the scream is about. Not my idea of ​​a comedy. Go Rent The Navigator or The Love Nest by Buster Keaton - now it's comedy classics! If you rent this one - you have a back-up rental so your entire night is not a loss. Count 3 out of 10
