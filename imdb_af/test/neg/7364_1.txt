The actors were not credible. The story was very poor, total juice and completely predictable. Really disappointed in Depardieu. It was a pity that they were no longer focused on the Canadian struggle for independence. We've seen this love story many times before, just with better actors! We had to wait for the last 15 minutes for a small sense of drama! The soundtrack was totally disturbing. The underline strikes you over the head with sentimentality. But really at the top. The only thing we found was the fact that they let the Indians speak their language. And we found the cinematography of the Indian village relatively realistic.
