I bought it because it was $ 1.99 and Harry Carey was in it and a friend of mine was in it and for $ 1.99, how bad could it be? Then I read a few comments on the film and began to get excited. Perhaps it was really a lost gem, one of those awesome little B-movies that everyone forgot, but who deserved to be resurrected. WRONG! I'm not sure how anyone else can give this thing the praise he got from here, but I found it one of the most boring and blatant bados-filled movies I've ever seen. And I'm not talking about Richard Carlson's Hokey Texas accent (straight from the Georgia part of Texas, I think). It's just stupid. No one in the movie acts like a real man. Nobody. And nobody does anything credible or interesting. It's not even a clich√© festival. It's just 80-something of the frames that go by. It even made Harry Carey, Maria Ouspenskaya, and C. Aubrey Smith boring. Now it's incredible.
