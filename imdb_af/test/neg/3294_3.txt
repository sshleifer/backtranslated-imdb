I grew up to sitcoms like Seinfeld, Roseanne, Simpsons, etc. In other words, mainstream television. Over the years, many sitcoms have come to the air and from those who are a very small percentage really smart and funny. The Home War is an excellent example of the majority of modern American comedy. <br /> <br /> I give the show a 3 out of 10 because it's what it intends to be a comedy, but that doesn't seem to be going out of its way to be a good comedy. A good comedy should wipe you with your big jokes, you can't see them coming and in TWAH I see just about every joke coming. The characters are probably the most simplistic and terrible stereotypes I have ever seen on the screen, and the play is not very good, except for the father who portrays a stereotypical beer drink sport that perfectly loves the American idiot. <br /> <br /> Poorly acting, amazing characters, and jokes that don't catch you, detract from this performance to a point where it's unshakable. If you don't have a cable and would like to see a comedy worth watching, try Boston Legal. It's more worth your time.
