This early movie by director Bob Clark ("Porky's", "Black Christmas", "A Christmas Story") didn't really pump me as I expected. In fact, it teased me straight. It's about a theater group going to a burying island, consisting of dead criminals, where they plan to divert some evil forces and some bodies. The leader of their group, a confused black-magic enthusiast and possible homosexual efforts to call on Satan's help with the re-animation of a failed body, so that they take the body to the nearby home of the abandoned caregiver and play with it. . Nothing interesting happens until the last fifteen minutes or so when the undead finally come from. they are digging and going to the designer's. The makeup effects are okay, the gore is VERY minimal (PG rating), and the extremely annoying characters focus on far too much, which really comes to my nerves. I suspect that a group of horrible actors who have been playing for an hour is supposed to look like a "comedic" status, yet I have found no humor in it. The whole concept is just ridiculous - how these kids are prepared to dig and to monkey with a dead body as long as they have done. The characters are stereotypical and mere and the movie is just boring ... Don't waste your time ...
