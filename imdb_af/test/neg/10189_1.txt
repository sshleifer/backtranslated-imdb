After a good start, it was the worst piece of holier than you've ever seen. This film is an open insult designed to make you feel bad about not reading the "holy Bible". <br /> <br /> To resume ... ... OK, let's call it a plot. Basically, strangers are not kidnapped (people we already know). No, indeed, his demonic powers kidnap people who are in new age or witchcraft, or read porn magazine (like one protagonist). <br /> <br /> It's completed with the little emotional piano music when the main character realizes he has to follow Christ blindly to be saved. <br /> <br /> A quotation sums it all up, imagining a subtle piano music in the background: "You can't let others, even those you love, stop the Lord." <br /> < br /> and we are supposed to live in an enlightened age ... still work to do. Boycott this piece of crap
