It's just one of the hundred million movies where directors are trying to move too much into a movie that's not dramatic at all. As in the beginning, the part where the monk woman moved the arrow into his own hand, the arrow shot five minutes later the same arrow. No sense. <br /> <br /> The only thing worse than the plot line is the CGI, which would be very competitive with a homemade flash movie. The actors seem to be doing their best to portray a lot of 70 robots; the dialogue makes so little sense that it is not funny. Many things just happen with no explanation on how or why, as a lady suddenly wanders in a zoo that closed hours ago. And when she saw that this thing was flying to her, her first reaction was to take a picture, rather than what she did ten minutes later - running (not even running) as her life depended on it was, of course, not. <br /> <br /> Overall, not recommended. Let me wish they did new episodes of MST3K.
