Franco films can be divided into 4 categories: the "earlies" (often black and white and inventive), the "naughty" (late 1960s / early 1970s, which often relate to Soledad Miranda), the "naked" (from different periods but with full use front female nudity as plotry) and "rest". <br /> <br /> It's part of the "rest". It's not a cannibal movie at all. This is definitely not gorefest. The few women in the picture do not even lose their loins and there are few full frontal things. The picture quality on the German DVD I watched is poor. The movie falls out (as far as it ever gets fire). As a Franco fan, I'll tell others they shouldn't worry. Do something different with your time ... read a book .... get a copy of "Women in Cellblock 9" ... anything really ...
