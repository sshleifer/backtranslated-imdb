If you want to enjoy the money you would spend to rent this money, buy a bag of ice and watch it melt. It's more entertaining than this movie. <br /> <br /> Bill Cowell, ashamed of you. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, go into a wheat field, bring two of the most annoying little girls you can find running for a few hours while the girls scream as hard as possible . Then send me the couples you would like to spend. <br /> <br /> After enjoying the sequel, I enjoyed the first Dark Harvest, I'm going to cry myself to sleep.
