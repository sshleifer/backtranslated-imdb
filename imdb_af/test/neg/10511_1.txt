It's 2005, my friends ... a time of great special effects and an era of technology. So why can't we see a movie that was a bit more thought of than this stocking low-budget movie. I've seen many low-budget movies that shoot off my socks, but this one ... it's almost like it's terrible. Just ... don't look. I could look at the lack of special effects and computer-generated scenes if the acting itself was at least good. I feel like a little kid who produced this whole movie. There is not even an original plot line. Vampire Assassins, by themselves, is one big plot hole with an attempt to mock him. Can anyone tell me if it was designed as a comedy movie and I just didn't know it? That makes me wonder, what has the successor for us who loved the first installment so?
