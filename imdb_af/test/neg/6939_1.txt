For an unknown reason, 7 years ago, I watched this movie with my mother and sister. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard with them. This movie was so bad. How prosecutions are produced is beyond me. It has been a while since the last time I saw this movie, but the one impression it held with me recently was: "They had to find the script in a dumpster in the background of a cheap movie studio , made in a "movie", deciding that it didn't suck enough and made it worse, I'm pretty sure they've spent all the budget on camera work and the so-called special effects, and then 13 cents after the script AND to pay the "actors".
