I usually don't write reviews, but this "movie" was special. I couldn't turn it off. I don't think I've ever seen a worse movie, but I was watching. It was like a terrible carwreck with blood flowing across the highway. It was disgusting, but I couldn't turn away. Where do I start? The movie looks like it's a sports thriller, but it's so completely ridiculous, it can just be a comedy, but it's not funny, even in a stupid or stupid way. It's like watching your cousins ​​try to shit a family gathering. It is painful to watch, but at least it is only for a minute or two. Second String went on for over an hour. <br /> <br /> Anyone involved in making this movie should not work again. The writing, directing, acting, and everything was just awful. The problem is that I can't describe how bad it was; you just had to see it. And I'm sure it'll never be shown again, so if you haven't seen it, you're not happy. I mean it was almost worth seeing just because it really appreciated me for every other "bad" movie I've seen over my lifetime. And for every movie I see in the future that I can't stand, I will think for myself, well, it's not bad as Second String.
