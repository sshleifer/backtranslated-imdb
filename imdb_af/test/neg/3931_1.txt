Harrison Ford plays a policeman in a crime thriller. The perfect ingredients that make it the best entertainment with Harrison back to his Indy and Han Solo best protect a witness of relentless and ruthless killers. How easy it is to be deceived. If the film was concentrated on the supposed themes of crime and tension instead of putting up barns and putting ice in people's faces, it might be worth it. Incredibly predictable with the best method of sending an enemy is with wheat.
