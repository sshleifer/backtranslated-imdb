A friend warned me it was the worst movie he'd ever seen. I was curious because it developed a cult status. I love a very strange indie cult movie so I gave it a shot. I have to agree with my friend. It's a steaming pile of dung. I'm sorry for the people who love this movie, but I can recommend much better if you want to watch a twisted Indian cult movie. Try Peter Jackson's Dead Alive (also known as Braindead), Cemetery Man (also known as Dellamorte Dellamore), or Modern Vampires.
