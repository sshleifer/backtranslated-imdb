Unfortunately, this movie is not very good. But does it really matter? We all know the basics of the story, and it has nothing new. But I love low budget horror & sci fic camp classics ... so I forgive this one. About the only thing someone remembers of this movie, that little Leonardo DiCaprio made his debut in it. <br /> <br /> He did OK. The part didn't ask for great acting skills, and the direction probably never gave him the chance to offer one anyway. Little Leonardo DiCaprio was very cute ... and so was the girl. The movie is fun if you like horror and sci-fic camp classics and are experienced to watch them.
