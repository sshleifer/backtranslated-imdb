It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. What a bad waste of Michael Imperioli's obvious talent. Disgusting movie from start to finish. All I can say is this director is not a "author". You never get into the game, the character's head, the wonderful talent with numbers that had the right Stuey. The coke scene is bad enough to throw your shoe at the set. It might have been a wonderful scene if it was shot for movies and not the stage, with the camera halfway across the house moving across a mirror with drugs on it while the drama goes far behind. The scene where he wins the big championship is just aloud. It should be watched in Film-up 101 - What not to do in making photos.
