Take your camcorder, your little brother and the disturbing neighbor next door who pours boiling water on wax plants; and you got a movie yourself! Well, that's what these guys thought anyway. It was so bad that I couldn't remember most of it, except for flashbacks that were comparable to someone who was touring in 'Nam'. Despite the really crazy title, the terrible quality, the terrible actors and the clich√© writing, I think this movie is not the worst I have ever seen. I save the slot for everything with stiff seagal, Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude van Dam. Anyway, if you don't have the options to find new "horror" movies that you haven't seen 1000 times (as I was) and you discuss this one, I would still skip it. it had absolutely no redeeming properties. This terrifying serial killer thriller was a poor, painful attempt to make an even B movie. If they are really happy, it can make the Wal-Mart $ 4.50 bin. but I doubt it very much.
