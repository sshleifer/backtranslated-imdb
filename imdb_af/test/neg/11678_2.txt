The film uses random events of historical importance as backgrounds and willy-nilly crosses the lives and timelines of its 3 central characters. For what purpose can one ask? The problem with this movie is that the writing becomes the "story", not characters or their lives. <br /> <br /> It begins with a bunch of rich, aimless college kids (and some non-social ones too) pulled into the Naxalite movement. Affair, rejection and separation follow. People seem to go their own way. Only until the heroine forces herself on them. Not once, but twice. After a break in the Movement, the next obstacle to this 3 is the state of emergency imposed on Indira Gandhi. Many political figures walk around for no clear reason. The subplots are too continuous and do not add up to make a logical whole. <br /> <br /> The movie is trying to impose a fake pace but never reaches a real rhythm. Rarely connected at times, there is no aging and growing whatsoever in the bows of the 3 former college friends. Even after they are allegedly married, engaged, settled or whatever, they are ever too eager to demolish it and go to a town to have sex with the ex-lover or ex-flame. What fertile imagination the author-writer possessed. So many 4-letter words are used without any row or reason that it is offensive! <br /> <br /> Chitrangda Singh has a terrible American accent that she doesn't try to hide. His horrible audience has her mouth-clich√©-ridden dialogue like "What's this?" I didn't think you would come (it's after the bright nightmare she was just passing through) or, in the beginning, "I appreciate your concern, but I can take care of myself". Yikes. What kind of clown did the dialogues write for this? She invites her friend to have a cup of 'South Indian' (no less) coffee, someone wants Good Morning and then Good Night is won by someone else in the family. Now, how about?!? <br /> <br /> The innumerable incompetent villagers and tribes are the best actors. The editing is really volatile with too many clips. Obviously it is difficult to make a brave statement. Sudhir Misra spent a lot of time on this one.
