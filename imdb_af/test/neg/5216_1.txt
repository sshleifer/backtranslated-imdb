This is another of those fundamentalist Christian movies that hit you over with religion like a sledge hammer. You know you're in trouble when setting the story completely ridiculous. Three men fly to Mexico to deliver Bibles. It doesn't make sense, as the church is Protestant and most Mexicans are Catholic. Protestant and Catholic Bibles are not the same. The Catholic Bible has books in it that are not in the Protestant Bible. I also find it hard to believe that churches in Mexico will not spread bibles to them. I can understand whether they are going to a place where Christianity is in the minority. But Mexico is far-fetched. If you can't believe setting up a story, you don't do the rest of the story either. A movie about religion can be entertaining, but not this movie.
