After reading the novel being read for about an hour, it is a sad disappointing experience to watch this movie. Just as he did in the prince of Egypt, simon wells somehow managed to send a script that took away all the drama and secret from its source material and turned it into this homogenized nonsense. Now I'm a sucker for cheese and camp, but this movie made absolutely no sense. There was no joy in any of the performances or any humor. There was no excitement and that foolish bookstore with Addy's character of filby throwing his hat in the air was the last hackwriting straw. I broke a lot when this movie was over and I still refuse to believe it was just 90 minutes. It went on forever. I wondered how the studio and director could have had such a random script, but then my friend had the movie for me exactly as it was, and I said that's good, but what happened to the movie.
