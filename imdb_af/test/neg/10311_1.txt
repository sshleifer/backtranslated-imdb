The previous comment is a way to be generous. This movie is a waste of electricity and plastic. On the other hand, I had lots of fun giving it to friends to preview and describe it as "out of faith". "No words can express how I feel about this." "This movie will move you." As expected, friends took this indescribable comment as enthusiastic endorsements. They were wrong. The sadistic pleasure I swore to this was worth the $ 5 I paid for the movie. On the other hand, one (former) friend says I'm back to him 90 minutes of his life. I especially enjoyed the "gun's eye view" of parts of the movie. Actually wonderful, it's absurd.
