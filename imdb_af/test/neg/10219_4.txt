By the 1950's Randolph Scott standards it is a disappointing and heavy-handed star star. Two or three characters can be completed, while two or three other characters can be given more prominence. (The humor has to be completely rewritten.) The Toth treats the action well as always, but his understanding of the overall narrative is poor.
