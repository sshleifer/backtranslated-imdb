This is a handbook example of how Hollywood does not trust filmmakers, and pandas to its great name stars. The character of the Christian has been completely rewritten, the anti-Semitism Noah's faces of his own army unit are virtually eliminated, Michael's story has changed considerably, and the end result is to proclaim the power and terrible beauty of the book. I almost wish I hadn't even seen it, because of the ability of movies (sounds and images) to resonate so strongly in your brain; I'd rather have left the impression of the book. The book could be written today, it is honest and brave. The movie, either. My advice: SKIP the movie; Read the book.
