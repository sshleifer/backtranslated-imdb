I was so offensive by this movie that I just had to write about it. Please be my humor. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming virtue, beyond good work, is that it's not over the past 107. minutes. Even the length is about 30 minutes long. <br /> <br /> Comparisons are made here with the dazzling darkness 'The Grifters,' but I can't see it. They are two different films altogether. The closest 'Swindled' comes to an existing movie, The Sting, which was made in 1973. It borrows (sorry, STEALS) freely from this beautiful George Roy Hill entertainment, which is exactly what it was. I enjoyed it because it didn't pretend to be anything else. <br /> <br /> There are so many red herring in Swindled that I thought I was in a fish tank. It's very confusing, but it's just one of its many problems. Most importantly, if you make a movie where everyone is lying to everyone, where everyone is going, we have no anchor to ground us. The inevitable result is a mish-mash of very messy seconds from other capers. <br /> <br /> Just about everyone in this movie is fucking and offensive. Certainly, a basic Film 101 class will tell us that the audience needs to take care of someone. "We can't care for anyone here: they are ALL pigs. It could have been like a quick comedy, but it plays straight from start to the end. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, don't read anymore. GREAT 'SPOILER' COME SORRY, BUT I SHOULD DO IT. <br /> <br /> There is so much fake blood and so many false murders that it does not yield credibility - it destroys it.The end is absolutely ridiculous - a "murder" in a full airport that is not at all a murder? , simply stand up, brush him off and walk away, drip blood, with the booty, while police and horde people watch, and no one intercedes, the director must have many cojones if he thinks we're supposed to Noirish B 1940s films have done better. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of European movie, but it confirms that schlock doesn't always come from Holly wood does not come. As far as my "Swindled" is concerned, my judgment lies on a well-known line of exaggerated producer Samuel Goldwyn, who knew everything about schlock: "Exclude me".
