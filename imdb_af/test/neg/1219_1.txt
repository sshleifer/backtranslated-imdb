This movie is beyond any limits. It's amazing - a very bad ripoff of Jaws and other (better) shark movies. A very bad one - everything is really pathetic. The story is pure shit, actors are bad, effects very cheap, no creativity whatsoever. It looks as if some really weakened children have taken Jaws writing and arranged it randomly, then his parents took their 8mm camera and shot the movie with their neighbors. The music is really inappropriate, just a "lift" music, slim and too optimistic when nothing happens, then slightly less optimistic when shark is around or when kids get depressed (listen again to VERY LOOG elevator music). Carlo Maria (the author) should be ashamed that he should ask for his name to be deleted from the titles !! The movie serves as a perfect demonstration, how shameful music will destroy *** ANY *** scene that is supposed to be exciting. However, there is one big difference to Jaws: In the beginning of Jaws there are comments about stupid people trying to kill shark with dynamite. Well, there is an attempt to kill a shark with dynamite. If it doesn't work, guys take a *** BIG LOAD *** of dynamite and spend like 1/4 of the movie by placing explosives in a sunken ship. It's really original way to catch the fish I have to admit! They use as much dynamite as they would try to kill a battleship (I would suggest Bismarck class of battleship) or to dig another Panama channel. It's just incredible. I'm glad they didn't try to use napalm flamethrower or tactical nuclear strike to eliminate this bad, about 2m shark. Well, there is mystical disappearing indigenous Indian (who also looks like the German pensioner) in this mess. It's not a movie, it's a warning example how bad the movies may be! As a warning, this is helpful. But the public must be protected from this crap. Most Italian movies are bad, but ... that's really exceptional in the worst sense of the word.
