This two and a half hour film was recently shown at the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). There was a scheduled 1 AM show afterwards, but wondered if someone would be awake to see it until 3:30. The opening scene is from a man walking in a field, and it takes four minutes for movie time. It's an ominous sign of what's coming: a good 144 minutes more of exactly the same. There is a scene of a man and a woman standing on a wall standing in the sun. It is repeated 15 times, with a very sparse dialogue. Sometimes these very long slow rows are interrupted by shocking stills, such as a close-up of female genitalia, shown for one full minute of movie time (hearing aids laughing for the past 20 seconds, like saying, "what's the message?"). "). The story looks like Dostoyevsky's novel "The Karamazov Brothers", in which a chin falls in love with a woman of easy morale. In one of the rare moments in which the crowd laughed (more in desperation to try to justify having already been a full two hours to see nothing happening) was the statement of a British tourist that he did not clear things could not see The Eurostar train was 180 km per hour, translated by the translator with the automatic switching of units of the English system to the metric system, so they could not see things clearly, as the train was 300 km per hour. What was wonderful about this movie is that the quality of cinematography shows that a lot of money has been spent on it. It was not an 8-mm experiment in the film kitchen. It has been carefully planned, structured, acted, modified. Yet I did not get so much of it. Some comments relate to the turbulent detail, such as the minutae of a dandling key chain on a newly opened door. All right, it's been noticed, but what was the purpose? Some obese people in the audience walked away after the first hour. The rest stays out of curiosity: something has to happen at the end. There was never. And maybe that's what the film is about. All the movies at the theater are action packages. This one wants to be different. Nothing happened.
