I saw this movie when it first came out and hated it. I only saw it 27 years later. I really liked it, though Robin Williams was totally wrong for the role. What I remember most about hating the movie is that it was almost the opposite of what I understood when reading the book. Since I didn't read it again, I can only give you impressions of the past - but I'm sure of one thing - the movie is an attempt at family life, while in the book almost ALL traditional institutions - including, and perhaps especially marriage - are shown to be jackets that will escape our good. The only positive in the book is the wonderful nature of children ... something that only captures the beginning and end of the film (with that incredibly beautiful baby floating in the air.) Bad Williams doesn't have a tenth of its charm !) My low point is therefore the fact that the film misrepresents the book. As a movie on its own, it does get better, but only for a few key achievements. Mary Beth Hurt is wonderful - I think anyone is watching her fall in love with her. And John Lithgow, as a former soccer player who had a sex change operation, is fantastic ... he never camped or made the character once, but made it worthy of praise. And so his performance had an incredible integrity. I looked at him in all his scenes, and he never once was female. Nothing in his show ever came near the show queen's show ... and that made the difference. In fact, of all the people in the film, he is the only one who is impeccable. It is worth seeing this movie just for his performance.
