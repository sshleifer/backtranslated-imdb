Weird with unnecessary singing and background. Coincidentally, much of the action will take place on stage, giving the feel of opera performance. None of this explains why it is such a bad movie. <br /> <br /> It is the impression that either not enough rehearsal has occurred or that an experienced choreographer was not available. The acting is flat. Even the sparkling Ziyi Zhang looks like she's just waiting for her next move or line. You might see the trivia on this site and declare she spent half an hour in Japan drawing and dancing. Read it again over 2 weeks and start making sense. Even worse are the little kids who look after their parents at the back of the studio, rather than at the camera. <br /> <br /> The cheapest and cheerful sfx is only cheap and cheap. The editing is staccato chops peppered with slices just nothing to add, except annoyance. Just think of all the stupid dance performances of the recent Zatoichi - especially the closing routine - run by your local high school drama club, with one well-known actress speaking in another language (but you only get her because she's so good, usually despite being unsuitable), recorded on a cheap camera and then processing the length in no artificial order three times.
