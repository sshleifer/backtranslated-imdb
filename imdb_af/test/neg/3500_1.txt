Terrible writing, highly confronted, of a "do-gooder" who knows absolutely nothing about racial relations in L.A. or the US in today's day. The good positive reviews are a mystery to me - but it can only be provided by people who think that someone's "good" intentions should be applauded, no matter how level, simpleminded and just totally unrealistic the results. If you want to see a film that is realistically dealing with modern L.A. race issues - the movie you need to watch (and probably have seen) is Pulp Fiction. There is more honesty and realism about race in any two minutes of that movie than in the full 4 hours (oh sorry, it just feels like 4 hours) of this stinker. <br /> <br /> If anyone ever needs evidence that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, then this is the movie for you.
