A horrible, horrible, horrible movie. I saw the original when I was a kid and it gave me nightmares in my teens. When I found out that a remake was on the way, I sighed. WHY, WHY, repeat a good movie? Well, we can thank Dark Castle for the buggering yet another classic horror movie. This time they replaced a somewhat interesting story with gore, slower than slow pacing, and yawn-inspired characters. Someone previously said he / she was surprised that Paris Hilton could act. Uh, did you watch the movie? She plays a fun little bump. Sounds like typing to me. Half of the people in the audience actually called when she died! It tells you why people see this movie. If this is your only reason, find a better one, because like a black hole, this thing will suck more out of your life than you want. If I was alone, I would have left the boring exposition for 10 minutes. This thing is like a moron's guide to making a movie. In the Southern Git, the stupid but attractive leaders, the knives are a lot, a plentiful, stock-threatening truck, I can continue. After watching this movie, I greatly appreciated Jeepers Creepers, and I thought the movie sucked. Save yourself and avoid this crapfest at any price.
