Linda Arvidson (like Jennie) and Harry Solter (as Frank) enjoy a romantic try when they walk her father Charles Inslee. furious, he chases Mr. Solter out of the house. Fearless, he goes to her balcony and begs her to swallow. Me. Arvidson is pleasant and goes packing. Then burglar George Gebhardt came to rob the place. Although he doesn't get much in the booty of the booty, Gebhardt's prayer succeeds in using Arvidson's tribe to escape the police? <br /> <br /> A Great Comedy. Note, during the balcony scene, Solter goes out of the camera so burglar Gebhardt can enter the house unnoticed. And Arvidson travels a lot of light, for there seems to be nothing in her heavy skirt; Maybe she just wanted to cover Beau Solter? Director D.W. Griffith, Robert Harron, and Florence Lawrence are illustrious extras. <br /> <br /> ** A Calamitous Elopement (8/7/08) D.W. Griffith ~ George Gebhardt, Linda Arvidson, Harry Solter
