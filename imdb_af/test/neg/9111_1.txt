***** At the end of the film I give two strings. Don't read if you want to watch this movie for some reason. <br /> <br /> Oh, that's bad. And for some reason, Sean Bean, one of the greatest contemporary actors, sold and appeared in his soul. The only consolation is that the screenwriters must have realized that someone as eventually pathetic as Steve Guttenberg can never strive to kill someone as cool as Sean Bean. Instead, he was killed in a wonderful turn at the end, by the good man who was supposed to be killed by Bean, but he was actually his boss and declined his own death. Do not worry. I didn't destroy anything for you. The acting itself is spectacularly apostate, with Guttenberg's patented "Hey-look-I-can-pull-a-Chuck-Norris face" hard man who dominates most of the two-hour hell on earth. At a plot I could have written while tortured and hung upside down with both hands cut off, there is also a completely indiscriminate critical error in the fact that the one moment will escape the virus if they look so wrong, a Another moment, Steve Guttenberg is brave to run around, throw, catch, and generally abuse a virus. It has the distinct appearance of a collection of the little soap cookies you put in your bath. My last word? If you are depressed and feel you want to laugh about something that has to be a bad comedy, but worse, stick it the next time it is on midnight on channel 5 and burn it if you realize I do. tell the truth.
