I hired $ 5 to rent this full piece of crap. Dr. Zack is the most inseparable main character I've ever seen. The movie was full of every click you could ever imagine and didn't contain a single OUNCE of originality. There was the typical sexism portrayed by rough foreigners, all the guys having the "too proud to give advice" attitudes so old as grandma's Christmas cake. The concept and deaths were really cool, but they lost all novelty as soon as the monster was revealed. (read the SPOILER at the end). Nothing else is really revealed, but the end is the biggest cop-out you've ever seen. I predicted everything before it happened, including who would die and how. The dialogue is missing, and this is by far an understatement. There is usually only random screaming, considerate looking and lots of sentences. The actors are just GOD RELATED! I don't want to talk about this movie anymore, it hurts me. I just wonder if the director even looked at it when it was done. <br /> <br /> (SPOILER ALERT! SAVE 5 DOLLARS!) The monster is just a lot of "developed" ants, so now they need. legs so they can move, (remember that this is not an evolutionary benefit at all, and that the ants have just killed those who were available, although the film behaves like they need. This end made me dumber.) The end is the main idiot who kills the maiden (a great bloody thing) that destroys all the other ants. Beautiful cliche eh? He almost came to an end as a result of a sudden emotional attachment to the maiden who conquered him. Give me a chance.
