Volcano is in Los Angeles where a slight earthquake has just hit, which is the boss of the O.E.M. Mike Roark (Tommy Lee Jones) decides to go short and late, and there he sees that everything is good, but then drives to the epicenter of the earthquake where seven underground workers were killed by a fire or intense heat of some kind. Mike is not sure what to think, but he brings the geologist, dr. Amy Barnes (Anne Heche) in trying and explaining things. Unfortunately, a large underground river of molten lava is released to the earthquake and eruptions at La Brea Tar Pits send the lava pouring into the city street and everything touches it flames. Mike, his men and the emergency services cut out their work to stop the lava river and save as many lives as possible ... <br /> <br /> Targeted by Mick Jackson, it was the second major budget disaster in 1997 about the idea of ​​an erupting volcano with Dante's Peak (1997) being released just two months or so before the volcano and while Dante's peak is almost no masterpiece, it is slightly better and more likely than volcano. The writing here is total nonsense and is in no way underground underground rivers of lava that look as if it looks and then disappear just as quickly, the different character's thumb of a river of lava that has not yet been affected by the heat (When the man is on the train the metal seats around him begin to melt, but he stays perfectly well, as far as I know human skin is not as heat resistant as metal, is it?) and it happens constantly, flying helicopters are clouds of if (in reality this would be impossible), a simple block at the end of a street will stop the flowing lava (which is from the other streets and other directions?), a perfect ditch in a street and then blowing a big building To make a massive dam and when Kelly sees the lava heading to her car, she comes out like anyone but for some reason just stands there watching two firefighters get burned to death and waiting for her father to save her even though this stage has burning her leg, in spite of all the concrete blocks joined together to make an obstacle in less than twenty minutes, make the man such a good job, can not penetrate and saturate a little molten lava except that massive building that falls on Tommy Lee and his daughter. then it's both good after that. The character is also terrible, although they were not as cliché as usual, with no romance between Tommy Lee and Anne Heche and minimal city officials trying to bypass Tommy Lee and Anne Heche before labeling the guardians. There are some poorly written and sometimes embarrassing moral moments such as Los Angeles rally, the black man and the semi-racial cop who warm each other and at the end wish each other well and that little child at the end when he says "everyone looks the same 'is a bit worthy and is definitely a ham-fisted attempt and trying to say what color we are, we are still human beings. We can all meet in time of crisis, as it brings people together. To say that I think volcano is one of the bad ones is good movies, entertaining and moving at a decent pace, but expecting nothing in reality or any human drama. <br /> <br /> I think a movie like Volcano can be seen as an update of a 70-year-old movie like The Poseidon Adventure (1972) or Earthquake (1974), but on a large budget with modern effects. To mention the effects they are alright, but there is nothing so much and the pieces are also surprisingly forgotten, sure there are some impressive explosions and a few OK lava river flowing through the Los Angeles effects flow, but little else. In general, volcano is not very exciting and sometimes unintentionally funny and completely ridiculous. It doesn't really work as the makers planned. With a so-called budget of about $ 90 million, it opened for a little under $ 15 million at the box, it looks good and there is a lot of fire, but nothing stands out. Volcano is a beautifully forgotten movie overall. Filmed in Los Angeles I think most of the places appearing here were shot in their real-life venues. The movie goes through the movements with some terrible dialogue and ridiculous set pieces to compete with. Tommy Lee Jones deserves better than that. <br /> <br /> Volcano is a bit of a disaster in both senses, it's a disaster-themed movie that eventually ended a bit of the disaster itself. Worth for some unintentional laughter and the ridicule of everything, but it's nothing good and I doubt I ever want to see it again.
