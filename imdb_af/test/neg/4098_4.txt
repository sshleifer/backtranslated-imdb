Although I enjoy Steve Carrell's work, Evan Almighty, like so many other exaggerated films, is much worse than I had hoped for. It was a chaste family movie, a kind of well-known comedian to improve their image, but eventually failed to deliver. <br /> <br /> The usual Carell's brave humor is almost absent from the movie and although he made me visit me a few times, there was nothing hilarious about him in Evan Almighty. <br /> <br /> Although his 3 children were probably somehow important to a Biblical character, it was very useless in the movie and the terrible actors. Even his wife was a bit of a third leg for such a simple storyline. <br /> <br /> Spending as much money on making a comedy was a big mistake. Although Carell's career might benefit from this movie, there is no real reason to see it. <br /> <br /> If there was just a little less of his family, a little more of Carell, Molly Shannon and maybe another SNL throw, it could have been much more fun. <br /> <br /> 4/10 for some chuckles here and there.
