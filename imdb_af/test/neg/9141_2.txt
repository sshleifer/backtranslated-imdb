It's a failure that's so complete that I'm angry. <br /> <br /> All the subtlety and structure of Reggio's early films is gone, leaving nothing but a haze of digitally pronounced images that seem to be the only purpose. Bad things people do. Just like Star Trek-like worm charts, slo-mo colored seascapes, mutiplications of obviously fake computer icons, and shots of athletic games that also show that no-one has ever been able (or even fit) to move Leni Riefenstahl for filmmakers, with an overlay of video color scheme that an 1980 producer 'Dr. Who "as" to cheesy "rejected," adds a controversy to "civilized violence"? There is no intellectual, emotional or visceral connection between these images as assembled and mutated by Reggio and far too many digital effects artists, and the cautionary story I suppose he wanted to produce, with all the "dramaturgical consultants" involved, no one seems to have his head saying something important and thinks they might not say something new <br /> <br /> Only people who watch too much television can make such a movie and believe it is meaningful, that is kindergarten Stan Brakhage, and ultimately relentless in his relentless obviousness. and tension here (unlike in "Koyaanisqatsi" where the ruthless beauty and strangeness of time-changing ordinary images forced you to consider their meanings) was when the DVD I watched stuck and skipped. for the Noam Chomsky crowd, based on reflex rather than reflection and means nothing. Two stars for the music, which is in Glass's best Pomo-Cesar Franck style and which contains passionate cello from Yo-Yo Ma. (I hope for the sake of his knowledge that he should not take his parts for a play of the movie; there are a few things you do not have to do, even for a payment card.)
