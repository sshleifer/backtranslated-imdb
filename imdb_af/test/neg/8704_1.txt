As a Christian I am furious after I only saw the first half of this photo. The film's website says they researched the film before they wrote, but I believe they forgot to consult the ultimate source THE BIBLE. I put in two different versions of the Bible and couldn't find half of what was happening or said in this picture. It was as if they had made up what was not in the Bible and changed what was in the Bible that they thought modern movie viewers wanted to see instead of the truth. I'm personally too young to remember the Ten Commandments of 1950, but it can't be any worse than that. I wrote to the network and can only hope they apologize to the public for this travesty.
