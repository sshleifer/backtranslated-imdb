Inexpensive teaming of recycled film material, music and ideas, this movie can't really be called "good". But for me, when I considered it a teenager, it was quite amusing. (I have never known the BATTLE BOTH the stars.) In retrospect, it has something nostalgic about the SF wave of the early eighties and the special effects of this time. The trashy old-fashioned appearance and its naivety offer a certain attraction. To enjoy this movie, I recommend concentrating on the paternal relationship between the characters of Vince Edwards and David Mendenhall. In addition, I like the notion that a lot of crooks are discovering his heroic traits after being involuntarily confronted with the challenge of caring for a child.
