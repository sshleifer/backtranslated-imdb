No! No no no! My whole being is rebelling against this terrible remake of a classic movie. I knew we were heading for trouble from the moment Meg Ryan appeared on the screen with her ridiculous hair and clothes - literally like a scarecrow in the garden she was digging. Meg Ryan plays Meg Ryan - how exhausting is it? And it got worse ... so much worse. The horrible clich√© lines, the stock characters, the increasing sentence I watched at a spin-off of "The First Wives Club" and the ultimate hackneyed schtick in the delivery room. How many times have I seen this movie? Only once, but it feels like a dozen times - nothing original or fresh about it. For shame!
