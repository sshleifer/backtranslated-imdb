Horrible Script, apparently directed by ... no one? The Marines cannot defend the monster with machine guns, but this time down as a 15-year-old girl kicks karate several times. It is supposed to be a luxury liner, but the Fancy Dining Room looks like a cafeteria in a hospital. They seem to have rented a high school for the summer, and pulled out chairs and things to decorate the set. In the final shot they are pulled from the water and into a boat and less than 3 seconds later they believe about two kilometers from the ship while it is sinking. How to make movies like this? I think everyone can be in a movie today. Aaron James, NYC
