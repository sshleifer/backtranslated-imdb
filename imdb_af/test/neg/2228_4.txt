Everyone who criticizes Sopranos for his stereotypical portrayals of Italians has seen nothing until they have a good look at this cornball gangster movie that focuses on a family so irritating. You almost want to rub them. <Br /> <br /> The parents in this clan are not that bad, but their two little boys - one total brat, one cloyingly cutesy poo - are impenetrable while their older ones are good-for-nothing. and Pollyanna daughter compete for public disrespect. But the grandfather of them all is, grandfather. As played by Chic Sale (in full "Day-nabbit!" Mode) he serves as the movie's moral compass and throws a large number of diatribes over "dang, dirty foreigners". If it's the good guys, it's not surprising that the actors of that era who played bad things became the big stars. <br /> <br /> Not that any star performances are found at the criminal actors, but at least they freed themselves better than the Grating Leeds family. The incompetent police officers do not even get enough screen time to drop things further. Only Walter Huston, as the district attorney, elevates the clich√©-riddled material into his useless efforts to catch up with levels in this mad. <br /> <br /> The movie earns credit for an early entry that would appear to be a very popular silencing-the-witness formula, and it does not fall into its portrayal of the difficult underworld lifestyle, but there are simply better and less xenophobic examples in the genre.
