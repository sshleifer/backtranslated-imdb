I'm not sure who has more fun, the people who wrote the reviews or the director of the movie. I couldn't read this comment anymore or watch this movie. I had to say something. <br /> <br /> I can see a low budget Western film made with passion and interest on detail, but using a garage with art deco lettering, pastel colors, actors apparently asleep As the writing is so boring and the boom gets on every two scenes, it's certainly not my definition of "one of the best Western movies not produced in the new millennium". <br /> <br /> If any of you guys had friends in the movie, just say it!
