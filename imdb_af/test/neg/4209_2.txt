See this used DVD cheap and got it for a bell. I also recently got The Octagon on DVD and bought that one to remind me because I saw it in the theater as a teenager and loved it at the time. The problem with the return of these American karate films is that I have seen many Hong Kong and Thai action movies ever since the fighting tones fall long, fast and jaw. I especially think of battles like Jackie and Benny "The Jet" at the end of "Dragons Forever", or Tony Jaa's circle-stair battle of "The Protector". The Hollywood kung-fu offers are not filmed right, and even make someone of certified skills, like Chuck, uncomfortable at times. And what's worse than a fight in slow motion? Then you know it looks normal, so they delay it for effect. It really emphasizes how ridiculous an opponent looks as they stand waiting just to be kicked in the chest. <br /> <br /> Poor Chuck, he has no intensity in this movie, and he also doesn't produce a fair threat. Compare it to his former co-star Bruce Lee, who had the charm and attitude to burn. When Bruce looked at some opponents, you could almost see the air creaking with him. In "Breaker, Breaker", Chuck accidentally kicked people, with complete negligence. When the judge sees him in jail and condemns him to death, Chuck stares at a sad look and I thought, "OK ... he's doing that" third eye "thing and going to grab the judge by the throat and come out of this ", but he does nothing but look up with an eye. Awful. And while the DVD cover gives you hope, with a run time of 1 hour, 5 minutes, it's actually 1 hour, 25 minutes, so there is another 20 minutes to see pain. <br /> <br /> For big fight action, Jackie Chan looks in the first "Police Story" .... the battle in the shopping center at the end is pure gold ......
