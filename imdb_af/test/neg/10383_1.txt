Let me tell you something ... this movie handles all the Troma songs and gore movies by hand, as it looks like it's a serious movie. From the horrible acting ... "I knew it, I knew she was in possession!" ... To the priest who accepted sexual favors and came into the showers with naked teenagers ... this piece of cake takes the cake. I try to compare it to another movie so bad. It may just be in a class. The kicker is probably some cardinal oversight production to make sure it was true to the real situation. I did not know that people from Backwoods were acting like absolute imbecile. I'm not sure I'm upset about renting it or stumbling across a comedy. It was a very guilty pleasure ... so horrible that I watched my hands halfway through my eyes (while I didn't laugh so hard, I was crying). The end simply made no sense, and the whole thing worked together perfectly. If you want to watch something so funny, here's your movie. If you want a scary movie on exorcism ... go ahead.
