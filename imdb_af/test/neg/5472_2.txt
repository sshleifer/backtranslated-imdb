Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance are legendary actors and director Kostas Karagiannis was the man behind the successful Greek Giallo-esquire thriller Death Kiss in 1974; And yet, if you combine the three talents, all you get is driving this full load! God only knows what Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance drove to die in this cheapest devil worship, but I really hope they are well paid because no one deserves anything as amateur as it resumes. The story focuses on a group of devil worshipers who kidnap some children and lead another group to go to them. The tempo of the plot is very slow and it makes the movie very boring. The plot is also a long way to be original, and anyone with even a passing interest in the horror genre will have seen something like that, and has undoubtedly done much better. The obvious lack of budget is felt throughout and the film can't overcome it at any time. It's really a depressing and unlucky watch and even a slightly decent end, is the front line enough to lift this movie from the bottom of the bar. Very poor things and definitely not recommended!
