It's a good time to say how well I think about this site: it gives me the opportunity to give back all the frustration I've lived for two hours, in anticipation of something to happen, to something that has to be said being, to be shown, subtly insinuated, for a symbol, an idea, whatever. No, just long, endless violets, interspersed with a tired piano. Tired voices, tired actors and bored characters and situations. Drilling is the long dead of the mind, and this movie is from that point of view a public enemy. How many thousands of living hours will still be stolen from thousands of innocent spectators. I do not claim my money back, just for my time and the time I invited people to watch this thing ... oh God!
