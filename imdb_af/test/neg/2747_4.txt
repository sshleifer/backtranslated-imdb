"AfterLife" is about a somewhat arrogant, fairly rich man who discovers that his mother is dying, and finds himself at his sister, who has Down's syndrome. He can't be bothered with her and basically wants to get her out of his hands; He has better things to do. At one point he finds that he has to take her with the car (she doesn't like flying) across the country. <br /> <br /> If it's all for you, it's probably because you `Rainman, a movie that is much better than its mimic, 'AfterLife.' The fact that it is the basic point of departure (that is, some characters and even scenes) is not the fundamental problem with the movie. The fundamental problem is that I don't care about these characters. <br /> <br /> Brother Kenny (Kevin McKidd) is a little female. He has a girl who comes and goes in the story, and learns to keep the Down's Syndrome sister (again, it is taken from "Rainman"). He is a journalist trying to get an interview with a doctor facing a scandal. If he stops looking at Roberta, the sister, he doesn't have much time for her and sometimes leaves her too long. When she walks, he even becomes angrier to her. Do I paint something by saying that at the end of the film he becomes a more beautiful, loving person? <br /> <br /> Roberta is not determined to be "normal"; she is 'normal' and wants people to stop treating her differently. She is played by Paula Sage, an actress who has Down's Syndrome, and her performance is easily the best aspect of the film; why did the scriptwriter not explore her character anymore? Well, probably, because that would mean the characters would get in the way of the story. When we certainly know the story, the filmmakers haven't seen the problem they created? <br /> <br /> For a movie about a dying mother and her disabled daughter (the father is absent, I think he's dead but I'm not sure), it's amazing how little the impact the movie has the emotions of the viewer. The screens are performed in such a standard, dull way, with such a standard, predictable dialogue that I have rolled my eyes. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against sentimentality in movies, but it only works if you care about the characters. Here the characters are so uninteresting and two-dimensional that I don't really think there is much caring. "Rain Man" has an emotional climax, but it has moved me because I care about the characters. <br /> <br /> Speaking of climax, this movie has a stinker. There is a sequence at the end of the movie that starts out as an incredible situation and ends in even worse territory; An unforgivable cruel trick is played on the audience. The sequence is designed to move the audience, but ultimately it becomes terribly manipulative and insulting the intelligence of the viewer. Audiences are not stupid, and they know when the film is deceiving. What a cheap shot. <br /> <br /> There isn't one scene in this movie that has its impact. There are a few series that are funny, yes, but if the characters talk to each other, I can move the script ahead of me, move predictably and uninterestingly, hitting anything that touches the mind or heart. There are those fine arguments reserved especially for the movies, where the other character knows exactly what the answer is. Why is it not supposed that 'realistic' movies don't realize that in real life anger can be irrational, and sometimes people can't express their emotions, and they can say things that don't make sense or can't say anything whatsoever? All the actors in this movie deserve better material. This movie is not based on facts, but I think a documentary about a family with a Down's Syndrome member will be much more interesting. So we may have had truth and emotion. For some reason, the characters in this movie think an emotion is just saying something out loud and making an appropriate facial expression. <br /> <br /> ** (out of 5)
