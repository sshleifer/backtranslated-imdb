Now any Blaxploiation fan will recognize the ingredients: great Afros, topless babes, surreally bad fashions and a jive talk. In this case, add an unmatched advantage, a plot that makes little sense, editing by someone with no hands blindfolded and the most divine scenes and you have 'TNT Jackson'. Not bad enough to be good, but not good enough to be bad, it's a wonderful mess from start to finish. I especially loved the endless errors of continuity and the head's white stunt double. <br /> <br /> It's so seventy bad Far Eastern martial arts meet black power it hurts, but son hurts it! I am ashamed to admit that I almost enjoyed it.
