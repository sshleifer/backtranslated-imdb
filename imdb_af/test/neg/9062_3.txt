I saw this movie with a friend who ran my marathon with me, and we both had the same feeling: it wasn't terribly motivating and didn't even have the idea of ​​what a training schedule would look like, so that Marathoners can get an idea of ​​what it will take for them to train and run one. In fact, there was almost zero technical information. I didn't expect it to be a technically heavy instructional video, but when the information was nearly zero, the film was just not balanced and it wasn't particularly helpful for non-marathons considering their first run. <br /> <br /> There were other issues. Some of the very first images were people falling close to death trying to run a race. Yes, really inspiring. The timing was also difficult to follow, as it was semi-chronological, but the filmmakers seldom gave you good clues as to what time you were watching. And they kept information back. You see that Kantor has an injury, and you just assume that it is out of all her training, but then there are several scenes later that they eventually refuse you because it is about a pine cone in her garden. <br /> <br /> However, some Spare Parts were very good, like the little bit about a woman defending racers, who wanted the run to be men only, and the cover of a Chicago race, where two of The races that were portrayed earlier are in the first place. <br /> <br /> From the top of my head I think of other chronological documentaries, such as Supersize Me, and Grass, where you always know where you are, and you feel they tell you everything you wanted to know. /> In short, it would not have been difficult to make a better marathon movie, and as it stands, I cannot recommend non-marathon educators to educate and motivate them to don't try, because I'm not doing 'I think it will have the effect.
