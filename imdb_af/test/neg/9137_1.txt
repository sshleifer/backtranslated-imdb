The director Godfrey Reggio must be a very charming and persuasive man for this fear-based project to see the light of day. Reggio's message, as powerful and resonant in his previous two Qatsi films, is hopelessly listened to here. Athletes, equations, oceans, keypads, laugh heads, etc., blend without purpose. The parade of banal images is mostly generic supplies from Getty Images et al, and the heavy-handed digital manipulations are amateurish in the worst way possible. Surely someone involved (Steven Soderbergh, executive producer?) Showed that a zoning filter was used almost every frame was a BAD BAD idea? The raw loop, layer and image distortion reminds a hotter Photoshop class. And to make matters worse, computer animation sequences are more artificial than an 1980s Wall Street pie chart. It cannot be said that improved aesthetics will only save this film, but some low efforts in this direction would have made it possible for visual music to accompany the music. I feel compelled to point out that Philip Glass's score will satisfy his fans. Not a radical departure, but rather a refinement of which Glass is best with lovely violin contributions by Yo Yo Ma. If you decide to watch this movie, draw your attention to the short opening sequence. While you may already be familiar with Detroit's once majestic but deserted Michigan Central Rail Station 89 minutes later, you will remember the 20th century image itself as the critical point to follow the EXIT sign / hit the STOP button, etc. You're warned.
