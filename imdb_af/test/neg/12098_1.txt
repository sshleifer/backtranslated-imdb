This is one of the worst anime shows I've ever seen. Looking at the manga review in a magazine, I thought it might be interesting, but when I got the chapters, I realized it was a complete stupidity. OK, the first 2 or 3 chapters are OK, and the series has a default. But as the plot progresses, it becomes completely incoherent. The series tries to show some mystics based on Christian mythologies, but it is a total stupidity. It contains some demons and stigmata scenes ... totally nonsense. It seems the series is trying to look deeply, complexly or mitologically, but a viewer with a little brain and cultural references will soon realize all the elements used do not have a real meaning: they only get there imported. THE GREAT WATCHERS! <br /> <br /> The last chapters are full of nonsensical elements: fights with cat-eared demons, references to a supposed battle between demons and demons that control time (without clear reason). The final is completely nonsense; An ignorant keeper will see a swinging final giving them a place to meditate; but the truth is: THE FINAL AND COMPLETE SERIES ARE A TOTALLY UNCERTAINED AND MISSING NON-CENSION.
