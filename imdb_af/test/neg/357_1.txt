I just watched this movie in Bravo! and it was absolutely horrible. It has the plot of a Shannon Tweed movie without the nudity. The point of departure was interesting enough, a winning lottery ticket in a secluded area and people who have reasons why they want the money. The characters were thin as were observations on human nature and greed. <br /> <br /> For a movie called Class Warfare, it had very little to do with other class differences than the first 20 minutes and the predictable ending. This movie could have done much better if there were more characters with motivations to get the ticket and was "who did it?" <br /> <br /> The acting wasn't fantastic, but it's hard to be credible with such a terrible writing. Lindsey McKeon is very cute and I want to see what she can do in a better production with a better script. She's probably the only reason I put the whole movie. <br /> <br />
