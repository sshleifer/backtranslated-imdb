Arthur Hunnicutt plays a very stereotypical role as a mountain man (probably the Ozarks) who is hunting with his favorite dog. However, the dog looks drowsy when Hunnicutt jumps to him. It becomes clear that although Hunnicutt and his dog move around after leaving the water, they both died in the water. No one responds when he speaks to them and sees and hears people talking about his and the dog's death. Still, strangely, Hunnicutt is VERY slow on the recording and it takes him a while to understand they are talking about him! I think it's actually done as a padding, because there wasn't really enough material to fill the half hour slot. <br /> <br /> Later, in the "surprise turn" he comes to heaven - or at least his concept of the place. He is invited, but since they do not allow dogs, he has other ideas! Overall, pretty well done but of dubious spiritual value! With no quarrel or irony, this episode is a bit dull - not "Twilight Zone-y" enough for my taste.
