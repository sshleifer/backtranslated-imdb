Sorry, I love Ray Bolger's work, but the one thing he is not, is a leading man. Maybe if you pretend to be the last man on earth, this romantic plot can work, but come on! <br /> <br /> Here's a movie just to show the title song a big hit for the Basie Band the year before (1951). And some beautiful, fine singing and dancing, save it as a total disaster. <br /> <br /> However, the story line is pathetic, even by 1952 musical comedy standards. And the other songs are as forgetful as Evening In Paris cologne. The dialogue gives the stars, Day & Bolger. Only Claude Dauphin's Boyesque charm keeps its character three-dimensional. <br /> <br /> So how to enjoy this movie on video? <br /> <br /> A.) Fast forward through all the dialogue .... <br /> <br /> Give yourself an idea of ​​Doris Day's choir and Ray Bolger's detached footwork. And don't miss Dauphin's hilarious attack on a rainy, windy April repetition in Paris.) Finally, keep a few bottles of Cabernet cold and convenient. </ P> <p> br /> <br /> Bob Raymond
