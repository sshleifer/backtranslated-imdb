This film explores the now infamous Wannsee Conference, where the top Nazis met to discuss the organization and implementation of the "Final Solution". First, I want to say I was surprised to see Kenneth Branagh playing a Nazi player. With the smooth blonde hair he definitely looked the part, but he didn't really do it well. There was nothing of the threat and cruelty and in the end he came out like a smile. The real Heydrich would not have left the conference as it was in the film. <br /> <br /> The best performance of all was undoubtedly Colin Firth, who played Dr William Stuckart, the man who wrote the 1935. Nuremberg racial laws and "legal respect" for everything the Nazis did. Firth's performance was beautiful, the mainhearted opponent of what Heydrich suggested. The best part of all was when he was verbally one of the Nazi thugs. The rogue murmured: "I will remember you" and Firth answers "you must! I'm very familiar!" The film is historically accurate, but let's cook it to what it really is - 90 minutes from a group of men around a table that discusses, screams and bragging. There is no excitement, no real conflicts (except the short argument). It's just 90 minutes of talk! Same room, same table, same people. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if the DVD is worth the money. I changed one feeling briefly.
