Let's not make ourselves ourselves, okay? We all know this movie was made because of the success of the "Grumpy Old Men" movies. Unlike these, however, this travesty has no humor and very little heart. <br /> <br /> Gloria DeHaven is the only gleaming light seen. It breaks my heart that she finally got the chance to show her skills to a new generation of movie gems just to end up in a piece of liquor like this. There was a pleasant scene pointing out that she was raised by someone she fell in love with. Her good performance was the only quality performed in "Out To Sea". Everyone else just goes through the movements. 10/02
