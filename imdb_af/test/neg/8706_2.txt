With a name like "10 Commandments" you would expect a movie representative of the account in the Bible, specifically Exodus. Not so here. This is standard procedure with any Biblical Hallmark-made movie. Remember "Noah" ?? It was perfect fiction and one of the worst movies ever made. At least, this movie had a "truth" to the original story. But Menerith, who was an important character in this movie - Moses' half-brother, is not in the original story. Other characters were absent, not to mention that important events were completely eliminated. So what can you ask for? Because it must be representative of the real story; Otherwise, some might and believe it is the way it actually happened. In today's age people get their faith from movies instead of church and read the Bible. It's also a big mistake. See Revelation 22: 18-19. The writing has already been written. Why does it change? Unlike the account in Exodus itself (which should be the main focus), you have the Cecil B. DeMille movie to compare it, which is clearly a much better representation. <br /> <br /> The night first broadcast it. , my wife was anxious to see it. I told her not to get her hopes because it was a Hallmark movie. She was surprised and said, "Why? Hallmark makes good movies". It may be so, but they are beating the Bible. I'm sorry to say I was correct. Not just the story, but also the acting. With today's technology you should be able to make a wonderful Biblical movie. I'm still waiting ...
