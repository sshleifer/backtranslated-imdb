<br /> <br /> This movie really doesn't matter. With the reverence that Phillip Seymour Hoffman played on his constipation and other toilet tumors in a 2.5-hour movie, you know they didn't make cuts at all and literally broke the crap. It is a waste of good talent and a total embarrassment. Terrible! <br /> <br />
