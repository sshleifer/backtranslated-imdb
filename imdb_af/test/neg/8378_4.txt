A bad Quentin Tarantino rip off, at least I hope this is where they go, because at least then I can respect the director for the admiration of Tarantino. One play a "singing" play with Rose McGowan was very well done and genius for this movie and could only be put to the test by the director. In addition to his Quinton inspiration and Rose McGowan and her one good scene, this movie sucked. From the crappiest dialogue I've ever heard, I'm willing to know why McGowan doesn't speak much, because of how difficult her dialogue would have been. Try to be funny, never, try to be dark and are not, try to be stylish and are just fatter. Who makes the money to make such movies, I hope it was all the directors so no one else's money was wasted. If it's not McGowan, the whole cast is very awful and if McGowan is your best hmmm, I have to wonder.
