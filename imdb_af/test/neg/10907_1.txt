Nothing about this movie is good. It is a formulated predictable "romantic comedy" aimed at forcing women to watch their important others. In other words, it's a predictable chic flick that isn't comical or romantic and is extraordinarily forgetful. If you like to watch the same thing over and over again, this movie will just fit perfectly. I was also forced to see it with my g / f at the time and it is no surprise, we are no longer together. I enjoy great movies that are great to watch while she just wants to see the same thing over and over, just with different actors. Nothing good to say about this movie. The title says it all. 1/10 (one b / c I can't give it a zero.
