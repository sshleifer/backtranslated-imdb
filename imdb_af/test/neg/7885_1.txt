This is one of the rare movies I didn't discuss with my friends right away after watching it. It wasn't because it particularly encouraged or impressed me. On the contrary, it didn't matter to me. <br /> <br /> Why? Because somehow everything was so exaggerated that I couldn't take this movie anymore. There was so much sex and violence that I got the strong impression that the film was very, very difficult to be offensive, as if it were in superlatives, rather than telling a convincing story about two women in a spiral caught. of crime. <br /> <br /> Baise-moi was described as "Thelma & Louise with real sex" for me. Well, that's true the main idea is similar. There are two women traveling through the country because they have committed crimes and know that their lives are now over, police are going to catch them and they decide that now everything is over, there is no way to hold back . <br /> <br /> Baise-moi was described as a feminist movie where women, who had previously had masculine domination, had vengeance on the men they encountered. <br /> <br /> This is something I have never interpreted in this film, simply because none of these women were ever innocent and because they not only kill irresponsible, violent men, but also men who deceive themselves , men who have the feeling of wanting to do protected sex. And they killed women. No, they are by no means better than the characters they encountered and abused in shameful, brutal ways. <br /> <br /> How easy it is for the "heroines" to kill and how much fun they take in them It is absolutely impossible for me to talk to them or even take them seriously. It was just too much. Too much sex, too much violence. I have the feeling that sex and violence were just there to create a superlative in filth, rather than conveying a story or making a point. <br /> <br /> Baise-Moi left me unimpressed, I didn't think, because it was so far from any real world. So built, unrealistic and over. <br /> <br /> There was nothing I could do with this movie. There was nothing else to think about, except "Why did they make this horrible movie?" If the intense unpleasantness of this movie was going on, I easily accepted it. But since I didn't find anything, since the story of the movie was no more than an excuse to print as much and ugly sex as possible in one movie ... I threw it away under "unnecessary torture", never decided ever EVER, look at this movie again, and now consider it the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Worst, not only because it's not really my cup of tea to watch people being raped, rape, have sex in other forms and kill each other ... but because it was makers wanted to tell the world with their movie ... if they wanted to say something ... it just didn't work. And there is nothing else that can save this movie, as it is filmed in such an ugly style.
