I love movies ... and rarely do I see a movie I hate ... but it was the worst movie I've ever seen, or at least closer to it. Any movie ending with a rape scene is terrible. Hands off ... I can't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie. I'm really angry, I want my money back and my time back. Awful! Don't go to see it, cinematography is terrible, the plot is terrible, the end is terrible. I didn't know what was going on during half of the movie, because I couldn't see it (and I watched a very big and big TV). Tenancy, the hills were eyes or house ... any of those are better if you want something scary.
