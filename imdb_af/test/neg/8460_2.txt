If it is nominated by the WGA, a professional screenwriter association, for a scriptwriter, then it is time to hang up the word processor. Surprisingly written writing, direction, production, at every level, even for a TV movie. No cliche is unused in this jaw-bad movie. What do they think? Does anyone really think children are foolish enough to watch it?
