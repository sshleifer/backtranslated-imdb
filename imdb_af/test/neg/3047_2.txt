It starts interesting because there is a carnival right next to someone's house with an oily right also there and a kind of shopping street across the street with a neon "Jesus Saves" sign, right in one small area ... Now is it pretty brilliant, if it is unlikely ... then we go straight into the movie which is unlikely for new levels. Of course, it is a lame remake of the 1979 excitement, Carol Kane, who is the babysitter Jill Johnson ... Now Jill is a chick running her cellphone, so high her evil parents are punishing her by finishing her job , probably something that the audience can identify these movie targets. Jill is taken to this large and fine house on a lake in the middle of nowhere (of course) by her father to babysit for the Mandrakis family. The children are already in their beds just as Jill arrives, and the housekeeper is still there, huh, she can't babysit? Of course, despite the remote location, one of Jill's friends, one with whom she apparently has issues like in a boyfriend or something, appears. Anyway, the alarm in the house goes without saying any reason and then calls from someone are coming, calls from someone who wants to kill her. Of course, Jill calls the police and since there is no real threat in her life, they blow her off, but tell her to call back if there is anything else they can do for her. Look at the scene with Jill and call her friends at the high school bonfire / pep rally or whatever. It looks like a Burning Man festival, ??? ?? There are all sorts of similar scares in this, including the cool cat Chester, of course, here and there, one of the most beautiful horror movie cliches there. I will admit that I have rushed down here at some point, and have I missed something? Hard to tell, or care about, really. It's one of those movies that makes me wonder how badly the remake of "Amityville Horror", "House of Wax" or "The Fog" could have been. Anyway, from reading online reviews, it seems as if the people who were most scared of these 12 year old girls, and I can only accept it from statements like "it made me my pants." Well, you can only hope that it will put an end to Hollywood remake of movies that were not exactly stars but did not bet on them. 2 out of 10 and I'm excessively generous.
