During the summer, the throat line for this attraction is very long, as it is a water ride. It's very well-themed, but many of the ride's artefacts seem to be out of order. Overall, the trip is not worth it if you have to wait almost 2 hours. in line. The drop at the end is exciting, but the whole ride itself could have been better. Creators for Indiana Jones may prob. helped these Hollywood designers. Also, the ride often breaks down and causes even longer waiting periods for others. It is also very unpleasant if they only have one float that is open and not the two, as they are supposed to. During Halloween Horror nights you drive in the dark and it's exciting if it's your first time, but if it's not, don't wait in a four-hour line.
