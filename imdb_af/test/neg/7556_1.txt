I can't really remember any details of this movie, except that the institution was extremely well known. Then I realized it was filmed at the Lazy Lizard Hostel in Moab, Utah. It was one of my favorite places to visit when I was younger and drove around the country. The man who owns / manages the hostel managed to get himself into the movie. All I remember about the plot of the movie is that it involves jeeps and naked women. It's great to just look at the scenery (I mean the rock formations). If you're just looking for softcore porn, you'll probably be better served elsewhere. I don't even know if this movie is available on tape or DVD.
