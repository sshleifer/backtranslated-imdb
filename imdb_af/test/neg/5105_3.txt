I was prepared for a bad movie, and a bad movie is it, so I think I shouldn't complain. Twentysomething Tom (gay poster boy Robert Stadlober) has so many issues he doesn't know whether he is coming or going. I wouldn't have stayed, but for the pretty girls: Serious Mavie (Anna Brüggemann); No-nonsense Angie (Emma Daubas); Sarah Baumann as the star of the movie in the movie. And then there's Tom's soul mate, Wild-eyed Margarete (Jana Pallaske). She reminds me of Béatrice Dalle and Gina Gershon. If you have to remember, these are good memories. She looks good even in the most ridiculous outfits, and I mean ridiculous, even according to Berlin standards. I wonder if I wanted this movie if I was the characters' age. My guess is that I wouldn't do it. Watch out for indie idols Oli Schulz and Max Schröder from "Der Hund Marie" who act as street musicians, feel no pain.
