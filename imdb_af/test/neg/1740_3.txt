This poor attempt to deceive your distinctive Japanese horror movie toward a terrible cult hit does not need the ammunition to keep the viewer through. Translated to vortex, Uzumaki is about just that - an irrational and abundant tribute to the strange downward spiral in nothing that apparently captivated a tiny village in dementia obsession lunatics. While it definitely makes a pleasing b-movie on the surface, the traditionally tiring play, direction, and twist will all shake their horrors in as much as Asian horror. Instead, translating into the Japanese equivalent of an early David Lynch piece exhausted it to be a spiral before it even had a chance to explain itself. Of course this is not the case. Apart from some clever techniques used, the film rarely connects the dizzying thematic themes with the dull essay. It eventually appears as an inexpensive exploitation in the cult genre, which replaces hollow imagery for real substance. When the movie ended, there was almost nothing gained from any interactions except a small number of scenes or images that rose above one note film. I welcome the makers at least to try to take the genre into more supernatural, metaphysical realms and to understand the coarse losses that are lost in translation, but with zero dust to restore any of its freakishness, it will probably be rejected to obscure the fanboy's bong. -round cellars.
