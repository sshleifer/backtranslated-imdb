In the animated series: <br /> <br /> Aeon Flux was an amoral rebel that was completely detached from everything and everyone. She was cruel, selfish, loving, unpredictable, spiritual, caustic, confident, sarcastic, deadly, intolerable, ambiguous. The original Aeon had low depth layers. She almost never allowed her personal emotions to pass through. The original plot was wonderfully ambiguous and thought-provoking. You can never tell what Aeon's motives were. Aeon was a militant anarchist, while Trevor was a radical idealist, so they could never have a stable relationship. <br /> <br /> In the movie: <br /> <br /> Aeon Flux works for the Monicans and her political motives and personal motives are very clear. She was beautiful, loving, vulnerable, easily tamed, emotional and very predictable. The Aeon in the movie had at most a low depth. The plot was clear and confronted. Everything has been completely explained from the beginning. There was virtually no conflict between Aeon and Trevor, at least in terms of personal philosophies. The only conflict between them was that they were on different sides. <br /> <br /> The movie was a terrible disappointment to me. I betrayed me. They got the idea of ​​one of my favorite animated characters of all time, squeezing all the depth and personality of her, and pumping her full of Hollywood claws. The essence of the animated series was completely lost in this movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn't give this movie a "1" is because the footage was incredible. It was neat to see some of the famous animated scenes like the fly in the eyes of CGI.
