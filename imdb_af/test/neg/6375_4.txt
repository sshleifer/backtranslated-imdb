Don't get me wrong, the man is a successful dynamo, but he went up by selling too many plastic toys to impulsive brats. So I get a bit cut when looking at comic book fans as an extension of the same market. <br /> <br /> See, "The Invincible Iron Man" wouldn't be bad if it was dragged on a Saturday morning. and exclusively aimed at careless children. But it is not exclusively aimed at children. Peripheral characters are killed every five minutes and there is plenty of bloodshed and semi-naked bodies to make net sensors so that they are not completely cut out for children's television. <br /> <br /> So, which audience is this video aimed at then? It's the audience that enjoys integrated story lines about the revival of a tyrannical Chinese emperor with 5 arcane rings, that's who. And I think the audience is very small. <br /> <br /> Over the decades, many wonderful authors have passed Marvel's leathery yoni. So, it is a pity that Marvel would dare their beautiful animation investments on so many questionable narrators and scribes who, like Mr. Arad, better accustomed to action figures during Saturday morning cartoons. How many lukewarm receptions do they have to endure before they get a better strategy? <br /> <br /> *** <br /> <br /> Animation: just smart cells, some segments are better than others, a low budget all the time - that's not Bakshi (Ralph) and it is not Bluth (Don)! CG animation is okay, but far from impressive. <br /> <br /> Story: A litany of clich√©s, all around, winding, confronted and uninspired. <br /> <br /> Characters: So why is Rhodes even here all he does, is Stark's sexual ambiguity? Hmmm ... her father is in a wheelchair ... Tony misses his mother ... Asian chicks are hot and apparently little different; The female lead is strongly objected to by the function's end. <br /> <br /> Performances: Can't blame competent voting factors for bad writing. <br /> <br /> Art: many Western muscles, many clean lines faces are very much derived from Oriental art, very boring measurements, very bare CG. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Not great, but worth a watch for fans and those who enjoy superhero myths. A 'must-buy' for collectors. A valuable "not to do" course for junior animators.
