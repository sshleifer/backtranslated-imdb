If you've ever visited and wondered about Shenandoah Acres as a child, could there be a worse holiday spot in the world? Well, you could have watched this movie and had your answer. Flavia (a.c.a. Fistula) Macintyre's dude farm is frequently visited by Gordon's business disorder, as Jessica was 13 years old. But Jessica can find much more than fresh spring water with that delivery bar ?? buried "bakkies," lost jewelry, dead bodies, even a talisman who will keep her dressed like a slut and beating drinks with a pale and a Suzanne Pleshette-like while being hypnotized by an indomitable head. Angry, evil evil.
