I'm still wondering why I'm sitting through this whole thing. It only had about 3 minutes of real entertainment, and the rest was just a total drill. The acting is not so good and the action scenes are so cute, it's not even funny. I wish I could say something good about this movie, but I can't think of anything now. There were probably somethings in it that some might enjoy, but the end must be the stupidest idea. What kind of person will get a small toy with a remote control with a burned machine gun to kill the President? This idea could never have been done in the first place let anyone stupid enough to try it, I think the author should have been obsessed with the toy car in The Dead Pool, but actually tried this look to make it serious.
