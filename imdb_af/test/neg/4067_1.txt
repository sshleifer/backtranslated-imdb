My suggestion ..... This movie was really meant to be a "comedy", wasn't it? !!!! If not, producers, directors, actors and "hair stylists" should really choose a different profession! Now, the guidelines of my submission require a minimum of "10 lines". How in the world can I add more to this? Hmm ... Let me see. Oh yes, the start of the movie was quite hilarious with the crash landing scene. It is a pity that the plane did not hit the truck truck, and a lot of "martians" would have scratched the wreck (of course hiding) and decided to take over the world planet and make a better movie. Now it would be a good start! <br /> <br /> T
