Oh, dear, oh dear, oh dear. My lifetime is drastically wasted by this pile of stink. I'd rather chew my arm or watch this movie again. Painful story line, painful characters and painful two hours. <br /> <br /> The best way to describe this movie is as follows: - I would rather put pegs in my eyes and cut my brain than look at another minute. <br /> <br /> Advice should remain clear and let your local man in charge of removing this garbage. <br /> <br /> Lin, you told me it was good !!! ! <br /> <br /> Goodaleeby Load.
