You expect it to be youthful, but you expect at least a full and coherent movie. What a waste. I'm very disappointed, not just to watch a bad movie, but to have such a good concept is contaminated by a common movie we've seen before. If this mess makes $ 1 over its budget, the studio will be wise to declare victory, save all available copies, store them deep in the nuclear waste series under Yucca Mountain, and never make a movie like that again. Most of this movie will make you think, "It's not what I wanted to see." This film appeals to the unwise and perhaps teenagers. It's a real shame because most movies are made for that demographic. I had much higher expectations for this movie.
