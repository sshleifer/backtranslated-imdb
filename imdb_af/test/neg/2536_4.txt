Sherlock Holmes and the secret weapon start in Switzerland as the world's leading detective Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) manage the Nazis to smuggle a brilliant scientist, called Dr. Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.) out of the country. from London. But is London as safe as Holmes thinks? Dr Tobel developed a revolutionary new bomb image that will change the air bombing forever and he agreed to give it to the British government, but these Nazis want it as badly as Holmes arch enemy Professor Moriarty (Lionel Atwill) plans to Secret of the bomb sight and sell it to the Nazis. Add Scotland Yard's fine inspector Lestrade (Denis Hoey), Dr Tobel's love interest, Charlotte Eberli (Kaaren Verne), assassins, mysterious scientists and a confusing coded message. Holmes cut out his job to keep Dr Tobel alive so he can deliver his bomb vision ... <br /> <br /> Targeted by Roy William Neill Sherlock Holmes and the secret weapon was the fourth in a series of fourteen Holmes films made between 1939 and 1946 to use Rathbone & Bruce as Holmes & Watson. . Author Edward T. Lowe Jr., Scott Darling and Edmund L. Hartmann are based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short "The Dancing Men" & are not the Holmes murder mystery, as it is more of a war-time adventure story. To ignore what Holmes is about, solving complex crimes and mysteries is a big mistake as far as I'm concerned. The Nazis' involvement and the war as a backdrop for the story feel out of place, uncomfortable and just not. The dialogue is not good, Professor Moriarty almost feels like a memory as if they could not cope with it and as a whole it is much less encouraging than others in the series. But at least it's short. <br /> <br /> Director Neill does his usual efficient job, but you have to cut it a little slap and remember it's been made more than 60 years ago. It has no true style or imagination, as well as the atmosphere and plot. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is unaware, the black and white cinematography is good, although I understand that a computer-colored version is also available. . The play is good, Bruce & Hoey do their usual comic relief, and Rathbone's hairstyle looks in it looks ridiculous. I'm glad he changed it for later installments. <br /> <br /> Sherlock Holmes and the secret weapon were a disappointment compared to some of the other great entries in the series, there is very little I can recommend. Everything that made the others so good seems to be missing here. Solve this one so far and first look at the better, just for the hard fans.
