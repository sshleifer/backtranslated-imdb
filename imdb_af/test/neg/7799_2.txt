Surrender Cinema is known for their extremely erotic, almost explicit sci-fi movies. While generally doing very well at this (Femalien 1 & 2, Virtual Encounters), this particular entry looks just a rehash of old band. Any number of girls - some recognizable and others - are in this movie at all stages of nudity. There are also several tracks from other films that are outstanding, unless you've seen those other movies. There are a number of solo nudes that do a number of things - some play basketball, others talk, and others play with themselves. The only thing of value in this band is the very last scene - a short but erotic girl-girl scene with a very enthusiastic and enjoyable Sandy Wasko and a more subdued Tammie Hainum. Not highly recommended.
