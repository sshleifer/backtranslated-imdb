Once again I fell for it, in my roots I am looking for a fun and horrible horror movie, even a vampire. Even if it's stupid, as long as I get my fun gores in the mix, I'm a happy camper, it doesn't take much. So I saw the cover of "Bled" at Hollywood Video and was so curious about it, it looked so interesting that I decided to rent it. Why? Why do I always fall for it? Not only did this movie satisfy the satisfaction I needed for my vile and senseless violence and nudity, but I was bored. This movie has the kahoonies to say it's a vampire movie and it's really not! I'm so close to going back to the store and pleading with money because it's one of the rare times I actually turned off the movie. <br /> <br /> An artist meets a vampire, I don't think, I'm still figuring out what he was, but his name was Reinfield, so I assume he might eat a cockroach man who likes to freak people? I think I don't know. Anyway, does he think the artist has a certain flare for darkness, so does he give her a drug to go into an alternative fantasy where a vampire exists and needs blood to become alive? I think I don't know. So her friends get excited and decide they also want to try the drug, I think, I don't know. So after deciding to try the drug, things get weird, the fantasies are real, I think, I don't know, and the vampire now enjoys the will of big breast girls in shameful clothes. I think I don't know. But some of the girls actually become vampires? I think I don't know. <br /> <br /> Sorry for all the "I don't know," it's probably one of the worst reviews I'm going to write, but that's because this movie was just very boring, and confusing. I just love to see it, want to be actors you can tell, are waiters looking for that big break. Not too clever that they fell into the clich√© of the horror genre, sometimes it works and sometimes it is not, in this case they really have to read the script. Because the movie, the look, the feeling, the acting, everything about this movie was just bad, I really recommend that you pass the movie only if you see it at your video store. It might be an interesting movie with the concept of a different dimension, but why did they choose this director to show his "creativity" even if he did? It was a bad movie, just stay away. <br /> <br /> 1/10
