Blonde main character, always believe in everyone and if you stay together, you can do something! Shy old best friend with curly hair (rip off or Gordo) wants to be a film director, has a secret lover on Zoey. Spanish best friend (farewell to Miranda) Weird smart girl Quinn (rip off of Lary Tudgemen) and the popular runner off Logan (rip off of kate) And Zoey's little brother Max, annoying (rip off of Matt) <br /> <br /> Zoey is the semi-popular girl, with 2 best friends. The only thing missing is the funny, small, sacred cartoon, Lizzie Mcguire, and Hillary Duff was much better. Jamie Lynn Spears looks more like a tooth in a tube leaf.
