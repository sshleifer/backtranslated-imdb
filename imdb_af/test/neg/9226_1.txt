If the following looks appealing, bring it to your local Blockbuster and hire this movie after rush: <br /> <br /> 1. Awful 60's hairstyles, from pathetic perms to dodgy ducktails. <br /> <br /> 2. The worst child actor in the world ever, who does nothing but cry and says DADDY in the most boring voice imaginable. <br /> <br /> 3. Lots of footage from alligators and monkeys not related to the movie. Not at all. <br /> <br /> 4. Stereotypical Indians using blowpipes and talking gobbles. Oh, and it goes without saying that they are moving around a campfire. <br /> <br /> 5. Hilariously fake plane crash mechanics where the throw actually throws themselves into the corners of the cardboard set. <br /> <br /> 6. The outside of 5, which looks suspiciously like a toy ray on a string stored around a studio with blue light. <br /> <br /> 7. Terrible special effects that the one used in the first Star Trek series looks forward to. (Special note: The shiny hair's blue hair glows. Oh, dear.) <br /> <br /> 8. Low-level editing and continuity, where background items move between screens, the soundtrack changes completely without any warning. <br /> <br /> 9. Don't you have enough money to hire a professional dancer? Get any lady off the street to simmer like an idiot! No one will see the difference! There .. <br /> <br /> 10. An 'exciting' climax that includes mercury sand, snakes (more archives) and a ton of false blood. Don't forget to make a dumb "tribal" sounding song! <br /> <br /> However, the more sensible among you will be waiting for the inevitable appearance on MST3K when this classic TV show is resurrected and then you can see it in the spirit it was meant for. Any other kind of pleasure that can be obtained from this shit is unthinkable. Not to mention unworkable. Don't even try it. 0/10
