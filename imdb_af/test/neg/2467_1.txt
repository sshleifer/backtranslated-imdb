It's by far the dumbest thing I've ever seen on celluloid. I mean, we started looking at the assumption that it was a "T & A flick", but apart from a few boobs, it was. I mean, I get the point of making silly movies to show some sex scenes, as this is the only reason to make a movie of that kind. However, this movie has no sex scenes and has nothing at all. There is no linear time, the screens move around like a jump in the wind, people appear for no reason, then leave, and it is never explained, the plot has never progressed, and nothing happens. I have never been so flabbergasted about how bad a movie was before I saw it. Is the director even at a film school? Has he ever seen a movie? I don't know, but its appearance seems to have made a little moron with this piece, because it is still working. I literally ran away from this movie stupid, but I still recommend viewing it, as it should be shown in every film school of the country as an example of what not to do when a movie is made. Move over PLan 9 from outer space, you have a new contender for the worst movie ever made.
