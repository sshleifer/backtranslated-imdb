I waited for a while for this movie. In the first day of the air in Turkey I watched it. It was a disappointment to me. I was planning to watch a historical movie, but one in the screen was a fictional one. First, the main character of the movie Cengiz Han, the great conqueror, is portrayed as a soft, calm, even a loser. You can't feel the power in the movie. The war machine he created has historically been conquered in the years (even more) of the world. To do this, Cengiz first unites the Asian tribes. In the movie, however, this looser man is in one scene poor man and in the second scene he is commanders. War screens were incredible week. In the final battle, the Mongolian horseman used double swords on their sides and cut the enemy. :) As a result, my friends and I just laugh at those scenes. Mongolian army means Mongolian archer-rider. You can't see it in the movie. Another bad thing was the use of fantastic elements in the movie. I don't want to go into the scenes depicting Cengiz as a prophet. We can say in the integrity of the movie, it is acceptable. But the scenes when the old monk saw the future and Cengiz Khan's wife is looking for Cengiz to give him a mission is really funny. When the monk died in the desert, Cengiz's wife felt dead and found his body on the continent. We're talking about Asia? Again we laughed. There are many more things to say, but I do not feel that this movie is worth talking to.
