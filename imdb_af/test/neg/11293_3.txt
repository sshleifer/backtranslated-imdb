Well, I haven't seen the silence of the lambs yet. But I think I would have been sick if I saw this before this piece. Not from the horrific violence, but from the lack of everything else. Anthony Hopkins was very good as Hannibal and I really believed he was as psychotic as he did himself, but from the reaction of the audience around me, the film was filled with cliches of "Silence" that lost me on points where others laughed at what was on the screen. <br /> <br /> Now I heard that the movie would be very gruesome and if the director wanted to break out ... did he ... but only in 2 series? I mean, if you want it to be horrible and I mean, so horrible that you're going to play the movie out of it ... you need more than 2 sequences. I always see it as if a movie should become that spectacular jewel that will eventually take you to another place and time or go over the top (which is done most of the time in bad taste). But this movie put me in my chair and fell asleep at times. <br /> <br /> Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore are the stars of the movie, right? Well, with the exception of Hopkins, I didn't feel that way. Who dealt with the stupid Italian police officer? I definitely didn't. So, the movie is really with a big hole that speaks of a man who is dying anyway. I mean, come on ... who cares? <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, the movie is great if you want to see Lektor and Starling again, but if you are going for a very good thriller .. You will jump once and maybe pay out twice. It depends on your level. <br /> <br /> Think about how much money this movie will bring ... there will probably be another Hannibal and this movie won't be on video until autumn. If you need to see it, wait and save $ 3.50 - $ 4.00 and get it on video. Don't spend the big money on this movie.
