I bought this movie from e-bay as part of many twenty horror flicks, all over a dollar a piece. When I saw this, my first impression was that it was probably from the late 80's. Later I started thinking - the Linkin Park posters on the wall and everything looks like I'm dealing with a more recent movie. Realizing that the movie has become an unbearable pain. The last 3 minutes were the longest in film history - the film just refused to end. Is there a genre like "horror for children"? In that case, this movie is definitely it. If there are parents who are perverted enough to set up their offspring, I suggest that it should be perfect for children about 6-8. The only thing I really liked was Greg Cipes, who was too much an actor for the kind of nostalgic retro-bottom of a dual bill.
