I'm not a fan of the Monogram Chan movies. . The plot, which includes radium theft from a bank safe, is a bit far-fetched and far from the atmospheric riddles Fox produced. Mantan Moreland and Benson Fong (like No. 3 Son Tommy) give a little laugh as usual. But otherwise there is not much here. Great title wasted.
