Please don't save your time and money with this stinker of turkey. <br /> <br /> It's an over-the-top melodramatic love story that is against the backdrop of New France (aka Quebec in the 18th Century). Or is it a historical saga of New France thrown into epic romance? I don't know, and at this point I don't care anymore. <br /> <br /> There is a rich story about the frightened French adventurers, villains and other different characters that Canada and Canada have established. parts of the US. It is not so. The characters are total clich√©s, the story is overflowing, breathless and without any charm. And for a long time all the viewer wants to do, is the head out of the theater, gets his or her head checked and gets his or her anger to enter through the hype. <br /> <br /> This movie was the biggest disappointment of my year with regard to theater, especially since, as historian and French Canadian or Canadian of French descent (or whatever) I am a believer in the fact that the story of my people in this country still needs to be told as well as it could be on film. B) interested in this subject. C) A movie lover who thinks today that cinema can do wonders with this grandiose and tragic story. <br /> <br /> As I said, don't waste your time with this frustrating little slap.
