I don't understand jokes. I believe this is my problem with modern cinema, or those movies made with millions of dollars in the hope that it will be the next biggest sensation. Isn't that strange? People are laughing just as much, and I believe one of the diseases for the problem is the movie "Showtime". There was absolutely nothing, from the beginning to the end of the credits, with all the handling between Murphy and De Niro, with Russo as eyecatcher, with even standard cliches swimming the general population with preprogrammed laughter, there was nothing in this movie that don't laugh. There were not the remaining physical jokes or the calculated spiritual vocal jokes in this film debacle at all. From the start I didn't buy the match-up of De Niro and Murphy as anything more than Hollywood excitement. In the commentary, the director spoke sharply about the rogue and laughter that went on during the shooting? where was it in the movie? It falls either two problems ?? the director doesn't really have a sense of comedy, or the editor doesn't understand the value of the movie. Anyway, they both plunged into the Hollywood nightmare "Showtime" for a whole hour and a half. <br /> <br /> Outside of finding any reason to laugh, there was no reason to follow these characters through any moment of the movie. There was a look at humor with De Niro's desire to pick up pottery as a hobby (but the director had to write KILN on the machine so the audience would understand? WHO DOES IT?), But it is dropped and never not developed. There was the idea that Murphy was an actor, but outside that one opening monologue no one would have understood. He hires a room in a producer's house where he can afford a police officer's salary? It just didn't calculate for Hollywood standards. There was a bad man who wanted a big gun, but the gun was never developed, or was there a real test of weapon power? even at the end. It has become a bigger joke to laugh at an accent than to remember the guns. Where was the television show in this? Russo had to get permission from this random man at first, but there were no consequences. There was nothing in the middle of this movie outside of further questions and meaningless dribbling. Random characters have been introduced, forgotten, reinstated and forgotten. The director and producer laughed at it, while we, the spectacular viewer, had to suffer from inside jokes and cliché stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Was there a love interest in this movie? Was there a really sinister bad man who had set off from the comic duo to bring true evil to the screen? Were there any pop culture references that did not return to Robert De Niro? Was there random chaos throughout this movie? Of course, if you need the answers, you won't find it in "Showtime". The fact that I puzzled this review with questions about the question just means that this subpar (actually, much under sub-sub-subpar) did not fill a quota or look like value to the movie industry. Sure, it had big names and one very neat explosion, but there was nothing at all. It was almost as if the director said before the shoot that he wanted clichés, but not regular clichés? go with the bad people. The plot had no linear structure. The jokes were boring. The characters were murdered and underdeveloped. It is also among the best of "friend-cop" movies. I like to give movies the benefits of the doubt, but nothing has worked in this movie. Not even Shatner can save this movie, and he even tried hard. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can't, or I'll suggest this movie to someone with a pulse. The comment only confirms the pathetic nature of the movie with clear errors, terrible jokes and creators who question the validity of their work. If creators can't stand behind "Showtime", why should we? I didn't have a "Lethal Weapon" when I watched it, but I wanted something like that. I understand there was some criticism of reality television and the corrupt nature of the media, but the message did not dismiss it from the page. In fact, I believe I saw the media when I watched it. Shame wears his heavy hand with this movie and I can't blame it. Murphy was a big star, comedy was his middle name (see "Come to America"), but lately he has lost his edge. De Niro obviously wants to get away from an image that haunts him, but to make these kind of movies just goes back. One of these films is similar to a Scorsese photo. <br /> <br /> Skip this one. I promise, this will make your final movie days worthwhile. Oh, and if you laughed at any of the jokes in this movie? I'm really sorry! <br /> <br /> Degree: * Off *****
