I rarely translated a literature translation that was so heavily translated into the screen. The hysterical cast of b-movie and sitcom extras makes the characters just like bad Jewish stereotypes. Worst of all is Melissa Gilbert, who you hate one scene and never develop sympathy. Performances like this should be noticed and used against actors who want to work again. All in all, a lazy, low-budget-made-for-TV movie of the kind that gives TV movies a bad name.
