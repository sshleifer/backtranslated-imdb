Very interesting to find another reviewer who had exactly the same response to this movie as I did: It was a lot better than I was 10 or 11 years old. <br /> <br /> It sees more than 30 years. Later, it's still right, but it just kept my interest slightly. What was pretty funny was just a little amusing. <br /> <br /> Also, things that stunned me as a 10-year-old became so stupid. For example, in one scene Trinity walks together and burns his revolver behind him and kills two men without first watching. In fact, he doesn't even care to see if they're dead because he knows he's hit the point. Um, yes, right. <br /> <br /> In addition, much of the dialogue sounds a lot of wood. Sorry, but 35 years later, it didn't really get much older. <br /> <br /> Although it has been a long time since I also saw that one, probably a better Terrence Hill movie than this one would be. be my name is no one
