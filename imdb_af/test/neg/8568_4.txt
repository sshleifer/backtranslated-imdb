I'm a big horror fan, especially Spanish horror. This film has so many possibilities to be good. It's a great idea, a vigilante ghost nun, like most of what came from Jaume Balanguero's mind. Both visual and sound effects were also pretty good. But everything is shamefully spoiled by bad direction, terrible casting and a painfully bad (outline, outline!) Script. Sorry. Perhaps Balanguer√≥ should write and direct himself ... <br /> <br /> I don't really understand why it should be played in English by actors who can't speak English (and when they do that) , they do it so badly it just makes their performances even sneeze). Looking at contemporary Spanish horror movies like El Orfanato or Rec, the performances are completely in line with this kind of stylish ghost story - and it's realistic, credible like someone like ourselves, like real people, because it's the only way horror reaches its goal . Unfortunately, everything in La Monja failed.
