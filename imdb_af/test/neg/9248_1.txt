... or should I inadvertently say hilarious? Anyway, this is one of the best comedies I've seen long ago. Throughout the imagination of some of the stupid fictional characters I was this side of Homer Simpson. It's just one forehead-slacking, painfully silly scene after another, because the cunning, darkened cardboard cuttings that replace, push, pull and drag the "plot" to real-life humanoid characters to its inevitable and clear conclusion. <br /> <br /> If I had to describe this movie to somebody, I call it a mutated hybrid of Deadly Attraction, Dumb and Dumber, and the Three Stooges, with a "climax" that seems careless as the episode of Family Guy in which the whole family gets Botson family next time a fire in the lounge. <br /> <br /> Advice to Benson Family: The next time you get a new pet, the poor animal does a favor and doesn't call it Fred!
