That's what Disney Channel shows for stupid children. It fits them well. It's not funny, the acting is the worst I've seen in many years, there are more stereotypes than actors, and everything about this show makes your face and rolls your eyes. Want to know why? Not only is this show a waste of airtime, the main roles "actress" Selena Gomez looks like a pig. Jake T. Austin's character needs Ritalin. David Henrie's character has to visit and waste a strip club. The show's writer is also inconsistent. In one episode, the security guard is called "sir" with one character and is referred to as a woman by everything else. <br /> <br /> Hello? This is called trial reading and editing. Do this, Disney. <br /> <br /> Has anyone seen the promo for the new "four-part blood-glowing saga"? Disney wanted their own version of the Twilight vs Harry Potter thing. Except a million times lame. The wizards of Waverly Place Movie ?? Think about it for a moment. Family goes away on holiday and 16-year-old daughter wants parenting independence. THE SAME PLOT of the Proud Family Movie etc. ... <br /> <br /> What's worse is all the Emmies and ALMA say it. And most of the audience is some age's 4-13 (And no life teenagers). how many years more? before selena gomez shows her tits? <br /> <br /> and it's Disney shows are all crap..hack writers..hack shows..destroying the thoughts and wallets of today's youth ..
