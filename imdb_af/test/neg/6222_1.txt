I don't know where most of you were, but where I watched the movie, we didn't sing people as some told them they were experiencing, we laughed at people, mostly on the plot plot line, the terrible dance series and the song from the likes of Brosnan. The only people in the audience who were apparently struggling with the movie were the people of the seventies who were reviving some of the past with the songs. I was a DJ in the 1970s and even went to the ABBA concert at the Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton in September of 79, and I appreciated them and I still do. But this film must have gone the same way as their marriages and ended in divorce. The rows were so poorly staged, the dubbing and editing was absolutely terrible and it had to be Meryl's worst production. I can't believe an academy award winner would push so low to do this piece of garbage. So save your money, wait for it to come out on DVD and then spend your money on something better, such as cat litter.
