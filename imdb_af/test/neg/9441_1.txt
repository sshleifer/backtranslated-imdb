This film has absolutely no redeeming properties. It's not even worthy to be in the 'bad it's good' category - it's just bad. Poorly acted, poorly shot, poorly written, heavily targeted, horrible sound recording and the whole thing is just amazing amateur. How it got loose is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Oh, and can somebody say the main actress that if you play "crazy" doesn't mean you have to constantly fail with your hair - In a generally annoying movie, this is probably one of the most annoying things of all. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, I think it's the only movie ever to be a Nazi buggy.
