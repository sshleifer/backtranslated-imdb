Where the hell did VH1 get the scriptwriter for this movie ??? From high school? This movie is trying so hard to be sympathetic to Michael Jackson, but turned him into a horrible caricature. All the lines are filled with clich√©s, but surprisingly the play is not bad. As usual, it's a bad movie with pretty good actors. The actor who plays Michael Jackson, jeez, I feel sorry for him! I think he did the best he could with the poor writing. I didn't think Flex didn't look like Michael Jackson, I thought he did the best he could, but later when he had all that white makeup, oh man, he looked yucky! The other actors who played Debbie Rowe, Priscilla Presley and Elizabeth Taylor were pretty good. Except that Liz Taylor's actress looks too young and healthy to play Liz. The actress playing Diana Ross didn't look at her at all and I couldn't figure out who this woman was, but later on in the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie disrupts anyone who is Michael Jackson, or Michael Jackson's side. It does nothing to change someone's opinion. In fact, the only opinion anyone will have after watching this movie is, oh God, this movie really, sucks really! And where is Michael Jackson's wonderful music and songs? There is no one in this movie. Anyway, I'm from the soundtrack to this movie and I'll probably buy it if I can. <br /> <br /> However, on the lighter side, it's a very funny, campy movie! It's a great time warmer if you want to see something light that won't harm your brain too much. I will probably see it again, because it is just as entertaining!
