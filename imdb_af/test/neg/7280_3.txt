Notorious horror movies seldom measure the hype that surrounds them and I have experienced a worse offender than Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes. I've been watching it for years when I got it for Christmas and waited for an evening when my girlfriend was out to settle and watch it. She knows her extreme dislike for anything that is really scary. I didn't need it. <br /> <br /> Following a pledge - if known - it firmly starts the movie in the 'Desolution USA' world of survival horror, quickly catching up on things when protagonists and antagonists meet in the deserted residential area. <br /> <br /> It looks like it's been shot at a $ 5 budget, with the cannibal clan costumes being hired from a dodgy fancy dress shop that specializes in faux cave and red Indian clothing. The story follows an annoying bunch of impatient WASPs taking a detour on a road trip to California, looking for a silver mine in a nuclear test zone (!). When they break down, they are introduced by the local family of meat eaters and must fight to survive. <br /> <br /> While hoping for another liberation, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Wrong Turn or Devil's Rejects, I actually realized I stumbled upon something that had to be dusty and uncomfortable in a bakkie video store bakkie's bakkie. <br /> <br /> With liter of tomato ketchup for blood and some horrible wound-close-ups, I can see how an 18-certificate (in the UK) is justified, but with that close -ups finished, it would not have looked like a Saturday afternoon grille on ITV. <br /> <br /> The whole silver mine / nuclear subject subplot is just a McGuffin to justify the 'civilized' family against the primitive. But how easily the wilderness gets their asses, it has credibility to think they have survived for a generation who has been passing by. /> <br /> And then there's the end ... or the lack of it. The Hills have eyes that look like a third act, or at least a satisfactory denial. Instead, I just left and wondered, "Yes, and ...?"
