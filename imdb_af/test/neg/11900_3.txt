I hired this type of soft core, but I can honestly say I didn't expect it to be the same as Rod Steele: You just live until you die. It was sexy and funny. It had a good writing, a sincere leading man and a sense of purpose. It also has Gabriella Hall which is hot. The reason I didn't expect this movie was because the box lacks the "Must 18 to Rent" sticker. I was looking for more "cheese" and less "cheesecake." <br /> <br /> First, I think movies shouldn't be allowed to start "actors" rehearsing for a part at a talent agency (or where "actors" rehearse). In these movies, the "actors" exercise sees the highlight of the lack of preparation that the right characters in the movie have performed. <br /> <br /> Once I realized that it was a soft core movie, I didn't "make it down and ask my money back. But the dizzying way in which the extended video is added "erotic" scenes is probably a late-night pay-cable release, which is very annoying and easy to move through without the persistent quality of, for example, Rod Steele . You know they should have a little money because I think it's filmed overseas. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the main actor is trying not to waste the invisibility on himself, is one of the most baffling work I've ever seen. And I saw Torgo from Manos! It could actually have been the dollar rent (it and Gabriella Hall). Yet there are better corny movies to rent with your friends.
