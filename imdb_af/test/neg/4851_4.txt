I don't see what the whole deal is about this movie. Patricia Kaas sings, yes, and it makes the movie charming, but singing is not enough. I mean, if you want all the benefits of this one, buy Patricia's CD and enjoy! The plot is simple (if the "dreams" are omitted); The main characters immediately look to love each other immediately, and immediately forget their other acquaintances. Relationships appear almost "compulsory", and the small "detective stories" being thrown in just make things worse. What initially appears to be a perfect movie is first rolled up and then comes out just like a dream. I measure movies by how well I will remember them, and for this one I've already begun to forget the details.
