I have to say, this is the first movie I reviewed here. I didn't finish watching. I mean .. I can't go on! No matter how pleasant I am to look at things to the bitter end, "The Ballad Of The Sad Caf√©," no match for this viewer proved. Vanessa Redgrave stars as the Strange Woman in the City doing it like walking through the river with a full suit. Anyways. A lost family member comes to visit, he is a midget and? Well, it's as far as I have. What was the point of all this? ? I didn't even bother to wait for Michael Carradine to continue, because I was already relentlessly combining the slow script and talking in a dramatic role at a minute. I call this coffee table theater. from the cinema that only appeals a few scarce, but the others just stay away.
