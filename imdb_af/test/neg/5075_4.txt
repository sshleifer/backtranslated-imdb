Chaos looks good: pretty framed, good production values, high concept action ... <br /> <br /> But ... <br /> <br /> The plot has the unique performance of both smart and incredibly blatant be in the "how we actually have the money" mode and over-complicate in the "what it did and why" section at the same time ... <br /> <br /> In addition, Ryan Philippe is NOT NOT, seriously NOT tough or scary ... and he is not particularly tough or scary when he throws a tizzy fit. Honestly, his big eruption is the only very funny scene in the whole movie. Excuse him for turning off the role of Anakin Skywalker and doing it now. <br /> <br /> Stratham is usually good as the tough but quiet, hard nut with the humiliating humor, but here, the extra relationship lines are so nice that even he seems uncomfortable to say some of the clich√©d mush needed. More silent looks the best? <br /> <br /> Snipes are actually OK, but another nail in a talented actress. He needs an actor's role, not an action hero repetition. Perhaps that business with its tax will allow it to break that form and the public and critics will drop him the sympathy. It would be good if he wasn't all that complicated all the time. <br /> <br /> The lines these guys speak when they don't do the plot development and tracking work can be summed up in one word .... The film feels sorry and it never gels. I irritated it for the first 45 minutes and the harder last part was sensible. It might have been good, but it just can't solve the terrible lines, the overwhelming score and the general level of irritation with the levels of likelihood. <br /> <br /> Overall, I almost didn't experience it: incredibly annoying, and Ryan .... please, please, get rid of the goldilocks ....
