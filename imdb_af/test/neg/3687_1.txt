I never made comments on IMDb here, but if I saw this movie, I couldn't be silent. I just set up my account here just because this horrible movie. In two words, this movie is PURE CRAP. the movie is not at all! Nothing makes sense in this movie. To watch this movie was pain all the way. I don't understand why Val Kilmer agreed to do this movie. He plays a small role as a gang leader, says little words, and he is there like 5 minutes total. <br /> <br /> I just bought this DVD because of Val Kilmer's name on the box and the interesting pictures on the cover. <br /> <br /> As stated in other reviews, Moscow has stolen my money and I want it back !!! The title of the movie itself has given the idea of ​​the rating everyone should give: Zero
