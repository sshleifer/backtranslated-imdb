Predictable, greedy, excessive, mediocre. Don't waste your time - there are much better movies out there. <br /> <br /> Resurrection begins well, but the plot repeats quickly. My interest rate has gradually declined. By the end of the movie I was just glad it was over. The characters never developed fully. The cinematography is muddy and the rapid change of POV rotations - while impressive in 1999, is currently just the label to name the movie as an attempt to replace the flash and character substance. The movie shooting schedules serve some purpose (carry tension and anxiety), but are constantly overused and eventually become counterproductive. A disgrace in general - the film / story has, of course, potential and the producers / directors and actors naturally have technical skills. A disappointment.
