I agreed to watch this movie with a group of friends despite my horror of horror movies. However, it was not the shock of a monster that turned me off this movie, it was the horrible acting and absolutely disgusting end. Inside, or the Cavern, has no redeeming qualities - it is poorly crafted, legally written, sickly bloody, and the inclusion of the free-spirited final scene repels me. No, it's not my dislike for horror movies that makes me hate this movie. I have seen such wonderful teenagers as "House of Wax". This is the fact that the movie leaves you with the horrible understanding that renting the video, you support the creators of Binne
