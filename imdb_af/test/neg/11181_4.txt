Father Brown's thesis is that a good dose of Roman Catholicism will solve all the problems of life. A little proselytizing I don't care, but sometimes it becomes ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Some fine actors have played Father Brown over the years, Kenneth More and Barnard Hughes are two good examples. Alec Guinness plays him in this movie and does him right, but you haven't seen a big demand for future Father Brown movies. <br /> <br /> If you are a dedicated Roman Catholic, I think it's all perfect. good sense. It's much more important to catch the thief and convert it to your religion than to see that he has been brought justice. <br /> <br /> But that's what was asked here to accept. In fact, there is a preliminary story before the main action of the movie. Guinness in clothing is being caught to put back stolen articles that one of his congregation members, Sidney James, has robbed during a robbery. <br /> <br /> This is the story he gives to the local police and of course this is something James has. trust in him so that he cannot break the confession. <br /> <br /> Up to bigger game now. Master Thief Flambeau, played by Peter Finch, stole a cross assigned to Father Brown and said it was again in St. Augustine belongs. But Father Brown is more interested in Flambeau to go back to his faith than to let him come. So he misleads the police so that he can reach his mission. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but this whole thing was just too much for me to swallow. Father Brown I want to hate to say it is guilty of obstruction and had to be arrested. And he was not obliged to tell anything he knew about Flambeau. The man did not come to him as a brother seeking absorption and spiritual counsel. <br /> <br /> Author G.K. Chesterton, a well-known Catholic lick in his day, finds it very reasonable. Carried to its logical conclusion, we must replace all police forces with an army of priests. <br /> <br /> Guinness borrows from Kind Hearts and Coronets's own Ascoyne D'Ascoyne and from Barry Fitzgerald in Going My Way to create Father Brown. Granted though Brown is much sharper than the other two. There is also a little colonel Nicholson in this portrayal. In the bridge on the River Kwai, Guinness also played a character, which has a little strange interpretation of the rules, showed him what was important in the situation in which Nicholson was. <br /> <br /> Father Brown is an entertaining fellow when he mysteriously solves and makes the authorities seem foolish. We enjoyed Brother Cadfael doing it in a medieval environment and American audiences like to play Father Dowling a few years back by Tom Bosley. <br /> <br /> This movie must be held to be entertaining.
