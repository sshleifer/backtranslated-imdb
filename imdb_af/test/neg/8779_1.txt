I remember this bomb coming out in the early 80's. Initially it sounded like a good idea. A rerun of an American classic using modern day movie techniques. There was a bit of a blow to the treatment of the original "Lone Ranger", Clayton Moore. The movie studio threatened legal action if Moore portrayed himself as the true once-off ranger. (Moore was at children's hospitals as the Lone Ranger for sick children.) For many Americans, Clayton Moore was just that; the only one-off ranger. I always felt that the studio could do both supporters and legacy of the lonely ranger justice if Moore was better treated. Maybe even a cameo in the new movie. Anyway, this was not the case, and many of the viewing public stayed away. The story and acting were also weak. All of this contributed to a big box office, and rightly so. I am personally pleased that the studio has lost big money to the way the real Lone Ranger has been treated. You do not treat such an American icon.
