Ha ha. - Oh no - what to say about this movie? Yes - green eggs and ham make more sense than this movie. Where does one start? Many of the good things have already been said - so I won't make it in the same area. I believe you already have the movie summary - so I won't paraphrase the movie. <br /> <br /> First - let's start the good. <br /> <br /> 1). If you like psychic vibrators that make you think (like me), the first 29 minutes of this movie will be for you - this is one of those movies that raises the question of what you've always talked about long car rides if you were kids ( What if you had to choose one relative, another to die, or what to do if you drowned or drowned. This movie is a good concept - bottom line. <br /> <br /> 2) The wardrobe group had a good job of bringing us back to the 70's. Realistically, how difficult is it to achieve? ..... Okay, it's all about good. Let's talk about the bad. <br /> <br /> 1). This movie feels like an episode of Twilight Zone of 2 hours. It can easily be 90 minutes. This can have made the movie tolerant. <br /> <br /> 2). Do you remember in the movie "From Dusk to Dawn?". The movie began interestingly, then halfway through the movie, it just took a humiliating turn? Yep - the same thing here. I would dare say that the writers started with a concept, then they had no idea what to do with it. I got a deeper thought proposition from Transformers 2. <br /> <br /> 3). Yes, we get the dilemma in the movie. We understand the philosophical undertones and Utilitarian approach - but the story jumped too much, did not extend to the current storyline and has a completely offensive direction (forgive me). <br /> <br /> 4). The end didn't make sense. Not at all. None. <br /> <br /> This movie will make a great holiday paper in Colleges' philosophy 101. If you are out of your mind, are sick in bed, or have ever been hit with a tart in the face, and can view it for free online - though, go for it. <br /> <br /> If you have to pay something to watch this movie, don't waste your time - you're better off watching. Howie Mandel stands on your tube. You will get more philosophical stimulation to reorganize your soccer team.
