I don't care what someone says, this movie is crazy. The only thing it went to was camera work that was done very well. As for the dialogue, I heard so many people talking about ... it also sucked. Yes, it was honest and truthful in life, but so, I can hear someone talking on the street or in a fast food joint. What made the dialogue good in movies like Pulp Fiction, and Gosford Park was the fact that it is a WRITTEN dialogue, which takes time to think through. Another thing was that the director should not put him in the picture. I believe that the male character could have been much stronger, but it seems weak. In fact, the movie seems to turn the male character and then he disappears completely the last twenty minutes. The girl in the movie I found completely repulsive, not in appearance, but in her needy needy ways. Say she's in love with a man, and jealous of him the next day, what a little shit. Final thing: the sound was awful, and I hope it was just something my theater harassed rather than actually on the final cut of the movie. There was a constant buzzing sound during various scenes and it was actually taken away from talking. The one good thing was again Blood's work as the DP, but the actress who played the chief's ex girlfriend also did a good job. These two things can't save an ultimate horrible movie, which I refuse to call a movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10
