There is no better way to describe the HORRENDOUS experience that Mamma Mia should see. Hitler must look up and tell the pseudo-director Phyllida Lloyd "You monster, what did you do?" <br /> <br /> Everything about the movie is wrong. Just ?? Wrong! Even his success, which is inexplicable. I can understand when those crappy parody films, like Epic Movie, make their minimal share of money and make profits just because they are cheap (of course they are!). But if something like Mamma Mia worldwide makes 450 million dollars, do you think "what's the hell wrong with the world?" And to think we have Meryl Streep, one of the world's biggest live actresses, in it? What did she think? "I need the money," she could say. Well, sell one of your grandchildren, even that will be less embarrassing. It is not that Meryl is good at a disastrous, erroneous, 'movie'. She is also disastrous! When she sings, though she is the choir, it is ridiculous. Worse than her only Pierce Brosnan. He was James Bond. Now he is singing Abba in a press spandex during the credits of the worst movie ever. Really? And if I call Abba, not that I have anything against the band and their music. Although it does not help them, the actors started singing (bad), dancing (worse) and the extras closing. (They come from nowhere!). To present one of the terrible music series to others. You want to cry when the music starts. And I love musical! But this is the first in the genre where you pray for real silence. <br /> <br /> I could stay. The list goes on forever. You can write a Stephen King novel with the complete list of errors in this movie. <br /> <br /> To summarize: go look! Really! You have to testify to understand !! And since it's already a big success, who cares if it makes you a few bucks? And you don't seem to sell your soul to the devil. Meryl did it before. For the whole of humanity. And now the world must end because we have committed the ultimate evil and we must be destroyed.
