Savage Steve Holland has written and directed his second film, One Crazy Summer, with John Cusack and Curtis Armstrong. Cusack and Bobcat Goldthwait are recent graduates to Cape Cod to stay with Goldthwait's grandmother for the summer. Along the way, they stomped in Demi Moore followed by John Matuszak and a motorcycle gang. Soon, the three are united to try to save a home from another lobster restaurant, through a cramped family working a dirty word. The film features several funny vignettes such as the million-dollar-dollar game gags and the Godzilla shit. Like the first movie of Better Off Dead in Holland, John Cusack adds almost the movie. Otherwise, it's a dud of a movie filled with confronted situations and idiotic characters (unlike strange). Moore even sings some bars in a nightclub with some terrible synthesizers. Goldthwait's gags are thin after a while, and Armstrong has never been an actor of any caliber to appear in anything other than Grade Z stuff. The trailer-truck twin is extremely annoying and unpleasant instead of the engaging girls they naturally intended to be. It's more of a hit or miss, kitchen sink comedy that could have used a better writing and direction. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
