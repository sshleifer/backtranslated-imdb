Another stupid "movie". The image quality is correct. Sounds too. Music is medium. The guy is trying to make music like in Halloween. <br /> <br /> For a rare time, producer / director chooses non-anorexic girls. That's why this movie takes a week and costs $ 10,000. Does this mean when producer has money, do they choose all anorexic girls? Good question. <br /> <br /> But girls in this "movie" are physically correct. But they are not good actress. Not even guys. But maybe it's just because the "story" of this "movie" has no value. <br /> <br /> I'm sure we're giving $ 10,000 to a teenager who likes a movie, and they can create a better movie. /> <br /> Don't lose your time watching this "thing".
