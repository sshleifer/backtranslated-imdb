It could have been a great movie if someone just knew how to finish the movie. <br /> <br /> The story just went well and at that stage in every movie like the "gray" characters "good" turns and the "bad" guys just get their desserts and * tree * ... it's as if they had run out of writing and just started throwing things up. <br /> <br /> What wouldn't it be? I was so bad ... if the role play just attacked the character development they had already put in place. But this is not the case and the movie soon becomes a goofy mess. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch this movie for about the last 30 minutes ... and then shut down. Now imagine how you think the next 30 minutes will look based on what you've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Believe me, the end you come up with will look much better than this movie actually ending. Trust me about this.
