Many times the description is "full of sound and rage which means nothing" and is right on the target. Unfortunately, "Code 46" doesn't just have sound and anger. A bit of anger would have been greatly appreciated. Tim Robbins character (William) is so lacking in passion that the idea of ​​his fall immediately in love with Mary (Samantha Morton) seems almost absurd. These people are so passionate that one starts to wonder if the water supply of this future world is dosed with torasin. There is a "Brave New World" kind of atmosphere to the movie that is helped by every scene being shot over 2-3 times. Unfortunately, this technique becomes boring and quite difficult on the eyes. The slimy language break is also boring when there is no apparent reason for its existence. Many futuristic, scifi movies are criticized for flashing and no dust. This movie has no flash or dust. This is a code 6 all the way.
