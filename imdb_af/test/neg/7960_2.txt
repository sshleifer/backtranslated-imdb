Water shows the fate of Indian widows in the late 1930s, saying in the end that the problem still exists largely by providing statistics, Gandhi refers to the movie several times before eventually having a scene depicting him and nothing extra normal innovating or new in the movie. Yes, cinematography is pretty impressive, but it can't be the soul of any movie for me. <br /> <br /> India had many problems like many other nations, but it got rid of many of these problems. What happens if a film about racism in America is made in a particular year ending with 'x number of Americans still experiencing racism today?' <br /> <br /> a) How it will be relevant, and, b) How would it be something extra that is portrayed in the theater. <br /> <br /> A story I read from a Deepa Mehta interview was that this movie is interpreted as a vote for the marginalized every place. From reviews I read every place, the general thing I hear is how the director did a good job and was brave to bring a problem into the world. The film is about a particular problem facing a society (and got rid of the reforms in general). <br /> <br /> I don't see anything that will crush the movie. In addition, the film soul was missing and moved between the plots of Chuiyya and Kalyani. Sarala, the young Sri Lankan actress, portrayed Chuiyya's role excellently and unfortunately it was the only thing that impressed me about the movie.
