Pretty visuals and lots of fighting don't make a good movie. And that's exactly what happens here. <br /> <br /> First, let me admit, I still have to play FFVII (I'm going to order it soon). However, I did research to familiarize myself with the characters and the story. However, not everyone has the luxury time to investigate such things, and Advent Children demands FFVII knowledge. <br /> <br /> Despite incredible visual arts, I can't say there's too much it's not new. We've seen it in Final Fantasy: The Spirits Inside, and apart from a better movement, I can't say they have done very super-bravery things with it. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes - Well, they're a little fun. How can we ever doubt the outcome of any of them. This one was annoyingly classic - there were three battles with the bad guys, following the standard procedure (the hero, Wolk, getting smashed, then he almost came over and became crushed and eventually won). The reason I said it was annoyingly classic was that it was widely used, but in this case was poorly executed. I'll touch it later. <br /> <br /> The English dub looked good, though I didn't see it in Japanese, so I wouldn't judge the Japanese dub, but the English. I'll say it - I've heard much better, even in my limited repertoire. <br /> <br /> Now, the plot. Ummm ... what plot? Let me be honest, this movie is nothing but a fan service, a chance to see the FFVII characters on the big screen with a beautiful eyecatcher. As I said earlier, the battles just look for no reason. The opening fight is never explained, Kadaj does not seem ambition to destroy the world itself or any real motivation to do anything nasty. Cloud sits around for the whole movie, and almost everyone gets a mandatory cameo. <br /> <br /> Really, FFVII was an ensemble piece. Advent Children is everything except. If they succeeded in playing an important role for everyone (Star Trek: First Contact proved that it was possible, I can add), then it could have been much better. Of course it would have changed the plot, which we can be honest with is almost better than the one we have. <br /> <br /> Characters were generally either unused or virtually forgotten. The members of Avalanche (that is the group Cloud who worked in FFVII, for those who don't know) get 2 scenes (3 in the case of Vincent Valentine, and some even get less). Hell, the bad guys get more lines than these guys, and it's pretty bad. <br /> <br /> The music ... well, I don't care if Nobuo Uematsu is God himself, he made this movie great time. Advent One Winged Angel was the only decent piece. Otherwise he cannot decide whether it is epic (and orchestra) or pleasure (with electric guitar). When he switched from one to the other, you felt as if he had taken a sledge hammer on your head. <br /> <br /> And the last point about whether this movie was epic or fun ... it tried to be both, and failed failed. Honestly you can't please everyone and do everything. The movie also tried to be deep (you can go epic and deep, or fun and deep, but all three are too much), but also failed here. The last scene, reminiscent of a baptism ceremony, was thrown in there because it looked for it. You don't have to be a Christian just shaking your head and crying. That scene just got in the movie (not Aerith's regular performances - she's Jim!). <br /> <br /> Given how fantastic I heard Final Fantasy VII, this movie is nothing short of a huge disappointment. Because of the beautiful visuals, I give it a 2 out of 10.
