Oh yes, I have to agree with the others who describe it as terrible. The action in this four-hour function is equally bad, so bad to the point that I find it impossible to believe any of the actors in this production might earn a living as an actor. I still wonder who did the casting. Each one delivers their lines without having any kind of involvement or emotional investment with any other character. No one seems to have a true relationship, family or otherwise, with another. The direction is also terrible and any action scene is laughable and unconvincing. Were the movie editors asleep? <br /> <br /> The costumes look authentic for the Regency period, but the fabric looks 20th century and colors (especially the blue colors!) are bare and I don't believe it was available in the early 19th century. century fabric except perhaps in its. <br /> <br /> Also the hair: the men have obvious hairstyles in the 1970s and the women have a "big hair" --- especially the woman Anne Elliot plays. <br /> <br /> All the female characters, young and old, are very nice, but it doesn't matter for the lack of acting abilities. The actress playing 'Anne' looks like she's in her forties while Anne Elliot is 27 years old. I mean, where was the makeup and lighting crew if we found the woman Anne was credible? She spends much of her time with her eyes on the horizon, or inside or outside. I still wonder what it was supposed to convey. Can you regret it? Yes, this production is sorry! <br /> <br /> The actress playing Louisa was really awful. She screams, squeals, giggles, and jumps like a sickly organized 12-year-old (apologizing to anyone who is twelve years old, reading it) that I was eagerly waiting for the moment she beat herself. How this behavior is supposed to be a mature man is beyond me. Most would return when she first opened her mouth to giggle and shout. <br /> <br /> The actor playing Captain Wentworth portrays someone so sweet and colorless, and wonder why any woman over eight can hurt him. <Br /> <br /> The feedback of the couple at the end is not convincingly done or explained. How did they get together again? Not because Louisa was in a coma; It sure is. No, there has to be more than that and it is not explained in the film. <br /> <br /> I rate this production two stars: one because it is Austens' work, and the other because some of the outdoor scene was nice. The only reason I could see the whole production was that I was ill with flu and I got it from the library. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy the book, see the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I would recommend this movie even if you didn't read the book.
