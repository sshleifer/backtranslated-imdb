It wasn't a good movie !! Why do you still tell people? There is a nice little story and then some sexy girls and then BAM vampires !!! Why? Why are there vampires? Where did they come from? Also, what the hell ?! There are all these "superhuman" vampires, but George Clooney and three other random guys dominate them all. Fast as well. It's not like there was a long battle scene with a lot of battle. There were only three dudes in the bar killing these vampires, like a fat man killing! The next thing you know is Clooney and the stupid girl saved by Cheech, leaving the family homeless in the middle of Mexico. End of the story. Literally. Oh, and the strip club was an Aztec temple that is funny because it must be southern Mexico, not the border. Why are people lying and telling people this is a good movie? Don't rent or buy this movie from a friend's house. You would wish you had returned that time of your life.
