Jesus Christ, what happened to hell here? This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. How is it possible that they have screwed such a good idea to a movie. To tell you the truth, I was so forced, but it was like Blair Witch, but with the real alien creatures that followed the camera man. Surprised, I was reduced to sending this stack of sh * t fast, and I never do it while watching movies. The high rating here on IMDb makes me believe the real strangers give 10's to this piece of crap. <br /> <br /> Invasion is about good, an invasion. The movie starts by saying that everything you are going to see is really, blahblahblah. Then they tell me about a special camera system that is used in cars, as if I have to believe them suddenly to enjoy this movie. Next thing you know I see the boring car ride ever filmed in a forest at night, you think. Is it a movie or a Disney theme park ride? The first 20 minutes are all boring police dialogue while grass and one straight road with a flashlight are seen. Where was hell the strangers? Of course they slept! Then we learn that bad acting is not only lowered to high school, as the policeman behind the camera goes out of his car to look for a missing man who was a night fish and stumbled upon a mysterious meteorite. I wonder what happens to him? From nowhere we see the 'night fish' man walking like a zombie. The policeman is apparently too stupid to see that something is wrong with this man. Apparently, he was stupid, as the zombie / strange man in the ears of the police injects some kind of alien parasite and therefore changes him into a stranger. Then the cop / alien goes back into his car, looking for a young couple who had sex in the woods for a while, get them, change the man in a stranger, and then the girl walks to the police's car and escape. If this quick plot introduction didn't get it in your head that this movie was bad then the next 40 minutes. Watching this movie is as painful as sticking repeatedly with a plastic fork. The script, while looking interesting on the back of the DVD case, is heavily targeted and unfortunately we are sowing straight to DVD atrocity. <br /> <br /> The only thing that kept me awake was the constant flickering and loud sound effects (miserable). If we see the same forest path for 63 minutes, this is not enough, we must endure the flickering techniques to "frighten" the viewer and a constant charge of a bad actress who becomes old and annoying. <br /> <br /> If you feel you should rent it, I tell you why? There are better sciFi / horror movies out there. Even the dreaded remake of the Invasion of the Body Snatchers is more entertaining than that. Because the love of all things is good, don't bother with his shit. My eyes blew, and for the first time I wanted suicide. A 1/10, avoid it like a disease.
