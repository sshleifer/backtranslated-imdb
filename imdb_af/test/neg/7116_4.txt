Mr. Brento wondered if this film was made by the same manufacturer of the Dragonball Z TV series. Of course not. <br /> <br /> This is a real film from Hong Kong based on the first episodes of the Japanese original cartoon (also based on a comic book series). And I really don't know if it was produced under the license of the Dragonball creators. <br /> <br /> However, the story of the apeun with special powers is an ancient story known throughout Asia (In Japan, the name of the boy is in the story of Songoku; in China it is Sunwukong; in Korea it is Sonogong, etc.) and the story in Dragonball has a lot to do with that story. <br /> <br /> By the way, as I said, this movie is based on the first episodes of the Dragonball series (followed by Dragonball Z, although I think the US version has another airline). And all the screens related to sexuality were also in the original cartoon (without too much and so much insistence!), But because of your comments, I think they were completely removed in the American dubbing. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I agree with you about the overworking role in the movie and how poor this adaptation to the original cartoon is. But maybe no one can forget about it after watching it.
