Director Nico Mastorakis has made a cynical money grabber (on his own) too cynical to impress anyone other than a sophomore genre. <br /> <br /> The most extreme, confrontational genre photos, to enter a character in VIDEODROME, "have a philosophy"; This is what makes them dangerous. <br /> <br /> ISLAND OR DEATH's philosophy is to throw and slow many "shocking" elements in a film mix. The result is a dish without taste, but an ugly appearance. <br /> <br /> Not to be confused with Serrador's brilliant WHAT CHILD CHILD CAN CHILD? (sometimes called ICELAND OR DEATH), Mastorakis's attempt was made on a Greek island which is a stage for various forms of slaughter, a bit of bestiality and a wholesale root. <br /> <br /> Everything moves at a slow pace and the violent pieces are poorly targeted. <br /> <br /> Addressed as "The movie that the sensors don't want you to see", I would guess the sensors never saw it, they just read the press kit until their knees pushed up has.
