Jason Lee does well to give this doggy movie fleeting promise, but it's not enough to distinguish it from any other common family comedy. <br /> <br /> This lively action, CG enhanced adventure, sees a shameful police dog (Jason Lee) turning into an accident in a super-dog in the lab at dusk scientist dr. Simon Barsinister (Peter Dinklage). Underdog saves on the salvation of the city as he tries to keep his identity secret - a challenge he can speak and fly. <br /> <br /> The strange gay raises a smile, but Underdog's human sidekicks (James Belushi and Alex Neuberger as father and son) are as boring as the predictable storyline. One for kids too young to see Superman. Or Spider-Man. Or even Shaggy Dog ??
