Wow. What can I say? I was born in 1960. I love bad TV movies. Like them I get involved. The works. I want to get involved. I spend time watching the thing. I watched the emmys on TV last night. How in the endless world was the Empire Falls (excellent name) TV movie for any awards? It really had wonderful talent. Of course. And they tried wonderfully. But how can anyone pretend to be an OK (TV for goodness)? OK direction? You know, I wish everyone the best. Really. But I thought it was quite sensible that Hollywood put this very bad movie for so much honor. Awards? For me it was kind of a wake-up call that Hollywood is such a small island community. To be cynical is not really my thing. But wow. --xptyngi
