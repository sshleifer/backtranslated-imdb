You life? OK I think I'm intelligent, educated, liberal and really into movies. I really like and have a good sense of humor. I was under the impression it was a painful comedy. They paid to make it, gasoline was used, electricity was burned, food was consumed, set up building ....... why? I blame the current state of the world on this movie and all the people that go with it, I will even include the viewing public. We are all to blame and deserve whatever comes. It's not funny, doesn't happen much, everyone who looks like it is bored or boring. There are no conversations, communication is minimal. There is no plot as far as I know. I just lost 89 points a few minutes from my life. I'll never get that time again. The only message I got away from is maybe life is too short to look at to watch movies from people who don't do much ... and then you die!
