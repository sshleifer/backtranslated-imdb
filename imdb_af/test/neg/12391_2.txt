It seems more or less possible that this film gave some inspiration to "The Sopranos". As his main character, Martin Blank (John Cusack) is a hit that has so many problems from his past and his profession that he is in therapy. try to handle it all. Everything finally comes to his 10-year high school reunion. The problem was that by the time White arrived after the reunion, I stopped caring. Frankly, I found this movie a hit from start to finish. <br /> <br /> It had potential. There was a pretty good role, led by Cusack and Dan Aykroyd, who Grocer, his bow runner in the hit business, along with Minnie Driver as Debi, White's high school sweetheart, who he raised on promnay, and a limited role for Alan Arkin as dr. Oatman, Blank's psychologist. However, that reasonably talented role never really came together. The drama had intensity and the comedy had real humor. What I thought was the potential to be a comic story was Grocer's suggestion for a hit union, but apart from a bit of a running joke, the idea never really developed. Regarding the romance, one wondered why Debi would even think to leave this man back in her life. <br /> <br /> There were a handful of guys, but nothing really caught me and kept me and I wondered most about the movie if this thing ever starts to click. It never did - not me. 10/02
