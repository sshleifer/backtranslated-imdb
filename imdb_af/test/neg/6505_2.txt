Okay, so it was done in 1993. Directed by Robert Iscove and loosely written by John Miglis, it is supposed to be based on a true story. Hard to believe anyone can be so stupid and blind to the truth. Certainly, it was obvious that this lady could find her at the time. <br /> <br /> Tim Matheson, who looks slightly older than I remember him, played the empty chief who was sowing in his somewhat romance and empty life. Well, it got him like Tracy Pollan, a somewhat vacant girl with kinky sex, like she wants to win her guys. <br /> <br /> Come on, call sex, even in the 90's was old hat. Can't believe someone will fall for that old line. But Mr. Matheson bought it. And it costs him a lot. <br /> <br /> The hardest scene to take was when he finally threw the woman out of his apartment and put all her litter in the lead (BEFORE THE APARTMENT) and then the stupidity didn't change the locks. Then I had enough of this trite movie. It told me that the woman was trying it on me so I could have the satisfaction of telling her to make a hike. <br /> <br /> I give this chestnut a 1 out of 100. That's how bad I thought it was. I think you can't blame the actors. But they were terrible. Did they actually try to play it with a straight face?
