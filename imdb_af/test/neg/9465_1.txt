After the death of a plastic surgeon's wife, he gets his cuddly assistant to help him bring her back with different parts of other nubile, young girls. This movie wants to be a Gordon Gordon Lewis-type skirt, but fails. The acting is over, the grim effects horrible (no, not in the good way), the plot is almost non-existent and no fun to have.
