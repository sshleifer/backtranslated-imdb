This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this movie? A lot of Americans enter France into Nazi occupation and begin to kill Germans. You see they are killing their enemies and killing them with baseball bats. While jokes are natural. <br /> <br /> Some will say this movie is a parody of a certain genre. For a parody it's not funny or funny. The content is zero. It is extremely brutal and disgusting. Below is a subtle political message, as it is again "the good guys" who kill the "bad Nazis". The whole plot is unthinkable if you turn it around. Can you suggest a storyline where Nazis (jokes) kill everyone in the Warsaw ghetto with flamethrowers? Probably not, but this movie is exactly about it, with the exception of satisfying the strange moral expectations of a certain audience: people who kill are so cool when done by the right people. <br /> <br /> This movie works only because of the hidden Nazi ideology below. It does not regard the enemy as humans. And if the latter is supposed to be an element of fun, I'm happy to say that this kind of fun will always be a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> Another riddle is how such violence can fascinate the American crowd while a little nudity will eliminate them. But if a mere body is pornography, this movie with all its brutality is purely pornography at its worst. <br /> <br /> Inglorious Basterds is a senseless, boring and tasteless waste of time and money.
