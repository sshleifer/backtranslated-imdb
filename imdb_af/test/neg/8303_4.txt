A True Gothic Horror Trash Classic! <br /> <br /> Uhm, it's really a terrible movie. Best thing about it: Rosalba Neri's naked nipples. Intensive suction material. <br /> <br /> Yes, Rosalba Neri is a good lady. Never heard of her before this movie, but she is a damn beautiful lady. But honestly, it was her nipples that did it for me, in the last scene, before the movie suddenly ended, all naked and erected ... Total dream nipples, man. Okay, sorry, to get carried away a bit here ... <br /> <br /> Basically I got what I expected from LADY FRANKENSTEIN: It's a thin and horrible movie with a big, ugly, ugly Frankenstein monster and some naked tits. And it has a castle in it. So I wasn't really disappointed or anything. It has dragged too much in some places (the first resurrection of the being that ends up, with dad Frankenstein, just experimenting, talking and trying even more). There was a fun, imbecile tribute to the original Frankenstein, though: Instead of throwing a little girl in a lake, Mongoloid Franky picked up a mere chick and threw it into a river. Laughed at me. <br /> <br /> Some of my friends just drove a bit too much about this movie. Maybe I expected too much. But Rosalba's nipples were probably worth the effort ... (Aw crap, I really have to stop calling her nipples). I think I'll just end this user comment.
