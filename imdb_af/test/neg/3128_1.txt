It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> We're supposed to play for an arrogant, know-it-all-trashy bank robber played by Dale Robertson, and a concise tees played by the extraordinarily beautiful Linda Darnell. a red dress. She had to be incorporated into that body! <br /> <br /> A Senator in the film thinks Native Americans and whites should try to understand, but the bigots win that day. I could barely sit through the endless dialogue of bigotry issued from the other characters' mouth. <br /> <br /> Apart from wounded knees and dances with wolves, there are few films that give a positive portrayal of American Indians, and do very few old westerns. This one is extremely bad in this respect. <br /> <br /> The romance between Robertson and Darnell put my teeth on the edge as he came to visit and forced a kiss on her while playing the old hard-to-play game. <br /> <br /> There are scenes that are inadvertently humorous, such as the characters that don't really drive in or on a stagecoach in multiple shots. <br /> <br /> A mysterious humorous incident in the storyline Linda Darnell's character largely goes out to buy tickets for the podium, and then requires a horse to drive, minutes later, for no apparent reason. . <br /> <br /> Another humorous scene is when the stage shot comes to a shout at the eyes of a cowboy hat lying down the road, and not just that, but ALL passengers are out for a look-see. <br /> <br /> 1 star.
