This movie has Mr. Bachchan not given justice. He is a good actor and I was very disappointed in the movie and there wasn't much plot. Matter fact this is the first movie I've ever been disappointed with in it. It starts with her at his home with his daughter and he is a photographer. He takes pictures of her in the garden, she is polluting herself. He is a sixty-year-old man who has nothing to do, but to take pictures of this girl. The movie doesn't make sense. The whole movie is about her pursuing him and telling him how much she cares for him. Then his daughter falls and he has to take this girl around places so she is not bored and the daughter is found out. I just didn't think this movie was on Bachchan's standards. He's better than this movie. I always suggested him as a standing person and then I saw him in this movie and I couldn't imagine him in this movie. The movie didn't keep me at all. I couldn't wait until the movie was over. And you won't.
