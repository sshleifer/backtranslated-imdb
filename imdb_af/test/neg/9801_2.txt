In the 1940s, Veronica Lake made a meteoric rise to filmstardom, thanks to its sultry beauty and its highly-featured "peekaboo" hairstyle. She has opposite big names, such as Alan Ladd and Fredric March, characterized by screen successes in films such as "This Gun For Hire" and "I Married A Hitch". She also kept her own with female stars, and she even surprised her opponents with her performance as a bitter marine nurse in "So Truly We Hail". But changing times and her own failures tackled her, and by the end of the decade her delight was over. With two unsuccessful marriages behind her (and two more in her future), Veronica went to New York City, where she sometimes had television and summer appearances before being completely out of sight. It was a big news when she was a barmaid in a second class hotel in the early sixties. But now her prolonged alcoholism and years of hard life have robbed her of her appearance. Without them, the public interest in her soon disappeared. She returned to the stage in various vehicles, but her success was minimal. Eventually she moved to Miami, Florida, where she lived in relative darkness. In 1966 she went to Canada for a role in an obscure film called "Footsteps In The Snow" that had no American release. The following year she was discovered by some industrial filmmakers who had long wanted to produce a commercial feature. They approached her to die in their movie "Time Is Terror" and convince her to invest in the project. As one author put it, "If ever a movie queen had a terminal comedown, it was." Surrounded by amateur performers and pathetic production values, she didn't even rise to a minimal level in this Miami, Florida shot quickie. Remarkably common in long shots, and in a scant old way in the near future, poor Veronica did not act as much as walking through her. As a swollen doctor, who has hit a successful youth recovery formula, using carnivorous guts, she seems bored and confused, her most unintentionally hilarious moment coming when she is forced to ad lib while struggling with several rubber gloves. The support roll is not at all helpful, just to promote the plot by killing it. Director Brad Grinter apparently only needed the actors to move while the camera was shown to them, not needed for something that looked like entertainment. (There is one unfortunate hilarious scene involving a private detective / nurse and a body in a wheelchair. Weekend at Bernie's' nearly 20 years.) According to Veronica himself, the film was laid for three years because there were no masterships was filmed. But in 1970, the production company scrapped it, the title changed to "Flesh Feast" and released it in cash on Lake's just published biography. And because former leading ladies like Bette Davis, Joan Crawford and Olivia De Havilland unexpectedly revived their horror movie careers, this transvesty was promoted as Veronica's "comeback movie". However, it seems a strange action for the filmmakers to strive for, because the (young) audience is unlikely to know for a horror movie of this quality or care who Veronica Lake was. As expected, it did nothing for Veronica's career, and she died three years later in poverty. A previous reviewer refers to a scene in which the female detective works as a nurse in the doctor's laboratory (overseeing the theft of bodies from a nearby mortuary) and helps the assistance of a versatile driver to cut the body parts . "Low Mrs Lustig," she sighed, "I hope she doesn't mind leaving her body to science." "Don't think about it," advises the driver, saw off. "I think you're right, Hans." shut down the detective / nurse, "What has been done is done." What a sad end to the career of a quiet, revealed star.
