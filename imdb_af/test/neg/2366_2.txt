A nice cute movie is almost needed to have moon-slopes, car hunts, a storyline that has a vague resemblance to 'plot' and at least one very nice country hole, barefoot with short pants and low top. The nice breeze is here (dressed in designer jeans) - but the redneck prerequisites stop there. Jimmy Dean is a natural as a sausage spokesperson, but as a hard-man former sheriff, he comes short. Big John is big, but he's not convincing with the "bad" part of his moniker. Bug-eyed Jack Elam is as always, and Bo Hopkins has been playing the same role for decades. Ned Beatty also plays his part in a small role ... but there is no story. It smells more like an episode of In The Heat Of The Night as a feature film. Cornball cornpone with easily predictable sentiment. Perhaps the brilliant issue with this movie is Charlie Daniels singing the theme. You know the one; This was announced by ... Jimmy Dean.
