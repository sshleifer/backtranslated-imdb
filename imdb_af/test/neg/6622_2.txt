root leaf in a full-length film, said enough. Just because it does not get one is through my personal one of only 1 and 10, and this is not an extreme option. terrible god terrible. There are a few movies that are so bad that they are inadvertently funny, then there are movies that make you physically ill and then there are those who are serious about suicide. fire all the copies of the movie, shoot anyone who doesn't have creative input on this movie, torture someone with any creative input and star, there are just so many things that can be said online, but he must beg for the final ten seconds exist with a cut head by the time the work is done.
