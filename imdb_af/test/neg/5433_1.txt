If you can make it through this movie without laughing aloud on the screen, you're a better movie maker than me. Count the logic decay, common sense jump and stretch credibility ... betcha needed more than two hands! <br /> <br /> PS: If one more movie uses a place that is clearly UCLA, claiming it's another university (in this movie's case: Berkeley), I'm going to lose It.
