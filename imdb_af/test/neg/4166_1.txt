This movie has been released in all major theaters in Australia. I watched the 7th AUG this weekend and I thought it was absolute nonsense (and I use the word much better). How it was released to every major cinema has no idea. The plot looks simple enough about the fact that the world is divided into subclasses and people need identity cards and actor Tim Robbins plays an investigator who goes to Shanghai to investigate an employee's steep ID cards. It seems to be actress Samantha Morton. <Br /> <br /> You think from the summary that the rest of the story has to be intense, but it doesn't just confuse the audience with different unrelated storyline. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie lets me save you trouble, don't get this movie.
