You know, I always like disturbing or strange movies, especially when they are shown at the fantasy film festival in Hamburg, Germany. but subconscious cruelty was probably the worst movie I saw this year. will this comment contain any spoilers? <br /> <br /> No, I didn't understand this movie. but what can you expect from a movie introduced to a fairy tale? "We (the guys of the festival) know that not all of you will see this one to the end ..." <br /> <br /> I like flash movies and I also like movies with a strong graphic language. but this? There are many bloody scenes in this one, but why? what does the director try to tell us? does he say that we have lost all morality and all religious feelings? Or does he say that incest always ends in disaster? who knows - i don't. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie that has made you think for a long time - watch it. but don't expect to think "Wow, I have the message" - I didn't get it ...
