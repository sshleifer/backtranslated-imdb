This movie has more goofs than any other movie I've seen in my life. The special effects are terrible. For example, near the end, when the Concorde falls after the cargo door turns off, the thing turns like a toy. The special effects of Airport (1970) are much better than this crap. Also, the power of a Concorde that opens up at speed and speed will essentially change the thing inside. (That's if it even opens) But the movie has its good points. Usually when it ends. It is also cheesy. Eg The thing land on a bank with loose snow, if so, it will splinter into a million pieces. Overall, 2 out of 10. Instant flop. Big laugh.
