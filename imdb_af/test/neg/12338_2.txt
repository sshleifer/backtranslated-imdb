Downhill Racer is essentially a movie to watch just for the awesome ski rides. Although there is a story here, Robert Redford's character, a skier who is trying to make the American Olympic team, is so tiring and unsympathetic that you are wondering why he doesn't give up at all. Early on, Gene Hackman adds nicely, but it's a movie that can be switched off with the sound, and it won't make much of a difference.
