I was fortunate enough to surf in San Diego (not the biggest waves in the world, but it was a lot of childhood, I'll tell you) and I saw quite a few so-called surfer flicks in my life . After looking at NORTH SHORE for the first time, all I can say is THANK YOU GOD, I never saw it as a child. If I saw this and mistakenly thought that it was a realistic portrayal of the surf scene, I would sell and totally acquire my board, I don't know, accounting or anything. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this movie has so much in common with the actual surfing, since TOP GUN was the true military life. The acting is terrible, the music is worse, cinematography is at its best, and OH MY GOD, what does Laird Hanilton think? WOW !!! Don't Watch This Movie !!! It struggles !!! If you want a REAL surf flick, see RIDING GIANTS. Hell, look SURF'S UP instead. Seriously. Suck. Struggling badly. Sucks REAL bad. Brah. ;) <br /> <br /> PS: Do I need some of "WTF?!" change to wtf because we obviously need to be whispered to this site. NO YELLOW! (Shhhh!); D
