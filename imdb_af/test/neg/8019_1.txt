A few teenagers had some sex on the beach in the 1960s. That's all. They say they are fifteen, while one of the actors is really twenty-five. Perhaps this role was a somewhat revolutionary way of touching taboo topics in 1978, but I can't imagine anything in Esmiko Limon being seen as tabooism. <br /> <br /> Scallop dialogues are mixed with even music even discolored. The choice of songs involves nothing but the very well-known "classic" that is still heard on every second radio station today. The American Pie plot is not much different, but it is at least a little funny. Eskimo Limon is boring, flat and not aesthetic. Almost incredible that it had six successors!
