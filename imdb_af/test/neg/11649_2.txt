This movie has ever seen along with some of the most predictable story lines and level characters. Of course, the author bought the playbook, "How to Write a Space Disaster Film" In particular, the stereotype use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space - a brave display in the face of a disaster, was done again and again. <br /> <br /> Max Q seems to have been written hoping that the producers will throw $ 50m on the project. But, judging by the last half of the film, which contains many lame efforts against special effects, the producers could only earn $ 50 thousand. To hear that the film was nominated for a special visual effect, Emmy absolutely cut me. <br /> <br /> I think a handful of high school graduates with Media Studies could have created more credible effects. ! <br /> <br /> And the plot holes are too much to mention. But I will choose one as an example. Now, I'm not a NASA expert, but it's definitely highly unlikely that a worker connected to the shuttle simulator will suddenly have a position of power in the control room when things start to affect the program. Surely there is someone more experienced at Mission Control, who would call the Program Director rather than a twenty-nine year old, who was not yet in the control room. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace for this movie is the work of Bill Campbell. He manages a good effort to save something from the train wreck this writing is. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 2 out of 10, with the above-average Bill Campbell's work saving it from a lower point.
