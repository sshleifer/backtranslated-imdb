This movie is absurd. Totally terrible. Michael Keaton and Andy Garcia really need the job to do this movie. The plot is not entirely credible! Michael Keaton agrees to donate bone marrow to the dying son of a detective, but then escapes. He manages the entire police in the police - not credible that he will have so much knowledge of the hospital. He takes an extremely winding route to get out of hospital, blowing up the generators and a pedestrian bridge (why?). And besides Andy Garcia (father of the dying boy) and a doctor, the criminal helps to get the bone marrow. The plot is so baloney! Maybe the worse movie I've ever seen.
