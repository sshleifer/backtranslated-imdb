There were not many thoughts on many fronts in the storyline. It's a good action movie, but it's about it. <br /> <br /> - The movie claims the lycans were kept to protect the vampires during the day. Yet they are kept in cages and necklaces on their necks. So they can't change into their wolf form, do anything that any other slave can't do. How does it protect the vampires during the day? Who are they protecting the vampires? The uncontrollable lycans? The slaves in human form are nothing more than farmers. <br /> <br /> - My understanding is that vampires are immortal and not age. Yet Sonya demands from child to adult. Are they just aging at some age? I understand that Viktor is old because he was twisted (as explained in the second film). But vampire babies age? Strange. <br /> <br /> - I didn't realize that vampires need torches to see at night. Yet we see that they carry torches throughout the film. <br /> <br /> - Silver was the only thing supposed to be detrimental to lycane. Nevertheless, wooden cookies fired from the large crossbows also killed the lycan. <br /> <br /> These are just a few things that only show a lack of thought in the story.
