Since I saw it before I watched it, my expectations weren't high, especially since those other horror movies were at blockbuster (along with movies like Junior). <br /> <br /> Well, it doesn't just make it The movie has the brainless stereotypical characters (the rich voting bag, the bitch, the sheriff, the substitute who knows what goes wrong in the village, etc.), but has such a terrible dialogue, acting, directing and cg effects. The Jeremiah Stone dude was hilarious. (* SPOILER *) I will never understand why he had bitten his finger from anywhere when he held the hostage. <br /> <br /> The premise of the movie is just as horrible as the other mistakes. From what I could get from it, Jeremiah Stone was a gold digger at the Gold Rush, and a notorious ban. He had an unfinished gold (* SPOILER *) and laid a curse on anyone who went to his gold before being shot down by the locals after killing a girl but not only survived. he bit his own finger and ran away. So, today, a group of indifferent moral finds out about this gold mine, and of course they are warned by locals about "The Curse of the Forty-Niner". And what do they do? As expected, ignore the warnings and look greedy for the gold. They get the gold, and all sorts of things go on. Fortunately, (* SPOILER *) the bitch gets her head cut off. <br /> <br /> It's about it. Look at the cover of the movie, you can tell what kind of movie it will be. It's just as horrible, it's hilarious. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 stars out of 5.
