This movie starts with children who tell urban legends such as the poodle in the microwave and get something extra at a chicken farm. Unfortunately, it turns to your basic anthology movie. The first is about an officer with a little secret. This one is good at its best. Then it gets worse as the next story about this child, obsessed with dead flies, continues and goes on and on and on. It is far too long and not all that is interesting to start with. Then you get the typical shock scene and end it. You need more than that in an anthology movie. You need at least three stories and you should not be so long, it becomes extremely uninteresting, especially as you can see how it will end a mile.
