I'm disgusting and terrified by the positive reviews this movie receives. Not only is it hokey, manipulative and melodramatic. It's also shamelessly offensive. The character of Radio `Gooding Jr 'is surrounded by a cute little thing, like a puppy that is so cute, you just want to take it home. 'This mentality is shameless; Radio is never treated as a human, but as a manipulative device to draw sympathy from his audience. Even more horrible is the movie's many moments, in which Radio gets in the head / travels / falls over / etc. These moments of slapstick comedy just cried the audience because it's funny because Radio is delayed. It's shameless. Now, I do not feel that the word 'delayed' is an appropriate word for the mentally handicapped, but it seems to be the point the film takes, 'Radio has slowed down, but it's good because it's cute and we like of him. ' Gooding's portrayal looks better suited to a John Water movie as an inspirational family drama. To be innocent of injuries, the film is incompetent at every level, Debra Winger is uninspired in the role of the "stereotypical housewives" that the memory of her terrifying monologues sees the laughter of everyone in the film. The score by John Horner is pure juice that always transfers its tears over the tired cinematography. Ed Harris is well in the role he slept, but managed to keep the audience's attention in the film. In conclusion, if you consider yourself a decent person, ignore this travesty of a movie, read the book, but skip this spectacular film about an interesting character from American history.
