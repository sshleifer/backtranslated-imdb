I saw Ed Wood's biopies many years ago. Tim Burton paid tribute to this extremely undoubted but enthusiastic filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Then I saw Plan 9 and it really tickled me. A foolish story, kind of bad production values, but still entertaining and even funny. <br /> <br /> Then this. What can you do about it? Well, since Wood was named a cross-dresser, it is shocking to see a movie dealing with it as a cartoon. Yes, there are a few stitches to teach the audience something about the subject, but mostly it's a kind of ridiculous self-pity. <br /> <br /> One of the problems is that it has a hundred views. On the one hand, it is a plea for tolerance. Another image depicts transvestism as a disease. And finally, tell the audience, "Well, if you're shocked, wait until you see it!" The problem should have been that Wood had to compromise so that the film could be made. You can almost understand this when you see the producer's opening title: Personally supervised ... So, where are we. This is not a serious subject movie or an all-out shocker. <br /> <br /> The entertainment value is virtually zero. The wood voice ear is softly amusing, but just because it sounds so deceptive. However, it was made in the fifties, so one could argue that it was brave to make a movie that even called the word transvestites. It all comes down to what the film itself is trying to plead. Schock. The rape scene, while soft, is just to do it. <br /> <br /> So, sorry. It's a blemish, but the discretion is not Wood's alone.
