A paranoid scientist creates a wolfman by transfusing wolf blood into a gentle, quiet but very large gardener to prove a hypothesis. So the gardener begins to try nightly campaigns and the scientist to use him to regain his credentials, but is beaten back by his former colleagues for the toddler with nature. Island Dr Moreau, Frankenstein and several wolfman movies have all merged into a very dated, goofy morality play. <br /> <br /> Though the subject is at its best pedant and inexperienced, this film is not made too weak and interesting to watch as a representative of horror film making his time. Like most crazy scientific films, it's a bad warning to walk around with Mother Nature. It doesn't have the power or intellectual challenges of Frankenstein, but it never reaches its reach. The play is sensible, just like cinematography, and the movie moves with an entertaining clip. Some of the dialogue is completely ridiculous, but hey ... it's just a movie - and a B little to it. There are also some nice shots of a wolf, and a hint of humor thrown in to prevent the film from taking itself too seriously - always a plus for this genre.
