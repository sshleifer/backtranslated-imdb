I'm sorry to rain on everyone's parade. Just a little background on me: I love Asian theater, especially Japanese, Chinese and Indian. I'm a beginner when it comes to South Korean cinema, but if it's the best of the best, sorry. I just want you to know that I'm not at all careful when it comes to appreciating foreign films and I don't fit the stereotype of the "stupid American". . . Well, not perfect. <br /> <br /> I can't believe the high praise, this piece isn't used. It's a disgusting * and * ridiculous movie. Hammy acting - everything is badly done and overdoing, like praying for the untrained viewer's attention. Strange camera work, with an insistence on meaningless proximity from MTV aesthetics. <br /> <br /> The plot is more full of holes than a giant piece of Swiss cheese. No one expects a thriller to be 100% realistic, and for the sake of entertainment I would like to close my eyes to small unfinished details. But, excuse me, what's happening here, * can even do a summary investigation? This story of an incredibly complicated and indignant act of revenge is worse than the worst tabloid story one can read in a line at the supermarket. (Do not spoil your "pleasure", if it is spoken, it will not go into the details of the plot.) The fighting tones are violent, incredible, straight stupid (the main "hero" assumes dozens and dozens of the opponents in the same time, after being trained ONLY while being imprisoned, hit a wall!) The truly "outstanding" features of this movie are two: the furious and turbulent sex (brother on sister and father on daughter, well evolved since Oedipus, do we not?) and graphic violence. Cutting off body parts - hands, teeth, teeth - along with industrial amounts of blood that have been flushed (how many tens of thousands of tomatoes had to die for this film?) Has no aesthetic function / motivation whatsoever. <br /> <br /> A S&M festival, although, but even for those, a feast of no merit or subtle. Heavens, even Mel Gibson's recent and much-discussed work on an almost similar theme, was not so bad. <br /> <br /> The inevitably good pressure on these pretentious, remaining, elongated piece of gratuitous yarns derived from Korean shores makes me wonder what happens. I don't think of myself as the ultimate taste of taste and often I'm ready to accept that a movie I didn't enjoy could be better than I could see. But I have no rubbish whatsoever to mention this one as I see it: bad, bad, bad. No redeeming qualities. My 2c? Find something better to do with your time.
