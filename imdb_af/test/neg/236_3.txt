Like many movies with small children, it starts with "really cute" and nice ... and then, after about half an hour or so, the reverse. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the case here in this time series story (which I usually love) where an adult meets a child he really is eight years old! Great prospect and a great lead actor in Bruce Willis, but ..... The child "Rusty" is a smart aleck and whiny brat and Willis Rusty grew up now as "Russell" shed with his constant scream. It's fun? No thank you. <br /> <br /> Young Breslin continued to become a very good kid actor, involved in a number of films, including "The Cat In The Hat" versus a well-known role player: Dakota Fanning. <br /> <br /> Overall, a disappointing movie, especially with all the good press, has this movie released.
