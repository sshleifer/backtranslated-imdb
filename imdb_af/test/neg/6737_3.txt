I hope it's done before Half Past Dead and Exit Wounds, because it was rubbish, Seagal was not to blame, it was at the crap directing when some action scenes took place. The plot was also confusing and basically just felt rushed, maybe it's flattened and released to capitalize on Seagals newer films? <br /> <br /> 3/10 <br /> He's not yet gone, put up under siege 3 and lost a little weight!
