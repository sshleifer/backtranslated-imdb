How is this a documentary? Much more like a running ghost tour, one can enter into any given southern city. Quotes were dropped completely without the first attempt to identify the source. George Orwell was the most identified quote. <br /> <br /> Documents are referred to without ever being produced in any form. Plains of fraudulent shots depicting movie stock are secluded historical films without separating reality and self-promotion. Film roles that were unrealistic and unlikely for the time were abandoned, as if they were trying to fetch a Blair Witch monkey, hoping to plunge a haunted house over what would otherwise be deadly. <br /> <br /> Isn't this in any way a huge lack of respect for actual victims of TB, a dance on their collective graves for the sake of commercialism? The line between actual footage and manufactured self-service is so thin; the drops of doubt played so insignificantly; the scientific boundaries so blatantly ignored ... how can this possibly be listed in my TiVo as a documentary? <br /> <br /> It's a holiday promo, and with that it succeeds fully. <br /> <br /> Hell, I'd like the joint visit if I can find it on Google Earth. Not scary said a previous poster. Not too serious, I say. Fascinating story. Flimsy movie-up.
