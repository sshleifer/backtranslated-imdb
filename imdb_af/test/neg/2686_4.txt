It is clear that many people really enjoy this movie and it is wonderful. This is definitely a very good movie, and I appreciate it in an era of heartless or emotionally damaging movies. Unfortunately, the movie has a lot of problems and it wasn't something I enjoyed watching. <br /> <br /> The primary problem is writing. It's just not very funny. If something funny or witty and fails, it is far worse than when it did not attempt at all. This film is, to a large extent, a series of "snappy" but gentle returnees between adult relatives, who do not seem to be imaginative or fit. There are also some central sites in the movie that seem too much of coincidence or character motivation to be credible or real. Some of the backgrounds were more interesting, and served to decorate the story around the edges fairly well, but it couldn't make the moment-to-moment level of contention nearly penetrating the movie. <br /> <br /> Directing / editing doesn't support the movie well, though I don't know how to explain it exactly. Somehow, things have always kept me in mind, and the actors mostly force unnatural material. They tried, and I didn't owe one person here. There were too many small and charming roles outside the immediate family. <br /> <br /> Not a good rental, but again, apparently a number of people found it very charming (I'm 38; I suspect maybe more than 60 people could enjoy this movie more? ).
