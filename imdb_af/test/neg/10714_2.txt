Maybe it's just that it was made in 1997, or maybe the one who managed to get it to a 7, was a soft spot for children with AIDS. But really people, the maniacal laugh & mayhem during the withdrawal phase? Didn't you see it? I'm surprised there wasn't a baby crawling over the camera over the ceiling and the sick boat. The acting was good, sure. But for me this is just one example of a movie from a time when situations and topic could pass for film language. Things happen, but that's it. There is no glue or motif that can be detected on the screen, so the subject can use the existing emotional connections to the plot without the writing doing it as it is supposed to.
