I am a music lover and was excited to see this movie. Unfortunately I was disappointed. I was ready to walk halfway through the movie. I did not identify with any of the characters, which means I don't care what happened to them and that I completely lost the story. On the good side, Ed Harris looks exactly like Beethoven, and the 9th Symphony is always a pleasure to hear, so it's part of the movie portable. Even the parts where they talk about the bridge almost redeemed the whole movie, but it couldn't keep me up to the end. The actors did what they could with what they had to work, but the script was just not enough to make it even interesting. The little bit about "was my" was turmoil. I wonder how much do the actors take on that one (I wouldn't be able to say those lines without bursting into laughter.) Anyway, such a shame, it could have been so much better.
