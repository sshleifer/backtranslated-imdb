This was, of course, a low budget movie. It shows in every scene. What is nice to see is where it is made. Much of the film was shot in Columbia, CA, in the Sierra Nevada Mountains near Sonora, CA. The film was also shot in Jamestown, CA, very near Columbia. There is a railway museum in Jamestown and they used some of the old trains in the picture. "High Noon" was also shot in Jamestown, such as "Back to the Future III".
