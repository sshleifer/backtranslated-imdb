This is a polarizing film. People like it or despise it, it seems. I despise it. The film comes from the same context as Lindsay Anderson's Oh Lucky Man, but while it's a masterpiece, it's just awful. <br /> <br /> Both films take Kafka's unfinished novel America, for their inspiration and general ideal. America is a surreal story of a youth's journey through the country. Kafka uses this character as a pure observer, one that doesn't change over the course of the journey (although the book is about 300 pages and still only a quarter finished, it never seems). Kafka allows to concentrate and comment on the absurd / surrealistic situations and environment. Oh Lucky Man follows this same template to show Britain through Malcolm McDowell's eyes and weekend the same for France. <br /> <br /> Both films are also extremely Brechtian, using various tricks and techniques to show the fact that it is not real, it is confab. But the difference comes when O Lucky Man uses the constructed film to convey the absurdity of life and the class system. Weekend uses the constructed film to kill us with ideological polemics. Because Godard goes beyond Anderson in his Brechtian principles, we end up with two principle characters in which we have no investment at all. We've been forced to spend 90 minutes with them, but we can't care less about them. Intentionally so. In doing so, Godard leaves us with a film that is entirely about his own message, provided in the first half of the film by careless and remaining symbolism and in the second half by a series of long speeches aimed at camera. Combined with unpleasant and unnecessary scenes such as the actual horrible pig death, much worse than any of the car's absent camera violence. <br /> <br /> The end result is to listen to a student political apparatchik drone and over and over his views while repeatedly kicking in the head to get the message. The problem with Brecht is, if you alienate the audience too much, then you alienate them from what you are trying to convey. It was always clear to me. <br /> <br /> However, the parts that really stay in the craw for this movie are the contrast between the extremely sexually explicit oral description of the threesome at the start and the off-screen comic rape in the middle, which even If it can be considered allegorically, the film destroys itself and it is characters that are few in the first place. It's so French with a capital F, it hurts. <br /> <br /> See o Lucky Man instead. This is a work of genius. Weekend is a prosperous job. <br /> <br /> Two stars, and just for the paper decoration and the piano scene, which are just brilliant tips, though they actually make the end result more frustrating and unsatisfactory than without them being a bad movie by the worst predictor world director. Obviously this is a damn good technical director who makes the most intellectually pretentious film in the world. Somehow this is much worse.
