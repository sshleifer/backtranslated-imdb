Hypothetical situations are abundant, once-off director Harry Ralston gives us the ultimate post-apocalyptic glimpse of the world, left in the streets, in the shops and throughout the landscape, even in the middle of a forgotten desert. A lonely survivor, trying to restore his common sense, takes food from the city to his bungalow in this desert. All in all, he hopes for more, but with no one around, he is wearing white underwear, and a passion for a local Indian tribe ?? to the discovery of a camera that opens new doors and breaks the barriers of human coexistence. Alan, a man of the book, was left on an unknown disaster on Earth. Think he is alone, does he start living life his way? Until Jeri Ryan appeared (as if in any dream) out of the bush, unhappy and unhappy to find the final man alive ... well ... like Alan. Anyway, they are trying to coexist, fail, get drunk, and before they create the ultimate dystopia, they run into Redneck Raphael (played by newcomer Dan Montgomery Jr). Tires are torn, confusion enters, a couple becomes a third wheel, and the battle between physically unclear nerds and brainless jocks. Even with no one left on the planet, it even becomes the darkest of human nature. <br /> <br /> Using a variable movie technique, Ralston gives us a mediocre story loosely on another movie titled "The Peaceful Earth" (which I will see next) which he never gives credit. With a borrowed story, I think he does a decent job of interpreting it again. His punch seems to be too short at the beginning, while Ralston tries to get his way out, borrowing from other film directors' techniques to try his own. He makes the film interesting enough, but fails to answer any direct answers. Certainly, the last days have come, but there could be a brief answer on how, or better yet, why, this couple survived. A spookier started to get us stronger in a comic movie. The contrast would have been like "Shawn of the Dead" but let us feel like we were watching a "made-for-TV" program. Listen to the audio commentary, I respect Ralston because he worked diligently to make this movie, and his passion almost sells the movie, but you can tell from his interaction with the movie that he was not so happy with his overall final not product. There were mistakes, those he pointed out and others that he was ashamed to point out. Although it does make decent independent films, it sometimes feels cheap, and in Ralston's case it was the latter. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that David Arnott's representation of Alan hacked me. He played that wimpy, school nerd, adult role very well. He was funny to watch and listen to, and he became sympathetic to the viewer. He was a key player to keep the film together, unfortunately, I can't say the same for the rest. It was Dan Montgomery's first movie, and it was obvious ?? I mean ?? really very obvious. There were screens in which I thought the ticket would come out soon and read the lines for him, maybe even a more realistic show for us, but unfortunately this was not the case. Then there was Jeri Ryan. She drew her character near the end of the film, which was my highlight of the whole art. She goes from alien unknown to bitter cranky insane girlfriend at the end. Confused? Again she eventually fell into her character, which gave us just a glimpse of what she would probably do if her actions were outdated. Even as the comments progressed, everything she contributed to was a laugh, giggle, or "oh, look at that color" moment. While her beauty can sell tickets, one can consider being just as beautiful. It was her first movie, so can I be too hard? <br /> Overall, this movie felt like something was missing. I was strong in the idea? The premise that even with just a peeping of people living on Earth, the evil of human nature still exists. Jealousy cannot be murdered by bacteria or bombs (perhaps because it is consumed by zinc) and we as a race will always want what we can't have. Ralston is not a surprising director, his techniques are flawed and pre-used, but he knows how to make a low-budget comedy. I think our idea of ​​"funny" is different, so I didn't laugh at many of the bits he found "hysterical". His actors needed the level of acting for this film, which was below average. His film was loose, which means there are elements that have never been explained or tackled (ie something with wings has survived?!?), Which detracted from the intensity of the film overall. It was a comedy, but it could have been much darker and much louder. For those who think Roger Avery was a big element in this movie, as we learn from their comment, was everything he was there for? That was essentially the bank for "The Last Man". Don't get your expectations for any classic Avery moments. <br /> <br /> Don't expect more from Ralston? And that's how I will end it. <br /> <br /> Degree: ** from *****
