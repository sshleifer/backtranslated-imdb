The Foreigner is a straight-to-video Steven Seagal movie originally intended to be released as a theater feature in March 2003. An intention allegedly reversed when Seagal's previous film (Half Past Dead) was thinking at the box office. According to some reports, the film has a cute $ 20 million budget, including location shots in Warsaw and Paris, and has been completed as part of the studio's obligation to enter into a two-photo deal that looks at the relative success of extracts. said that Seagal still had a solid impact. <br /> <br /> Despite the size of their investment, Sony Screen Gems probably made the right move in the shelf of this movie. It's almost incomprehensible. What do I say? This is incomprehensible. I don't think I understood what was going on, except in the broadest terms. <br /> <br /> Seagal is employed by a mysterious man to deliver a mysterious package to another mysterious man. Other mysterious guys are trying to stop him. Other highly mysterious guys are trying to kill the moderately mysterious guys trying to stop him. Other really, many mysterious guys do especially mysterious things, all of which were too secretive to find out. The intended recipient's mysterious wife tries to intercept the package before it can be delivered to her husband. Being a self-proclaimed "perfect professional" who has been hired to deliver the package only to the man's hand, Seagal first opposes the woman and later becomes involved in protecting her and her daughter from other mysterious guys with inexplicable agendas, as well as her husband. <br /> <br /> Many people have mysterious, cryptic conversations. Many people blow each other's brains out. Some guys die more than once, while other screens end up in a screen without a clear view of the rash, so the audience sees someone dying, but not sure which one of the rifle members goes to the mountain. Allegations often move, adding more secrecy. Or should I say confusion? <br /> <br /> I don't know who was on whose side or what someone really wanted, and the resolution was as unsatisfactory as the outline. At the end of the movie I just sat there thinking, "That's the end? What the ...?" <br /> <br /> I couldn't even find the credits. IMDb says Aussie actress Kate Fischer (of "Sirens") was in this movie, but I will be condemned if I know where. Either she was left on the cutting floor or she excluded wisdom from the project. She could have found some activities more beneficial to her career, such as having unnecessary surgery, scratching the awkward input cards from magazines or taking community college courses in animal husbandry. <br /> <br /> Seagal was a pretty fair hand-to-hand warrior, but the action scenes didn't leave it at all. Seagal is now in its fifties and is a very big man, so it is reduced to a minimal level of physical exertion and even through it is in a knee length to conceal its thumb-like Brandoic outline. He can even get some winds to remove the packets from candy bars, but it's understandable if you just estimate how many of those he has to eat to maintain his current perimeter. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal was making a return with deviations, but if his last movie was half dead, the one should be close enough to fill the other half.
