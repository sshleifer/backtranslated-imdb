The film begins with a 30-minute explanation of war, human cyborgs, battles, history and then 2 actors in a pit. They run around this gravel pit / desert area for about an hour to shoot each other. That's it. Must be about Â£ 10.00 to make, with change. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Points out of ten: Acting -9 Sets 1 Costumes -9 Direction -50 Production 1 Titled intro 4 <br /> <br /> I think this movie would be improved: Lose the comments. (Let the viewer decide what is going on). Remove some of the awful CGI. Add some techno rave music. They might just save it.
