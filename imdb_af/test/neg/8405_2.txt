I think "Rosemary's Baby" is the most overlooked horror movie out there. Not scary, interesting or much of anything. It is pretty well aimed and Ruth Gordon was great, but it's about it. But this successor makes it look like Gone With the Wind. <br /> <br /> I took it back on TV when I was 14. Unfortunately, I still remember it. From what I remember Rosemary's baby, Andrew has grown up and the covenant wants him to start taking over (the world it is). But there are forces trying to stop it ... and Andrew doubted himself ... <br /> <br /> I give it a 2 for a few reasons: Gordon is in this (and still very good ); Stephen McHattie was actually pretty good as Andrew and there's a haunting moment at the start with Rosemary (Patty Duke) being kidnapped by a bus ... with no driver. <br /> <br /> Unlike that, it's boring. , stupid and unnecessary. The original doesn't need a sequel! Ira Levin's 1999 follow-up was not much better. <br /> <br /> First vote for the start with Duke ... and then set off. Not worth it.
