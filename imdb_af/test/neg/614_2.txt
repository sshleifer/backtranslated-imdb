hey .... i really don't know why this movie is so much appreciated. Maybe I missed the point. The way I see it, many international filmmakers have made brilliant films that deal with "schizophrenia" and informed, excited, shocked emotion and forcing the audience to hide and think of their reality ........ while it is true that apnea's ambition was ambitious in the face of all the other movies, this one fell short ..... miserably ...... it was too slow, there was no detail about anything and the end .... was completely ... meaningless ...... it was not open ended or anything .... just senseless ..... so watch it if you want to see a good concept that is completely wasted is ..........
