Who is thinking of the store here? How can any producer / network executive / director stab a crew in the sand of a wintery Canadian beach in the sand of a wintery Canadian beach in the sandstone of the best tropical palm trees and try to settle it as tropics. down? Those trees were real palm trees that are a pink tin of K-Mart Christmas tree to true fir. And who's leaving Dermot Mulroney in front of the camera with painted gray hair that didn't play in high school? And didn't any of the geniuses doing quality control think of this thing to fix the (excellent) Canadian actor when he said gaz instead of gas? Everyone involved in this plodding slug of a "movie" writer, director, actor - did not only do good but brilliant work elsewhere. They stayed too fast inside events and deadly, without any emotion except the obvious, imaginative and confronted. Perhaps it just looks like one of the worst movie ever because of all the red carpet hype it has been offering. And I say this as someone who loves life. What do people give? <br /> <br /> All that said, a certain actress's work on a certain critical turn in the movie (and if you've seen it, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about) was so brilliant that the movie A 10 would have gotten me if it was the whole movie. Unfortunately, it was only about five seconds.
