Ag the sci-fi channel. How often do you disappoint me? Often I think, do you ever show good movies? OK, you gave me the big 'Heroes' and the pretty good 'The Lost Room', but they are a series, and for the movie there is nothing positive to say. Bad acting, bad directing, terrible characters and a level story, and that's just for the start. I signed out director Allan A Goldstien and was not surprised to find anything of interest in his resume (in fact, I think it's a pseudo-name). The site of four motorcyclists out of motto crossing in a national park when one of them has an accident requiring a park keeper to save them just to catch them in a forest forest is poor and predictable that you beat every beat Know before this happens. The front man, Bryan Genesse, the park keeper, is so bad, it's terrible. Throw as the action hero champion boy in the footsteps of so many others, this man makes Seagal and Van Damme like De Nero. The supporting role is a little better and well before the end there was a residual hope that the fire would then devour them all the movie crew. Avoid at all costs
