Quentin Tarantino once said to be successful in the film industry, you had to make your own Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs. Author / actor / director Larry Bishop seems to have taken the board a little too literally with Hell Ride and received a sloppy tribute that lends too much to his visual, music, camera work and time-changing storytelling. But to properly imitate a Tarantino movie, one must have talent to build creative talks. Unfortunately, Hell Ride's primary nail element is its horrible ramblings and vulgar monologues that only work to confuse the audience and confuse the audience while simultaneously calling for the actors to be involved. <br /> <br /> The anti-hero protagonist biker gang, The Conquerors, consists of several weathered vigilantes who bring their own mark of bloodthirsty justice to the lawless paths. The leader, Pistolero (Larry Bishop), is completely revenge and burnout. The Ghent (Michael Madsen) is just trying to balance his chaotic, psychotic symphony of life by giving lead to anyone who crosses his boss, and Comanche (Eric Balfour) follows with a fiery loyalty and a mysterious past. <br /> <br /> On the rogue front, Deuce (David Carradine) is the master brain that has orchestrated from afar, although not quite far enough, and Billy Wings (Vinnie Jones) spits poison and ominous statements for his tattoos while having a harpoon rifle and a general contempt for life. Although these characters may be interesting on paper, as soon as they are forced to enter into terribly poorly comprehensible dialogue, all traces of coolness disappear faster than Bishop's next film funding. Whilst Hell Ride is being beaten with imperfections and missed opportunities, the main facet of its illegal lies in the poorly-conceived talks. And because Bishop's main influences are the talky films of Tarantino, there are many of them. The first twenty minutes of the film is almost incomprehensible and will probably make so much sense. By the time Pistolero's headache is set and certain phrases are being overused to the point of nausea, you will pray for both death and the ability to turn off the sound. Even Dennis Hopper has trouble keeping cool while spitting such a foolish dialogue. <br /> <br /> Have you ever repeated a word or phrase to yourself so that it just doesn't sound right or even makes sense? Bishop starts there and then keeps the madness until you envy the characters on the screen to cut off their heads. And when the dialogue finally breaks, we are treated to cut between the shots of naked female oil scrub and throat. I'm not sure what effect Bishop hoped to achieve, but I doubt he got it. <br /> <br /> Hell Ride wants to pay tribute to Quentin Tarantino movies, Robert Rodriguez movies and every movie featuring the violent and devil-power-attitudes of cyclists. But while his intentions are noble, the terrible cringe-worthy dialogue and the hyper-styled timeline-missing editing prevent the public from investing with generic solid characters. By the time we find out the riddle behind the characters' motives (and it may be a while before you realize there is a mystery to be solved), it's just too difficult to care more. And while everyone on the screen is having fun, they have completely neglected to translate any of that entertainment into the audience. <br /> <br /> - Joel Massie
