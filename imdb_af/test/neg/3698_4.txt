This is the kind of movie that BEGS shows at 3 or 4 in the morning on TV. <br /> <br /> No doubt, the filmmakers responsible for attacking the 50-footed wife have made an appropriate statement about women and philandering and the dangers of the demon rubble, all included in a scientific allegory . <br /> <br /> Or perhaps it was a write-off of tax. <br /> <br /> Anyway, "Attack" proves best for the viewer under the following circumstances: a) extreme drunkenness, b) seen on a double account with any of those Jacqueline Suzanne movies (maybe " sometimes not enough?) or c) just a night when you feel unsafe and the world around you is too perfect. Pop in 'Attack' and you'll feel good, guaranteed! <br /> <br /> It's good for a laugh at the expense of the hokey script, the rubbery special FX and the four-eyed sheriff. And I think the last line should be in a monument somewhere in Washington D.C. engraved. It's just as memorable. <br /> <br /> Four stars for "Attack of the 50 Footwife"; buy a copy, post it to Gloria Steinem - she will love you for it.
