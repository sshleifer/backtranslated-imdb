When you make a movie with a killer child premium, there are two effective ways to approach it; You can also make it as realistic as possible, create credible characters and situations, or you can make it as enjoyable by playing it for fun (for example, the makers of "Silent Night, Deadly Night" on an equally controversial subject: a killer Santa). However, the people who made "Bloody Birthday" do not do those things; they rely solely on the shock value of the image of a child with a gun (or a knife, or a nose, or an arrow) in his / her hand. The result is both offensive and stupid. The whole movie looks like a bad idea rushed through production (and then held for a few years of release). It is a bit redeemed by good children's performances, but it is VERY messy. (* 1/2)
