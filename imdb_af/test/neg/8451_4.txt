** SPOILERS ** With the title of the movie twice the name of the killerfish once, you'd expect to see them in action attack bite-ripping and bite almost everyone in the throwing characters. Instead, wait until the movie is almost over for you to get as much as a look at the Piranahs. Even though you see the water bubbling and stirring as a poor individual disappears under the assumption that he is being eaten by the fish. The movie "Piranha Piranha" starts with this scary looking Piranha on the screen if the credits start rolling down but **** SPOILER **** this is the only time in the movie you ever get to see the killer fish or fish what you never see a piranha is the movie again. What you see is a travel report from Venezuela and it's people and the Venezuelan jungle along the Amazon river basin. Along with very beautiful and breathtaking photography of the landscape, as well as the people and wildlife, it's all about it. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of story dealing with this great White Hunter Caribe, William Smith, which ironically means Piranha in the mother tongue spoken there, which is the title of the movie "Piranha Piranha "really meant? "Caribe Caribe"! The person Caribe is played by the legendary Hollywood Hell's Angles biker and around the difficult man William Smith. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, this trio of American tourists Jim Pendrake and his sister Terry, Peter Bown & Ahna Capri, and their American guide Art Green, Tom Simcox, are on their way to the Venezuelan jungles to watch with Terry to take pictures to return. Terry is scared of guns, as we learn that as a young girl, her father sees his head blow off with a gun. Even when Art saved her life by using one as his attack by a six foot long backbone, Terry, almost charged him to have a gun; what he promised he would not take with him on the journey. <br /> <br /> At a jungle stop, or bar, the three are in Caribe, which we initially saw in the jungle jungle. of the movie. Caribe welcomes himself more than three with his knowledge of the jungle and his half-baked philosophy of life and death, as well as his ability to get them to the local diamond mines deep in the Amazon basin. <Br /> <br /> Although a bit strange at first, the man is so into himself that he doesn't seem to notice that there are people around him, Caribe is apparently a sweltering and nice guy who is busy for a long time . and friendly motorcycle race through the swamps and jungle with art. Caribe even shows Terry, who at one point in the movie almost knocked out his teeth, the fine points of hunting and shooting game that he apparently didn't really die, but became part of him after he killed them! A little crazy, but you have to admit that this man has imagination. <br /> <br /> It is much later in the film that for some strange reason, perhaps it's the cheap drink he drank, Caribe suddenly goes crazy and becomes murderous and Terry rapes and rapes and her brother brother and moor. take him to the deadly piranhas. Try to escape from the devastating lunatic and then be forced to fight it with him. Art is so severely defeated by the dirty battles Caribe that he has left almost unconscious. Just then Caribe's Art. Eventually killing, he is shot dead by Terry, who, after the experience of this insane neutral work, finally decided that guns are indeed needed and needed to kill many rare but lifesaving opportunities. br /> <br /> It's worth looking at, if it's worth watching, just for the scenery and nothing else. It's just a shame that the movie should advertise as a killer fish, or Piranha, horror movie, if it were honest about it, it could be a more or less average jungle of adventure with Smith. He's building it, playing Tarzan of the Venezuelan, not Africa, Jungle
