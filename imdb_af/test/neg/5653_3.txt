Miranda Cosgrove is known for her debut in "School of Rock" with Jack Black and her role as Megan in the show "Drake and Josh" and she became a favorite with the Nickelodeon public. So it's no surprise that Dan Schneider would just make her a show. Unfortunately, it ends up as bad as, if not worse than, The Amanda Show. <br /> <br /> "iCarly" is about three friends, Carly, Sam and Freddie, who have become idols in the junior high community through a webcam show called "iCarly". Carly and Sam are hosts and Freddie shoots and puts it on the internet. Carly also has an older brother named Spencer, performed by the hilarious Jerry Trainor known for his work in "Drake and Josh" as Crazy Steve. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you this. Don't believe the 8.3 out of 10 that this show was received, as it's almost every aspect pathetic. Dan Schneider probably studied about 5 minutes of teenage interests, because all I see is that he says "iPod? IPhone? IHome? Aha! Teens love anything that starts with" I "!" and a majority of Drake and Josh performances, if not, are just very dry and joking jokes that don't even talk about generosity, like: "You want me to turn on the AC to 60 degrees? "" No. We want you to make it to 60 shekels! " Not only that, but when you look closely, almost all the sets are used in "Drake and Josh" and "Ned's Declassified" which are simply picked up with pots and try to look different. <br /> <br /> The scenes where the show is a broadcast of the iCarly network are just as horrible as the whole series itself. The dialogue in them is terribly bad, which can be accepted by some, as it is only two friends playing in front of a camera, but what is dealing with the very strange, humorous antiques they like "Random Dancing! " Do? And it just gets worse. <br /> <br /> In terms of acting, Miranda and Jennette are not at their best. Nathan Kress, who played Freddie, is sometimes not credible, but he does a good job. The person who really steals the show is the humorous skill of Jerry Trainor, who fits in well with his "older parent" role and his wide eye-level performance can make some pretty funny segments. Badly they are not regular, because it could have given the show an extra star in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Dan Schneider had made this show for the sole purpose of giving Miranda Cosgrove her own cable-born. playground to jump around and spray illegal jokes and pathetic cue-card lines in every direction, because everyone has buried extraordinary talent under the poorly written writing and weightless acting. Dan Schneider did a good job with "Drake and Josh", so it's a real disappointment that "iCarly" is such a failure. Jerry Trainor's play retained this 1 out of 10 rating, but he alone couldn't save "iCarly" to be so horrible.
