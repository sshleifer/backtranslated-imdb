This is another movie I missed on Italian TV as a child: notable for his quintet of aging stars. Most of them have never made a horror movie in their lives (Fred Astaire, Melvyn Douglas, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., John Houseman and Patricia Neal), it's about the men's long-hidden past crime to haunt them. This is the form of a ghostly death switch for the girl who loved them all (Alice Krige), but who had to be forced to go to an unfortunate incident when they humiliated their ego! Fairbanks, who was the one responsible for the act, has twin sons (Craig Wasson) and so Krige also leads her revenge on them. Soon one of the latter, Fairbanks himself and even Douglas and Houseman are all dead. That is why the remaining Wasson and Astaire decide to confront the ghost at the scene of the crime, where they also have to fight some sinister tramps that somehow offer Krige's offer! I was looking forward to seeing these veterans on their last legs (Douglas died before the film even suggested. By that time, he had played a different role while proving Astaire's own ominous swan song), but GHOST STORY has also gone through many changes of mood - while a low pace comes right through and far into the bargain, everything but a failed curio. With sex dolls (including Wasson's front nudity!) And gruesome makeup effects, water has become increasingly disrupted and the old-fashioned elegance inherent in Jack Cardiff's (another notable long-lasting) cinematography is destroyed.
