This is a perfect example of why many people say the 90's sucked when it comes to horror movies. A devious voodoo-on-campus story of terror with the once-promising Corey Feldman (STAND BY ME, THE LOST BOYS, etc.). There may be just enough things to drop you and it doesn't look too cheap, but it's still an abomination aimed at an audience that was in their early teens during the 90s. I might have been part of the audience, but still I got as good as nothing when I saw it now. And nowadays, teenagers are getting a lot more and better used, and I don't think any of them know or care about who Corey Feldman was. Or, "is," actually, since the guy is still making movies. But the only thing that still links itself to his days of glory is the Lost Boys 2: the recently made TRIBE successor. And I even think no one would encourage anyone to seek VOODOO. Just another movie that has disappeared for 90 clear grounds.
