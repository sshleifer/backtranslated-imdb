May contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> An innocent trailer or perhaps 'Compton' LA white child is witnessing a terrible childhood trauma to drugs and violence. An unprofessional but dedicated police partner is trying to take off a 'sophisticated' high-end club drug ring just dismissed and watched by the drug high-priced lawyers. The plot thickens as more people return to seek revenge and justice with a predictable end. The only memorable part was an attack by Ron Jeremy. <br /> <br /> If I were in a movie, I would have asked for a refund. I feel sorry for the poor actors in this movie. It was just awful and painful to watch. The worst part was the cinematography where the director returned in the same scene so the sound couldn't really match. And NO it was not a codec or DVD problem, but a deliberate technique. Ughh. Two stars.
