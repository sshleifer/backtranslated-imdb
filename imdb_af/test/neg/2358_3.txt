If I had no expectations of this movie, it could have received a 5 or 6. I give it a 3. The play is poor, the factual accuracy of the drugs being discussed is missing and I don't feel empathy for the characters. <br /> <br /> I watched "Adam & Paul" immediately before watching this movie, and I both laughed and cried several times. This movie didn't get a similar cord. The directors of 'Human Traffic' may have some deviant experiences of ecstasy, but there is no demonstration of actual drug-related semantic knowledge here. In fact, I find it rather offensive and counterproductive for the controversy to make current drug laws less politically oriented. <br /> <br /> See 'Requiem for a Dream' if you're looking for a great movie. about drugs.
