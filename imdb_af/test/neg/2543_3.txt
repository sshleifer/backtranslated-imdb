Due to rather dubious plate tectonics, Japan begins to slide under the sea. Initial predictions say it will last about 40 years before the country is immersed, but a villain scientist adds even more dubious science and determines that it will take less than 1 year! The government thinks he is a squat, but evidence soon begins with his theory. <br /> <br /> This big budget disaster movie follows the formula put by a number of Hollywood movies of the late nineties (I assume I didn't see anything about them), with the scale of the disaster and the tragedy the nobility of the human (well, Japanese) spirit acts of heroism and sacrifice, and the power of love or something like that. ie it is so naive in its psychology as its geology ... we all know that half of the population would be raped and plunder the moment they thought the police turned their backs on, and the other half would just panic and be useless. /> <br /> The movie does have some very special special effects but is not as smooth or expensive as an equivalent Hollywood production would be. It is at least as nationalistic, humorous and lacking in self-awareness as Hollywood movie would be, and probably even worse. It does have the hot evil chick of Battle Royale as one of the prospects ... but she is not even angry and is therefore much less hot. <br /> <br /> The movie is too much at 132 minutes, getting worse and worse as it progresses to a conclusion that has endangered me. I certainly didn't mind whether Japan was halfway down or not, and before the end I tried to think of ways to speed up the process if I ever were in that situation. <Br /> <br /> But it does have nice special effects, and Kou Shibasaki is still very hot, so I give it generously ... 3/10.
