Lance used to get quality support from James Cameron. Heck, he even had his own TV program (Millennium) for a cup of seasons. Why is he doing this? Can't find a better way to pay his bills? <br /> <br /> I love a good low-budget movie. Some of them can be simply because of their ridiculous representation, their textbook stereotype characters, or often because the actors are related to the director / producers. But this movie has no value loss. I didn't laugh. I didn't cry. I just had this sick feeling in my stomach. That feeling was quickly identified as a pity. At one point, Lance Henriksen was an A-list supporting actor. He was in Terminator (he was a terminator before Arnold arrived), Aliens, AliensIII, classic B-movie Pumpkinhead, among so many others! I wanted to send him money afterwards. Perhaps we should start a supportive Lance fund or something. <br /> <br /> Then again, to make this thing ... maybe not.
