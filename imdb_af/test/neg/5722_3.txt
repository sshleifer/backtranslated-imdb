Well, I admit that I like Brigitte Neilsen in an unhealthy way, I have only one thing for 6-long women with swords. There I said it. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with the movie? Almost every mistake you can make is made. You take a successful movie (conan) and you drag it through the mud with bad writing, bad casting, bad effects and the worst thing of all ... you put a cute kid there for comic relief. This kind of thing almost killed the Indiana Jones series, which you know. Nice kids are for Disney movies, not real movies. Neilsen has taken the film seriously, though it looks like nobody else has done it. The plot repeatedly pulled Schwarzenegger's red Sonja's fat out of the fire and it significantly undermined her character. A warrior's wife doesn't need a man to get her out of a mess, it's her job! Not to re-use the Conan character in this movie was a crime. Kalidor? Wow. The movie never played the right mood and his pacing was rather rude and sloppy, unlike Conan the Barbarian who had several story lines that were graceful. When it comes to fantasy flicks, it's okay to have cheesy costumes, it's okay to have Harryhausen style animation. It's good to have dull excessive sets that don't make sense, but to have a terrible writing is unforgivable. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been a classic, but the writing felt it was written by a 12 year old.
