This show is pathetic. I can't even begin to think of how someone with an IQ that is larger than a can of soup soup past his expiry date can sit for half an hour through this garbage. It's one of those weird shows that is so indignant, in all respects you can honestly say you're less intelligent than watching it. I did a study and found that the average person lost 10 IQ points for every fifteen seconds they watched on this exhibition. It's second only to another Comedy Network abortion, Popcultured (19,863,221 IQ points per second lost) and almost a tie with Girls Will Be Girls. Keys to the VIP each owe us an excuse. When I look at this travesty of a show, I feel sad for society. How is it allowed to continue?
