There are many different problems with the movie "KillShot". For one there are too many coincidences. The man is a hunter and just kicks on the day the chief killer appears, with someone who knows the killer. All right, I'll take that one. The child calls the brokerage after which the woman works and asks that money be ready when he gets it. Okay, I'll take that one too. Before going to cash, he decided to rob our killer, who didn't kill him, but decided to work with him. It really gets bad. Then they appear on the same day that the man has an interview with his wife's boss. No one is there, but the woman and the man who decided to get into the empty office. They make their way into the office and the professional killer just assumes they're talking to the right guy. It's just in the first 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are many more holes in this movie, then I give up talking. Why didn't the killer kill everyone at the brokerage I didn't know? Why didn't he shoot the woman on her stoep, I don't know. Why did he leave that dumb kid, make all those dumb moves and mess up a lot of shit, I don't know. Why the girl was even in the movie, I don't know. Why did he decide not to drop the gun and just release it on the counter, I don't know. Why did they even go into the witness protection program, I do not know. What I do know is that the Casting Director did a good job, the Director of Photography did a very good job, the Location Scout chose good places and the Production Designer was worth every penny. So my advice for anyone who wants to choose a roadmap that will be so well-managed by the crew is to ensure that any attempt to kill someone through the hit is not filled by a peak through an open window.
