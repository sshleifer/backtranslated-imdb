When Jan Svankmajer runs his imagination, get ready. You are in for dark, harsh movies like "Alice" and "Little Otik" or short jewelry such as "Down to the Cellar" and "Jabberwocky." All of these are excellent films that represent at best disturbing, surrealistic films. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, when Svankmajer tries to make a political statement of any kind, you are advised to hurry the room. Svankmajer's films in this year tend to be both adolescent and pastor, offering straw man caricatures in repetitious fashion to express his pseudo-brilliant insights. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Lunacy is the latter kind of movie. Cartoonish ideas and characters are stretched for a terrifying two-hour paper thin. There are a few moments of interest, but these few oases are separated by big deserts of boredom. <br /> <br /> If you found Svankmajer's horrible, monotonous short film "Et Cetera" brilliant and hilarious, you'll probably love "Lunacy." If you've never seen a Svankmajer movie, please start elsewhere.
