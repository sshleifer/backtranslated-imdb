I expected much more from this movie. The preview looks interesting, so I decided to check it out. Bottom line is that "The Adventures of Sebastian Cole" only had one decent thing: Adrian Grenier. <br /> <br /> I really like Grenier and made his performance very enjoyable. The character is well-designed, but all the other kind just drives through the movie. Clark Gregg is really good, but I don't think his character is too well explained. I mean there's not too much to explain; he wants to be a woman. Still, something was missing. <br /> <br /> The obvious low budget of the movie was nice to see. I enjoyed filming on just a screenplay, and just a few actors. It was a good change. <br /> <br /> While the main idea of ​​the movie was actually good, it was disappointing to see many scenes that have nothing to do with it, but just threw it here and there. As I said, the author looks promising and I have to say that I was interested in where director Tod Williams was heading, but it was basically a very slow movie with not too good dialogue. <br /> <br /> "Sebastian" looks good at the end, but again it fell right into a hole. The acting was mostly good, the writing needed work, but the film's budget helped it in the long run. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to anyone who wants a silent movie with a strong character, but otherwise I will stay away. Personally, I wouldn't look at it twice.
