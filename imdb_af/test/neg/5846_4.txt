Just watched this movie late last night. I remember the hype of his release and to be honest I saw it again, then I might not have been so generous. I hate hype, it can ruin a movie. I think the movie was about the characters and put too much emphasis on Woody. He was also good - although wondering if he was stoned all the time. It never went too deep. Redford was dark but not too dark and his character eventually dropped me. For me, he must have been more confrontational with Demi - maybe throwing her out or telling her she's been paid. After all, he would have investigated them before he made the proposal - it was not shown in the movie, but no one in his observable position would have made an offer to anyone. He was cruel about breaking them up and the last straw was the house and yet Demi fell for him? The sections that gave insight to Demi and Woody's relationship were the best part of the movie. There was a sharp depth that outpaced John Gages' character. He could really have been much stronger and, as other people pointed out, I think the movie draw was Redford and they didn't want to sniff his "image". I say what hell Robert was old in this movie! Woody and Demi's characters were naive in a sense, but I think it was very deliberate to move you to their destiny and to fight their decision. But the reality is that they lost their dream home and where did they go? Las Vegas? to dare to leave little and then accept a madman rich billionaire proposal. I found their naivety when Redford seduced them a little too unrealistically. The movie could have been so much more and other actors would have made a difference, but it said on the late night television. It was nice and I, if you don't think too much, are nice too
