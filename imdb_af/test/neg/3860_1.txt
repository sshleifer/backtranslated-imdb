I just looked to see Joe Morton in an early role and honestly wished I hadn't bothered, he could and has done much better than this crap ever since. Can't understand why someone finds this kind of stupidity funny, but each at his own; it is an absolute mess and not funny at least. No waiting, just one line was funny, where Mr. Kent (Joe) and his family enjoyed this nutmeg dinner as he was invited to dinner. (Lord only knows why). Pest to Mr Kent: You know how it is like a dog. You're there. Mrs Kent: Not recently, Joe's expression was funny, but it's one thing that doesn't make a good comedy and it's so far away that it's funny. is sent to the nearest garbage bin, it is just good enough for it. Joe Morton - glad to see you, no longer appears in garbage; you are much better and a great big actor.
