There are movies not released in theaters, but on video. This should be allowed to age and dissolve the way the old nitrate film stock is made. No story, inappropriate violence, ear maintained, poorly written and the pity is that the star was not the only bad role in the film. And I liked Siegel's other movies and enjoyed them.
