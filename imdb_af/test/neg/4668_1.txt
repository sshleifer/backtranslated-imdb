First. I'm not looking at Americans. I know many people who are intelligent people from the US. But this movie is so bad I just had to comment on it. <br /> <br /> First of all ... Movies are mostly far from the truth. This movie is no exception. Many scenes are so incredibly fake. For example, the departure of the 2-space ships. You see they leave the full tanks in space. Just a little distance apart. Remember what caused the spacecraft to explode in the past? Just share a tinsy win that came down. Here it is only common to drop fuel tanks that are as large as not larger than the entire ship. Which idiot makes 2 spaceships light and does it at the same time? Secondly, the Russian station is a piece of shit. I hate to bring it to you but astronauts are going to Russia these days. Since their equipment is much more reliable, then NASAs are. The space shuttle has retired. And NASA just uses it to pay off the bills. And there's no better alternative for that. And the list of tippers goes on and on. It is truly an insult to people traveling in space. And I know half as much as these guys do. But the most annoying part (read: the whole movie) is the propaganda and patriotic chess that you got hurt. MY GOD !!!! I thought I was looking for a CNN business commercial for like an hour. The actors solve their small problems by shooting each other, giving the middle finger to all who come face to face, fight, ignore the police, etc. But when it comes to their love for their country and to sacrifice their lives, all of them are in the suicide bombers. Maybe I don't have the feeling of a true "Patriot", which the folk song can sing backwards in Swahili. While driving with George Bush behind the wheel of a golf cart, drive in circles until the battery is empty. But this movie was too much for me to handle as well. And when I finally pulled the flagpole and the dust of the American flag out of my hiney. I realized I was happy this movie was finally done. I don't know why so many good actors participated in this meticulous, stereotypical, propaganda movie. But I'm sorry for them. It represents a country where you can get away with murder if you have money or power. As long as Uncle Sam thinks you're a good patriot. Where everyone is happy as long as it is another country that is devastated, no one cares.
