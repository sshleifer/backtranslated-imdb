This little cheap is just remarkable, because it's the worst movie Abbott and Costello ever made. It's horrible in every way: dirty music, horrible choreography (watch the awkward head male dancer), cheesy special effects and sets, wooden actors (the leaders are scarce at high school in their profession and were unheard of later) and a script without a single layer. Better times were ahead of the comedy duo. Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd is much better, just like the television series, which is sometimes inspired. But skip this one.
