This movie may have been one of the most original and unfunny movies I've seen in the past. To be honest, I didn't expect a revolutionary comic formula, but I expected to entertain at least. With such low expectations, how can I be disappointed? <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey, possibly my favorite actor (not sarcasm), has done little more than treadmill in this movie. He seems to return temporarily to his funny-faced roots and created a character that is no different from his Fletcher Reede of Liar Liar. This new character, Dick Harper (a.c. Fletcher 2.0) is a poorly rendered and miserably written bat. If you smile yourself while watching this bitter and essentially boring character, it's probably because Carrey is trying so hard to bring a third dimension to him. Carrey's outrageous attitude becomes humorously uncomfortable - and finally, sad. <br /> <br /> Tee Leoni as Jane does little more than provide the Abbott to Carrey's Costello. I find Tea Leoni typically refreshing and under-used, but not in this case. Jane Harper could easily be played by any actress from the age of thirty to forty-five, and it is in that non-specificity that the character of Jane is uninteresting. She simply has no other characteristic than the next of the movie's general theme, which it seems to be. Wait, no, this movie has no theme. Unless you see "Big Business Is Evil" as a theme. I thought it was more of a given. <br /> <br /> Richard Jenkins and Alec Baldwin deliver credible (though tired) supportive actions, but no one really looks into the role they play. It is very clear that Alec Baldwin made such a great effort to play his role as the sinister C.E.O. as he wants to eat a sandwich (which he looks very much recently). <br /> <br /> Slight touchline, but has Alec Baldwin played any role over the past few years that didn't need him to be a powerful hit in a suit? <br /> <br /> Anyway, take my advice if you haven't seen the horror for yourself: save your money. This is the one that catches on HBO over a few months. Dick and Jane are present, but there is no fun to have.
