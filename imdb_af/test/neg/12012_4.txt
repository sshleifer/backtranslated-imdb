Junior and his father start a new life in a new town. It's the same life because Junior didn't change one piece. He is still the same rotten brat as before, but he grew bigger. This time he has a pal, called Trixie, and she's just a little worse. Junior doesn't like his father who dates and makes every opportunity he has. Then grandpa goes in and the dog comes along. I thought the two of them would make it a good movie, but they didn't even get to the end of the company. It's a movie for immature people. It did diapers, farts, doggy, and toilet humor in it. Only someone under the age of twelve will find it super hilarious. I hope if I have a boy, he is exactly like Junior.
