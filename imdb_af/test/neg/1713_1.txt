Do the following: Get a copy of this movie and a friend. Wait the friend $ 10 that they can't go through this whole movie. They cannot deviate from their gaze or be distracted by anything. Look at your friend now. Win or lose, you get $ 10 entertainment. <br /> <br /> It makes me no end when people watch a movie and quickly give it 1 out of 10, or take their minds with "it sucks". (And then asked "Why?", They respond, "Just because." Arrgh.) That's why this movie. It's the only purpose for me to say, "There! It's a terrible movie! It's 1 out of 10!". <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely horrible. <br /> <br /> While the recent trend of movie paradises forced them to be increasingly formulated. This movie falls short in every aspect. It's not funny. It's not entertaining. And for some of the parodies it is totally inaccurate! Horrific acting. Inappropriate dialogue. A whiteless story. Terrible special effects. One INANE gag at the other. And to make matters even worse, there is not even a generous nudity to somehow make it worthwhile. <br /> <br /> This movie jumps past idiot, stumbles over stupid and lands first on moronic face. Even I, who loves a good "watch your brain at the door" movie, got me physically excited to watch it. This movie isn't even "Hard Ticket To Hawaii" so awful - it's good, bad ... It's just a little bit. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I actually challenged a friend to see it as described above. Not only was he able to do it, but he had a headache and needed a few minutes later because he felt a little sick. True story. <br /> <br /> I couldn't emphasize this rating anymore ... a sounding 1 out of 10!
