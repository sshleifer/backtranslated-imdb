I think there are two ways to make a movie with children than the intended audience. You can either say to yourself, 'Let's make a movie that children will love today!' or b) "Let's make a movie I would have loved when I was a child!" The second approach explains why Steven Spielberg often makes movies that appeal to a younger audience. First examples are E.T., The Goonies or Indiana Jones. That Darn Cat is an example of the first approach. You see these flat, amazing characters telling things that are supposed to be funny, but they are not. The plot itself is enough for a ten minute short, but instead it continues. And although I'm not a kid, don't I fully understand what this movie is supposed to be fun for kids? The rogue police rushed a dog, the old woman with a dual-body or Christina Ricci's sarcastic oneliners? One actor showed a spark talent with his many acrobatic humor: Doug E. Doug plays the FBI agent.
