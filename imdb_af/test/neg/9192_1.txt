One of the worst movies ever made. Let's start with the superficial: Joaquin Phoenix is ​​primarily too fat to be a firefighter. The NYFD does not recruit Pillsbury dough boys. John Travolta has a bad dyeing job, and the odd shine in his eye throughout the movie made me think that he was a kind of Scientology extender. The plot hits all the tropics and clichés of what the average Joe believes life as a firefighter is really like: they all get drunk, get fights, have a difficult time expressing their emotions, their wives are all at the house crying, they all have dad problems, everyone has a Boston accent, and so on. An invaluable piece of swarmware that plays on our long-lasting cultural hero-worship of firefighters after 9-11. It was incidentally valid cultural hero worship. Unfortunately, this film does not offer any credible heroes to worship.
