The premise of this movie is ugghhhh. The man is married and although everyone on this site seems to think, "Yes, it's funny, cute and a good movie." What the hell?!?! What's funny about immature girls playing with a married man with a new baby? What's nice about the fact that he's cheating on his wife? What went wrong with getting teenage boys to have sex before they started school? No, it's not good enough, the man must be married, off-limits, off-the-market, that's the one we need. Dumb ass girls! Then one of the girls decides that she "loves" the man. No, she "just keeps" the way he makes her feel. Two of the girls enjoy it, they think it's funny and no one looks at moral problems with what they do. It's just shameless, but yes it's all good with everyone one this site. The dark-haired girl even has the audacity to get her dad from the house, under the breast of the baby. This is a morally disgusting movie and where is the woman? Poor woman works and pays the bill while screwing the baby.
