Rourke does his usual little bit, as a sinister, rancorous, Neanderthal, malicious, evil yoke, in the same form as in "Picture Claire", "Out in Fifty", "Get Carter", "Double Team" and the rest of he is in the garbage. <br /> <br /> He has very few lines. <br /> <br /> Of course it's all just junk, undervalued Rourke, prevents him and doesn't matter. for his characterization as an actor. After praying ... "" Johnny Handsome "," Barfly "," 9 1/2 Weeks "," Year of the Dragon "etc. For many years I considered Rourke an outstanding, smart, intelligent man "I think he has since changed. <br /> <br /> He looks reckless, calcined. <br /> <br />" He looked with dark eyes; / Despair has inhabited his chest / And the man made a perfect plague. "(Belloc," The Example ") <br /> <br /> I had absolutely no other reason to see this dull movie, except that Rourke was in it.
