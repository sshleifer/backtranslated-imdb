no really, i'm not joking here, and i can't believe how many people here really gave it really positive reviews! Oh wait, this is the IMDB comment section, stupid me. It is interesting to note that on this date there are not enough votes to give this movie a score of ten, but there are dozens of comments about the film raves. What does it mean that I wonder? Anyway, the font is awful. character changes their personality and motivation and action every scene, to stop the movie that looks vague. It wasn't even stupid, it was also there, but the pure idiots of the writing exceeded any stupidity that the characters showed. For example, Karl was not told a command because there are two dead bodies in the desert and "the killer is there somewhere" so he forces everyone to travel 40km to find the murderer, to obey orders and to all. command. When the hero sees something vaguely in the dark and Karl warns, Karl tells our hero to stop being an idiot and that there is nothing there, so they all go home. Next scene, he refuses to let it go and has to hunt everything it is. It's just a joke. Yes, the monster is very impressive, but the crap the people are saying is just trying to cancel its interesting aspects, and the predator and alien moments are very boring. and the end ... the end!?!?! jesus .... the worst movie I've seen this year, and I've seen bugbuster!
