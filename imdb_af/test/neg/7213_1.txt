this movie is a lot of waste, and to try and base it, the first is just a farce. The most important thing that dropped it for me was the use of one of the first ones, said earlier by classic actors. since Sam Elliot cannot be reproduced in any way, I mean when Dalton phones are wading in the 1st, and he ends the call with cool, it was great, but if the bunch called the DEA agent back home, he made the call with gladness. cool it doesn't have the same ring, it's really, there are others, but i can't be bothered, but i hope you get my drift. ...
