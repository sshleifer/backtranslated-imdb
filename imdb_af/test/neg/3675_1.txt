It seems there is great potential for the story line of this movie to be something worthy of watching. The acting was flat and the story lacked depth. There was too much confidence in camera work, which had some high points. I have to agree with the other negative comments. I just wish I had read them before I bought the DVD. The movie can be worth watching for free and you are bored to get tears in hand. There could have been much more plot development with why there is homelessness in Moscow (ie post-Soviet capitalism), drug use (ie increased heroin trade from Afghanistan); more development of why the revival of Russian Orthodoxy after the fall of the USSR, the archaeologists themselves, or even more in the fight against nihilism.
