I'm a big fan of Patricia Hodge and Mariam Margolyes, so I watched this show when A & E happened a few years ago. The show was strange to say the least, but I gave it a chance because I kept these actresses. It must be one of the worst shows I've ever seen. I won't see it again and will definitely not waste money buying the video. The storyline of this TV version is ridiculous and just stupid! The "kicker" (pun intended) comes when Ruth did an operation on her leg bones. That kind of nonsense belongs to James Bond and Sci-Fi movies. If this version is true for the book, I won't review the book from my local library! The American version came out a few years after I saw this original. To my surprise, the Americans did it, as their version is played with Meryl Streep and Roseanne for the laugh, and it's pretty funny. When played, the storyline works.
