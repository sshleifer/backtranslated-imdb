Why is this movie bothering to see? It is probably an award to be the worst career career of a major movie star since Clark Gable's laughing play of an Irish patriot in Parnell. <br /> <br /> It is unthinkable that Bergman will feature this film and his director on a lucrative Hollywood career where she can choose from the best scripts and directors presented at the time. Initially there was no writing to work with, except for a few notes. Then we are supposed to believe the polished Bergman as a poor refugee who is willing to do something that is released from a refugee camp, including marriage to a poor Italian fisherman she doesn't even love. I read where Anna Magnani was the original choice for this part. If so, it made a lot of sense to throw the lighter Bergman into such a proletarian part. But since she fell in love with her director, common sense flew. <br /> <br /> So she'll be living in this poor village where the men have to swing to withdraw a lean life from the sea. A place she naturally hates to be and where she doesn't fit. <br /> <br /> Her only friend is the town priest who knows she is not fit for the life of a poor fisherman's bride, but tells her that for the sake of love she must suppress her true feelings of aversion and accept the poverty and despair she meets every day. In addition, this volcano is always on the verge of eruption and they all drown in hot lava. But like a true heroine, Bergman repented of her misery by declaring war on almost everyone else in this brave movie. She even goes as far as to seduce the town priest, in a lower-pitched scene if it wasn't so pathetic. Since her husband's poor arm should lock her in a room to not let her run away, she must use her body to buy a married man to take her off the island. No sacrifice is too great for her; No one can be inaccessible if he is willing to help her escape the island and her misery. I won't bother to tell you how it all ends. The no-script movie ends are as plausible as the rest of STROMBOLI. I even remember (seeing it on the late night TV) that it had two different ends! So be warned if you have to feel brave enough to sit through this king's turkey and catch the mishap Bergman. This resulted in Hollywood for the next seven years and she was sentenced to sleep with her director while still married to Peter Lindstrom. None of the movies she made with this director (who she later married) is remarkable, except as proof of a career past. I don't kid you. It's pretty embarrassing. <br /> <br /> - - SoundTrack
