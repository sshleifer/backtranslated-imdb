If you thought Tomorrow was unconditional, wait until you see it. <br /> <br /> Good, so the representation of most disaster films is usually a 1 billion occurrence occurring by other circumstances. In this case, the same is the joining of two major storm systems. Good enough so far. Oh, but stop, no, the "event" is the sabotage and the subsequent destruction of the power grid. <br /> <br /> Next, many human interests - in this case a deceitful man, a psychotic gun-wearable boyfriend, a rebellious daughter, a hacker with a point to prove, threw a senator trying to push an agenda, a reporter trying to stand up against the man and jamming a pregnant woman in an elevator. /> Finally add a handful of probe opportunities to add excitement. <br /> <br /> If the director tried to fit in any meaningless plot lines, there would be no less time for the real disaster to be the diligent state of the graphics, almost certainly the intention. <br /> <br /> Jeez, if you can't even model a truck convincingly, you really don't need to be twisted, explosive power stations, Las Vegas to tear apart, or to destroy oil stations. <br /> <br /> If you haven't already gotten rid of this scary movie, let me just add that all three bad guys are killed in separate, and completely unfair, unmistakable ways that make more good moralizing the movie. <br /> <br /> I have no problem with first-month film students who are "clich√©-screaming scripts, but for the sake of God it doesn't mean that anyone should make it into movies! <br /> <br /> The management of making the abysmal indescribable 10.0-apocalypse doesn't look so terrible. Avoid them both.
