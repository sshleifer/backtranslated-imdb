A college professor is working on creating zombies and if you do not know that, things are going really bad. The next thing you know, the whole campus has been exceeded. Thank you, there are a few uber commandos trained for such a situation. They must be accompanied by a group of moron commands, led by a rapper (he doesn't even bother to play a military man, he only responds to his superiors as if he is a "white" homies) . The highlight of this part of the movie is the dressing room scene. The male and female moron commands have the same dressing room, and according to military regulations, all women must wear black bras and panties. Hey, if you can't make a good movie, you can have at least women in their underwear. My hat is for the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> So, after much discussion of how well prepared these moron commands are for work (Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq), they are all killed in fairly short order. . Their biggest downfall seems to be that it never happens to them to turn on any lights. A typical encounter they walked into a room and saw someone on the far side. Man or zombie? Can't tell. Flip on the lights? No, moron-commando protocol requires them to walk to the person, make sure they keep their gun so that it can be easily knocked out of their hand, well, you know the drill. The downfall of Sergeant Major Sticky Fingaz is especially fun - my favorite scene that includes a rapper in any movie I've ever seen. Fortunately (and again, guarding the filmmakers), the hottest babe succeeds in the moron commands to survive. Her and the female uber commando are both in tight T-shirts for the rest of the movie. Now that's how a military operation must be carried out! There is a lot of running around, my humorous things like the uber commandos that can't come through a simple fan grid (obviously a thin aluminum piece that you can easily put through your fist). It necessitates a plan to rub zombie guns on themselves and although we saw nothing in the movie to show that zombies are tracing their prey by smell, they are good enough to sniff the zombie gut and let our heroes go. . <br /> <br /> A few other funny pieces - the Paris Hilton gag, the "Can you hear me now?" gag, and the fact that the zombies are biting immediately secondary characters, main characters can fight through dozens of them without refurbishing. Another chuckle is provided by Mr. Fingaz, who can't pronounce the word "tourniquet". <br /> Overall, this is somewhat amusing. Could have used more interesting characters, but for an original Sci-Fi channel I was slightly impressed.
