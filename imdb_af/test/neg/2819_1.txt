This movie was absolute trash. The director and stars (?) Should be banned from making movies forever. The paper-thin plot relates to a messy director played by the sleazy director (now acting) to advertise on the Internet for women to die in a sneak movie. <br /> <br /> There is no horror, the girls look vast and bored, the direction is useless, the music is misplaced (heavy metal in a library scene?), and the lighting is terrible. The director had to buy in a few more shopping carts full of aluminum cans and got a script, sober actors and some light bulbs. As it is, it is a disgusting, nasty, worthless mess of a movie.
