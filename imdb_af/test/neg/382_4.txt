Start with Fulci playing a version of himself, and write down some ideas for how people can die. Navigated by a fake-looking cat who is supposed to be a brain. The copy I watched was in English, which I always hate, but I was extremely disappointed not to hear Fulci in his own voice. <br /> <br /> Fulci is in a kind of feverish state that works on his latest work. horror movie. His stomach turns when he sees things that look like the effect of his movie, and he begins to hallucinate that he sees horror acts. He visits a psychiatrist, who hypnotizes him and unfortunately he does not mind his improved mental health. I am reminded of the psychiatrist David Cronenberg played in Clive Barker's Nightbreed (1990). The shrinkage in this one is played by David L. Thompson, who is pretty bad. Probably a real life friend of Fulci's, he has a great toothy grin when he kills people, although it can be Fulci's black humor at work, which I thought was also poor. <br /> <br /> The movie is made up of a lot of clips from Fulci's movies, or Fulci on the set who directs them, watches TV shows or watches the acts. I've never been too much of a movie movie show in TV series, and I also think things like Charles Band's Full Moon Entertainment cut off their old movies and put together three such cuts as new anthologies. I think they should make money? <br /> <br /> The shrinkage in Cat in the Brain refers to the theory that violence in movies causes violence in real life. One of Fulci's co-workers talks about the fact that a documentary crew follows Fulci to see how his life is. Lots of self-referencing things like this. <br /> <br /> In the end, some characters sail away on a boat called "Perversion."
