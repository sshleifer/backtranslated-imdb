Now I have seen two movies by director Chen Kaige, a very good one (Farewell to my concubine) and this bad one, The Assassin. Both movies portray important events in Chinese history, FMC in the 20th century and TA the first unification of the entire Chinese nation in the 3rd century BC. FMC succeeds with memorable characters, stunning cinematography, compelling sets, good acting and an interesting story. The killer fails at almost every level (okay, the sets are great, the cinematography is good, and the few battle scenes are very exciting). But ... the pathos. Call me a synika, but too much is too much. If you feel that Saving Private Ryan was too pathetic, be aware it will make you sick. The dialogue is lifeless, many lines look like political statements, subtle or entertaining, this picture is not. The movie is dominated by its own pompousness. I'm really surprised that the killer gets such loud voices here on imdb. 10/04
