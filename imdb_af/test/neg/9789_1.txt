It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I think you can get it from the title. There is also a particular love scene that can be the strangest thing in the history of the movie. I can't even remember why I saw this movie or when. Only this is an absolutely horrible movie viewing experience. On the other hand, if you are looking for the absolute strangest movie to waste two hours of your time, then you should rent it at all times. Good luck finding this at your local store. I doubt this film is in a very wide spread. And please do not do this to children in any way, as this can distort their impressive thoughts forever.
