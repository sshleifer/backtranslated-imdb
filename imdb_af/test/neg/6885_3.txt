This episode has just broadcast in the UK. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. The melancholy touches of humor were poorly judged, childish and detracted from what could have been a pretty good story. I can't believe Jerry Bruckheimer allowed this episode to take place. I saw every previous episode of this show, and even the episode where Jack played his own parent was far from this episode. The lesbian kiss was pathetic sensationalism. <br /> <br /> There was also no continuity of the previous episode. There was nothing in the storyline that explored Martin's dangerous behavior or possible drug addiction. There was also nothing explicitly written about Jack's emerging relationship with Ann. Usually without a trace is quite good for this kind of continuity. <br /> <br /> The next episode should be a significant improvement.
