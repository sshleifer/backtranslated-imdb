Man, it's common. Rebecca DeMornay is a highly disciplined policeman who falls to Latin Lover Antonio Banderas in a wine shop, one of the ponytail and prison houses. If she cut loose, she really cut loose. Unlike this terrible thing she has (and we have to admit the matter has his speed collision), she is a pretty cold fish. Her broken, sick father shows for the first time in years and she pushes him out. She is also striving to keep her bitter top neighbor (Dennis Miller) at bay. And there's prisoner Harry Dean Stanton trying to maneuver him to diagnose multiple personality disorder so he didn't nail his priests for the ceremonial murders he had committed. <br /> <br /> All these people, and perhaps more, immediately suspect when strange things happen to her. Someone sends her dead flowers. Someone does unspeakable things to her pet cat. (The next time I see a domestic pet, it appears in a packet or rinsed in the cupboard or boiled in a pot, I'll break.) So, who does it? Guess. No power on earth can force me to reveal the end, but maybe a hint will help: child abuse. <br /> <br /> The abuse excuse is an interesting business in itself, much more interesting than the movie. What does "child abuse" mean? Do we mean sexual abuse? Physical? Both? How about a kid over the back with a wooden cooking spoon, hard enough to break it? That's what happened to me and my brother when we were kids, just like similar things to other errant boys in the neighborhood. Sexual abuse? It never happened to any of us, as far as I know, though I'm not sure it will be rejected with any animation. In the Samoan town I studied for two years. There was one case that an adolescent boy played sexually with a much younger girl. The girl's family knocks hell out of him. The boy's own family sent him to live with another family branch in another village, an exile that lasted two years. By the time he returned, the incident was forgotten by everyone, including the child. (Incidentally, the little girl we see here is under five, so it's unlikely that she remembers Dad's night-time visits, since the long-term memory wasn't really established until that time.) DeMornay's experience led to her mental disorder being called becomes "the social construction of trauma." It's not there unless we sit there. Enough of the psychiatric reading. It will be fifteen cents. <br /> <br /> You want trauma? I'll give you trauma. The movie absolutely forces us to identify with Rebecca DeMornay's character from the start. Then, if she has her first try with Antonio Banderas, and Pio Donnagio's score is the erotic in our heads, the camera gives us a shot over her shoulder of the bare-dressed Antonio crawling over us with his hairy chest. Well, this is traumatic. It makes any male viewer feel like he's on the floor of the laundry room at the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo. Don't get me wrong. I don't like Antonio Banderas. It's just that I don't fall in love with him. There are not enough shots of Rebecca DeMornay's elfin body in the whole universe to compensate for that kind of anxiety. <br /> <br /> Here is an interesting way to survive this movie. Instead of just sitting there, trying to select and separate the scenes filmed in Toronto from those shot in Budapest. It's really a challenge and power, for everything we know, to maintain your common sense.
