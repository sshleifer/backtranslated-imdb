Little did I know that when I signed up for the "all pay channel" package at Direct TV, I would see such a movie. It came after another movie we watched ... and I was a teenager in 1981 so I don't know where I was at that time ... but I missed this movie. <br /> <br /> I also can't believe we left it. It's as funny as it was in the early 80's back in the time machine ... but I even think it would have been a painful movie. It was just ... well ... "too cute"! ET was "cute" in some way ... but not unnecessarily cute ... and stupid. <br /> <br /> When I see a movie like this ... I come to IMDb to see what others are saying. I was blown away by the fact that this thing was nominated! Wow ... the movie industry has come a long way since the 80's! Oh yeah, it showed old parents ... btw that's the other thing I'm surprised about ... the setup ... not a lot of non-names ... but a few real actors / actresses. Must have been in their drug days! Anyways ... strange, interesting, bizarre, and make one happy they grew up!
