Looking at this movie, with its deterministic cause and effect, wall-to-wall clich√©s and hacked sentiment, can anyone be so naive to think that it's actually how Barrie's life played? You look it in a posture of disagreement. Hollywood biopics is no longer based on individual life, they just write about previously successful biopic programs. If Hollywood made a movie about your life, it would be filled with such a perfect synchronization that you hardly recognize your own story. Any personal complexity would be wiped out by some explanatory, simplistic background. Your story will look like "Rocky" because it is the only lifebuoy. Hollywood knows how to produce more. We couldn't make the public think about what was left open as they left. This movie does not trust an audience to find out things without being led to them. I saw the captain's / mother's references before the movie made it easier for me. I could see the 25 child turning for days coming. <br /> <br /> It's a totally average movie. Not terrible, but not good. Therefore, it will be flooded with some Oscars next year. There is nothing better for the Academy than congratulating themselves on finally marking patterns that occurred in the previous thirty years. <br /> <br /> From the New Yorker article "Lost Boys" by ANTHONY LANE: <br /> <br /> Arthur Llewelyn Davies also loved his sons and it may be unfair to find Neverland to Relieve him from the scene for goals. By the time Johnny Depp meets Kate Winslet, she is already a widow. Arthur was very alive when Barrie first entered the consciousness and the home of the Llewellyn Davies family. <br /> <br /> "Finding Neverland" is a whip. From the moment Barrie meets George and Jack, and begins to think about the means by which they can be delivered immortally, the story is sad, but reality is even worse: 1907? Arthur Llewellyn Davies dies of jaw cancer. 1910? Sylvia died of lung cancer. The five boys were left, Barrie made their guardian. 1915? George is killed in the First World War, fighting with his regiment in Flanders. 1921? Michael, an undergraduate at Oxford, is drowned while swimming with a friend. The two bodies, when repaired, are clutched. <br /> <br /> On April 5, 1960, Peter Llewellyn Davies, then a valued publisher, threw himself under a London subway train. We should not be supposed to read a thought in torment, but we can note that if he lived another month, he would have reached the centenary of Barrie's birth, and therefore, one thinks, " a new wave of interest in Peter Pan "?" that terrible masterpiece, "in the words of Peter Llewellyn Davies.
