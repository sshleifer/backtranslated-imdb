Aussie Shakespeare set for 18-24. With blood, blood and more blood. And good dose nudity. It will not be for everyone at power levels, for violent for some too cheap for most. Made on low budget, they try to do the best, but it only works sporadically. And it just seems to be missing, but it's not compelling. Although there is some good action on the part of most that you do not come in, especially mecbeth's heads are. The best achievement came from Gary Sweet and the strangest Mick Molly. If you see it in Shakespeare, but if you keep your cheese mature, you'll love it. It's not a bad movie, but it's not that good either. Sam Peckenpah would have liked it, if it's filmed as a Western film. I expected a lot from this, as I loved romper stumps. but it was a vacant effort.
