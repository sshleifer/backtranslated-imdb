I've never seen so much talent and money used to produce something so bad in my life! As in other commentaries, one whose talent, such as Christopher Plummer, Faye Dunaway, Donald Sutherland, and many more is thrown together in a movie not recognizable as an Agatha Christie story. I think of how it can be the same, done the right way. <br /> <br /> The movie has even less intimacy than the Christopher Reeves Superman movies. The big movie makes the smooth production even less effective than in those movies, because there is not enough time to get to know someone. Dave Brubeck's progressive jazz soundtrack wondered if the wrong video was in the case of the rental shop. The music became more and more offensive when the plot progressed. It's hard to tell whether the soundtrack or the annoying technique of repeating information from earlier scenes was more offensive. From someone who has seen most Christie movies (that's what attracted me here, that was one of the few I haven't seen) miss this one. It's not an Agatha Christie movie. Golan-Globus is better suited for the production of movie over time, rather than the sniffing atmosphere of the English puzzle.
