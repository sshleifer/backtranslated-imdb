First, I wasn't sure who this movie was for - it seemed like a story for kids, but had things in it that children wouldn't understand and find boring. There wasn't much about it, Bruce Willis was not an actor at all. He looked at his half smile - unless you were a big fan of her, I wouldn't bother. And if that's the story you're interested in (guy who looks like it all, but is emotionally missing, teaches a child's lessons), I'd look at a boy. It has everything that this film lacks, humor, sadness and reality.
