VIVA LA BAM This "Jackass" spins the (naturally written) adventures of Bam Margera and his pals (Johnny Knoxville, Brandon Dicamillo, etc.). This show, while having a fair share of the brutal comedy and crazy stunts, focuses mainly on Bam's torture of his parents. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say, Bam, but ... you're not as cool as you think you are. This ego-extinct performance is not only painfully unfunny (and yes, I loved Jackass), but also narcissistic beyond belief. The excessively stylized intro ends with Bam and declares cool that he will do whatever he wants. How are you doing something that is really funny? I like Jackass for what it was worth. The camera work was terrible - any idiot could have made a better performance with a camcorder in their parents' garage. But the performance has at least moved on a steady pace and has never gone boring between the crazy, dangerous or just disgusting stunts that the pals performed. . <br /> <br /> Not so with "Viva la Bam". We follow our hero around while playing on his friends pranks and torturing his family, but it never feels like anything but real lame and written comedy. The stunts and pranks are generously entertaining, but they are so boring and boring that they can hardly smile. <br /> <br /> "Viva la Bam" is a bad spin-off that doesn't do well, but feeds Margera's over-sized ego. I do not recommend this lame and relentless display to anyone.
