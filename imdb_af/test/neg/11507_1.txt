OMG, which did Disney lately, most of their new programs really suck. The suite lives up to Zach and Cody, but other shows like Cory in the home, Wizards or Waverly Place suck and are indifferent. <br /> <br /> Of course, Sadie is just stupid and stupid. It's about a teenager named Sadie who loves science and grows up and goes through her everyday life. There are her friends Margaret and Rain and her older annoying brother Hal. Everything is annoying and stupid. Especially Margaret who thinks she is the most popular girl in the school and thinks she is so beautiful ... it's just too terrible. I hate all the seasons of this show, it's just terrible in every way (the first season was better though). <br /> <br /> If you appreciate your life, you won't see this shit, its painful and stupid
