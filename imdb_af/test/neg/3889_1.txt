Days of Heaven is one of the most painfully boring and useless movies I've ever seen. In no way, form or form will I recommend it to anyone ... unless you try to make your children sleep or, God forbid, give someone an aneurysm. If I could go back in time and do one thing, I would set the rules on fire before sending them to the theaters. Why? Days of Heaven's plot are simple but extremely vague. Long rows without dialogue make much of the movie together. The characters are too shallow and ridiculous to have relationships with. The climax of the story does not touch you: by this time your brain has worked so hard to figure out the plot and array of hidden metaphors that are your ability to think. The only thing that works is your eyes, and unfortunately, your ears, who must listen to the sound of Linda, the girl in the story, who speaks like a man. I'm now stupid to see this movie. Don't let that happen to you.
