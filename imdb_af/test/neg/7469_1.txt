I saw this movie at the New Festival in New York. It was by far the worst movie there. It's the use of uncircumcised full frontal nudity and a desirable manuscript and direction that doesn't link a 'Maurice' repetition, or decides it's a Neil LaBute movie, made me feel. Why would anyone throw such a good throw? . It lacks irony and fills the vacuum with sentiment, causing the times when the movie turns on itself to wipe your face as your mind and heart are looking for what's in the movie, but not. I wish the director and editor reviewed the film again, because perhaps there is more story that can be released from an otherwise unpleasant experience.
