Director and playwright Richard Day adapted his own stage stage material, clearly inspired by Rock Hudson's real 1950s dilemma: what to do with a screen idol that is secretly homosexual? Grab him to an unsuspecting woman to stop the gossip (and keep him working). Wispy-thin idea given energy by the good cast and retro production design that almost looks like a greeting card by Shag. The dialogue is not very clever, and there are some slapsticks around the start that don't work (food spit, etc.). Yet, when a serious tone comes to the final act, it is treated with good taste - and is much more welcomed by the viewer than all the klutzy silliness. Matt Letscher does good work as movie heroes / guy Guy Stone, but is his experience here enough to strengthen his character, or will he be back at the bar the next night? The movie doesn't seem to know - or care. Day wants to get a few one-liners and one well-written pro-gay speech - a plea for tolerance - but he has no other agenda. For audiences who invest their time and interest in these people, the sentimental bow on this thing may look like a prank. * 1/2 of ****
