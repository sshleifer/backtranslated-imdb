This movie could have been great, but it wasn't. Under the cesspool of talented no-hopers and friends of the filmmakers who wanted to help, there are a few soft clips of talent. The star of the film plays a good role. He is convincing and has those scary Italian eyes. However, he is teamed up with the worst rejections of actors someone has ever experienced. The opening styles of the film are among the worst and most embarrassing. It looks like Gay Porn. Luckily no one stripped. The still-mentioned rape scene is rubbish. The prison order was the best part of the movie, although it was irrelevant. The movie soundtrack (if you can call it) sounds like a teenage boy's first attempt to use coolit and some sample CDs. It is boring, repetitive and extremely lame. In fact, the whole movie is lame. Get out while you can!
