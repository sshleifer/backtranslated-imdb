In addition to the history of the theater, there are a few films that have deceived the viewer, such as hitchcock's stage scare, alejandro amen√°bar's "abre los ojos", David Fincher's "the game" and this one "ausentes" (absent ). To start with, I don't like these kind of movies, I feel like someone is trying to pull my leg. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I don't know what happened, such a confusing movie. Kubrick's "Shining" can be a better or a worse movie, but certainly more honest than this is pretentious and dubious situations. <br /> <br /> Technical, fine photography, fair performance, and so on. The script is so poor, I wonder what the producers see to continue and shoot this shit. <br /> <br /> And these movie remarks are the 3 guys who wrote the script (calparsoro, loriga and quiroga) lost in bios trying to make a masterpiece - or trying to do something to fulfill their stomachs and Waiting for more personal projects.
