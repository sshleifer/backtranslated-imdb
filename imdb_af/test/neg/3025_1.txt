Good sir. <br /> <br /> I'm just going to say off the bat, I just watched 20 minutes from this movie. If I'm a hard Eraserhead fan, the "what, you can't watch an evil black and white movie with little to no dialogue?" defense does not apply. I simply can't watch scary black and white movies with little to no dialogue. <br /> <br /> This movie is what happens when you give an angsty goth child with no talent and nothing to say a camera. and budget, and puts him / her so many senseless offensive images on the screen. It was clear from the beginning that this film had to be 5 minutes long (assuming it didn't exist at all). Shots lasting a few seconds drag up for minutes, as the director has "I-Just-Love-The-Sound-Of-My-Own-Voice" syndrome and refuses to cut to another shot until the entire footage is viewed. From the moment the girl in the mask started masturbating the "God" body (the opening phase of the movie! Joy!), I knew it was just a matter of time until I turned off the band. After at least 10 minutes of another body pulled, I knew it was time to give up, drawn with a rope, drawn by a gang of clerics. I rarely give up on a movie. Throughout the whole of Blair Witch 2: Book Of Shadows, though not happy. It didn't deserve the 20 minutes I gave. <br /> <br /> If you are an Eraserhead fan, do not allow simple relationships with the mentioned movie to rent this amateur waste. Let me refer you to Tetsuo: The Iron Man, for a viewable and enjoyable part of incoherent black and white strangeness.
