I am very interested in the overwhelmingly positive reviews here. While having some good features, for the most part I found this movie to be heavily handed, predictable, and worst of all, not least scary. The first 30 minutes of the film was promising, the actress did a nice job in her portrayal and the world around her was well thought out and meaningful. Unfortunately, from there, the movie has gone down a spiral. I went into this movie without knowing what it was all about - nothing about the actors, directors, genre, etc. At some point my wife made the remark: "is it supposed to be a scary movie?". Well, I think so, as the kettle plate horror movie score full of whistling violets and extensive vibrato can mean nothing else. There was not a lot of originality in the film, the romantic interest was painfully obvious and the second half of the film descended deep into the realm of the ridiculous. A movie like this runs a dangerous narrow road, and unfortunately there comes a point where the viewer has to decide whether to continue on the road or to jump off and just laugh at its ridicule. For the last 30 minutes I have chosen the latter.
