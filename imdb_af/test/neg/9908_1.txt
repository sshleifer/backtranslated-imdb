What I hate most about in this garbage is the arrogant attitude of the filmmakers and network exporters who radiate this nonsense on the public because they really think the audience is so stupid, so indifferent, as tasteless as to earn these kinds of disadvantages. There is an inherent amusement to watch disaster films and with the magic of today's CGI effects, artists are given powerful tools to explore what they have previously denied. With that allure we sat down to see some chaos and destruction. Well, guess what, the only chaos we saw, was in the ads that released next Wednesday's episode. What a lie! But wait, there was even a bigger one. The writing itself was the greater disaster! And then there was the direction and the flaming action of everyone involved in this turkey. But we've known it before? We knew that the effects alone did not make an entertainment, but yet the network uproar that opened this TV movie didn't care about it, because in their mantra the everlasting line "never underestimated how stupid the audience was not ". These guys really have to live by this motto, and I'm so brave. No wonder the audience dropped American drama into herds and pitched their camp in reality programs. At least in those programs, nobody tries to look like anything other than what it is: intellectual pornography. Well, Category 6 is worse than that because it is different and "original". Yes it was a disaster movie, but the disasters aren't what they advertised!
