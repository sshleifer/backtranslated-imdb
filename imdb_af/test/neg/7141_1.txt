Okay, first the good thing: If you've seen the trailer, you know about 100% of the "scary" moment of the movie. And yes, this is a good thing, because you just have to stay at the trailer and not see the movie. <br /> <br /> I now understand why Sarah Michelle Gellar hasn't been in the movie for a long time, not wanting to associate her name with this production. I wish her the best for "The Return". <br /> <br /> You have to follow 3 different stories in this movie, and they are all disconnected (in time and meaning) to the end. And even then it's a very bad climax. And God even forbids the door open to another successor. <br /> <br /> Yes, in this movie, "The Rage and Fury" is underway. No need to visit the house any more, just be close to someone who is inside and you're done. It's no longer a curse, it's like a virus. Go inside the house, get scared, come back to the US and spread the joy in your apartment building. <br /> <br /> It's not that hard to follow, but you don't really care. The plot line is slim for no one and you have a lot of scene in this movie where you just laugh and shake your head ... Milk someone ?? Last year I saw the Ju-On 2 at the Fantasia movie festival, different story quite, but much better than that dud. This is not a remake, but this time they might just have done a remake. <br /> <br /> If you need to see it, wait for the DVD.
