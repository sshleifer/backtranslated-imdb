Once, it is good to see a very bad movie like this, just so you know how fair an actor Keanu Reeves is. The premise of this story is good: teenagers go out on a boat, meteor land in water, strangers kill teenagers. What is there not to love, if you are in shouting thrillers? But I had to know something was when I read it, it was only 75 minutes long. I thought, "I hate movie about how long it is. Who says a movie should be 90 minutes?" But as soon as I took the BBuster's DVD off, I was shocked at the terrible production quality, which is directing this completely amateurish piece of garbage. The only reason I watched it to the end was because I didn't have cable television, and I already paid four dollars for it. However, there was a ray of light: the actor Chris played was actually decent, and far from this drink. First, the special effects were cheap and unconvincing. Then the strangers - the costumes were interesting (rubber suits), but since most of the movies are in the dark, you don't really see them! And almost any of the actors was convincing enough to suspend unbelief. Finally, I have to say that the DVD jacket with much higher production standards than the movie itself was made. It felt like a rip-off, so beware when you rent other DVDs. Save $ 4 and buy a pint of beer.
