Wow, what a cute movie it is! It looks like it's a backwoods treasure, with the camera running dogs through the bush. It then becomes a bit boring and follows the story of some girls moving to a house pursued by Indian spirits. We then get lots of shots from one partially dressed girl and another naked girl in the bath. It suddenly becomes really cheesy when the "Zombie Indians" originate from the earth and begin to terrorize the girls. We even get a Samurai Indian. <br /> <br /> This movie is pretty boring, though I found the story of the four Indians buried alive very interesting. Once the Indian zombies (or whatever you want to call, because they are not technically zombies) the girls start to terrorize when all the fun begins. It's not a special movie and can't be taken seriously. It's just fun to watch when you're bored or when you drink with friends. I can't help thinking even if it worked better than a short story, because the first half is boring boring.
