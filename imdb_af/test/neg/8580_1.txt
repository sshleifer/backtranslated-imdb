Proper but poor James Bond movie, mainly because both the hero (Bond) and the villain (Blofeld) were seriously mistaken. Lazenby is too big and innocent to play Bond. He looks and trades more like the good-natured but dull jealousy in a police action film. The director and writer is trying to establish his credibility, but his statement of lines like "Royal Baluga, North of the ..." is just not effective in establishing him as this worldly and supreme villain. Savalas doesn't do a bad job, but his characterization and behavior is more suited to a gangster. The best depicted characters of the movie are Tracy and her father. But the performances by those actors when the screen is shared with Lazenby only serve to emphasize its shortcomings as an actor. This movie is too long (140 min.) For a Bond movie and offers no thrill to Bond's mountain escape, where it starts picking up. This movie is trying very hard, but falls short. Many Bondian elements are present and the climate fight is on top, but I always get a feel for something that misses when you look at this one.
