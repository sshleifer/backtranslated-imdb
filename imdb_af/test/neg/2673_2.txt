This movie is very bad. In fact, the only reason I gave it a 2 rather than a 1 is because it made me laugh. Without giving away anything, a man's head explodes into this movie. It was so pathetic, I laughed. I don't believe the scene was meant to be funny, but it's nonsense. Complete nonsense. The original Halloween is such a good movie, it's a pity they have to go and make such a stinker.
