College students (who are actually in the late 20's) on campus in Boston (who look strange like the Isle of Man) are threatened by a fiery monster (compiled during a Blue Peter episode). The new teacher has to save the day (though he really is ... Oh, who cares?) <br /> <br /> I start with the positive ... there's a good shot of Eastenders New Gal Samantha Janus She looks into the compulsory campus with her best friend Katy Lawrence. A little bit trivia: Katy was hired when she arrived at her auditions with her sister, just like moral support for her brother and sister, but eventually landed a lot. Oh, joy. Selected to be unclear ... flashing her buttocks into a meaningless scene added for titulation, and then killing 30 minutes for her problems. Her latest (and only other credited role) is Nursing Nurse # 5 in Reconciliation. I wonder if she's sneaking a look at Keira Knightly (if extras and stars are allowed to mix) and wondering: where did it go wrong? <br /> <br /> I'll give you some tips. Katy: If everything The other British role-players are asked to speak with American accent in a doomed mass marketing effort. The only person who can manage it is the B-movie veteran in the USA, Todd Jensen. You know you're in trouble. If you look at your payslip and it's just about your lunch and your bus ride home, you're not playing a movie with a trillion dollar budget. If the premiere is attended by many relatives of the fourth assistant director and causes lines of laughter when the Stickyback band sample falls through the sewers, it should come to you that it is not exactly Alien. Or even a Critters IV, come to think. So, Katy, in your next life (I'm a Buddhist, you see), maybe you'll be a little more selective in your choice of debut rather than impulsively jumping against the first heap of shit sticking your head out. Flashing skin in your first movie does not guarantee long-lasting success. Unless you are Sylvester Stallone. And he had the writing Rocky to support him. <br /> <br /> For all purposes, it's like a movie I've ever seen. But for mere unintentional laughter and pure camp value, it becomes a 1. Well done;)
