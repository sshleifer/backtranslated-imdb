By going through the good words of my friends, I rented this movie, hoping that it would at least equal the happiness of the similar movie, Home Party, but I was very disappointed and very bored. <br /> <br /> Sleeping while watching a movie is never a good sign. I don't know if it didn't address me, because I don't live in "da hood" or if I'm not black, but it's probably one of the two. <br /> <br /> It is trying to spoof some movies, but only with a few laughs, but in the long run it fails miserably. Miss it.
