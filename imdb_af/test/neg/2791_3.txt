The movie starts when we see a picture of a big drought in the 30s in America. Then a short story is shown about a creepy farmer Elijah who made a deal with Satan to get good harvest. Elijah hired young men to work in his garden, killed them and used them as a scarecrow. He also fed the soil with their blood. A little after two policemen came to visit him. One of them is shot by Elijah, another one kills the farmer himself. Then the day is shown, and a guy named Sean is told he has an old farm as heritage. He decides to go with some friends there to see how it goes. Little did Sean know that next night was the "Payback Night". <br /> <br /> As far as I am concerned, this movie had a good story for a horrorflick, but low budget and poor special effects just ruined It. "Dark Harvest" is a perfect example of lazy filmmaking. For example, we see a scarecrow (an ordinary man wearing a funny, inexpensive mask) chasing a girl. When he lifts his hand, we get a normal human skin under his glove, instead of a rotting flesh. The gore is also not so impressive. There are some nasty murders by our "lovely" scarecrowers, but everything is very cheap and unrealistic. Surprisingly, the play is a bit good in this movie, or I better say its credible. Some naaktonele are also offered to the fans (even a lesbian scene), but those scenes do not save it. <br /> <br /> Pronunciation: Good music, good story, solid acting. But horrible effects, cheap gore and plot holes slow down this movie. Not really recommended.
