I have here this movie was good from different people. I also like Natalie Portman and Javier Bardem, as well as the director Milos Forman. But after watching this movie, I really had nothing to admire. <br /> <br /> First, the play was much lower than average. The performances were just not powerful enough to really feel shocked by what the inquisition did. Javier Bardem delivered a solid performance and was probably the only one to actually have Spanish accent. It is pretty clear why this Bardem was the only one. Natalie Portman, who, in my opinion, is a very good and active actress, has not really made me feel sorry for her. Like the movie, there was nothing to admire about her performance. Stellan Skarsgaard, what I do, has produced a very average performance, like the other actors who give a boring performance. This movie was mainly about him since he played Goya. Yet he did not become what he needed to make this movie good. What about Randy Quaid? You just joke me. He plays King Carlos IV. Look, he's great in comedies, but he plays a king who just describes the whole movie for you. <br /> <br /> Directing was just awful in this movie. When a movie is a mess, there are usually two people guilty of it: the director and the author. I get the feeling that Milos Forman really didn't want his actors to make a Spanish accent. Of the very few fighting scenes in here, they are all terribly displayed. Also, as a director, he should give you the feeling of shock of what the inquisition did. After this movie, I felt like I was indifferent about the event. To sum it all up, he shot the screens poorly and deceived the actors. <br /> <br /> The writing that was also done by Milos Forman was as bad or perhaps worse than directing. There was really nothing unforgettable about the movie, except for one seen where Bardem gets the same treatment that Portman's character received. Otherwise, the movie did not give you the feeling of the period and could be composed at least with a quote or two. <br /> <br /> After completing this movie, I just watched the TV think OK, why should I care about any of these? I care and am very interested in history, but when movies like this come up, it feels that the producers have robbed you of something good taken from the movie. If movies are so bad, we'll see the technical flaws in a movie as if it were good. Like the accents. I'm not sure people would emphasize the lack of Spanish accent if this movie was good. <br /> <br /> The whole point of this review is to say, don't see it.
