A ruthless killer was hired to eliminate someone from the top of the US government. Continuing to change his identity and location, he is only known as the Jackal. Everything about this hit is a secret. Aware of the Jackal's presence, but uncertain about his purpose, the FBI's deputy director has the biggest challenge of his career. To find this cold-blooded killer, he and a Russian information officer help a captive Irish terrorist. These unlikely allies enter a global clock race to stop the mysterious mercenary before he can complete his mission. If you're looking for a non-stop action movie like Die Hard, then the Jackal is not your movie. It is a slow spy thriller with very cool gadgets and weapons. Richard Gere does a good job of playing a passionate terrorist who helps the FBI to deeper than just freedom. And Willis makes a good effort as the Jackal. OK movie but nothing more.
