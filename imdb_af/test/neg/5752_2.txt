For many months I've been looking forward to this issue. The previews look good, early reports on the net were encouraging, and golden eye and Timesplitters were excellent shooters (by the same people). It seems that I was very deceived! Haze had the potential to be there with Call of Duty 4 and other next gen shooters, but it looks, plays and feels like 5 years or so ago. I played Haze on a 1080 television and was initially disappointed that the developers of the games restricted the graphics to 720. The Haze universe has no detail and atmosphere, but the feeling of "rushing to finish it" is always there. <Br /> <br /> The controls are slow and cumbersome, and I do not need an x ​​/ y axis sensitivity adjustment yet. There are many parts of the single player game that are very dark (visual) to the point where you can't see where you are going. Why not add a torch feature like in Halo? or even better, night vision? Using the performance-enhancing drug "nectar" is interesting, but just as you get used to, you change sides and don't use it again! why try? I can do a lot more Haze mistakes, but instead I'll just say Don't BOTHER! wait for killzone 2 or play assignment 4 and try to unlock the golden AK!
