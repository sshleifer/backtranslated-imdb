There were some big television movies in that past. Epics like "Roots" and "Lonesome Dove" come to mind. Category 6: Day of Destruction will not be remembered for promoting the cause of TV films. A nice bad story, just by the horrific script, Cat6DD, surpassed, because I want to call it, inspire more sympathy for the actors involved as a terrorist in nature that the movie was supposed to bring. The sound you hear during the movie is supposed to be the sound of the wind, but instead it is actually the careers of Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy and Thomas Gibson (Greg, of the Dharma & Greg duo) who are faster than homes and trucks and cows plummet can fly away from one of the 15 tornadoes we see in the first 5 minutes of the movie. The film is advertised as a nature that has been crazy. Instead, we get a lame story about how 15 different weather systems joined forces to produce 150 degrees in Chicago, and then a blizzard the next day from a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico. With a storm system from Canada, but actually it came into being in a radius that has been changed by global warmingâ€¦. It didn't matter what the story was, the acting was horrible, the words the actors said were stupid and 13 scientists across the country had crowns after hearing the dribble that came out of the movie. I didn't care what happened to any of the characters, the special effects were substandard, even for TV standards, and the story lines were useless. All in all, I really like this "TV event."
