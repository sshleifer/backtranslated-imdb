Although many Billie Dove fans are happy with her work, I have to succeed. As a socially prominent member of British clever, her British accents are basically non-existent and her line readings sound like, well, line readings and her emotions seem trance-like and ponderous. Basil Rathbone, usually a fine actor, seems completely off-guard and also speaks with a strange kind of accent - in his case, something like Italian, although we can't be sure. The script succeeds in keeping its exact ethnicity a secret. He is further hampered by the screenplay that gives him one of those old movie scenes, something that has to do with nerves, which requires surgery. The only true entertainment is provided by the illustrious Kay Francis who plays a lacquered bob with silk rolls in her role as a depraved digger who consumes outrageously men, including Rathbone, and then spits them out. She pulled it off with her unique aplomb. She is the only living thing in this dead sea of ​​a movie.
