I really don't understand who this movie is aimed at. From just the absurdity of it, not to mention the ridiculously bad acting, cheesy dialogue, and the fact that the villain is a child, I would assume it was meant to be a children's movie ... but I think there can be more swear words than pulp fiction, not to mention constant references to drugs and general chaos and killing, so what demographic does it try to please? This movie is too schizophrenic, such as combining Country Music with Heavy Metal. In the end, nobody will like it, because it's a bloody paradox. I would recommend this movie because it is so funny (in a bad way), except that the actors are so unbearably unbearable that I would not suggest otherwise. <br /> <br /> I'm quite serious when I say I couldn't watch more than 15 minutes of it. Terrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiible
