I also don't read the book on which the movie is based, nor the letters between Vita and Violet. If I come to this movie with any expectations whatsoever, it might be that the Bloomsbury group (including Virginia Woolf, among whom the Nicholas were part of the image) would be portrayed. It wasn't, however, that wasn't a problem for me. What I am wondering about is how the people behind this movie managed to make it, so to speak, so uninteresting and repetitive and flattering most characters, despite great material and some very good actors. The writing is simply not good enough. I agree with the criticism of my Finnish neighbor - too many senseless sexes (but only among the women, while there is nothing explicit about Harold's many love affairs), too many senseless scenes in general, too little information on the background of characters. It seems weird to consider the quality of the production - on the surface it looks like a very ambitious piece of work, but the writing obviously holds the most weight and that is where this movie fails. <br /> <br /> Vita's relationship with Harold struck me as unconvincing, although they both act very well, especially her. The way they explained their unconditional love to one another in a rather juicy way, I thought, well, simply not convincing. It is much more meaningful that letters have happened, as tmmvds point out that I also wanted to know where the nicknames came from - the Russian and Mar - why is someone called Vita the nickname Mar? It may be small things, but it is important to contribute to the bigger picture. <br /> <br /> * I watched the movie with English subtitles, and where it said Mitya apparently said it instead Medea. This can explain my frustration with nicknames to some extent - I couldn't understand why Vita's Greek should be, while Violet's was Russian!
