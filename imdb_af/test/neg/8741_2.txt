I have this movie on t.v. a few weeks ago, but got up to the first 10 minutes or so. Initially, the person on the witness protection scheme located in a secluded farm becomes nervous about his outback guards and asks the guard inside the house whether he can make a phone call - just to discover that the line has been cut. Shortly afterwards Roy Scheider acted as one of the witness's assassins and properly executed the witness and his wife. After which the Roy Scheider character picked up the wall phone in the kitchen, dial a number, and then talk: it's done !!!! That was it for me!
