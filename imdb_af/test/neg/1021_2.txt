Southern Cross, written and directed by James Becket, is a waste of good celluloid and actor's efforts. A formula movie is not necessarily bad if it is paid on its promise, which this movie does. It is a tiring fusion of movie licenses that can be traced to the thousand different films of the past. It's full of random and empty plot twists that add nothing but aimless action, like a voyage through the lead actors to a ghost town where the villains (inexplicably) follow them. It was clearly an excuse for a shooting and escaping scene bordering on the predecessor, with people jumping in and out of doors and running along windows while shooting pistols at each other. It is believed that someone told Becket there was a ghost town in the Chilean foothills and he said, "Oh big, we can do a shooting scene there." <br /> <br /> Don't even waste your rent. on this. It is a bunch of random pieces and pieces from hundreds of different movies being put together to call an action drama.
