It's a story as old as man. The jealousy of another man's wife and possessions. There are even commandments about it. <br /> <br /> In this story, Raymond Burr ("Perry Mason", "Ironside") is the driver of a runner plant that desires the owners' wife and feels he is not treated with respect. The woman, starring Barbara Payton, who is trying to return to a series of turbulent affairs, was leaving Burr, who killed her husband, Paul Cavanagh, a little. <br /> <br /> But it was a stranger woman, the housekeeper (Gisela Werbisek) who sees everything, and who was able to make some voodoo's to avenge the injustices, which is another young wife (Carol Varga) included, to whom Burr also loves love. <br /> <br /> Burr is poisoned and becomes or becomes a gorilla. Payton will be with Kong if she ever wants to marry her as he enters the jungle every night. <br /> <br /> The end is predictable. But the moving question of this movie is why Payton will ever be scared. With the sharp pointed missiles protruding from her chest, no animal could come near her to do any harm.
