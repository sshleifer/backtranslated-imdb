I accidentally happened on this movie when I was looking for something to eat while eating lunch. I actually went to the WE network because it said the last 20 minutes of a movie about the importance of sticking it to some gymnastics teams. Well, I'm crazy. <br /> <br /> First, I missed a good 20-40 minutes at the start of the movie. Fortunately, most of them were recovered fairly quickly, especially in the bedroom scene where Crystal admits she was responsible for the death of her rapist. <br /> <br /> I love Jenny Garth and will see just about anything. She is just as beautiful, and I want my lipstick to look as perfect as she always does. She looks good throughout the movie, and is not really older than what has been over a decade. <br /> <br /> Overall, I felt bad for the actors when I watched this movie. Everyone tried to sell their parts, but everyone was so badly written that it was a constant battle. Frankly, I was surprised to see Terry Farrell and Mitch Ryan (Greg's father of Dharma & Greg) in it. <br /> <br /> But the writing wasn't the worst part of this movie. About half an hour before the end, her mother dies, and when they point the headstone, the death date is 1979. After the beginning, I got the impression of the wardrobe that took place in the 80's. Not a leisure dress or bell bottom in sight. Shame on the person who made the wardrobe for this movie! Don't get me wrong - all the outfits in this movie were beautiful, but they were totally wrong for the time. It almost makes me wonder if they told the wardrobe that it was a time. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - good for a laugh or feeding a Jennie Garth solution. :)
