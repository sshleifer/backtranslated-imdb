Incredible successor (.. the absurd idea of ​​having the killer snowman on the rampage at an island resort where there is no snow or cold weather) brings the spirit of the psychopath back, thanks to a scientific experiment that is strange provide elements that re-enter life into its molecules (this is the best I could do to explain this preconceived concept). <br /> <br /> I could go deep into how he is thrilling on the island to kill many tourists, but I just can't bother to worry because it will all be so tiring. Anyway, the filmmakers think it's wise not to kill the pretty girls ten minutes after their arrival. I mean seriously, why worry about even introducing them to us if we can't enjoy our cake? <br /> <br /> The murder scene of the snowmobile takes the cake. Ice icicles stick out of the beach's sand so a victim can fall on them. Oh, and another girl is stabbed with a few weeds. Look, I get what comes to me when I sit down to watch a killer snowman movie. So, a ridiculous supernatural shooter will tickle Funnybone ("Oh, it's such a wonderful cheese-like horror movie!") Or do you think why hell wastes you time with such nonsense. Jack Frost has the power to freeze water (.. how can they melt him in the first film) and cause the island to resort to snow. One sequence has Jack-free swimming pool water, which encloses a swimming model under the sheet, causing her drowning to escape anywhere. Oh, there is also a relaxation of the "tongue stuck to the icy pole" bit of The Christmas Story ("Cowatonga dude!"). <br /> <br /> I have to roll it, though. they are real troops trying to entertain this miserable material. Christopher Allport (maybe indifferent) returns as Sam, to face his old nemesis, like Eileen Seeley as his wife. The efforts of humor in the cheek (at least for me) fell flat, but the armed soldiers then tried to make the most of a very difficult situation, with enthusiastic performances doing their best to rise above the vigorous premise . and a furious dialogue. <br /> <br /> A development is taking place that increases the danger for those who are still dealing with Jack, his genetically modified water molecules, thanks to the imported foreign elements, allow him to cool / freeze. and worse, he can reproduce now. Through digestion, jack up what looks like snowballs that hatch to reveal small snowballs with black eyes, mouth and sharp teeth! The killer snowman costume and little snowballs later implemented in the movie can produce abdominal lambs when you're in the mood for such shenanigans, but I personally found this litter. Hokey (that's the purpose, I think, cheap guffaws from those willing to embrace it) and unbearable. The snowball descendants are a clear tribute to Gremlins where we find a bar scene where the small bastards in number over terrorist victims at the resort celebrate. The weapon against them .. bananas! It was explained that when Jack Sam was killed in the first film, both were in a truck bed full of freezing. (An ice cream cup coming from Jack's stomach penetrated Sam's chest as he pushed them out of the truck's window from a window, and I suspect they were "connected by the crane", Jack Sam's banana allergy inherited, or so is what we have led to believe!) and thus both "merged" into a sense. <br /> <br /> Phew, such a movie, because it refuses simple explanation. It's a movie with effects and plot so awful, the presentation can be enjoyable due to many mistakes.
