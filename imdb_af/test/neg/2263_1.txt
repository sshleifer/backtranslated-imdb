... But not this one! I always wanted to know what happened. We'll never know what happened, because GWTW was Margaret's baby. I am a lifelong fan of Gone With the Wind and I could no longer be rejected by the movie. I compared "Scarlett" to the original GWTW because any movie worth following GWTW was of the same quality as the first. Rhett was beautifully cast, though no one ever met Mr. Gable will not compare. I'm also a strict Vivien Leigh fan !! She was Scarlett. She adjusts the account. Not another actress of this age or another will ever fit the same shoes, but with "Scarlett" the work could be done better. There was not enough thought to find the right Scarlett. It was clear. <br /> <br /> Overall, something to look at, but if you want to know what happened to Scarlett and Rhett, I suggest you write it yourself or find fiction. This movie is not worth it.
