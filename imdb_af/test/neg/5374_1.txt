I initially agreed to the paranormal state because I (more or less) the paranormal search genre to be interesting TV, than nothing else. <br /> <br /> I enjoy Ghost Hunters because more than half of their investigations lead to more than half of their investigations. totally debunking, and finding most Haunted hilarious using mediums and frumpy British women with Paris Hilton day-glowing eyes, fading from fear / demonic incidents, all shot in a beautiful night vision green. <br /> <br /> Paranormal State has nothing of this appeal. It feels like it's been combined with "lead" that Ghost Hunters rejects. The episodes ranged from trailer families and single mothers with emo-adolescents who drove themselves around, and an "interview" with a 5-year-old about the monster living in his room (the monster goes to RAWRRR, we're told) . All these people call on a college club to solve their problems. The whole show is about Ryan and his partner, his enormous ego. He leads his company of do-eyed coeds around, unless a case is considered "too extreme" and commands them to stay at the hotel HAHAHA. Better leave it for the benefits, that is, itself. <br /> <br /> The unconscious comedy of this show is all in the light of how good the contestants are. Ryan turns his stories to hunt, follow, etc. by a demon he first met when the Catholic Church recruited him to help with a case. Sorry, but the Catholic Church has people who can do it. They do not have to use the day shift manager at Quiznos in its 2 cents. <br /> <br /> This show is terrible, shame for A&E for bankrolling This folly, which is trying to follow in the footsteps of some much better paranormal-themed shows. It is almost unintentionally funny, except that Ryan is so arrogant and without charisma that watches the performance long enough to mock it, is not worth it.
