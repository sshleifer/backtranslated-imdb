I can't remember the worst movie I watched. Total waste of actors and hearing time. If you prefer to sit with your TV and think when this movie is over, this is the right movie for you. Perhaps this film was recorded to make people believe that Moscow has some mystical past. But I have to say I didn't expect anything else from Rade Serbedzija, but I expected more from Vincent Gallo. The movie does not have a plot, character, development, denial. The film is about the underground tunnels and how it's mystical. fair there is a camera effect, but even that is too poor. Over and over are the same pictures. Total waste of time.
