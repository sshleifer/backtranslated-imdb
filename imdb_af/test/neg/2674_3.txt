[possible spoilers] <br /> <br /> The sixth "Halloween" movie is a very depressing thing, but unfortunately not the way filmmakers intend. Currently everyone knows the story of how it was slaughtered and released in such a messy, incoherent form. The second half, in particular, makes little or no sense, as plotting elements are set and dropped, seemingly random. The very end has left me scratching my head. What happened to hell? Is Dr Loomis dead or what? This is what you get when you put a skameless hack in control of a movie. It's not a pretty sight. <br /> <br /> On a related note, it is the most graphical violent entry in the series. I have no problem with Gore if it's in the right place, but this movie takes it on absurd levels. The notorious explosive head must be a new layer for the series. Michael himself even seems to be the act of killing another person, which is not in line with his effective, methodical approach in the John Carpenter original. <br /> <br /> I'm not quite sure who was responsible; director Joe Chappelle or the producers, probably a combination of both. I would be very happy to apologize to all concerned if they just want to release the legendary Producers Cut, a more complete version of the movie that is a great improvement on every account. From what I understand, it's quite like another movie. I offer to pay the full price to buy the DVD when Miramax comes and releases it. <br /> <br /> There are, however, a few good elements. The idea that Michael is controlled by the Druids is intriguing. Paul Rudd is solid like Tommy Doyle, whose appearance is a neat bond with the original. The smooth footage helps make the performance a little more viewable. But these scant offers are overshadowed by the overload of the drift we have to get. <br /> <br /> Finally, "The Curse of Michael Myers" is announced as Donald Pleasance's Last Movie. Many of his scenes are excluded from the final cut, and if he appears, he looks poor and unhappy. The movie is dedicated to its memory, a blatant (if unintentional insult) if ever there was one. The fact that a talented artist has to end his career like this is too depressed to even think. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (from ****) <br /> <br /> Released by Dimension Films
