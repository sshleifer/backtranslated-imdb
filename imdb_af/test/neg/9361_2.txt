A woman finds her trapped in a seemingly inexplicable result of suicide. Then again, is it really suicide? There seems to be a ghost on the loose. Guess what? The ghost has long black hair that hides its face, and it moves with its head or arms turned like this or so, making a very strange ghost. Recurring theme music plays from unexpected places to announce the advent of the ghost, and bizarre sound effects - which resemble the sound of small twigs broken - are always accompanied by this fearless spirit. Does any of these sound familiar? Well, if you've seen some Asian horror movies over the past 10 years, it should. The movie 'The Ring', 'One Last Call' and a few other recent horror hits are trying to add an uninteresting and worn plot to a climax, but we've seen it before. Avoid it unless you are desperate or have not seen any other Asian horror movies in the past 10 years.
