First, I'm in the US <br /> <br /> When I first saw it, I thought it was a clear - and horrible - rip off of The Office. So I would have awarded it zero stars, but watch it long before the Ricky Gervais series came out. <br /> <br /> However, it is difficult to see this or any other performance with similar dynamics (including the American "Office") without comparison. It's just not even close to the same thing. <br /> <br /> I give it some credit to be original and before its time. I will also say that - and the US "Office" and "Larry Sanders" - are real satires. The UK "office" is something big and more transcendent, as if it is populated with real people in events that felt they were actually happening. But unlike this or the shrill Christopher Guest "mockumentaries," it's not really a satire, while "The Newsroom" is definitely. <br /> <br /> Be that as it may be, "The Newsroom" is still not "I'm very funny. It is separate, and self-conscious, but with a throw and crew, not nearly clever or talented enough to handle the goods. It is weighty comedy that is worn on poor shoulders. Sincere, but ultimately not recommended. <br /> <br /> --- And what is the lack of an anamorphic DVD? I know it was shot in anamorphic widescreen because I saw the pilot episode on one of our HD channels. CBC, get to the program. ; )
