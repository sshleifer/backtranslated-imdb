Laughably awful. One might think that all the big name actors involved in this movie will at least make it credible, but they don't - this one is a stinker. <br /> <br /> Characters either jump around without having a good reason. to know where they are going, or they stand to make clogged faces run for their lives. <br /> <br /> Check your higher brain functions at the door if you plan to watch this movie. Or, get a bunch of your most clever friends and give this one the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" treatment. This is what I did in the second half of this turkey. <br /> <br /> And don't be confused with the excellent movie "The Day of the Jackal", a far superior thriller of 30 years ago.
