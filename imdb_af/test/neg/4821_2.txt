License fees to see this trash and pay it with hard earned cash? Humorless, no sign of laughter, God knows how it won a BAFTA! <br /> <br /> For twenty years now, we have been subject to East clients. When, oh when will the Great British public see this terrible soap for what it is? Crass Pap! This program no longer shows reality in the East End of London as everyday life in Beirut, and has never done so. <br /> <br /> The Eastern connoisseurs I know (the real people) are friendly, courageous, hardworking and loyal. And one of their greatest features is humor. It was the Eastenders who went through the worst of London's lightning and held two more fingers to Hitler. And what do we see on our screens five days a week (including an omnibus)? Nothing but a bunch of moaning, screaming, "dead from the neck to" lashes, seeming to be sitting down in a bar, sneaking at each other. What a great advertisement for Britain it is !! Do the authors actually think this garbage is pumping them out? Obviously, the woolly-minded section of the public is doing it, but then I heard that anyone with the brain could believe in something.
