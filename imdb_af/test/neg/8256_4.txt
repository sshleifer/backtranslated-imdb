I bought this movie because I thought the movie was decent and I like Jennifer Rubin & Patsy Kensit. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that the play is not of a high standard. Stephen Baldwin watches his character at times and at times morose. Patsy Kensit is so-so, but not too convincing in some scenes, and the alleged poetry she spits in a particular scene in her Hotel room is completely meaningless rubbish. Ms Kensit is definitely very suggestive and sexy here, but eventually I think Jennifer Rubin is by far the best in this movie. Ms Rubins Character is initially innocent, then sexy, because she plays Stephen Baldwin's Character (Travis) for a fool. The supporting film includes Adam Baldwin (no relation to his famous namesake) and M.Emmet Walsh who appeared in many films, I also noticed that Art Evans was one of John Mclane's allies in Die Hard 2. The movie is decent and there are a few naughty with Rubin & Kensit, a bit of action, but it's definitely not a fast moving or intelligent thriller. There is a specific scene when they are in the car to commit a crime and Stephen Balwin's character wears sunglasses and when you see him again, the environment is painted around his eyes, etc. black, then the sunglasses appear later when their departure The crime scene and the police are in the pursuit, a very clear mistake in editing. <br /> <br /> If you are fans of one of the ladies or Baldwin, you can find something here, but others need to be clear. It's a reasonable but unbeatable thriller and not really worth more than a few dollars if you want it.
