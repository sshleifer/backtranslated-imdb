If you're accustomed to Lana Turner in the Postman Always Rings Twice, and compare it to this low budget, low talent, low quality movie, well, I was just ashamed of Ida Lupino's "singing" (more like talking) and not keyboard plays scenes. When the first non-singing scene started and all the people just looked at her flat, I was positive that they all wanted to roll their eyes and start talking or talking to each other (she stinks, let's get out of here). The actors are flat - emotions are deflating. And Ida is really a spoiled bi-otch throughout - just a 100% turn-off. It was like Betty Boop on conscious sedation to a gas station servant in nowhere's USA. The story was flat, the music was flat, the scene was flat, her chest was ... not caring. I was sad for the rest of the actors. Perhaps if the real actress had to take the lead and the men actors had more emotions, then the movie could have had a chance. Sorry for insulting those who thought it was outside the world. I wouldn't have thought if it had stayed out of this world.
