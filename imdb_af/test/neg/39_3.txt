It's a hard movie to head for. While deserving its 3 (or maybe even two), for an Al Adamson movie, it's exceptional - and virtually Adamson's best. This is because, unlike many Adamson movies, there are times when NURSE SHERRI looks almost capable. But if you are an Adamson movie, you know the crappiness MUST leave its ugly head back! <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a bizarre cult leader of a large congregation (six) trying to raise a dead guy who looks like he was made of blue cheese. In the process, however, the cult dude has a heart attack and taken it to hospital. He died, but it seems as if many of these hospital scenes are missing and some of them appear much later in the film. In other words, if you see the movie, it seems he may have recovered - only to hear that he is dead. Because the man the b.f.f. of Satan, however, his evil soul cannot die and he returns to both attacks of one of his henchmen and to own Nurse Sherri. Now Sherri is, of course, a very disturbed woman - demonic possession or not. Sometimes she acts like a zombie and others are violent homicide. So I ask ... "why didn't her boyfriend think it was problematic?!". In other words, after trying to kill a patient, he does not get an exorcist or commit the booby hatch !!! Oh, and talking about boobies ... this movie is NOT the breast filled sex skirt showing its title and posters. While there are some bare breasts here and there, it is irrelevant to the plot and is only briefly (1/2 second or so) seen in both scenes. So, if you're a perv, this movie isn't for you - although a few places in the movie (as the nurse gets out of a patient) look like the movie. Perhaps it was designed as a porn flick at once. <br /> <br /> But if you're a bad movie fan, there's plenty to make your appetite. Some examples of incompetence are the inability of many of the actors to produce lines that aren't bushy - and I'm not even talking about Sherri. Particularly striking is one of the final scenes. I have never seen a quiet and dramatic play in my life, and that includes Ed Wood's movies! There are also some more inexpensive touches, such as the bad animation of "green things", the doctor who finds a murdered nurse, continues to investigate in a house where walls are covered in blood. Better still, an army of policemen). <br /> <br /> Despite these problems, why do I think it's good for an Adamson movie? Well, the story is not bad and he could build tension very well. Many false alarms early make my heart a little breed. Also, the car accident, while it was irrelevant, came down well and was almost a big budget for Adamson. <br /> <br /> Overall, not a good movie and one of most people will be bored to watch. But fans of Adamson or indifferent films will love it - it gives some fun in a cheesy way that gives a few laughs.
