I just caught "Goodbye to the King" on the cable, and maybe it's just because I'm a girl, but I thought it was on the craptastic side. The writing and direction are pretentious. (When I realized that John Milius was responsible, it all became clear). The supporting actors were actually not bad - James Fox was excellent. The biggest disappointment was Nick Nolte, who I usually enjoy. As soon as he goes native, he starts with a very stiff, English stable, and half the time he looks like distracted, as if he just smoked from the abundance of Borneo's rain forest. And then the end - what the ??? Learoyd only happens on the same boat as The Botanist (incidentally, if the botanist took the girl, or what?)? The boat just conveniently comes close to an island-rich takeover by a crazy Anglo ex-headhunting Army deserter?
