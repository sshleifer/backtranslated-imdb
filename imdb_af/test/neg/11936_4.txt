The director was probably still in his early learning phases when he tried his hand at the western region. Look at the outfits. Everybody looks scrubbed, well-brushed, well-dressed and well-dressed as if ready for the church. Even the horses look well cared for and shiny. It's western, crying out loud! It is supposed to look dusty, nasty and sweaty. And then there is the amateurish behavior of the females in this bird. The whole lot, a dozen or so, all beautiful and benevolent, was just freshly raped and widowed, but hardly a tear did not flow. Instead, they all look with great interest (if not straight lust) to the newly born beautiful seven who later feed, bandage and comfort the bandits. The same direct criticism goes for Lee van Cleef, who does a fairly good acting job. Our Lee, who plays the law, just lost his dearest wife. But Lee, hard as organic rock, doesn't show emotion at all and finds himself within days of his spouse's ruin in the arms of a juicy widow with whom he walks with her bread in the future. The cad. And then there's another thing that always botheres me with these kind of movies: no matter how many dynamite-induced explosions occur in the middle of a pack of about 50 horses The scab on top of them, just the crooks killed and the nights always rejoice. (I know ... silly moi ... it's just a movie ...). It's not the worst western ever made, but is preparing for some serious gift.
