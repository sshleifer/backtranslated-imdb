Most of this movie was okay, for a sequel to a sequel to a sequel ... <br /> <br /> I was impressed with the amount of tension there was; I actually expected to be put out of the window in favor of Gore, Gore, Gore. It wasn't, but there are some ridiculous deaths. <br /> <br /> However, the thing I didn't like was all the complications. It might have been good if the writing writers took the time to explain them all. But what was the purpose of the secret society in the spiritual institution, specifically? Why are they protected to some extent from Michael's damage? What exactly are they going to do with the baby? How did Jaime Lloyd conceive, for the matter? Why does her 20 years claim to be pregnant too? Why did Michael kill his fellow conspirators in the end? Why were there fetuses in the laboratory? The actors seemed to have found out when they saw the fetuses. But it was never explained to the audience. <br /> <br /> If you're just going to watch this movie to see people snooping, then it'll be fine for you. However, if you can't be a plot thrown to you that remains unsolved by the time the credits roll, you should look something else.
