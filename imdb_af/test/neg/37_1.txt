The first 20 minutes were a bit of fun, because I don't think I saw a movie so badly (acting, essays, effects (!), Etc ....) The rest of the running time went to drag with every click in dialogue no effect. These people didn't look like horror movies or how to make them or any other movie. There is no adult language, a little short nudity, and no gore except false blood smeared on no open wounds, etc. It would have been PG in the early eighties and PG-13. I'm not sure how it has an R score or if it really did. I saw the American International release entitled Hospital of Terror. I've seen 100 horror movies over the past 12 months and it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Here's an example of how bad it is: There is one scene where something green comes through the door. I'm not sure what it is supposed to be, but what it is on the screen is a bit of green crayons (which I'm not exaggerating) over the film, half-moving inside the door, then it's supposed to do something Nurse Sherri to take possession of her. I couldn't believe they had the lack of pride to show this embarrassment.
