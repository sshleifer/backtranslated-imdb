A plot that is dumb beyond belief. However, it must be acknowledged that the lead actors go to their roles as if it were Shakespeare. And that's how it should be. It's not their fault, the author seems to be in a coma. <br /> <br /> Hats off to what is really a very shrewd performance by Joanna Kerns. She proves that just because it is not on the page, does not mean that a role cannot be grasped and engraved. And she does it with gusto. Good for her. <br /> <br /> Same for Christine Elise, who is advised to be a little bit more confused and silly, but goes much further than her script calls. <br /> <br /> And also award. A graduate of the day and first time soap (Ryan's Hope, Melrose Place). He is always versatile and underestimated. His primary downside seems to be his impossible to ignore, good appearance. He is a solid, well-oriented actor who has much more to do than he generally does. <br /> <br /> The rest of the role is basically window decoration. <br /> <br /> The direction is adequate and the writing is pretty idiotic. <br /> <br /> Watch this one to star in three great actors and enjoy doing the necessary cold. It's fun.
