Suck ... what can I say? <br /> <br /> Why is a horrible script like this first approved. It is not wrong to have a complicated plot, but it is not well explained to the audience! <br /> <br /> To explain the woman, the plot via flashbacks, is badly bad. Having such a rigorous editing for the fighting tones is also bad! Such fantasy display just shows in trailers. It cheaper the whole look! <br /> <br /> And who are the Russian guys at the top of the movie? Who is being tortured? Is he with the CIA? <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't deserve to be released into the theater. But it's not worth producing in the first place. It's a joke for Hollywood.
