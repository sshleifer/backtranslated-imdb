While the writing was terrible, the frightening, the only thing that saved this "turd" was the brushing, but it wasn't enough to make me look again. Everyone said I was actually looking stupid about this movie. It was a new layer for Troma. Lloyd Kaufman, who started the movie with a garbage bag and made noises at night, had to make me realize what I was getting into. It was by far one of the worst ever eliminated by the Troma team. The best place to watch this movie is for those who aren't disabled, because they can't stand up to change the channel. In conclusion, it is not a quick recommendation to watch this movie just for the breasts.
