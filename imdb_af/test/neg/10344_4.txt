Corben Bernsen addressed horror film about a chemical weapon released in a sports event and all in crazy monsters. We watch the staff at a radio station reporting. <br /> <br /> It has moments, but mostly it plays like a lifelong horror movie with breasts and blood. There are some very good ideas here, but they just don't work. Actually, the ideas of the film are better handled in a movie called Pontypool, which builds a lot of work and tension by showing nothing to us. It shows us things and it just looks cheap. Given the choice, I see Pontypool again rather than watching this movie again.
