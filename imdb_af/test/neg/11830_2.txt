"My Blue Sky" is boring. The plot is unsatisfactory; the characterization and dialogue stink; The musical numbers, sometimes presented in interesting ways, are not only too often absurd, but also extremely lyrical, painfully clear and emotionally hollow at the core. The leaders, Betty Grable and Dan Dailey, are attractive professionals. However, despite their talented efforts to lift the drunk and indescribable material, they fail. David Wayne and Jane Wyatt, for all their demonstrated talent in other projects, are more or less cyphers here. <br /> <br /> There is really only one reason to watch "My Blue Sky". One reason ... a star: Mitzi Gaynor, in her film debut. Her total screen time is probably less than ten minutes, but so what? Her fame and promising personality, her naked beauty and her exceptional charisma are glorious and make these minutes the most spectacular, memorable and exciting moments in the film. If you would appreciate an opportunity to see a tremendously young talent emerging, please visit Miss Mitzi Gaynor in "My Blue Heaven." <br /> <br /> By the way, I mock (and encourage you to avoid). Casper's manic, obsessive-compulsive DVD commentary for this movie. Wordy, digressive, unnecessary encouraging, often weak with what is on the screen, and constantly galloping with excess nerve energy, his comment is absolutely indigestible.
