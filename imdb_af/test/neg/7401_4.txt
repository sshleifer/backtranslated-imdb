I only saw the first part of this and came to the conclusion that I wouldn't miss anything if I didn't watch the second episode. The cinematography was OK, but apart from this, the plot was as common and run as any other war story. The actors and actresses play their characters without passion and the make-up is really bad (Heiner Lauterbach with his white hair and Kai Wiesinger respectively, as if some white white hair can give them more dignity and common sense). I mean if you watched more than two or three movies about World War II (like most of us), then you're just going to bother seeing a third or fourth if it has some new insights or twists in it. the plot promises. But Roland Suso Richter seems scared to do it, you can almost smell his fear of not meeting the bourgeois and joking expectations of the conservative ZDF TV channel while watching this movie. Millions of euros have been spent to bring about boring and unimaginable German films. These millions of dollars could be devoted to making three or four independent films, but no, let's give a director a film that tells people that war can be explained with rational means. My advice: Rather read Joseph Heller or Kurt Vonnegut. They'll tell you what war is! Or give me one million euros and I make a better movie than this load of BS! And another thing: why is it that German movies are only awarded for the Oscar when the movie is about World War II or the Holocaust? Probably because it is the only thing that makes German movies. And it must make us think, doesn't it?
