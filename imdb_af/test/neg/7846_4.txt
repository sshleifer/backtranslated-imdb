Tycoon will never be listed as one of John Wayne's better post Stagecoach movie. It is good in spots, has some fine action ranges in the cave and also in the flood at the climax. But the plot leaves much to be desired. <br /> <br /> What we have in Tycoon is two men who do not like each other and that aversion prevents them from working as a team. Multimillionaire Cedric Hardwicke hired John Wayne and James Gleason to build a railway. But then he refuses to give them the necessary funds to do the job right. <br /> <br /> Things become very complicated when Wayne falls for Hardwicke's daughter, Laraine's Day. After a night of spending their time alone in an Inca ruin, Wayne and Day, according to convention in South America, will get a shotgun, although nothing has happened. <br /> <br /> What happened, these two were locked in a room for 24 hours to work out their differences somehow. Their little ones cause some deaths under Wayne's crew. <br /> <br /> But what Tycoon is best known for is another little thing. Laraine Day married Leo Durocher, the manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers when it was filmed. He was a constant presence on the set, frantically jealous of John Wayne, who he said might have a relationship with his wife. Nothing about it, but he made his wife's life miserable. <br /> <br /> None of the Duke's better efforts.
