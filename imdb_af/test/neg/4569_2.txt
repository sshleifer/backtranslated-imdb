I'm not generally a fan of high school comedies, they rely heavily on humor in bad taste and rarely get far from clich√©d story lines and characters and instantly dull dialogue. However, I had my share of guilty enjoyment, especially when I was still at high school myself. To see the oh-so-recognizable teacher figures get their kicks kicked, I always lifted me and an occasional laugh might also be the case. These movies work only if at least one of the characters is an instant one, which was not the case with 'Cheats', especially the main character. Of course it didn't help that the actor in the game was one of the annoying, non-talented, arrogant children I've ever seen in a comedy. <br /> <br /> Doing a comedy is no joke, it's hard to be funny: the delivery should be just right or the material spilled. In this case there were not very good things to start with and the jokes that were half-funny were professionally screwed through the cast. <br /> <br /> This movie feels 3 hours long, the director never heard of pacing. Of course. Stay away from this one, there are many other pleasant teenage comedies out there, like 10 things I hate about you, who is your dad and superbath.
