I usually like this stupid / no brain activity movies, but it was just too stupid. There were too many clich√©s and the plot didn't make much sense. There were many loose points and the end was extremely poor and sudden. We didn't even see if the big master plan worked. We only saw the main character about his dead, the professor (who died because of stupidity (see below)). <br /> <br /> One scene especially annoyed me. Why did the professor only have oxygen in his container for about 5 minutes when he handed the dam manually? And if they only had oxygen containers with 5 minutes oxygen, why didn't he bring two or three of them? Then he would have survived ?? it was bloody stupid. The movie is pretty full of such stupid things. I can't recommend it at all.
