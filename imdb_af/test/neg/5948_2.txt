In fact, everyone responsible for this drink must be beaten, dragged and hung! If it's such a big Eugene O'Niell drama, I never want to be a victim to see it again. There are so many things wrong with this feature where do you start? First, Elmer Bernstein's bombastic score is present throughout the film, even in quiet scenes where background music is subtracted from the character's motivation. Secondly, these characters are not pleasant people and although some judges might like me personally not to have every scene in which Ives picked up the scenery, but that was the way his characters were written: to be averse. W / Loren has never made it clear whether she is good or bad? and all her chats about how she is going to change things to the way they come before the baby? Well, I've seen what comes clear. Perkins is overlooked and then he plays the role of a warm-up for Norman Bates (which he played two years later), who even wants to give up debt at the end. Hokey! Thirdly, this film is a studio production phase and it suffers. The story would have benefited from location shooting to develop a sense of "place" on the farm (giving up all the main lines). As it is filmed, there is no sense of value for the property, as the film has a studio sound phase that is not convincing. It's a very horrible movie.
