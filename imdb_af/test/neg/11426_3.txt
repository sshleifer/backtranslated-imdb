Because I would never have seen this movie to the end. Although there are a few, but not many, funny moments in this movie, I couldn't understand more than about 15% (including the English couple in the 3rd story) of what people said. Three short stories, no one with a real point, with just a few of the most miserable and lifeless people I could have imagined and a load of dirty language. Didn't find it funny, didn't find it, found no sense in it. 10/04
