[WARNING: Some spoilers are included, although this is a documentary.] <br /> <br /> I bought this documentary because I am the director of D.A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus, which include MOON ABOUT Broadway, STARTUP.COM and THE WAR ROOM. I highly recommend all great documentaries. Looking at this extremely boring and unconscious account of Depeche Mode's 1988 tour, I realized that they had nothing to do with working on editing this movie. The group members were definitely less than the upcoming camera; That is why the game of adding fans on a weekly bus ride has been added to pick up things. Really, now I mean, come. Who thought a concert movie of a cent-pop band with three keyboard players and a singer would be a good idea? Admittedly, I love Depeche Mode's music, and Martin Gore writes good melodies, but to see it in concert never seemed to be interesting, and this movie is proving positive. Unless you're a big fan of Depeche Mode, stay away from this documentary .... it's a total waste of time.
