Yes, I bought camp and it wasted about 86 minutes of my life and 5 pounds of my money. I thought I didn't expect a wonderful movie. I didn't really think about the cover. least not boobies in the first 3 seconds (I don't complain about the boobies.) I complain about what hell has to do with something? this movie had to be kept there hand cam at home as a joke .... they sucked .. why was the blood more brown and thirsty like the real blood? ... cheap I tell you I mean everyone was not in color they were just yellow yellow. And another thing that killed me at this sad apology for a movie was the fact that they were trying to pretend to be the clown, a woman, although it is clearly a shabby black-haired man. .. let somebody else notice that the only special effect in this movie was a delayed jump. It was also poor oh and the solution effect you can find on many basic computer programs like ... powerpoint. movie blow
