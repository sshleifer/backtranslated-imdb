Overall, I call it a disappointing achievement. It tries the old "Horror Anthology" approach, but fails. The acting was bad, and so were the stories. Of course, any film shown in the movie was random, just to attract the R-score for sex. Typically, I think, but bad. Take your $ 5 and rent a real movie instead!
