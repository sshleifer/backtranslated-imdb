Equations with the original series are inevitable. It is a pity that Diana Rigg left the original show in the 1960s because of the abuse of producers, and MacNee wondered as much as any fan. It's not telling how long the show could last. Linda Thorson was OK as a replacement and her episodes still kept almost all the quality and aspects of the Rigg episodes - only the Rigg / Macnee chemistry was missing. The New Avengers had to be left on the shelf - a diminishing Macnee, an annoying Purdey, and whoever is hell is this man Gambit. Also the humor was forced and poor - when I just watched a few episodes, because that was all I could see, but I think I have the idea. Try as much as possible and do, it's almost impossible to relive an old display as a new format or movie.
