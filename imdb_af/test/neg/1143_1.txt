I loved the original, I watch it every year. but the second is a piece of garbage and it should never be made. The second could have worked if there was another place. The boy was not an original or did not act like one of Eddie's children. Third was too clever for Eddie, who played his father's role. None of the other children were there. It could have been much better. I don't know why they even tried to make this movie. There was no continuity of the first movie. I would pretend that this one does not even exist. It is sad that the actors do not even see that they are true. A very bad movie. I just think I have an hour or more messing up on a bad movie and I really love all the national lampoon movies.
