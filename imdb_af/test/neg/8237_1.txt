This movie series. No money, no acting, nothing. I caught it tonight on the 3: 00 movie, and I was forced to respond. This movie didn't recommend anything. I can't believe it's ever been released to American television! No one in this movie can act out of a paper bag. The lame efforts on comedy fall flat on their faces, the special effects consist of a worm-like puppet "monster" ... I can't even tell you how rock-bottom this production is. It seems to cost $ 50,000 to shoot, but just because it's at 16mm, and that's probably a generous estimate! In any case, I quickly lost interest and I had to look for "Matlock" repetitions instead of completing them. That's how BAD is this movie !!!
