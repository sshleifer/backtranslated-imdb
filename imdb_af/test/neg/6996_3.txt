You can see the final outcome of a mile away. All the signs were there ... the liquor, the fast ride, the diversion of the women .... A good commercial for safety belt use and later model vehicles that put the passengers farther from the windshield. The end is also quite anti-climate, as the Ford Econoline bus is almost overloading its nose after hitting a high-speed bridge (very unlikely). made it a little more credible. And why do these movies always appear during / after a prom? Is it a case of once you survive the prom, will you be good for life? More than anything else, it points to the lack of policing of the liquor for liquor, and doesn't hold tabs on the MINORs who leave the dance for a backbone.
