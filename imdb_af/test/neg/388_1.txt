Closet Land is a nasty piece of work with excellent actors. Nothing more (or less) happens in the film except the perpetual abuse of a handsome woman prisoner by a sadistic police officer. The environment is minimalist. It can be regarded as soft core S&M porn because the drama is without all reference points such as time, place and political context. Since what has happened, cutting into a fantasy futuristic environment, the abuse is purely personal. The pornographic aspects are justified by being a warning about the evils of the totalitarian government, but because there is no real context for the torture of this young woman, we come to disturb but have learned nothing. <br /> <br /> What's the point? That torture exists in the world? That abusive prisoners are bad? That dictators are abusing innocent people? We already know this. Closet Land has echoes of such works as Darkness At Noon and Ionesco's Rhinoceros, but both works were made by competent artists whose work had historical context and depth of meaning. This work is amateurish and the dialogue sophomoric. A certain inch off.
