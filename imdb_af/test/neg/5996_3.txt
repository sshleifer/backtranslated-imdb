The first twenty-five minutes may be the worst in the modern British film. Director / Advertising William Cartlidge treated Wilde's original with such reverence that he completely ignored the needs of a movie. Fortunately, the quality of the direction and editing improved significantly after the first half hour, but by then the damage was done. From the actors, Prunella Scales and Robert Hardy wipe the floor with the rest of the cast every time they are on the screen. The other exceptions are Jonathan Firth's Arthur and Karen Hayley's Mabel, who get ample latitude to deliver their lines with the true comedic meaning of Wild. The apparent lead, James Wilby and Trevyn McDowell, are comparatively slim and wood. In an obvious effort to make a scant budget every penny, the play was nominally updated until the 1990s, but in combination with the original script, the effect is more of a bad manuscript of the 1970s. True moments of comedy are few and far between, but when they arrive, it is very amusing - a sign, perhaps, that more sensible pruning from the rest of the play might lead to a better, more even movie.
