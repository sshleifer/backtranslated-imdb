I saw this movie a few years ago and I never want to golf again. I mean ninjas seem to have no respect for the game of golf or the way it developed. And I'm not talking about "victimless" things like forging a scorecard. No no. Based on what I saw here, they murdered shameless policemen and golfers on secret land club grounds. Judge Smailes will turn into his grave. And they repent for sins? No no, based on what I've seen here is the typical reaction of a murdered ninja to take over the body of a woman's telephone repair worker and seek revenge. I find it morally reprehensible, and unnecessary to say, after watching this nonsense, I not only stopped golf and talked to the phone, but I also decided to stop feeding the homeless.
