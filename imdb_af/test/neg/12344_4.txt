The movie is a bit interested with the boy who is interested in a teenage girl at his own age. Clayburgh's rogue man is killed in a car accident because she is ready to go to Rome and sing as a diva. Matthew objects but come along. He reconnects with the young girl, but this time Matt is on cocaine. His beautiful voice, beautiful, turbulent mother is in the spotlight. She doesn't know how to handle Matt's addiction. The movie is looking for a plot. Clayburgh is in the wrong role and Bertolucci can have his head in the moon as he directs the picture. The Moon has great symbolism. <br /> <br /> Save your time. Maybe I'm overly generous with 4 *.
