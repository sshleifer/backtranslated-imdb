The final installment in the Karate Kid series is predictable, poorly acted, and so bad it is boundaries on the enjoyable. But not quite, it's just bad. In this installment, Ralph Macchio's Karate Kid is absent, already in one of the episodes. The new child, played by Hillary Swank, is the teenage granddaughter of one of Mr. Miyogi's WWII friends. Her parents recently died and her grandmother tried not to get hold of this young hero. In steps, Mr. Miyogi put things right. Along with the formula, there are a group of neo-fascist bulls, the Alpha Troopers to be placed in their place, and a new karate movement called the Praying Mantis. As I said, this movie is a mess, and should be avoided.
