Gargoyle starts late one night in "Romania 1532" as a peasant girl (Daniela Nane) travels in her horse and car that reflects her own business when the moonlight clouds above a living gargoyle crash and attack her, she manages the Gargoyle to escape and happen at a castle of a little description where an evil mob of locals and a priest can put an end to the Gargoyle, or they think ... Cut to today Bucharest where two CIA agents Ty Griffin (Michael Pare) & Jennifer Wells (Sandra Hess) are negotiating the safe return of the son of a wealthy US ambassador to his kidnappers. In the pursuit of one of the kidnappers, Griffin lost himself on the roof of a building, but found a large pool of blood and no visible signs of what had happened to him. Meanwhile, Dr. Christina Durant (Kate Orsini) and her colleague Richard Barrier (Jason Rohrer) a church when church worker Gregor (Mihai Bisericanu) informed Richard that he had found an old age. The two investigate and find a cave with lots of slimy cocoons and one very angry & very lively gargoyle that doesn't waste time killing them both. Griffin & Wells is in the case when reported and soon realizes that local legends of monstrous Gargoyles are true to a local priest named Father Soren (Fintan McKeown) who wants to flood the world with them ... <br /> <br /> Written, compiled and directed by Jim Wynorski under his usual pseudonym Jay Andrews Gargoyles is another masterpiece that Wynorski can add to his credits. The writing by Wynorski, Ion Ionescu, A.G. Lawrence & Bill Munroe are crap, unspeakable, boring and as simplistic as you can get. To begin with, I would like to know if there was only one Gargoyle that had laid all the eggs because I was pretty sure it could not have been pregnant. How did it survive in that hole for 500 years? What did it eat? How did the priest know it was there? Why didn't anyone ever find out? Why did the priest want to flood the world with them? To rule it? The Gargoyles barely take over the world and then let a priest rule it like a king and if they have done what is left to rule? Like the guys who wrote Gargoyle, I don't think he thought it was good? No matter how I see it, no matter how I try to figure it out, no matter how many times I try to celebrate it. Gargoyles just make no sense and their story has great plot holes, decay into logic and is not so good to start anyway. The character is dull and clich√©d, the action repetitive and unspeakable while the film as a whole is a real drill to go through. People do illogical things and everything that happens is very convenient, such as when priest Griffin tries to convince Gargoyle's existence and one suddenly appears and falls upon them. The cave full of cocoons is such an abomination to Aliens (1986) it is embarrassing and the end is lame. The bit on the big Ferris wheel at the show was funny, although the man scared the boys for heights and forced him to get it. <br /> <br /> Director Wynorski cuts costs and steals videos from other movies, in fact, the best scene from Gargoyle is a car hunt by Bucharest, but it is taken from the Jean-Claude Van Damme stock film Maximum Risk ( 1996). There is no shock, fear or atmosphere. The special effects are terrible, the CGI Gargoyle looks as if it is in a computer game and has little interaction with any live role-players. There are many scenes that look to the sky and try to barely appear. There is not even a worth seeing the thing, there is a terrible dope. It's technical. The special effects are terrible, but otherwise it is acceptable. The Romanian locations look good Romanian. Gargoyle went straight to video and showed it with a reasonably cheap look. The acting is not too much, personality bypass victim. Michael Pare makes the dull, dim heroes. <br /> <br /> Gargoyle is a crap movie, it fails everything that a decent creature needs to strive for. A total waste of 90 minutes as far as I am concerned, one to avoid.
