Bobcat Goldthwait must be commended for trying something different with this surprisingly sad movie, a cautious story about the pitfalls to be honest about everything. Melinda Hamilton stars as Amy, a girl who has verbally slaughtered a lion dog in the past. She struggles to tell her fiance, John. Of course, the truth behind this is the rough ugly head. The film deals with the fall of the escapes. The movie is good by everyone, except perhaps Jack Plotnick and Dougie, who never really felt like he was doing well with the picture. And the movie, while it looks solid enough, is several times. Every single person in the movie struggles with massive hypocrisy and all our stuff is difficult to relate to. Bobcat has to be praised for doing something else, as I said earlier, but otherwise it doesn't always look good, and it doesn't always lighten Goldthwaits's own legal principle, the criminal misconception of the Clown Shakes > <br /> My Degree: C-
