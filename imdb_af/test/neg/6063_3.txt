After his father's suicide, Charlie 'Kid' (Ray 'Boom Boom' Mancini) accepted the invitation and advice of his friend Tiny (Michael Chiklis) and traveled with him to Las Vegas to become a boxer. On the way they meet Gina (Jennifer Beals), they give her a lift and she becomes Charlie's friend. Johnny Ticotin (Rod Steiger) is convinced by Tiny to be Charlie's bank, and powerful agent Alex Dumas (Joe Mantegna), after watching him, becomes his manager who promotes Charlie's career. This movie is so boring that it doesn't deserve to write a lot of time. I don't like boxing, but sometimes I watch a good movie on this theme. But this one is terrible! Predictable, full of clich√©s, with a terrible chief actor, a pure waste of time. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Corpo e Alma" (`Body and Soul ')
