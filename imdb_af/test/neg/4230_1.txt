I can't remember when the last time I was so disappointed by any movie. Probably I did too much (in a way, you can expect action in dogma-style movies of course). But there's just nothing going on. Luckily I watched it at home and could switch channels when silence and silly / dumb faces began to kill me. And it was very often! It's really not too much fun to see ugly people who don't talk and move slowly, stroke and French men, not to mention ugly bodies with explicit sex. If it just makes sense, the whole murder situation is ridiculous; looks like it was just created to show another vagina as zero characters are able to actually solve the crime. With only four pseudo-developed characters and a movie going nowhere, it's pretty easy to see who the director chose as a killer. And it doesn't make any sense either. In spite of all the boredom and suffering, I have to admit that it has touched me in an inexplicable way. Perhaps you should examine it yourself, although I do not recommend it.
