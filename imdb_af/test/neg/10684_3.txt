After a 19th century gun double that goes wrong, a beautiful young woman becomes a vampire. Not only does she become one of the undead, she uses her gay, embarrassing person to maintain her talents as a cold killer. It is a low grade B feature that had to go straight to the video. The violence is fierce and stingy, but actually quite mild. The story line is so poor and dialogue so random, it is difficult to gain much interest. Eileen Daly is the main character Lilith Silver. Also in the film are Mark Caven, Kevin Howarth and Isabel Brook.
