This film has the potential and creations of a good, good, good love story ... the movie is perfect, the visual work, the original point of departure, the characters work .... but the story moves from one chess shift to the next in a most predictable way ... not one character in the movie has any depth or depth explained by the director. All we know about Catherine Zeta-Jones character is that she is obsessed with her world. No one is allowed and no one sets her world out. So much is obvious ... but the remaining characters all have their own dimensions that are never actually explored or exposed. Aaron Eckhart's character has so much more to offer the story, but it was not allowed. Abigail Breslin's character is so easy to understand that her performance is a bit predictable and fake. The end goes back to the forced turbulent world of Catherine Zeta-Jones, where the audience never falls completely before. Honestly, her turbulent world is not much more than a portrayal of a selfish, self-controlled, spoiled woman. would not have much time or sympathy in the real world. The director needs to make her a hero and never do it. In the end it is Eckhart's character who eventually wins because he wins. <br /> <br /> Not a horrible movie, just a movie that has been much better with more depth of personalities allowed, explained and exposed. <br /> <br /> Cheers
