This thing. o god this thing. I can't even call it a movie. A movie is something that does something. go somewhere. has some plot or something. I don't know how to do it. I really don't. First, I say that dark fields are the worst movie. and I thought it was. then the pirates or ghost island proved wrong to me. And now, third time in a row, another role goes beyond the duty to prove me wrong. <br /> <br /> (suction). Dark Harvest II: The Maize. Lord, it's terrible. Let me break it down for you. Male daughters are in danger through some magical psychic powers he got from his Act II popcorn, and believe they are found in a wheat field. Of course, this is the most beautiful grain field in all existence, namely the size of the wheat fields of Jeepers Creepers, Children of the Corn, and Signs combined. The main character, whose name is Shy (awesome names btw) then runs through a wheat field .... find some ghost girls, talk to them and ... walk through a wheat field. dig for a while ... and walk through a wheat field. and the amazing sad thing? Actually, I'm not doing anything. That's pretty much the whole movie. The only thing I can leave is how he is being chased by two policemen who want to arrest him. I do not know. pretends to be an actor. I didn't mind at this point. He gets away and the police - something that kills the killer. Holy crap there is a killer? apparently yes there is as much as 4/5 introduced in the film. But wait! then he walks away for a while and there you guess it more by running and digging the grain field. Then there is the end where he saves his daughters. huzzah. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this movie is it's boring. It is undeniable, human, boring, boring. I can't explain how terribly boring this thing is. nothing happens, the characters are as attractive as a root canal, and it's just half an hour of nothing. The only good thing that came out of this movie was that my friend and I got relief from the near nirvana state that this movie we tackled after the effects of the drugs in our brain had to kick in overdrive to keep us alive. During the subsequent insanity I found that I hugged a wall with a wall and my friend got a new passion to laugh hysterically as he floated over the floor as if he were seizing. This is the kind of madness this movie brings. It's not just bad. It's bad for your health. The cover looks great with a picture of an AWESOME scarecrow killer that I would totally like to look like a horror con, but it was the most misleading box ever. Don't drop it too! Don't watch this movie. watch a better maize film. ANY wheat movie is better. Don't let it get you! don't! a 0 out of 10
