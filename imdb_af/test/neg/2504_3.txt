One of a few films filmed at Coronado High School in Scottsdale, AZ in the late 80's, as well as Just One of the Guys, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and Net Perfect (which played a segmented movie during the Mickey Mouse Club .) Film is definitely for kids, as previous comments made it upright. <br /> <br /> Over the past few years, Coronado has reviewed and many of the buildings seen in this movie are now gone. The field where they are caught is adjacent to the soccer field, one of the few areas still there. The internal screens near the safe I believe were built in the old 200. <br /> <br /> Unless it is playing on the Disney Channel late at night, it may be very difficult to find a movie. How they ever made it is beyond me.
