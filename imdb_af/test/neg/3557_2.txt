I watched this movie because of the good reviews here and I will not make the mistake again. <br /> <br /> The first few minutes show that a group of people were brought together by a tragedy, but you didn't see what it was. Flashback 12 hours and we see the boring lives of each of these people, which in the end is completely meaningless to what is going to happen. When the end is finally revealed, you realize that you have just wasted an hour of your life waiting for a big payout that doesn't happen and doesn't matter what you looked at. The only connection these people have is that they all had a bad day - but even the continuity is lost in boredom. <br /> <br /> If it's supposed to be a "Crash" clone, it's a complete failure.
