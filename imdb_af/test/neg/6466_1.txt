Ladies and gentlemen, we can offer the worst of all Disney remakes. Although the name of this movie is "That Darn Cat", it had to be "That Darn Teen" or "FBI Agent". The cat didn't have really good scenes, Ricci's character was more annoying than funny, Doug E. Doug had no good lines. Even Dean Jones's cameo role couldn't save this movie! The only very good characters were the city's only two mechanics, but their scenes were just short. In all, I would say that if you are considering watching this movie, get something more intelligent like a Barney video.
