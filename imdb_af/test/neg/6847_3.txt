I agree that Mary Woronov (Murdoch's secretary) is one of the only good things about this movie. She is my favorite actress ever, every role she plays is always done so well. Her character is smart, sarcastic, smart, light, funny and cunning. She really does pull out this role and you get a good feel for what her character is about. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is pretty bad. The music is the most entertaining thing left over. One of the characters has this very funny radio that she brings with her while wearing her sleek, striped tank. <br /> <br /> One thing that was a little interesting about the story was the idea that someone was renting these people. three college older children to clean up an old abandoned theater. He gave them the keys and said - go there. It would be great and I wish someone would give me the chance! Imagine joining two other people with an old abandoned theater and deciding how to decorate it and fix it. You have total control over the whole building. It will be so nice! Unfortunately, the characters do not think here as an exciting adventure, they think it is a great task. They walk around with long faces and fight with each other all the time. It's kind of a bummer. But it's nice to think about the possibilities that these people aren't even excited about. <br /> <br /> The movie does a great job of making you feel helpless or haunting a bit from the theater itself. But the acting (except Woronov .. and possibly Murdoch, the boss - just because a very good money makes hungry fake smiley businessman never got lucky) is really awful and you end up feeling dissatisfied. Plus, the random slapstick is a bit sticky and kind of ruins the reality that the movie is trying to create. <br /> <br /> See if you delve into Mary Woronov, the funky 80's Casio keyboard style electronic beat and if you think you're a giant, spooky-abandoned theater for yourself, it's not interesting.
