I totally disagree with the previous reviewer: this movie has amusing moments, but hardly a riot. (Unless you really think it is leaking from a septic tank and heads are exploding in a shot, it's a laugh riot. In fact, the only reasons I gave this 2, instead of 1, is because a. ) Two of the actors are decent. The soundtrack is above average with a few songs that are tossed in contrast and c.) The monster truck is frightening. <br /> <br /> Unlike that, it's a movie with some intermittent, creepy or interesting ideas that are overwhelmed by inexorable crassness, crudity and vileness. The former best friend character is one of the most annoying I have ever seen and the little grace that the hitchhiker's character has disappeared into yet another constructed turning end that makes little or no sense. <br /> <br /> A waste of the main actor showing a few nervous charms and the aforementioned actress depicting the hitchhiking character ...
