This is a cheap movie! A stripper is attacked and raped by zombies and nobody believes her. She goes to the police who also rape her. She eventually finds a child who has also been attacked by the zombies and traces the zombies back to 'The Zombie Master'. The fact that Stephanie Beaton stars as the stripper is the only reason to watch this movie.
