This movie had some funny parts, but for the most part I made it to continue and change DVDs and rather watch "Malibu's", which I had in my own collection. At least I would know there was something funny and give me something to look out for. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed in this very low budget movie. And I don't judge a movie on its budget. It just lacked originality and was too predictable. I won't rent or even watch this movie again, and I'm usually repeating the movie. The actors were forgotten. The story was half thought and it made me have an insatiable urge to laugh. I finally looked at Jamie Kennedy's White Boy Gone Gangsta to scratch the comedy itch.
