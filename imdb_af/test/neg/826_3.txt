Ali G was initially funny. His interviews were fresh and original. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a mock gangster wearing OTT clothing and using street-wise lingo was initially a profession. <br /> <br /> But this movie is just a rehash of old jokes, the humor was mostly childish and turned around the male genitalia for the most part. The film claimed good actors like Charles Dance, but their talents were wasted as they foolishly played 2-d characters. It's not 'terrible', but it's not a second time really funny. It may be said that the movie was Ali G's last bastion of comedy. Then he ran out of steam.
