We tested this movie in a club as an example of how classical literature can be distorted in the most horrific films of all time. Just the fact that the back of the box proudly proclaimed the proclamation that had to be set in the "techno-futile" future was enough of a hint. I think the word describes the film itself, because it doesn't matter how much technology they have tried to save this movie. The effort was completely useless. Not to mention that our club advisor told us he was unable to find a distributor for two years. <br /> <br /> This movie bug is full of a cheesy, cliche dialogue that is worse than the terrible teen poetry. Beowulf's character halfway changes in a way that is not credible, and when he is in an action scene, he constantly blows like a hyper gymnast. There is even, as they say, a "token black guy" whose attempts at humor are completely out of place. And of course, the daughter of the leader of the outpost Grendel is terrorism is a total fixen. A Vixen whose breasts are exposed throughout the movie. A Vixen who wants to fight the essence, but she never puts on weapons. And her weapon of choice is a small snare. And despite their serious situation, she is still dressing for dinner, in a dress with a translucent dress that exposes her shorts underwear. There are some scenes that can succeed as soft core pornography, and in the second scene they even use footage of the first. I thought Grendel's portrayal was bad enough, but then came the end of the film, showing a show of CGI that could be decent for the 80's, but was completely ridiculous for a late nineties business. I can go on, but you should all see this movie for the fullest laugh. <br /> <br /> The other club members and I managed to watch it by taking a MST 3K cue and mocking it all the way through. I'm still moving from an extra's weapon: an ever-turning pizza cutter on a pole.
