The hills have eyes, not a good movie by any imagination. Because the villains look almost normal and not what you'd expect distorted lunatics to look like. Because the pacing is sometimes very slow, and there are many scenes of The characters repeat themselves. By that I mean that there are many fillers in the movie, with very deliberate walking. The film didn't have a clear direction. The plot of the movie is almost original, even for its time. The Texas chain saw massacre came out a few years earlier and is a much more effective film, as far as horror goes. The movie has little in the way of scares and the sounding soundtrack just turned and already distracted. once.i suppose the music was used to cover the fact that not much is happening by much of the movie, although it failed in its intended purpose. I basically still watched the time to hope every few seconds that something would happen or it would end. When something finally happened, the film was devastated by mere chaos and loud noise. I put it through because I like to give a movie that is the benefit of the doubt. There are a few loud screams, and yes, people die but who cares. Too slow I get it so. Madam enjoyed it, so at least one of us got something out of it. The hills have eyes are not the worst movie we could have watched, but I doubt I'll see it again. This film was made again in 2006 and I will also have the overview of that version. In the course of time this movie was slow, while other times were chaotic and repetitive. someone running around your block screams their head off, stay away from this movie. A better bet would be the original Texas chain killing (1973). 1.5 * out of 10 * which is generous
