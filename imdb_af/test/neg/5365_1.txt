I was very excited when the paranormal state first came A&E. I thought it might bring more interesting ghostly evidence. The production value looks good and I really love the logo. Then, after a few episodes, I began to feel that this show might not be evidence, but had a strong religious agenda. <br /> <br /> It looks like every case they investigate has a big, big, evil demon that can't even move a teacup on camera, but everyone is scared. Then there comes a power of Christ ritual that saves everyone. <br /> <br /> There is also very little focus on other members of the team. The whole show focuses on Ryan and he feels like one of the people who handles your pamphlets about his church on the street. <br /> <br /> Have paranormal phenomena and demons become the new missionaries of Christianity, who frighten people to repent? Really, it must be on a Christian network. I was very disappointed.
