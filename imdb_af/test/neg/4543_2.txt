"The Chilling", director of Deland Nuse and Jack A.Sunseri, is one of the worst zombie movies I've ever seen. Why Linda Blair ("The Exorcist", "Witchery") appears in this stinker is outside me. The plot is really dumb: the frozen bodies at a cryogenic laboratory are revived after the offense of strikes and turned into cannibalistic zombies. The characters are completely one-dimensional and stupid, the zombies look terrible and there are no gores. Feed this cheap piece of garbage like the pest. My rating: 1 out of 10.
