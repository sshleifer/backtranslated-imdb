This stupid, anti-environment wannabe "Jaws" is sad, pathetic, boring, dull and dumb. There is nothing wrong with that. <br /> <br /> Plot follows a few shark / octopus creatures that occur off the coast of Florida and kill some people (including a boring, stupid couple with a shiny woman and a silent man for one or for another reason, sticking with a fork). His rise to the surface is always represented by a vague coastline of something hobbling over and over. It does not make sense, it is terribly boring, and it is suckling pot suck. <br /> <br /> There are moments of camp that cannot be ignored: the same shot of the couple's boat from the opening sequence THREE TIMES; the doctor twenty times a dying patient's chest with an eclipse without stopping, although he is clearly dead; the porn-esque soundtrack; The couple's shot makes love on the beach, with three different themes ("We come before us!"). the old computer that sounds like Kermit the Frog; A scientist who gave up shouted, "I know!" a dr. Smith; The list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> Oh, and everybody drinks at least thirty bears in the course of the movie (many noticed by Mike and the Bots). . . <br /> <br /> The MST3K version is their best episode, but it's definitely better than the movie itself. "That's how I like to go fishing, guys ... with a flashlight and a flame worker ..." - Crow <br /> <br /> One star for "Devil's Fish"; seven for the MST3K version <br /> <br />
