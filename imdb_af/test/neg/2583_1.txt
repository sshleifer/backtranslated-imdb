I saw it at the Toronto Inter. Film festival in September 2005. The description looks interesting - how wrong I was! It could easily be the worst movie I've ever seen - in 50 years! I see the director is my age (1948) and along with Nico from the Velvet Underground, which we lead to Andy Warhol, who happened to be the one I thought I had - Warhol's 24+ hours of nothing much happened. . It's not art, it's boredom. <br /> <br /> Specifically: black and white. OK, maybe ... but what is the purpose here? Surely they had color in 1968! And there is no contrast with the present. And yes, the subtitles were obviously white. I don't think I missed much, but it made about 20% of them unreadable. <br /> <br /> Next, it is purely chronological, but with seemingly random events being thrown in. What is the purpose of the conversation with the Old Man at the table? It doesn't add anything to the movie. There were many similar scenes - almost like someone taking a camcorder and filming random people and splitting them to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Plot? None. The "riot" consists of a few figures in the distance that sometimes shield a rock. Mostly it is a turbulent time to watch people (in the distance!). The repetitive opium smoke is just as boring. When the main character had a cute girl, I got up, but no, she was boring too! This is perhaps the only French film I saw where no one is pulling their clothes. Probably they were bored to bother. <br /> <br /> Romance? None. The girl looks completely indifferent to everything - perhaps her sculpture is interested, but if it does, it is not shown. We are completely indifferent to the fate of the characters because they are all unattractive. Perhaps this is the point of all this?
