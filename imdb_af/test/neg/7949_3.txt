Why does the original "Repeat" repeat? In my mind, "assault" was Carpenter's true masterpiece. It has all the elements that have good Carpenter movies. External threat to small group of individuals. People take the challenge because they are forced to do so. Insulation! Just remember, the guns in the Carpenter's original have made no sound, and are therefore far more threatening than conventional devices. And now it is again. Concentrate on "main character I psychology and on its relation to main character II (the evil but honorable). The anonymous threat in the Carpenter movie is replaced by a fairly conventional conspiracy / corruption background. The remakers just don't have the main chart of the original do not understand, and so something has been reasonably common.
