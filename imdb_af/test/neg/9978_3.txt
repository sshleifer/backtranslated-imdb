I evaluated this movie a 3 and it was generous. The scenery is ponderous and gaudy, the acting for the most part being awful. I think Peter O'Toole did a good job of acting (Tiberius), but he had to be murdered when he saw the final cut of the movie. John Gielgud, how short he was in the movie, still seems to play Hamlet's role. The parts of the hard core pornography were not erotic, nor did they do much to further the story. Okay, Malcolm McDowell had a nice butt and the man who played Macro was nice. The man who played Claudius looked more like the traditional depictions of Nero and was definitely contrary to Robert Graves's photograph of Claudius. The climatic (?) Assassination of Caligula, wife and child is inaccurate because, after death, he was lying on a staircase in an open air, when he was hit in the underground passageway on the palace hill running in front. of the Domus Flaviana that still exists today. There are places in this movie where practically anything draws my attention from it - gracious distraction. If you want history, read Suetonius or Tacitus, if you want pornography and sadism, watch Passolini's "Salo", but stay away from this movie at all times.
