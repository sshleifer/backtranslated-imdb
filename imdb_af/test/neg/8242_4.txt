I've always had the Carry On movies, with their double-meaning sexual innuendo dialogue and moments of slapstick comedy, but I can see why the critics give this one two stars. In fact, many British people are gathering at a coach to go to the Palace Hotel on a Spanish holiday to an island, Elsbels. What they didn't know is that it's not quite built, and they need to share bathrooms with their neighbors, they have crazy and many other complications and complaints from Mr Pepe (Peter Butterworth, who is quite an amusing accent, eg peace that sounds like the bad P word). With Sid Brent as Vic Flange, Kenneth Williams as Stuart Farquhar, Charles Hawtrey as Eustace Tuttle, Joan Sims as Cora Flange, Barbara Windsor as Sadie Tomkins, Kenneth Connor as Stanley Blunt, an apparent crap (I personally can't remember who he is not) Jimmy Logan as Bert Conway, June Whitfield as Evelyn Blunt, Hattie Jacques as Floella (a ridiculous hag character, not as memorable as her regular Matron), Bernard Bresslaw as brother Bernard, Sally Geeson as Lily, Carol Hawkins as Marge , Jack Douglas like Harry and Patsy Rowlands as Miss Dobbs. I admit it's not good, but there's just enough dialogue gags, and of course Babs in the shower, and goes to her bum with that iconic whistle, and later a quick rip of her bra. Okay!
