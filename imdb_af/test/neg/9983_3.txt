210 minutes version (very hardcore, or so I hear) or the R-rated version released in theaters? Of course, both are terribly terrible. Peter O'Toole and Malcolm McDowell both claim they wish they never made this movie (the latter of the two men reported it in an IMDb interview!), And I can see why. Nothing but an awkward mess of soft porn and a half-hearted attempt to make a plot. <br /> <br /> Not much of anything here except cheap tricks and stupid scenes. I liked what McDowell himself said about the movie: "It was like one moment, I would star, admire my mule or something, and the next scene will be two lesbians." <br /> <br /> How true. <br /> <br /> What a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars.
