The first of the three Aztec Mummies films is the only one that has never been translated into English in the best of my knowledge. The film was chopped and used by people like Jerry Warren in other films (he combined it with another Mexican horror comedy with Lon Chaney to make Face of the Screaming Werewolf. And it came in Attack of the Mayan Mummy and elsewhere The longest of the three films, a good piece of this movie, makes the two later films that use it as a basis for flashbacks. The plot of this film has a scientist who conducts an experiment on life regression, which can cause his subject to travel back and discover hidden rooms in an Aztec pyramid. The group, as well as a sinister figure known as the Bat, hopes to use the information to discover hidden treasures. Instead, they discover a living mummy that has other plans. For a long and long time, this film has done too little to keep its 80 minutes long (the mummy is not even past an hour). Probably the least of the three films, it's easy to see why this movie is cut apart, and it's the only way to form a non-sleep inducing film. I watched the movie last night and fought to stay awake. It was a tough move and I found that I was finally scanning to the point where the mummy showed. Given the choice, I will make a pass and watch the second two movies.
