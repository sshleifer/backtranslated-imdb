Oh yes, this is another re-announcement of the classic "sociopathic murderous doctor creating female Frankenstein and falling in love." From the same director who brought you such timeless classics as "10,000 Maniacs" (no, not the group) and "Blood Feast", this "unfinished" movie screams virtually for the MST3K treatment. The doctor's assistant even has Torgo's teeth from the classic "Manos: The Hands of Fate". I don't know if the graphics, or the false fake violence or the regular stretch of the dialogue-free tide could deter the crew. <br /> <br /> The main reason to be through this movie is to For the hysterical 'hypnosis' scene, the legally serious end and the rock bottom values. I actually watched all the credits to this movie, for the same reasons you tend to slow down your car if you pass a serious traffic accident. It and the sheer genius of the end theme sounds like a watery "My Favorite Things" played on a toy piano. Goblin is not.
