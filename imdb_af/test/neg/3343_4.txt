(Spoilers) <br /> <br /> Sure, it's based on Moby Dick. Completely obsessed and it destroys him. It is a total foolishness. The movie is getting pretty good, but by the end of the film everyone is destroyed and the headmaster's mind is empty. <br /> <br /> The supposed half-sister is never convincing. Some very poor lighting effects. Music is interesting. But little else. It took me more than a month to complete the darn thing. If you like to be John Malkovich, you might like this. But where BJM was a big movie I just didn't want to see again, Pola X is a movie I just hate to hell. The only possible excitement in the film is the enjoyable sexual play by the end of the film. (Hopefully you don't think of Catherine either.) <br /> <br /> This movie is very boring, depressed and poorly targeted. Not highly recommended. If you like French movies. (look at Crimson Rivers instead) <br /> <br /> 4/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 5/10 Entertainment: 1/10 Repeatable: 0/10
