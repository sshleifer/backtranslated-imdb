Why was this movie made? Are producers so easily deceived by sadists that they will give them money to create torture methods such as this so-called "movie"? I love a bad movie than the next masochis, but "Cave Dwellers" print it. It is seriously physically painful to watch. The plot is about a name called Ator - a cumulative numbnuts I will call the rest of this review as Private Snowball - who must fight invisible warriors and save a princess to beat the bad man who needs to find a better hair stylist. Maybe I got the plot wrong, as it has been a while since I watched this look, but really, do you care so much? Oh yes, Private Snowball also has a dumb Asian sidekick (who doesn't?). Who is not funny. <br /> <br /> Anyway, private snowball fight invisible people, visit caves, all in the name of a good king, so personality free, Al Gore makes like Jim Carrey. Then Private Snowball builds a hang glider (yes, I'm serious) and gets the girl. YiPpIe-kee-yay. It's cheap, unintentionally foolish and dull. Why am I not surprised that the director eventually made porn? <br /> <br /> Bottom line: TRAFFIC. Ator will steal a part of your life and you will have no strange "so-bad-good" catches to get away from you. Bad Ator! BAD! AAC! * Gags *
