Thomas Vinterbergs "The Greatest Heroes" is another road movie without the most important element of a movie: a good story. The characters are not very original and not very interesting. Especially Thomas Bo Larsen is a pain in the neck, playing the same role he has played in the past few years and what he repeated in "Festivals" - he seems to think he is screaming and shouting at other people! The film does not make much sense and is not very funny, although it is difficult to be "cook" and "strange". If you want to make a road movie, why not add something original to the genre?
