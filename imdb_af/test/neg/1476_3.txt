The concept of this movie is unique, but its performance is less than special. When I arrived at the cinema and realized that there were only 15 people in the crowd, I thought I was making a mistake. The real mistake, however, was realized in shocking detail when the film was over and I knew I was wasting two hours of my life. <br /> <br /> Without the brutal recordings of the old man and the stupid funny friend, this movie would have rated 1 out of ten. <br /> <br /> This movie is special, special because it is probably the worst movie ever released to the public. <br /> <br /> There is also the question whether you can call it a movie or just an advertisement for the likely crummy "Northwestern". <br /> <br /> If you think of watching this movie for the plot, then the humor, the filming, the places, do not. On the other hand, if you like both sides of the film production spectra, just go for a book, or a small game or just a few novelties.
