Perhaps if you've never read any English literature, or just watched the Hollywood version of any book, you might find merit in this horrible movie. It has Shoreditch's management and writing skills. The BBC 1995 adaptation is both very enjoyable and close to the book and keeps the atmosphere between Elisabeth and Darcy very good. <br /> <br /> The characters in this production are badly mistaken, Sutherland as Bennet looks like a total buffoon. Bingley also does the fool and it is inexorable that he is a friend of Darcy. I can't imagine how Judi Dench could take the role, maybe she thought it was a surreal comedy version. <br /> <br /> Quotations from the book are out of context. Big pieces are missing, the important episode with Wickham being overlooked. <br /> <br /> Mr. However, Collins is very good and towers above the other members of the role. <br /> <br /> The only good thing is we didn't pay to see it. Wait for the DVD and use to keep a wobbling table.
