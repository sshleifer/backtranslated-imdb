As others say, it's a ridiculous horrible movie (NOT a MOVIE!). It's not bad in a funny way, just painful to try to endure. Don't waste your time. <br /> <br /> Erika Eleniak is quite warm, but there is one scene where she is in a bath, and you can see the wrap covering her chest under the bubbles. She also becomes fat. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes are so bad that it is uncompromising, if you know something about or martial arts, or even decent choreography, and editing / effects are unnecessary. /> <br /> There's no payout, it's going nowhere, and struggling to get there.
