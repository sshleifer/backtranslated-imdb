He's cute. <br /> <br /> The movie was opened in 2 2007 in 2 US theaters, for one week and awarded $ 914. It went fast. after the beginning of August 2007. <br /> <br /> We could only take about 40 minutes before switching off the DVD. <br /> <br /> It was the type of movie that played on the bottom half. of double account. You've seen the main film, and we've seen this one. You may have walked before we closed it. <br /> <br /> The 3 actors and the young ladies in the movie earned everything and earned better. than that. <br /> <br /> Ratings: ** (out of 4) 54 points (out of 100) IMDb 4 (out of 10_
