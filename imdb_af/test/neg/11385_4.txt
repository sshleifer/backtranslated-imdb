Beautiful blonde Natasha Henstridge is the young, unhappy widow in the hillside mansion, telling her story to a TV reporter in Monroeville, Virginia. And under the community's benevolent horse set, she is presumably involved in the death of her older man. This is James Brolin, who trusts as a babe-in-arms. Flashback teledrama made in Canada based on an article published in the Vanity Fair magazine. It must be true! Either way, it's much more romance than mystery, and a very familiar story. Leggy Kind of star Henstridge as a golden count hospice nurse? This can happen, I think. And it is good to see Brolin in an important role after his ticking turn in Antwone Fisher, even if he doesn't make it to the end of the picture. The end of the picture? He didn't even make it at the beginning of the picture. That is why flashbacks were invented.
