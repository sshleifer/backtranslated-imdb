Rose ?? Is there something going on in this episode? It introduces us two clues, a slow-dug gritty idiot of a doctor and a completely uninteresting companion. There is no plot to speak of childish humor, mixed with very poor stimulation and accidental music. What else is there to say? <br /> <br /> The end of the world ?? A marginal improvement, seeing our first outer space scenario. Then brought down by poor contemporary humor, paper thin logic, very poor pacing, and tired SF clichés. <br /> <br /> The Unquiet Dead ?? Best episode to date shows what can happen when someone knows how to structure an episode, writes an interesting character dialogue, and integrates an intriguing plot. Just leave the doctor and dandruff. <br /> <br /> Aliens from London / World War Three - Doctor turning into farce. What more can be said. Penelope Wilton brings the proceedings a little gravity and tries her best in difficult conditions. Some poorly written and out-of-place soap opera elements come first in these two episodes, and a return to poor pacing, bad plot and circle worthy humor / satire. <br /> <br /> Dalek ?? Not great, but still far above the RTD rate to date. The pacing and script are all good (though the doctor and dandruff still irritate). The consequences and threats of the Dalek are well introduced. The final, however, has taken on an interesting prospect that has reduced the doctor's most notorious enemy, in a cuddly bird and a previously unreported threat, to a blue rubber squid that looks like a child's toy. <br /> <br /> The Long Game - The first RTD script to show any plot, even if it was in a clichéd 80's style. Yet it is slightly affected by his usual confidence in young jokes, which makes it too far in the future to make logical sense, and again poor pacing. Not as bad as his previous efforts, but immediately forgotten. <br /> <br /> Father's Day ?? The initial point of departure could have been vaguely interesting, but common sense and logic have abandoned this episode from the beginning. We are also treated to an entire episode of Soap Opera. Before you start thinking, it's about characterization, remember, there's a big difference between Lame Soap Opera and characterization. On the positive side, it proves that OTO is not the worst scriptwriter so far. <br /> <br /> The Empty Child / The Doctor Dance - It started in a mediocre way, with a few worthy moments, and some illogical mistakes that even a primary school pupil wouldn't make (relieved windows in a blackout, someone?). Then the first part takes a more interesting and sinister turn. Florence Hoath really steals these episodes and shows us what an interesting companion could have been. She can also act. Instead, we get the annoying and politically correct Captain Jack as the new companion. The conclusion was a bit hasty, but sufficient. The pacing and script improve with a fairly good story, which makes these two episodes very atmospheric and intriguing. <br /> <br /> Boom Town - I have to be honest, except for a few examples, I was so disillusioned with the current series, that, after seeing the trailer for another 'Slitheen' episode , gave up and not I do not expose myself to torture. <br /> <br /> Bad Wolf - Reality TV, probably the worst facet of modern media, is basically the point of departure. There is no subtlety whatsoever. Do we get any interesting social comments like the likes of The Running Man or Truman Show? No, of course not. It's in a RTD episode, so they're basically here to try cynically in the audience of those shows. Once again, logic goes out of the window, as we put 200,000-something years into the future. OTD tries useless to make shoelace in an 'over-arcing' story here, with no other interest than its own existence and when the villains are revealed at the end ... They make empty threats and the doctor grins again like an idiot for the climax! Faster than the OTD's other efforts, it has one or two interesting moments. Otherwise, another, thoughtless installment. <br /> <br /> Breaking the Ways - The Great Final. More of a damp squid, literally. All the Dalek threats erected in 'Dalek' are being cracked because they become quite pathetic. So many plot holes puzzle this episode, with typically poor contrivances. Daleks wants people to harvest Daleks, but then all continents evaporate? Dalek's can evaporate continents, but doesn't destroy the Tardis in space? The Tardis are now indestructible and can be found all over the country, even over people, so that they can be saved in it? This ability cannot be used to easily destroy the Dalek 'god'? The Daleks can evaporate the entire continent, but don't just satellite 5 to destroy the doctor, and let him play? The doctor is a pathetic coward without the conviction of his actions after he exterminated his entire species to try to eliminate the Daleks? Aside from this and many other holes, we are treated to the lamest dues ex machina solution ever invented, along with a near useless storybook. <br /> <br /> So what can we say about the new range, all-in-all? <br /> <br /> Would it be a second series if it were anything other than Doctor Who, with RTD behind it? Would most episodes be seen as anything but non-original and forgotten, if they were anything other than Doctor Who, and attached RTD's name? I don't think so. <br /> <br /> Some people will think we can't say anything about RTD, as we are guilty of bringing Doctor Wie back to our screens. However, this is at the expense of good characters and stories. Personally, I would rather not have a poorly planned, poorly-pregnant product, which is eliminated at that price. I'd rather wait for someone to come together and make a real effort. For the most part, it's the kind of puerile rubbish that SF gives a bad name, and it's different from the most creative genre.
