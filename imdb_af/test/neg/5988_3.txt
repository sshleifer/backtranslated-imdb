SHRIEKER is a full moon production. I knew what to expect (very little quality), but I didn't expect it to be as painful as SHRIEKER was looking at. <br /> <br /> It's just awful. Bad acting, confusing writing and direction. Annoying characters I wanted to kill. The whole thing was probably made in one week. I saw CHARMED episodes that were more complex and convincing than these cheapest. <br /> <br /> It has the look and feel of an orphan episode of a bad pregnant TV series that no one has ever seen. It was a task to watch and I could dream and feel dimmer. Watching a movie shouldn't be so much hard work.
