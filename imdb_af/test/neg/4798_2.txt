Just seen Coronado. Here's the only line they've gained to sell it, "" from the FX team behind Independence Day ". I think it says a lot. No one talks about writers, directors, actors. <br /> <br /> It's a cute adventure story that takes place in a banana republic in Mid America, but the storyline is thin. <br /> <br /> All the Through the movie I thought of how much this movie looks like the cuts of an action computer war game. Although the FXs are nice, they are too often visible. Much like the cutting scenes in CG styles such as Command'n'Conquer. <br /> <br /> You know almost immediately that that particular truck, background, bridge, castle or jet fighter never existed. The look is smooth and nice, but not the standard we expected from Action Adventures today. The film lacks many obvious on-site filming. <br /> <br /> The acting, storyline is below average and the FX's are nice but not movie standard. I'm not surprised, this thing is straight to video / DVD. <br /> <br />
