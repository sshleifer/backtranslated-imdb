OK if you are looking for a fun lesbian skirt. This is NOT the movie If you are looking for a fun movie with hot sociopathic characters (in the delusion of "cruel intentions" or "wild things"), it is NOT the movie if you are looking for a classic vampire - lesbian seductress movie. This is NOT the movie. <br /> <br /> But if you want to flush an hour of your life, it's your movie. It was poorly written, poorly directed, poorly screened, poorly filmed. It had bad special effects ... I mean very bad special effects. I think you can actually generate the same special effects in Imovie lol. <br /> <br /> THIS IS A LOT OF BADFILIE. <br /> <br /> The actors were classic star beauties, but looked more like porn stars. It is shot like a soft core porn, but you never get the shot and the actors all seem bored from their brains. the 'girl on girl' scenes, sucking btw, was so lame that there was almost nothing worth it. look at the 'almost sex scenes' on youtube cos, that's the only reason you want to see this movie and not even worth it. <br /> <br /> A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME !!! Don't first pick it up, look at 'Cruel Intentions 2' instead - the same movie without the bad special effects, bad storyline, bad writing, bad dialogue and bad acting. I can actually look now, just to purify my mind
