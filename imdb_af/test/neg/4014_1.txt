I first saw the minimum wage section, but I'm not going to look at the others, how can that be? Morgan began to argue about his terrible situation, which at the beginning of the episode was living on minimum wages and the complaint never stopped. Ever. Fortunately for the viewer, his slim girl is just as annoying as Morgan (if not even more annoying). <br /> <br /> And that's all, they go to the movie and buy bottled water for 2.50 and then go to a restaurant to eat out all the time if they obviously * complain that they is poor. <br /> <br /> I don't care if the other episodes are better than this. No one should be forced to watch this crap.
