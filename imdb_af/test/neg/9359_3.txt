I heard good things about "State of Grace" and came in with an open mind. I thought "God's army" was good, and I thought maybe Dutcher had improved as a movie maker. The movie started with a few shaky plays, and I thought, "Well, maybe it'll get better." Unfortunately, it never did. The picture starts by setting up two elders - Mormon missionaries - and the audience seems to know them and grows to care for them. Instead, the story degenerates into a highly unlikely series of unfortunate events that highlight blatant disobedience of the missionaries (something unthinkable, but rarely at the level depicted by Dutcher) and it is almost laughing. <br /> <br /> Dutcher's only Success in this movie is his successful alienation from his target audience. By depicting unrealistic and inaccurate the lives of Mormon missionaries, Dutcher achieved nothing more than to anger his dominant Mormon audience. The movie does not in any way reflect reality. Assignments are nothing like Dutcher's point (I myself served a Mormon mission), and gang life in California certainly contains much more explicit language than the occasional gentle vulgarity. The conclusion I think it was supposed to touch and inspire the audience to believe that forgiveness is available to everyone. It was both incredible. It's the whole mission to see that this parent is sent home. And the mother and the girl stand right next to each other!) And cheesy. Next time, Dutcher, try to make a movie to identify.
