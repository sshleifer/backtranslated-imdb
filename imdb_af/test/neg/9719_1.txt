OK ... before I even start the more or less constructive criticism of the movie, I would like to say a few words that come out of the heart ... This movie comes out !!!! Don't go see it unless you really like SWEATY BOY BANDS and WOODEN-ACTIVE, NO-PLOT STORIES. Let's go to why I think the movie is so bad: 1. There is no story line. There is no plot. The director tried to create a mystery. The feeling was just not there. 2. The whole thing looks like a big, hour and a half promotion for a kind of goth-wanna-be-but-still-looking-like - "BSB" band ... All the guys in school are perfect abs, no fat or ugly young people ... there's not a pretty girl in the movie either, not one. The main character is either wet in the pool, or everyone sweats in his bed ... poor guy. Must be awful to swear on such a day. 3. Can the guys do something good with their powers? Anything good? Keep the fire in the old barn or help his friend who came in the accident instead of just breaking around and showing things to each other. 4. Woodworking. The main character has only two expressions on his face. Expression number one: sad. Expression number two: try to look seductive, but still look sad ... In that boy there are 4 guys: The capital, his best friend who came in the accident, the blondie and the fourth one ... what was the name of the fourth? I think he only spoke twice in the whole movie: once in the beginning (he said the jump of the cliff with the power won't kill them) and the second time at the end when he and the blondie the girl lost. The movie could have been without him and no one would notice. Anyway, my pronunciation: 1 is the perfect score for this movie. Boys - don't go to see it. There is very little action, no tension, no hot girls. Girls - at least the actors are looking for ... What I recommend is to get a sound of this movie - that's the only thing I like about it.
