This horror story takes place in the Namib desert of Africa. A Canadian system analyst, Zach Straker (Scott Bairstow), is being sent on a job for a diamond mining company. Although he hates fieldwork, he finds himself in a truck with a rescue unit in the open desert that blows sand flies and whips, sand. Four diamond prospectors are found. Well, what remains of their scattered legs is discovered. During a long cold desert evening, a form-shifting monster makes its appearance. Zach and his colleagues are terrified when their truck is stranded and members of the unit die terribly one by one. There is no character development; let alone dialogue to speak of. The desert that is in its own way is beautiful and without giving away. The creature is as old as the desert sand. Also in the cast are: Rachel Shelley, Warrick Grier and Patrick Shai.
