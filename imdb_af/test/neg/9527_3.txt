The story, as I understand, is "based on real events." It can be good or bad, depending on the type of license that is taken with the actual events and how it is delivered. <br /> <br /> In this case, the results are enough to make a gag. I didn't expect much to go in - a story of rich high school children who are going to take an ocean ride under a hitchhiker. That's what I figured out was a come-of-the-old movie about something about a boat camp or basic training, the kind in which the breast Sergeant says: "My duty is to get you out of your overwhelming civilian ways to cut. " Well, that's it, somehow. The children start out as children and end up as an organic group. But it's a lot of fun than any boat camp movie I've ever seen outside of a deliberate comedy. Who did this thing? The air is filled with slogans that belong, not in high school, but in the third grade. The dialogue obstructs the ear. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges usually does better than average work, but his performance is mediocre. He does not add anything to the part, although he has given his lines, it is difficult to know how much he can do with it. The rest of the cast is indifferent and some of the children are painfully inadequate. There is a lot of tearing and a lot of crying. The best scene involves a dolphin. <br /> <br /> The immature clich√©s remain until the end. The Coast Guard is thrown into the trial of the fierce court following the disaster. The interrogator does nothing except Bridges over the head with his misinterpretations and misconceptions of events. "You made the crew drink alcohol, didn't you?" (A few harmless drinks.) "And you didn't punish them, even though you punished them for killing a fish." (The dolphin business.) The technical details of the sink are left behind. What is a white squall anyway? And if it's as dangerous as Bridges claims, why wasn't the whole crew warned and wearing blazers? But why continue? If the "Albatros" was a Dreadnaught, it would still be torpedoed and sank by the ridiculous comic book.
