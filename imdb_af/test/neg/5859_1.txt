I turned it around for about 50 minutes! Whoever was the moron who decided to steal the idea of ​​Koushun Takami's book (Battle Royal) and make it into a pathetic reality TV scenario deserves to shoot! <br /> <br /> That has made the movie industry a good turn. Now, directors like William Malone (Fear Dot Com) can say, "Well, it's better than Series 7". This piece of Crap & Dracula 3000 band is the first place in the worst 100 movies ever made! <br /> <br /> Be warned, this is not a bad thing! <br /> <br /> It's a shame for filmmakers everywhere! <br /> <br /> Never see this movie!
