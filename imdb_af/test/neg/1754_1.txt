Another frustration of Anthony Minghella, which seems to have thrived on these huge inflated super productions, takes more than two and a half hours to do what a reasonable movie maker would do in about 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The story centers at Inman (a summer ambulance Jude Law), which goes to the Civil War, have just barely started with some kind of romance with Nicole Kidman, a Preacher's Daughter recently in the beautiful photographed backwater village arrived. The story cuts back and forth between Inman's trials and tribulations in war (which is guessing what boys and girls? HELL !!) and Kidman's trials and tribulations at home (which is highly predictable, is incredibly boring). Ren√© Zellwegger appears on Kidman's farm to help Kidman get it back in shape after Kidman's holy daddy dies of Uncomfortable Character Disease. Zellwegger is all acting in Granny Clampett, acting in a cute and deceptive manner, and gives enough difficult love and home understanding. To turn the stomach of even the hardest viewer of Touched By An Angel. <br /> <br /> This movie is simple, ominous. Avoid it like the big-blown Oscar-bait Bogus Pretentious Literary Adaptation nonsense it is.
