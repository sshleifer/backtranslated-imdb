*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Some bushes African-Hillbilly species are in the desert looking for Diamonds when they find a hard hill in the middle of a sandy desert area. Spoilers: The dumb one starts with a pick with the hill and breaks it open. Then he looked into the hole and stuck his head in and surprised! something eat him. The other two dimwits are not seen alive again. Scott Bairstow looks like a Pizza Delivery boy, but he plays a kind of expert scientist with a medical grade (which means he's about 35 years old). Bairstow is supposed to join Camp C and help them find diamonds. The truck that picks up Bairstow to take him to Camp C has a handful of strangers who usually populate movies like "PITCH BLACK" THE THING, and so on. The truck came over the first truck to drive and they decided to investigate (how did the truck not see the other truck when they were driving to pick up Bairstow because they were on the same road?). So they find the eaten bodies, and there are some decent special effects associated with legs with small pieces of meat on them. The main madman in the group, Karl, decides to find the killer. So follows the truck in the desert after a few songs, and eventually it has an electric short and the crew is stuck in the desert. The dumbest man in this group picked up a bunch of legs with his jacket to carry them around. If he wears a nap (with the same jacket), the creatures eat alive, and another man walks over and puts his arm in the goo and that dummy also loses his arm. Sounds exciting so far, except that a few minutes later, Dr. Bairstow says the creature is actually hundreds of thousands of ants that use the bones to hold each other together so they can travel to a new hive (because the miners have torn open the old hive). Now, the last time I checked, ants could move on their own without killing people to use their legs for structure. If all they needed was a bit difficult, they could put a lot of sticks together and use them to create a shape. The whole story is really stupid, and the ant explanation is the only one given. The rest of the movie is just about the group killed until they find the new ant and kill the ant brain (kind of) and then the hundreds of thousands of ants move away on their own Betty feet. An extra ant brain was found (camera off) and sent back for analysis, creating a reason for a successor.
