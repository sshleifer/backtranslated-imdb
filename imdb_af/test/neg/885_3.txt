I like all kinds of movies, so it's not a bash on romantic movies from a guy just from the Matrix. Don't like it. <br /> <br /> I just felt it was a lousy movie. I didn't feel that there was enough character to fall in love with the characters. They were there for a few days and while dealing with a serious hurricane and big problems in each of their lives, Richard Gere and Diane Lane fell hopelessly and helplessly in love? It's not realistic. This movie didn't make me buy and I feel emotional and that's something you're looking for in a good plot. Some emotional connection. If anyone can tell it, it falls in love quickly, without any real substance, if so. You are not right or wrong. Different strokes for different people. <br /> <br /> Another very amazing component of the movie was Diane Lane's very rude teenage girl, who became fun and sympathetic at the end of the movie. Is a teenage girl who is so miserable and aggravating with her mother not to come back with her cheater, just go on a switch and be nice? This movie, in a nutshell, had some big names, but for me it was a big disappointment.
