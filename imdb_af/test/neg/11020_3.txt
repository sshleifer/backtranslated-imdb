After watching the TV ads for this movie, I rushed to my local theater and laughed a lot. In the end, it was one of the longest 90 minutes I've ever spent. The Wog Boy really didn't give a story line with enough dust to keep my interest and predictable and sometimes tasteless jokes didn't fill this gap. <br /> <br /> A scenario where the two 'Wog Boys' dance floor of their local nightclub was the only one that impressed me. The only character worth watching was "Nathan," played by The Castle's Stephen Curry. His struggle with the opposite sex offers most of the few laughs. <br /> <br /> A word for this movie is boring. Save yourself the time and just look at the TV commercial as the only laugh shown.
