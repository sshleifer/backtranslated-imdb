Although this series and the mini-movie in particular were very important at the time of release, I feel that the series as a whole is actually pretty poorly written with a poor role. The issues at heart are portrayed very well, but it is difficult to relate and understand the problems within the movie when the play and writing are not convincing enough (especially if you watch the mini-movie). <br /> <br /> I also don't think this mini-movie or series was the test of time, as many of the screens are pretty nice. The issues are still important, but Boys From The Blackstuff cannot fully help the cause of the problems in Britain in the 1980s.
