Taylor Deemer Mrs Drake English 10 PIB B4 March 31, 2010 <br /> <br /> A Shot in the Dark <br /> <br /> It's hard to make it through the movie Heart of Darkness because it's incredibly unaware. The book on which this movie is based has little action to start with. So, the thought of making it into a movie looks like a totally awkward idea anyway, and basically this ensures a failure. <br /> <br /> Most of the book is from the mental journey of a young sailor named Marlow at work through the many darknesses of the Congo and people as a whole. I feel that the scriptwriter has largely failed the essence of Marlow's travels. It missed the biggest problem of light versus darkness. This is the most important point in the book and when it is not translated, everything that remains is 100 minutes of boredom and monotony. <br /> <br /> That's the case, the question is asked, why would anyone make it in a movie? An even better question can be asked, who will want to see it? It is quite a task to look at. If it did not contribute to a degree in my English class, I would never have considered watching the movie. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. The heart of darkness is deprived of all its insight and meaning when taken from the pages of the book. The novella is torture to read until the last twenty pages or so, but the thought is that it is a pretty decent book. The movie is like a shot in the dark with no chance in the world to hit its target. <br /> <br /> How can a book about the mental processes and the realization of darkness be portrayed in physical, visual sense? I feel it is impossible to accurately show thoughts. Also, I feel like the time difference between the book and the movie creates important points that do not add up. The novel Heart of Darkness was published in 1902, while the movie version of Heart of Darkness is from 1993. The 91 years between the two can be a reason for the seemingly different sites. The novella looks much harder, and the film does not represent the prehistoric feeling of the Congo. The Congo, in the movie, looks like another place, not the dark, inhuman place where the book conceals this institution. I feel that it removes another important element that really contributes to the novella. <br /> <br /> With two of the biggest aspects of the storyline missing in the movie, the little decency is in the book Heart of Darkness. is gone. When the controversy of light versus darkness is the biggest theme, it is not in the movie, it seems the whole movie will be incredibly useless and that is. It is boring, unaware, and a great waste of time. There is no reason to see it. The book is stripped of any meaning it has. If necessary, read the book for some reason. Avoid the movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> Cast and Credits Marlow: Tim Roth Kurtz: John Malkovich The Russian: Morten Faldaas The Intended: Phoebe Nicholls <br /> <br /> Targeted by: Nicolas Roeg Written by Benedict Fitzgerald, based on novella by Joseph Conrad Duration: 100 minutes Rated PG 13 (some sexuality and language)
