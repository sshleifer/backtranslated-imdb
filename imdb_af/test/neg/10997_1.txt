I saw it on cable. Someone had to lose their jobs to lighten this one for air. Just because a movie is made doesn't mean it should be shown! Savage Instinct must be displayed in ALL movie classes. It's the perfect template for not making a movie. The editing alone is so mumbled, you will think it is made up of a team of trained (weak) monkeys, moving across the unpaved canyon road in the back of a jeep, blindfolded and drunk. The sound is often not readable. Acting? I can't do anything I've seen here. Presentation? Hmmm. Can't name it either. Failure? It works. All that is said ... THIS IS HILARIOUS! I cannot stress enough that there is not one redeeming factor in this "movie", except the hilariousness derived from its own incredible inability. Fun, in a strictly masochistic manner. See it ... if you dare.
