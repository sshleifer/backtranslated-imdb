Back in the dark days of 1990, the hoped Heir at the Spielberg Throne (after the failure of suspected singer-child Phil Joanou) mistakenly believed he was pretentious Spielberg wannabe David Mickey Evans. Evans cursed the studios for over a million dollars. She sucked baby-boomer drivers to believe his script - a combination of nostalgic, 1960s references and a disturbing drama on child abuse. Somehow equal to good narration and a decent movie. <br /> <br /> As Rod Stewart once sang, "see how wrong you can be." <br /> <br /> But the beginner's artistic, "ET"-inspired writing convinced enough he was the next choice - the new Spielberg - and such an agreement was made not just to than 99 percent of the world's population will ever see in their lifetime, but also Evans to direct the film - even though he has never been in his life. <br /> <br /> Hey, how difficult can it be to be another movie genius? <br /> <br /> Two weeks into the shoot, Columbia invented. His daily newspapers were called "completely unusable" by the studio - or at least those that were enough not to be under the E.N.C. to fall. (Emperor's New Clothes) game. All his material was scrapped and recycled in guitar photos. <br /> <br /> So what is a studio to do after they have sunk 10 or 20 million dollars into something they still believed to represent the resurrection of Steven Spielberg? Rent Spielberg yourself to save the day? Columbia probably tried it. <br /> <br /> Type old Richard Donner. Hey, he can't be a movie, but he gets the job. "Superman" was not bad at all - and the first "Lethal Weapon" was pretty good. <br /> <br /> So Donner steps in and grabs the regressive reins. Fortunately, he is able to convince Columbia that the worst of the film's indifferent fantasy sequences - which played like a ten-year-old's acid journey - must go. Unfortunately, he left in the Crying Buffalo (ooh, how poetic) and the ridiculous, pseudo-Spielberg fantasy ending, completed with Clueless Mom perfect content for the rest of her life to get postcards of her missing son while in the world she surrounds around. red wagon. Right. <br /> <br /> But Donner managed to get a decent performance from Elijah Wood. And Lorraine Bracco as the Idiot mother was also not bad. Maybe Donner should be revalued. Maybe he's not such a foolish Hollywood hack as everyone has ever believed. <br /> <br /> The only reason I burn these overhangs is that someone is smart enough to get the big John Heard (but in the wrong part, of course). The kids do okay ... although Tom Hanks's horrible, excessive explanatory narrative almost destroys every scene. <br /> <br /> One can think that after the David Mickey Evanses and Phil Joanous and Troy Duffys of the world, the studios can eventually be wise. One can hope that this hype-driven movie debacle will never reveal the possibility of the Emperor's New Clothes Syndrome. <br /> <br /> Doubtful!
