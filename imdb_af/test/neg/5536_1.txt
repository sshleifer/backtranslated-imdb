So this ugly man ends up with long, nasty hair and his girlfriend in this house and they argue and argue about his old girlfriend. There was supposed to be something about it, but I didn't see anything at all. There has been mention of a devil from the sea, but it doesn't go away at all. I wish it did, because then it would have taken away the tension of the jealous love triangle. The title of the movie seems to be a frightening and exciting movie, but it's so far away from believing it. I waited and waited for it to end and was so happy when it did. It didn't live up to the title because it had to boo hoo hoo. The cover had a cool picture, but I shouldn't judge a cheese film.
