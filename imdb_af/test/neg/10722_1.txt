Part of the film's low rating is the emphasis on unemployment and the suffering we have to endure. While it's good for drama, in comedy, we know the pain it doesn't have to emphasize. Consequently, fun with Dick and Jane is not a suitable title and I was just disappointed not to play with Dick and Jane. It is true that it is a copy of the movie of the same name, but it fails on the performance and the title was not suitable for the story line. <br /> <br /> But if the movie is moved to be "The Art of Stall" and the emphasis on bungling slapstick comedy more take the robbery and the plans to steal (stupid of course) the movie would be a big boost. While at the same time showing the movie the chief executive at least initially that it is a rogue, it will be easier to address the pains early and just leave it. The movie suffers from a point of view problem and for that reason a comedy cannot work if the point of view is not properly done. A dizzying man character who is a Wile E. Coyote on the Road Runner will be more funny, including the slapstick comedy. But in this case, instead of catching the bird with complicated contractions, a stalk will be very funny here. I mean you can make a lot of this and put it in the movie. But since the point of view was wrong, the robbery had to be limited. <br /> <br /> You will enjoy the first 15 minutes of the movie (during Jim Carrey's great rise), but to make the trouble they had to experience To be more comical, as it is a comedy , this is the part that needs a major overhaul. It can be more difficult if there are more problems than John Travolta's Civil Action during the downfall. The movie was a serious one, but the problems they faced were somewhat comical.
