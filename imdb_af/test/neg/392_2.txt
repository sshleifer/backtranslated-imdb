Now I loved "Lethal Weapon" and "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", but I can't believe Shane Black wrote this stack ... or that David Morse and John C. McGinley are in it. I screened it for a movie festival. Awful. All layers. It is preachy and hard handed to not stupid. This is also surprising how little L.A. Cambodia looks. The whole idea of ​​time traveling through post-traumatic stress disorder is a bit stupid. Imagine "Born on the Fourth of July" mixed with "The Butterfly Effect 2" (I detained as the example to really show how bad this movie is) but directed by Michael Bay's 2nd unit director. So bad. The 2 stars are purely based on the production value.
