I have looked "lost" with the family since my first episode. It was cute. Last season it was very disappointing, they (writers) didn't seem to know what to do with the show, so they were trying to do it by stretching one storyline into a whole episode. The current season, which I decided at the time to watch just to see Rodrigo Santoro, and with a small hope that things will get better; was a disappointment after another; My husband and son even stopped watching. First, he (Santoro) only appears for 30 seconds in each episode. But the real problem is with the story line. There is nothing that really happens. Each episode can be displayed in 15 minutes. We look at each episode and wait for something that never happens; I do not ask that every secret be revealed immediately, but what about some variation in the story lines? In the first and second seasons we had different story lines, we saw the characters history, a small action, a little romance, now like one big event that reveals the whole episode. It's almost tired of seeing it, when it's done, you have the feeling that you've lost your time. Now it's important to note that the actors are still big. I can't believe they Eko (Adelawale) killed. He was wonderful, Jack (Mathew Fox) is still incredible, the perfect hero, so kind, big, brave. Sawyer (Josh Holloway), the "bad boy" is kind of mellowery because of Kate (Evangeline Lylli), but it's cool. I miss Sayid (Naveen Andrews), Sun and Jin (Yoon-jin Kim and Daniel Dae Kim), they are all an important part of the plot (or should be), but we barely see them. I hope Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro) will play a big role on the show; if not, why did you make so much of him at the show (Access Hollywood, etc.)? Sorry if I have rumbled too long, but I feel cheated by this show. When I started looking, it was fine, I was used to it and now it's very disappointing to see how it goes. I'll be here, hope for the improvements !!! Katia
