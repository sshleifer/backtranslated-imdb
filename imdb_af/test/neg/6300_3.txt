The costumes are shameful and the Australian foreign screens are fun to watch, but there is a head start on this story - an average rand - about drag queens. I especially noticed that in Terrence Stamp's character, "Ralph Bernadette Bassenger." Maybe it was appropriate, as there is no "good old" about Ralph-Bernadette and his group "queens". <br /> <br /> Once again we get the strong liberal slope that says anything and if you disagree - or in this case pro-homosexual, then you're a homophobe. (Gasp!) <br /> <br /> What is really worrying is the end when a young boy goes with his "alternative lifestyle" father and embraces his gay lifestyle, not because it fits the story, but because it fits on the agenda of the people who wrote the script. Lamentable.
