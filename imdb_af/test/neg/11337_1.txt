You thought of "Traumschiff Surprise" that the German comedy could not get worse? It can. This comedy is another attempt to avoid stereotypes of gay men who are masked as a nice comedy. The initial concept (openly gay men in soccer sport) would have been a great opportunity to erase stereotypes, but ... The actual intended message of the movie seems to be in what way gay men are so different from straight men. . Absolutely stupid, of course. Even gay sex is treated as less value than straight sex. This movie only tries to serve live audiences who want to laugh at stereotypical gay men. Well, don't waste your time on German comedy movies!
