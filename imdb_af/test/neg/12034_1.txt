I'm so glad he didn't live to see it. This movie is a disruption to his work. I agree with the other comment - this movie was a terrible disappointment. I'll give it a zero, but I'll give it a 1. <br /> <br /> The story was bad, and it reminded me of the days when I was a teenager trying to write a movie. look back and realize how terrible it was. Bad actors, family and friends, and someone who is dumb enough to fund it, was how it was made. It's really great how strings can be drawn to do something. If this movie made it to the general public, it puts a lot of hope on other Indie filmmakers who have talent worth fighting for! This movie made me laugh but for all the wrong reasons. At all accounts, it's not really meant to be a comedy. Scary movie is a better game on a horror genre - this movie just sucks.
