What can I say? After reading Herbert's books and having Lynch's movie, I was very disappointed. I felt I had a rejected version of Buck Rogers. The sets look like a remnant of a Star Wars TV special! I felt that the play was almost amateur. The costumes were curly and over done which gave it a 60s Flash Gordon pulp feel. The worms! They are supposed to be sandworms, yet they appeared to a large stalactite with a mouth at the blunt end. The effects in general were fairly second rate. I won't even start the shameful Navigator effect. <br /> <br /> This so-called Frank Herbert's Dune wasn't even true to his books! It had to be called "Frank Herbert's Dune - For Dummies". Key plot elements are omitted, names are changed and the whole "feel" of the story is "purified". I didn't even recognize the Harkonnens! In fact, most characters did not appear like Herbert's descriptions. I'm just getting upset just to remember what was a tragedy. I'm glad I couldn't stomach the second installment.
