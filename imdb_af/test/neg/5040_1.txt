I will not spoil your surprise by mentioning any of the terrified plot lines. I just want to say that this movie is suffering from poor animation, about acting, clear taglines ?? These are some of its good features. If you are deserted on a remote island and the only link to the civilization you get is this movie throws it for the fish. I can't tell you how sorry I saw this terrible horrible movie. To speak, of which this film is supposedly not a horror movie can be classified as such for the simple fact that the only horror in the movie is the playing ability of some of the actors. <br /> <br /> Be careful.
