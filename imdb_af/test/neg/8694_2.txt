It is difficult to compete against classic greatness, but once you make the choice and the decision is in the game, you need to get the best and brightest resources to keep your product sheet in the vanguard of quality. If you intend to pursue the second or third (or fourth) goal, why do we even try? Therefore, I wonder why this version of the Ten Commandments was written, produced and broadcast. I will ask the producers: "What did you think? Were you creating a projected deficit?" If the producers might think, "We want to examine this biblical story from a different point of view ..." Then I would say, "OK, I watched the show, now what is the point of view?" The starting point of this "possible perspective theory" unleashes me. I can usually watch programs, and (right or wrong) at least get a sense of what the creators are trying to achieve. Not so, here. I recognize names like "Robert Halmi" (the producer) and I can associate his work with an obvious product. Tin Man, Earthsea, Flash Gordon, Jason and the Argonauts. Low budget entertainment based on myth, history and comic book entertainment. A perfect genre for sci-fi channel. That's why I still have to ask Robert Halmi. "What was the point of these Ten Commandments, what do you think?" ???????? AFS
