I've watched a number of Wixel Pixel and Sub Rosa Filter movies over the past few weeks, and have found many to keep them. <br /> <br /> This SRE movie looks much less than any other I've seen. . Perhaps it's because it's a comedy / horror movie rather than straight horror, and maybe it's because the humor didn't work very well with me. <br /> <br /> It is a little less than seventy minutes long and the Credits begin as the last ten minutes start. There are some excerpts, goofs and behind the scenes that go on while those credits roll. <br /> <br /> SRE movies tend to be short, and tend to feel, despite it. It's no exception, with some scenes going too long. <br /> <br /> The story involves a poor child in Christmastown, California, picked up by all of his classmates. He stole one shoe and was unable to replace it. He was "Oneshoe McGroo". Due to an obsession with pirates, his parents gave him an eyelid with a Christmas tree placed on the eyepiece. <br /> <br /> Many of the classmates are killed, and the few who come together to decide what to do. They are counted one by one by McGroo, who storms to the sound of sledding bells that ring. <br /> <br /> The characters are almost all broad stereotypes, such as the nerd called Dorkus, etc. There is a strange scene in which a kinky couple has sex; the woman is handcuffed and blindfolded, the man carries a large paper of watermelon over his head. It reminded me of some of the strange sex scenes of director Rinse Dream. <br /> <br /> The picture quality is good, and there are many extras. But basically a pretty, silly movie. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, I think you can never have too much Christmas horror movies. Yet there are many other needy holidays.
