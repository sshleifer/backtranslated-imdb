This piece of garbage belongs in the basement of a little tired old house where it will never see the light of day. The only thing that was scared of this litter was the price of admission. I was just amused when the end credits started rolling and I was free to vacate the auditorium. Wearing an unmanned one; a complete waste of 1 and a half hours. When I die, I pray that I can come back as a ghost and give a fever on the moron that this gibberish wrote.
