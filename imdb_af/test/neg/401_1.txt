My wife and I watched it after DVR turned off Encore action this week. It must be the worst horror we've ever seen. Predictable dialogue (my wife and I guess the lines are spoken before them), hokey special effects, a script that drove all over the place. I think the worst part was the stereotyping of the different characters in the plot, not to mention the free sex scene between two of the young heroines in the movie. Neither of them has a purpose other than bald parts. of their anatomy for the cameras. This movie should be categorized as comedy, not horror, as the villains of the movie (spiders) stop motion are animated and not least credible. I can't say I would do a better job of making a movie myself, but it was very amateurish and not even a "B" movie, somewhere closer to a "d" movie or "f" if possible. I think even Science Fiction 3000 will have to hand this one over!
