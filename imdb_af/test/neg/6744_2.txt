To me it wasn't like GI Joe at all. When I looked at it as a child, I just didn't mind. In fact, the part I liked best about this one was the opening credits. They change so many facts around and also turn the story around. Cobra Commander is thought to be part of this stupid race of reptile people in Antarctica or somewhere frozen. Although I always thought he was a normal guy who, every time you saw his eyes in the series, they were surrounded by plain colored meat and not the blue was his face here. There is just too much shit in this one to try and make it a spectacular movie, but for me it just ruins what I watched the series for the first time.
