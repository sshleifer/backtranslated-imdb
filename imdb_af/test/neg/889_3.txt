I'm not sure why the producers need to trade in the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise, as the title suggests it's a successor to the first three movies. Although Marques Houston appeared in "HP3", he played a completely different character in this film (he was eight years old). Okay ... so Reid and Martin were not the most talented and couldn't carry a movie themselves. But to trade on the HP franchise, it seems to me that there might be some kind of referral (though minor) to the previous movies. I'm sure everyone who wanted to see it was "sophisticated" - thinking they see a sequel - not a completely different movie with a famous name. And I'm sorry ... Kym Whitley isn't funny and couldn't hold a cherry at the end of Robin Harris, Ketty Lester or DC Curry in the previous movies. Although Meagen Good and Mari Morrow are a significant visual distraction ... I have to give it a THUMBS DOWN! Just the name of the movie "Down to the Last Minute" would have been good. Furthermore, the Hudlin brothers (who produced the first three films) were not involved in making this movie.
