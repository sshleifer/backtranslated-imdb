Just a few words: this is a good thing. George A Romero is still among us. If he were dead, he would be forced to get out of the grave to vote against the people who made this "political satire". And the saddest thing about everyone is, I actually agree with these people's sentiments. Yes, there are zombies in it and they have a good reason to come back from outside the grave: to vote. Oh, and one of them ends the doctor from Startrek Voyager. It's about as scary as it gets, people. If you are looking for a horror movie, I suggest you keep looking. And if you're looking for a witty political satire, you're also in the wrong place and not just because this series of Masters of Horror is called. But don't let me hold you back: maybe you see something I missed. Though the chance is that you will waste your time with it, just as I have. Let's just say I prefer my zombie movies with the zombies in the camera.
