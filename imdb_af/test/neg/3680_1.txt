If they had a zero out of 10, I would have entered it. Everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves to take money from the public. I don't know how to release movies like this Video or Pay Channel. I'm disappointed in Vincent Gallo. Val Kilmer was there about 8 minutes, so I can't hurt him. Just the person who listed him to be the star in it. It's like Marlon Brando in Superman. There is no plot except that Gallo is looking and finding his friend in the catacombs. Why they are looking for the gates of hell knows only the director. They must be kept out of this movie in Moscow and burn it for fire to keep all homeless extras warm for the night. There is nothing more to say about this film that all the other reviewers have written. I wish I could forget this movie that hurt my brain.
