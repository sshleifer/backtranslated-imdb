Apart from the beautiful images, thanks to the movie Alun Bollinger of New Zealand, this film is not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The storyline is so fragmented and lost that it's hard to know what's going on at any given time, and just when you think you're following, change direction, like a lost two-polar puppy. <br /> <br /> The musical score is awful, and too much on extremely emotional pieces trying to force the audience. to feel a certain way, as if the instruments were acting like an emotional ride? 'feel sad here'; 'feel shocked' here; "feel scared here." In addition, the repetitive samples over and over leave the audience on the edge of the laugh. <br /> <br /> Are the days of silent film, where musical instruments are the only portrayal of voice? but you will not think so when you look at the Queen. <br /> <br /> The voice ear was so overused that you wonder if this movie actually needs any accompanying images. It could easily have been a radio play, but even then it would be difficult to follow the story. <br /> <br /> And the stolen ideas of Jane Campion's The Piano are too obvious to watch. Not only are the beach and forest shots almost identical to those in The Piano ?? Maybe some of these come to Alun Bollinger's camera working on the latter? But the voice-over feel and levels are also strikingly close. And who can forget when Holly Hunter's character cut her wings in the shape of her finger cut off by Sam Neill. Does this remind you when Wiremu amputates his 'quick finger', and surprisingly also with an ax? I thought so. <br /> <br /> All in all, I can't recommend this movie unless you wear a pair of earrings and just keep in mind with the scenery.
