Everything that made the original so much fun looks absent here. It's simply a "run of the mill demons on the loose wrecking havoc" but without the passion that the original gift has. <br /> <br /> There is nothing new in the story. They seem to be the first one altogether. Here, the demons run loose in a high security apartment building and, of course, kill most of the residents in a foolish way. The makeup effects actually seem less convincing than the first. Although the actors were not really brilliant in Demons, they are actually much worse. You don't care about these characters. The plot is non-existent, the music arm (apart from one Simon Boswell song), it is not at least frightening; It's just not that good. <br /> <br /> Easy movie Dario Argento is also involved with Lamberto Bava (Bava has a comedy in this movie, not a very funny one). <br /> <br /> Perhaps 3 is too high a score, but at least I could see everything and didn't think to stop halfway. My advice; Stick to the original.
