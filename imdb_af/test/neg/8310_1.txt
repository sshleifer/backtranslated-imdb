Bay Area residents probably remember Paul of The Diamond Center, a luxury late night huckster who played easy credit and cheap rocks on late night television in the 1980s and early 90s. I just call him because there is an actor in Death Machines who seems to be the owner of an Italian restaurant. He appears in the best scene in this positive, terrible and near-unshakable crime drama about a dragon lady (Mari Honjo, who wisely hanged her actors after completing this movie) controlling the local syndicate. Our hero (we don't call him Paul From the Diamond Center) plays the restorer with all the subtleties of The Simpsons' Luigi ("you like da spaghetti?") And looks unobstructed when one of his customers complains about the food. No, there is no fly in the soup or hair in the sauce: there is a Red Buddha in the pasta, the calling card of the murderous crime boss, who sends a figurine to each of her prospective victims. Dead machines are bad by any measure, and pretty boring, which is an even worse crime.
