American Graffiti is one of the best movies ever made. I've seen it at least 30 times and I'm being emotionally touched by it every time I see it. (I graduated from high school in 1962.) <br /> <br /> More American graffiti is one of the worst movies ever made. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe if anyone who was involved with the big original movie was involved in this terrible sequel. The part of the film in Vietnam was extremely inaccurate. (I served in Vietnam for 18 months with the 101st Airborne Division.) <br /> <br /> The whole movie has nothing to do with any part of it. <br /> <br /> If anyone ever wants to make a case Against the deterioration of movies, more American graffiti would be the first example of what can go wrong.
