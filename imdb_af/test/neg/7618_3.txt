I once saw this movie, and was interested in seeing the whole thing just to see why the critics gave it two stars, so I agree. Basically, the film begins with Kermit the Frog (Steve Whitmire) who tells all of his Muppet chums that they have lost everything, and he ends up sitting depressed (and possibly thinking suicide) on the bank. Meanwhile, Angel Daniel (David Arquette, who was already in space from the Muppets) in another world (Heaven) visited the "Boss" (Whoopi Goldberg, another reason I wanted to see the movie) that Kermit really needs help. In the flashback, Kermit, Miss Piggy (Eric Jacobson, not the original and better Frank Oz), Gonzo (Dave Goelz), Fozzie Bear (also Jacobson), Pepe the Prawn (Bill Barretta) and all the other Muppets show off stage show for many people to see in the Christmas holidays, and it looks good. But the really mean Rachel Bitterman (Joan Cusack) is determined to end the show or the theater, and Kermit does everything possible to make sure it doesn't happen. Of course, Kermit failed the last time, and Bitterman told him they were finished and she could officially take the theater. This is where Daniel is sent as Kermit's guardian angel to help him, but Kermit is not in the mood and eventually ends with "I wish I was never born". Of course, you can recognize the spoof of a wonderful life, with Kermit as George Bailey and Cusack as Mr. Potter. In the end, of course, Kermit realizes how much he means to everyone, and goes back to find the theater. saved as historical landmark. Also the lead role of Whitmire as Rizzo the Rat and Beaker; Goelz as dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Waldorf; Barretta as dr. Teeth, Rowlf the Dog and Swedish Chef; Jacobson as Animal and Yoda (the only character that sounds like Oz's version), William H. Macy as Glenn, Matthew Lillard as Luc Fromage, Carson Daly, Molly Shannon; Scrubs's Zach Braff, Sarah Chalke, Neil Flynn, John C. McGinley and Judy Reyes, Mel Brooks as Joe Snow; Brian Henson as Scooter and Janice; Jerry Nelson as Robin the Frog, Statler, Pops and Floyd Pepper, and Kevin Clash as Sam the Eagle. The most memorable moment for me is the stage pod of Moulin Rouge, except that and the familiar faces in it, not great. It was the Emmy for Outstanding Music and Lyrics for the song "Everyone Matters". The Muppets were number 47 on The 100 Great Pop Pop Culture Icons. Sufficient!
