It must be the worst movie I've ever seen. The part where they lost daughter? With the Poltergeist overtime rip off? just push it over the edge with stupidity. I watched it on display so it still had the cheese's soft porn scenes in it. I must say I made my ass laugh. The 80's 3D effects were out of place. Includes an invisible cat and a revolving vortex. Wow I wonder if the people who made it are actually fulfilled in life. The actress who plays the woman seems familiar, but sucks anyway. Her scream can be used as a torture device in hell for more than retired Nazis. Anyways thanks showtime for the super crappy horror movie. I will always enjoy the time I watched most of the time and money I have ever seen.
