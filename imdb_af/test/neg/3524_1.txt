What can I say? It was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life (and believe me, some of my favorite movies are terrible). The act was amateurish, the sets were boring, and the camera work was slim and sophomoric. This whole movie looks like a college final project. I had to convince myself that it was done by a teenager to make it look a little good. The most disturbing factor of the "movie" is that it is not even film at all - it is shot on video. It was extremely distracting. In addition, the dialogue is just disastrous and the plot line is so basic that it makes my eyes water. Not to mention, they steal from at least four other horror movies in the first 20 minutes or so. If there is such a thing as zero stars, this movie will get it. <br /> <br /> The only thing scary about this movie is how bad it is.
