I really enjoyed the movie. It was really cute. (They destroy the villain with hairdryers - but where are they plugged in?) But it's a unique movie, and I enjoyed Courtney Draper and Tamara Hope. I also enjoyed Fanuel (but you write it ...), like Megan's charecter, because she called him a dweeb. Except for the acting, the "rewinding" and showing on Ariel's and then Megan's point of view was very interesting. I saw it twice and I will see it again
