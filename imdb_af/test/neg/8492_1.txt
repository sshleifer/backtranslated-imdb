My wife got tickets for our family to attend the premier of this movie of her employer for free. I only regret the price of the popcorn and the two hours of my life wasted on this garbage film. <br /> <br /> I own the DVD of the original Mask, and enjoyed it very much. I didn't expect a remake anywhere near the original in production values ​​or writing. But was not prepared for this vulgar pile of waste. Poor behavior, poor plot, a bad CGI baby leaving gas and urinating in the hyper "mask mode". A woman turned into a giant nose, made mucus. Fun huh? My eight-year-old son loves movies like Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and Star Wars. After it was over, I asked him what he thought. His exact words; "I hated it. It's like the Scooby Doo movie. They take something good and have to bring all those brutal stuff." My twelve-year-old daughter and wife also hated it. My wife later told me that my son asked her twice if we could leave. He never did it. I'm proud of him. You think I'm a kind of puritan, of the groans, and the lack of laughter I've heard in the theater, I think most of the customers agreed with me. <br /> <br /> This movie represents everything bad about children's entertainment today, and any positive reviews should be from people financially related to the film.
