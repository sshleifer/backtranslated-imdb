Larry Bishop, the Author / Actor / Director, focuses too much on camera, music and visual. The film overshoots meaningless ramblings and vulgar monologues, which have nothing but boring and annoying to the audience. The actors experience a bumpy ride, from the movie's start, and are trapped in a horrible smoke screen. Hell with the ride. The movie is a bomb. <br /> <br /> The victors are presented as weathered vigilantes, seeking their own form of justice for what they consider lawless. They are cyclists, anti-heroes and protagonists. Pistolero, played by Larry Bishop, is the vengeance leader of the suit. The Ghent (Michael Madsen) is trapped in his own crossfire of chaos and psychosis. <br /> <br /> Comanche (Eric Balfour) is loyal but secretive. Deuce, performed by David Carradine, had to pass on the ride, and so the ticket buyers (if you decide to watch the movie, you will be sorry but you will find out why). Billy Wings (Vinnie Jones) is a vibrant and poisonous character, completely filled with contempt. <br /> <br /> What puzzles are how this movie, with all its constant ramblings and vulgarity, ever cares for someone in a journey that is absolutely not going anywhere. Ticket buyers, take my advice: don't pay for the ride. Please do not make the same mistake as the investors. <br /> <br /> The first fifteen minutes, or so, of the movie is confusing and incomprehensible. The dialogue, which changes rapidly into meaningless monologues, makes no sense. The whole movie is hell bent to go nowhere. Poor Dennis Hopper was caught in the middle of a real mess. He also had to pass the ride. There are constricted heads, cut throat, and naked women struggle. Obviously, Bishop doesn't know where he's going with the movie. He is completely lost. But by the end of the ride, you just won't give a damn. Mama Mia! Stay home. And anyway, don't take the ride. I rate this movie a 1 out of 10, but this movie is so terrible that it gets zero.
