I just looked at The Edge of Love (incidentally, this is one of the worst titles so far this year) and it feels like a task. Watching Keira Knightly's unlikely skeletal character, made me even more in the rough of the movie. <br /> <br /> It took me four nights to see it, it was so boring. The only good thing about it was Cillian Murphy. He is always good / credible and has been seriously watched in many films. However, it just wasn't good enough for him. <br /> <br /> Apart from the unfair characters, boring storyline, the plot was also emotionally unsatisfactory. I felt like I was spending my time watching it (what I did). I had to do the smart thing and shut it down, but I kept it out of respect for Cillian Murphy and the great cinematography.
