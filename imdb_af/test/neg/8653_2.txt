I had some expectations of this movie because 1. It was a Yash raj production. 2. When the songs were first shown on the TV, they looked nice. 3. The stars (?!) Roll was new. Well, I have to tell you that I just couldn't sit through this movie. Uday (with his red lips - what were the makeup artists thinking?) Try hard to look cool, but fail. I won't even start on his play (if you can call it). 'Cleavage Queen' Tanisha with all her screaming and ranting a raving just makes you want to pull your hair in frustration. I think Uday was slightly more tolerant than her! She must take acting lessons from her sister. The story is pathetic ... the same old proven formula. Absolutely no originality. There is nothing worthy of watching in this movie. Make me wonder why it was made in the first place!
