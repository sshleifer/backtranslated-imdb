Alexandra Maria Lara: A very beautiful and seductive woman, but not a good actress. In all the movies I saw her, it seems to me the same character. Whether it is in the descent, nackt, vom souks, LOVE and now WO IST FRED! She is always (playing?) The young, kind-hearted woman, who is a little naive and does not know how to handle the things that happen to her. She has a repertoire of probably five different facial expressions that she works abundantly. Personally, I have a hard time believing that she can play a mysterious and somewhat stingy character because it is not. So she's like a pretty girl next door, what she is, but like a sniff, when it comes to acting. Til Schweiger: Same thing! The movie: Straight stupid. If it was an American movie, it would have been a huge role for Adam Sandler, which I also dislike. I was not insulted by the fact that it is a movie with the disabled. I just thought the jokes that came out of it were not funny at all. I visited twice or three times, but when I was halfway through, I was just bored and irritated and wanted to end this movie.
