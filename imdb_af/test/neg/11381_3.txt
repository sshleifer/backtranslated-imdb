"Ghost Son" is Lamberto Bava's best movie and at the same time his worst movie. I suppose the statement requires some clarification. It's best because it's well-targeted, ambitious, accessible and very stylish, but its worst because it's a dull, inexplicable movie and undoubtedly a big fall for all true fans of Bava's previous efforts. Let's look at it: many fans, which I definitely included, would not have been interested in this movie that is judged by the plot, the famous names attached to it and even the boring sounding title. The only motivation here was Lamberto Bava, who in the past brought us huge amounts of complicated Gialli and fun movies. "Ghost Son" is a bit of his comeback movie, along with The Torturer, and although the latter is definitely not a good movie, it at least lives up to its fans' expectations, with an excessive amount of dull, blood and sadism . "Ghost Son" is a poor and unbearable soft horror movie, even in terms of mainstream ghost stories. The emphasis is too much on sentimentality, and this affects the already limited number of terrible and terrible atmospheric moments. The basic premise may have one or two potentially good ideas, but the movie is totally dull and clumsy. John Hannah and Laura Harring star as a happy couple, living on a remote farm in South Africa and breeding horses for a living. The joy and happiness can't possibly improve, so of course something tragically bound to happen, and doing it. Mark dies in a car accident, but the indisputable Stacey stays with the farm where she is in constant contact with Mark's spirit. She even gets pregnant with his child, but shortly after baby's birth Martin's mysterious events occur. Mark's restless and selfish ghost seems to have the baby and uses him to encourage Stacy to commit suicide. With all the focus on the couple's relationship, many of the events and subplots are underdeveloped and / or inexplicable, such as the whole background of the young girl Thandi. There is too little action and the only real scare moments are also borrowed from classic movies like "The Exorcist" and "Rosemary's Baby". Pure talk in terms of horrible entertainment "Ghost Son" is a painful burnout, but it has to be said, it's a beautiful and enchanting failure. The cinematography is extremely elegant and many camera angles are really inventive and suggestive. The tuning score sometimes even succeeds in creating an ominous atmosphere, though nothing is important to the screen. There are several beautiful images of South African wildlife to admire, but if that interests you, you'd better consider National Geographic. Not much to recommend here. Fans of atmospheric ghost stories have much better options to choose from and the tough Bava fanatics are advised to watch (Demonstrate), "Macabre" or "Blade in the Dark".
