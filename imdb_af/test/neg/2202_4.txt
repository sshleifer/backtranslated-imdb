Okay ... she was on the boat with the man, realizing he was dead to kill her, knocking him out and then he found the reason why he was coming from her, this disk was killed by her colleague. So what will any rational person do? Maybe he is holding his head again to make sure he's really out? Tie him up? Look, Sandra, honey, you have the chance to escape while the man is just as tall. Until you know how long it will take you to escape, make sure he can't get behind you. I hate these stupid women victim roles. The rest of the movie was just a series of twists and turns that were completely stunned and unbelievable to stay interesting.
