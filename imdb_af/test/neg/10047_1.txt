This failed satire or commentary on the human condition has easily earned a place as one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen. I am seriously considering buying a copy if I can find one inexpensive cheap to drive away unwanted company. It's honestly so bad. I regard this as a kind of anti-personnel weapon. If you are the kind of person who just needs to see a train wreck to witness the massacre, then this movie is a jewel. Just to be honest, Kelsey Grammar's character has one line that almost works, but not really. Otherwise, try everything in this movie insightful, but miss the point about the distance between the Earth and the nearest colliding galaxies. I can usually appreciate a book or movie where the main character of a kind of existential fear suffers, but the anxiety presented here is so incredible and on top, and the film does not even address the nonsense it does in any valuable way on offer. If you are familiar with the term "word lift", you might get a picture of the film expertise. Oh, and the narrative structure is ill-conceived, pretentious and amateur. It failed on both style and fabric. If you really hate someone, they invite a dual feature of this movie and "The Terror of Tiny Town", a Midget Western from the 1930s, and put them in the constraints with their eyes open to a Clockwork Orange style. But this is likely to violate some of the Geneva conventions.
