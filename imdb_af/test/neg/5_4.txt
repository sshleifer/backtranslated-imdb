I wish I knew what to do about such a movie. It seems to be divided into two parts - action sequences and personal dramas ashore. It follows Ashton Kutsher through survival swim school, led by master head Kevin Costner, then to Alaska where some spectacular rescues take place, the latter leading to death. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the screens on the beach have struck me so stereotypically in so many ways that they have to be a hiding place. A typical bar room fights between Navy Guards and Puddle Pirates. The experienced old timer, Costner, who is an elderly bar mixer, says to him: "Married to the coastguard." The older head "trying to prove himself to be nineteen." The neglected ex-wife on shore to whom Kostner paid a farewell visit. The seemingly sadistic demands placed on the swimmers by the instructors, all in the pursuit of a higher goal. The gifted young man had a turbulent strife. <br /> <br /> The problem is that we've seen it before. If it's Kevin Costner here, it's Clint Eastwood or John Wayne or Lou Gosset Jr. or Vigo Mortenson or Robert DeNiro elsewhere. And the climate scene has elements that are outrageously drawn from "The Perfect Storm" and "Dead Calm." Neither is fresh and none of the old stereotype characters and situations are handled with any originality. <br /> <br /> It works best as a kind of documentary version of what goes on in the swimmer's school and what can happen next and even that is a bit poor because we don't get much in the way of education . It is especially a personal conflict, romance and tension to wash out. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the U.S Coast Guard is quite a noble outfit, the official mission of which is the safety of life and property at sea. In wartime, it is transferred to the Navy section and serves as a cave. In World War II, the Coast Guard even managed to have a Medal of Honor winner in its ranks. <br /> <br /> But again, we don't learn much about it. We don't learn much about everything. The film falls into a sequence of visual exhibitions and not too much else. A disappointment.
