If you really really enjoy movies with ants that build dirt mirrors, eat non-ants and conquer the world with a voice-over story, then this is the movie for you. In fact, some scientists working from a bio-dome communicate with highly intelligent ants (the most intelligent actors in this movie) in an effort to try to avert their conquest and extinction plans. Throughout the film, the two scientists (and a girl who saved them from the ants) used everything at their disposal (computers, green dye and hearing plays), but to no avail. I think they couldn't afford any pesticides, because the movie would be too quick. <br /> <br /> The title of the movie "Phase IV" is something of a mystery. This is not a spoiler, but "Phase I" starts just after the opening credits while you don't reach "Phase IV" until the end credits. Apparently, the director knew the movie would be boring to go through and phases 1 - 3 throughout the film as a kind of progress report: "Stay there friend! Another stage to final credits!" As a MST3K episode, this one was not very good for two reasons: 1) This is one of the season 0 on KTMA when they first started, so the reefing is not as good as in the seasons; and 2) This movie is so bad, even J & TB can't relieve it. There are one or two Gamera references, since they only downloaded 5 Gamera movies. <br /> <br /> The movie does have a trick / surprise, but I was so happy to reach the end, the effect lost on me.
