Having investigated half an hour with rumors, a gay bar outside of Tupelo, Mississippi, SMALL TOWN GAY BAR shifts, is focused on killing Scotty Weaver in Bay Minette to demonstrate the risks of the maintenance issues. But here's a problem. Bay Minette is not near Tupelo, as the film implies. It's not even in the same state. It's actually about three hundred miles away in the Alabama coast. <br /> <br /> Director Malcom Ingram does not boast to point out this fact, nor does he bother that Bay Minette itself is much more than a wide-ranging place, it is actually about two deep breaths away from the major metro area of ​​Mobile, Alabama - which has a notable gay community, quite a few gay bars, and even a Metropolitan Community Church congregation. If Ingram is unsuitable on these points, you should ask if he is on others. <br /> <br /> If someone who is born, educated, and still lives in Mississippi, I must say I find most of the small town of gay bar very hooey. No more Meridian or Tupelo, the communities in which Ingram focuses, are so rural, small or as isolated as he would imagine, and gay bars are indeed more common in the state than the film implies. Ingram has previously said that the absence of a gay bar does not mean an absence of a gay community, thereby proving a very profound ignorance of the southern culture, which tends to keep those who regularly burst. - Be gay or straight - in minus value. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, KLEINSTAD GAY BAR is a case in which a movie maker with a personal agenda came to his topic and then proceeded to film the agenda. Should gays and lesbians living in rural Mississippi face big, sometimes frightening challenges? You bet they do it - but it's no excuse to relieve such a degree with reality. The DVD contains a commentary track and a number of deleted scenes, but I found the movie itself so ridiculous that I didn't lose any time at all. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
