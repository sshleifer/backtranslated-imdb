This movie is only recommended for insomniacs: it will relieve them of having them sleep. Five-year-olds can also enjoy it. But for anyone else (including fans of the genre), what a drill! The "antique" plot is reminiscent of "Return of the Dragon", and this movie is just as unbreakable, but Nero is not Bruce Lee, so "Enter the Ninja" is a worse movie. So far, it's the second (the offensive "comedy", "Bachelor Party" was the first movie I gave 1/10).
