Unbelievable. Great role-playing, fair, interesting plot. <br /> <br /> But this movie has such graphical atrocities that aren't tense or excitement, just unsettling turmoil. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> Everyone can see the freak coming back to his habits. And that Robert Englund (like him) was an idiot; forbid your daughter to sleep with a soccer player, but he tries to kill an idiot and keep kiddyprn, is it right? <br /> <br /> The policeman whose daughter was kidnapped - someone felt he was a policeman and not an actor? Not me. This movie goes on and on with an end that we see in other horror movies: if the returns were good, part 2 could be made. Bad, very bad things. Maybe give some inspiration ...
