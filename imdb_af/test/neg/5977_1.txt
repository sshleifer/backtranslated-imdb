The title leads viewers to believe it is a fun movie to watch and probably much better than it is under the influence, but it is not good at all. One 15-minute series with Jack Black plays one of his songs and struggles while venturing through the woods. This movie is not saved at all. Every actor in this movie used to do better things, except for the main girls I couldn't think of one movie I saw before. I hate bash movies, but I also hate to find something fit in movies. The film is sad, not very funny and has such a potential with its incredible role. If it is reconsidered and written, it can be wonderful. If you want a good movie to see stoned, see Grandma's Son, either Half-baked or Dazed and Confused, but it's not a movie to be seen at all.
