It is surprising that some people have seen it as art. We saw it as a poorly filmed (shaky hand camera and everything), (generally) bad action, indescribable mess that looked more like a high school movie project with the kids experimenting in black-and-white movies. Injection of poetry instead of a story does not make an art film. When we watched it in the theater, people started with the giggles (we included) at the endless stupidity of this relentless, winding mess. And believe me, it seems infinite. If we had finished our candy and popcorn, we would also have walked out of the theater with the other two dozen people looking for something more interesting to do!
