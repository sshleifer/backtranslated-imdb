This movie is trying to be artistic, but is so pubescent as a film school student's first attempt. Next, it tries to be erotic, but comes over as clumsy as a virgin's first attempt. Finally, it tries to be cruel and gripping, but apart from Kinski's performance, which has been vigorously but remarkably wrong in the amateur melodrama, it is just as gripping as your hand for a wet noodle (which is an appropriate metaphor considering how erotic this movie is). It features a blowjob scene that is even leaner than Chloe Sevigny's career cemetery performance in The Brown Bunny. Get started now while you have the chance. Find yourself a Victoria's Secret lingerie catalog instead - it's more artistic and more erotic than these trips.
