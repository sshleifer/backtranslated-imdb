This movie was recommended by several people, and after reading all the positive comments from this site, I continued and bought a copy of the ebay movie. The acting in the film is averaged and a little hammy, especially by the family of cannibals, occurs in sequence if Jupiter rumbles and screams and shouts straight into the camera. It's one of those gigs where you just feel bad and bad for the poor actor. It's also proof of some of the worst editing I've seen, there's a terrible jerking right in the middle of his "speech". There are a few creepy moments and sometimes the music works well ... but overall the movie is not that good and I don't know why people think Wes Craven is so nice to a director. So far he has shown me nothing that I believe to be brilliant. The only thing that improved with Cravens movies was to produce its production.
