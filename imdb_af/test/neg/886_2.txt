Wow. Not because of the 3-D imagery, sometimes used to give good, good images, but which makes a lamb! The end of the movie just seems to implode on itself. This film should be one of the best-ever movie samples and one of the most pathetic attempts to try and explain it. The misunderstanding of this movie is also painful. If you are looking for a bad 50-year-old sci-fi movie to laugh (aka "bot feed"), go for it. Otherwise, look for better movies.
