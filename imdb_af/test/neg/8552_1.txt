Sad ... really sad. This movie has nothing (hmmm, maybe Sybil Danning) to let you watch. It also hurt me to see Linda Blair in this exploitation step. She definitely deserves better. <br /> <br /> So what is the story about? Let's see ... Warden John Vernon taps the prisoners in rather inspiring positions, while the prisoner Sybil actually runs the jail and has to fight little Linda to survive. Sounds like a B-movie, huh? It is.
