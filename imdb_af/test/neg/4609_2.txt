Be warned by the line at the top of the box that promotes a story about 'about sexual jocks'. There is nothing about Carrie 2. The plot is absurd, the dramatic awful, and the end is all too predictable. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect a masterpiece, but I expected to be entertained. . I wasn't. The only way I could rationalize this movie was because I was at a relative's home while waiting for my car to be fixed. Unless in the same trouble stay away from this movie.
