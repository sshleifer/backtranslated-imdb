I won't lie, I rented this movie because it was an "arty" movie with some explicit sex. I have the scene and Catherine Deneuve's (short) breasts, but the rest of the movie is just the usual long pretentious European art films with lines like "Did I have a mother or father I don't know" (paraphrase). If you are curious about the transition from art to pornography, it can be an interesting look, using the quick button (I was still too slow!).
