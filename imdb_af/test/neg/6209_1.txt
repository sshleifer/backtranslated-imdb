There was no 0 in the voting option, so I was obliged to use the next available figure. <br /> <br /> It's a sad day for bollywood when such a movie that has role-players is nothing more than a bunch of youthful acting, and a horrible script. <br /> <br /> This movie is nowhere near to be called a Hitch clone. Salman Khan with his usual take-you-shirt theme and Govinda with his humorous laugh. If someone said two decades ago that I would write a comment on Salman (after his success with Maine Pyar Kiya), I would have written him / her off.
