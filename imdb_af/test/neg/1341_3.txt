Director / scriptwriter Diane English's 2008 update of George Cukor's 1939 MGM classic comedy shows more mothballs than his predecessor. Based on Clare Booth Luce's sharp observation in 1936, playing on the relationships developed under a rigorous female group of devastated Manhattan socialites, the story will look like a contemporary remake. Instead, because of English's thematic persuasion, the production comes as an extensive therapy session with a lack of whiteness. In addition, the diverse lifestyle of women in this film today is reduced to stereo types in the seating area, and the original play's central expectation of eliminating men from the storyline seems even more complicated given the overt pan-sexual evolution among men as well as women since the 1930s. To bring in injuries, the recent big-screen adaptation of HBO's "Sex and the City" has made this kind of a girl with a lot of sadness much better and sharper. <br /> <br /> The skeleton of the original play remains as the story rests on rich Mary Haines, who gave up her promising clothing design career to become the dedicated wife of a Wall Street financial wizard. Like 'Sex and the City', she is surrounded by three best friends - Sylvie Fowler, a successful, noble magazine editor in the form of Miranda Priestly in "The Devil Wears Prada" (another movie featuring these echoes); eternal pregnant Edie Cohen representing the stay-at-home wife; and Alex Fisher, a lesbian writer representing every oppressed group, is usually excluded from such an exclusive click. Through a mouth manicurist, they find that Mary's husband has a relationship with eternal crystal Allen, a perfumery missionary at Saks, who is more than willing to break a marriage while struggling to become an actress. The rest of the plot does not matter, as it is a series of scenes focused on sisters and tinkering. None of this is very enlightening and without the satirical singing of the 1939 movie. <br /> <br /> Watch Strange Youth at 47, Meg Ryan looks to play Maria in a way that tries to relive the goodwill she experienced in the 1990s with "When Harry With Sally" and "Sleepless in Seattle ". It's not that she's not fit for age here, but her familiar ridicule seems to conflict with the passive character of the character. Annette Bening is doing a bit better in the playful Rosalind Russell role of Sylvie, as she proved that he was capable of conveying hardness while masking vulnerability, but her character goes through such urgent transformation that it is the work of the play worsened. Poor Eva Mendes should play Crystal as a level, transparent shop girl versus the clever, hard-capped Joan Crawford. Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett Smith are kicked to the sidelines like Edie and Alex respectively. Much better, is Candice Bergen as Maria's skilled, supportive mother and Cloris Leachman as the housekeeper. <br /> <br /> The 2008 DVD probably doesn't have a robust reflection of the lack of response to the movie's release. set extras. There are two scrapped plays - one with Crystal and her friends who have a girl in the night as a contrast to Mary's extensive garden party, and the other an extension of Bette Midler's cameo as a multi-married Hollywood agent who Maria counseling during a late night. at a yoga camp. Two featurettes exclude the extras. The women: The legacy of history behind the original 1936 movie and The Women Behind the Women, which has the film and the crew, speaks infinitely about female empowerment and self-image. The irony is that this version of "The Women" is directed and written by a woman, such a patronizing look at women.
