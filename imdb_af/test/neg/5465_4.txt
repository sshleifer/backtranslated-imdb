Book of Revelation begins very well. Daniel, an ego dancer, is kidnapped, abused and sexually raped by three masked women. <br /> <br /> Then nothing else happens. There is some hint of rediscovery, but the movie doesn't give an explanation or a real ending. Daniel's reactions to the abuse are very basic. He joins dance, has sex with every woman, and eventually has a relationship with a very simple and general woman. <br /> <br /> I saw a good deal of art house movies, but it lacked something about it. The main lead is good; but some characters don't seem to be completely defined.
