When the movie starts, it's clear how old and sick the boys are. Although Oliver Hardy is huge, it is Stanley who looks as if death is overwhelmed. Apparently he was silent during the production and of course lost a lot of weight. Although he would eventually recover and live for another decade and a half, he looked like a dying man. In addition, when I watched the movie, I was shocked at how much Stan Stan - I half expected him to die from the effort. I really can't understand why they came from their retirement, considering their health - especially if the story and production values ​​are as poor as they are with this movie. <br /> <br /> Stanley inherits an island and a boat. He and Ollie are ready to leave when Antoine, a stateless man, literally falls into their boat and begins the journey around the island. Along the way, they discover that Giovanni has been hiding, but despite this, the four men become friends and land on another island. It looks like paradise and they are all very happy. A little later, a pretty young lady arrives with them and everything looks grand. <br /> <br /> Uranium is unfortunately discovered on the island and the place is flooded with reefs. Eventually, the crowd decided to hang over and take over the four men. At that time, the island was sinking back into the sea and the men were spared. <br /> <br /> I'll give the movie some credit for original and interesting. One thing, however, is not FUNNY - and it is unforgivable for a Laurel and Hardy flick. Although it's not a bad movie, it's definitely not a good one. A sad end to their brilliant careers. <br /> <br /> All the actors, except the duo, are baptized in English, as the film is made in France. While this may not be the worst movie they made (it would be the BIG STATE), it's definitely close !! Watching this movie is painful and likes to clean up people after a serious accident.
