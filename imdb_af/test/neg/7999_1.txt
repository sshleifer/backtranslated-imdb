Anyone who claims this movie is a ninja-classic movie should have seen this movie before the mid-1990s, or he was less than 10 years before he saw it. Otherwise, I can't explain this 'classic ninja movie' title. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes in this movie are just unbearable. Instead of throwing Franco Nero as the ninja, they can rather hire an experienced martial artist. In any way, the acting skill is not important in the type of movie. Nero's fighting ability is barely a street fighter in a bar. His kicks and punches are lame. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of active movies with good action. It's just a waste of time.
