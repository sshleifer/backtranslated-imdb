just watched this "movie" and it actually made me write my first comment on IMDb.com, although I've been a user for over 9 years. The reason I watched it is because I like explosive films and sometimes I like to test my limits and see what is still shocking me. First of all, the gore in this movie didn't shock me, not even the idea that someone came through it and made it into a movie. What really shocked me is that there is a market for this kind of crap. . don't get me wrong - I'm all at censorship, but this movie seems to me to be made for a kind of fetish crowd that looks like this type of sh * t. It didn't give you the same kind of horror and guilt you felt after watching movies like "August underground". that movie is horrible to watch, but at least you get the feeling that the filmmakers want to show you how disgusting violence is. In the case of "niku daruma", it seems to have been made strictly to raise people. I prefer movies that are shocking because they are well done and thought through, such as Gaspar Noe's movies, or Takashi Miike's, or Funny Games of Man Bites Dog - those movies will stay with you for a while. This film I will have forgotten tomorrow, and the only thing that stays with me is the idea that there is somewhere, people are awakened by seeing it. If you read it, look at the next hospital or shoot yourself - this does not apply to gore dogs, however. you are cheeky! peace
