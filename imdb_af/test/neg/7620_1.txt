Do you know which farmers are spraying on land? That's right - Mommy, so when the BBC decided to make a very confused conspiracy on the GMOs and to get farming we got was some of the fanciest fog that the BBC had given its audience. <br /> <br /> !!!! SPOILERS !! <br /> <br /> GOLD AREAS opens with a bunch of masked scientists in a laboratory where a female scientist (According to law on the latest BBC, all scientists are women) announces a new wheat grain to the third save the world from a hunger "then change the story to another, just as beautiful a scene. If you are going to make an excitement of any kind, you shouldn't open it with a hook that grabs the audience? were the X-FILES while 28 DAYS LATER was opened with a hook that took place in a laboratory, I think someone at the BBC did not think this thriller needed a hook, because the viewers had trailers in this month throat filled. <br /> <br /> As the (not very exciting) story, some journalists go ahead One is a drunk man with morality lower than Bill Clinton and Dubya Bush combined while the other is a female journalist full of virtues.) They are investigating patients at a hospital that may be via Me rcy killings' bumped. It is at this point that things start to be confused, as the female journalist is threatened by MI5 issues and the first episode ends with the main MI5 ghost being killed. <br /> <br /> The second episode shows that patients at the country hospital are actually dying due to infection with a VRSA superbug. This is when things go completely straight. All of GOLD's money was the audience to believe the intelligence services and the company that was shown in the opening order is behind death. But it is not. It turns out that the bad man is an organic farmer who manufactures the VRSA superbug in his bedroom and the story ends with the MATRIX camera working with the drunk male journalist spreading fire on a field driven by VRSA, thereby spread spreading across the country. <br /> <br /> I find it impossible to say a good word about GOLDEN AREAS. By the time of his broadcast, I was both a member of the Scottish Green Party and Greenpeace. I have agreed my time in the environmental movement, but now I am quite offended by how environmentalists are portrayed here and that the bad man is spreading a deadly genetically engineered virus as a warning to the dangers of genetically modified organisms is very stupid. It's a bit like a CND member who abandons a nuke in London to warn of the dangers of nuclear war. I was also slightly offensive about how the male characters were written as bastards, while all the women were very intelligent and morally better than men. There are also other problems with writing, especially for VRSA. If it's different from the scriptwriters, take the time and effort to investigate VRSA. It will be completely different from what is seen here. Oh, and if you burn diesel, it doesn't explode like napalm. Perhaps the worst criticism of the script is that it looks like the JEEPERS CREEPERS structure way, which violates the last ten minutes of most of what has gone before. Where as JEEPERS CREEPERS lasted only 90 minutes AREAS OF GOLD lasted twice as long, is doubly irritating and illogical. <br /> <br /> As a footnote, environmental awareness never makes a good theme for excitement. (Anyone remembers those Steven Segal movies?) It's time TV and movie producers realized it
