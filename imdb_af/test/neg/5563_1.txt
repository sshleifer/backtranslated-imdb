What should I say? I just saw this movie for curiosity, and it's really a shame. I grew up in Brittany with stories of Celtic legends, and spent 5 years in Rennes, the town in which this film is being said ... Shame that no actor or camera of this movie ever arrived in Rennes. They could have chosen at least a probable town, or a likely forest, but nothing even SEEM like Brittany or Rennes. And it calls it a film about Celtic legends, and makes a fool of the audience. Besides the details, it could have been a good movie, but it's crazy. Silly scenario, stupid characters and no originality. Definitely to avoid.
