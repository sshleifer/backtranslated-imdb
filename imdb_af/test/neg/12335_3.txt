This movie has the potential to be a decent thriller, but it was complicated by just about twenty minutes of good writing, which was mostly used initially. Then, holes began to appear in the story that one could drive a truck. The film followed a descending curve from good to habit, to bad, ridiculous at the time it ended. It is not recommended.
