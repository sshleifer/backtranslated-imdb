The most self-sufficient movie I have had the misfortune to <br /> <br /> rent. Unwatchable. Much of the movie is of course improvised, <br /> <br /> and not good. It looks like Toback is taking the first from <br /> <br /> taking everything. The movie is good for a few minutes when <br /> <br /> Robert Downey Jr. appear and then go back to hell quickly. <br /> <br />.
