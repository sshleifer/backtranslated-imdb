I just can't get it. Freaks out on the planet talk about this one as a must see. They dare even call it an exploitation because the occupied girl seduces priests and masturbates all the time. Do not make me laugh. I watched the movie, just seduced at the end of the movie and didn't call it seductive, it's just bad language she speaks. And the masturbation is also a big laugh, she tries to seduce her father while masturbating, let me be clear, with her clothes on you out there. It's not bloody or bloody at all, all bakkies on Beyond The Door, well, let me say, one is better to me than this movie. Only the last 5 minutes in possession are vomiting and strange eyes. If I knew it was so bad, I would never get a copy. If you really want to see an exploration of exorcism, see Angel Above, The Devil Below or other cheesy ones. It's a time of time.
