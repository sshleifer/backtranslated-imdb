Jacqueline Hyde, like any other ordinary day for telemarketing individual Jackie Hyde (co-producer Gabriella Hall), starts until her boss (Robert Donovan) burns her out to take personal calls at work. However, this is not bad news, because the call she made was from a lawyer informing her that her grandfather (Malcolm Bennett) recently died and that he left her home and fortune (why doesn't it happen so not with me? Very excited Jackie heads out there and makes her right at home. Looking at the thermostat once, Jackie stumbles into a secret room where her grandfather abandons the bright red formula he invented, each one drinking it to change their look. To be a bit on the spicy side, Jackie eventually falls on the glamorous Jacqueline (Blythe Metz), but Jackie's better-looking alter-ego begins to take control ... <br /> <br /> Manufactured and directed by Rolfe Kanefsky I thought Jacqueline Hyde was complete and total crap from start to finish and it is so straightforward and straight forward. According to the opening credits, Jacqueline Hyde was "inspired" by the classic Robert Louis Stevenson novel "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, honestly, Mr. Stevenson could see what was happening to his story, turning in his grave. For a start I think Jacqueline Hyde was meant to be a horror movie, the IMDb definitely calls it such, but there is no horror at all, except just how bad it is. I would say that Jacqueline Hyde is more of a soft core porno than anything else and very tame about it, why sit down and watch this softer than soft porn crap if you can see your hard stuff what the goods really deliver? Why, that's the question I'm asking here. It is not even good porn, except that it is too soft, it is boring, boring and the sex scenes that are not worth it are few and far between. The most intelligent aspect of this film is the title that would have been rather clever if it were not the fact that another movie used the title Jacqueline Hyde (1998) during the previous century. better than this piece of garbage. This is one of those movies you should see for yourself to see how bad it is, but just hope you'll never get the chance. <br /> <br /> Director Kanefsky is apparently working on a low budget, but that's not an excuse. This movie is shot on a digital video camera, the movie looks cheap and the few cases of CGI look like they come from a Nintendo Gameboy. The final 'shocking' turn has probably the worst morph effect I have ever seen and is pretty good for a laugh like the scene when Jackie's breasts grow via more horrible CGI. It's another thing, the movie takes him too seriously. The topic sucks, is too predictable and makes for a poor movie but perhaps if the dialogue was deliberately funny with some dirty porn, the movie might have been better to watch, because that's not the case. Forget about any decent horror, violence or gore, as there is no surprising endless blood supply. <br /> <br /> Technically Jacqueline Hyde is home-made movie type, photography is the flat hand-held point & shoot variety, music, production design and special effects of a suitable low standard to fit the writing . The acting was terrible, serious, it's bad. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Jacqueline Hyde is a bit shaky, there is not one positive thing about this tiny movie I can think of. Any proper movie lover will have almost impossible time to find any redeeming value in this crap, definitely one to avoid.
