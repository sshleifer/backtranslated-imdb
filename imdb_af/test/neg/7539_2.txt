Contrary to most of the comments in this section, I must say that this movie is hardly the definition of "junk!" Escape. The only readers who seem to be aware of what a catalog of clich√©s is, are those who live in the northeast like I do and know what the area is. I am totally sick of movies that are supposed to be 'realistic', but set out the working class (from everywhere) as stupid, criminal army life, but then excuse them because of their social background. And funny? I smiled briefly twice and laughed once, but it was against the indifference of two boy actors with Sunderland accents trying to hide their Newcastle accent from Sunderland soccer players! There was only one nice character in the whole movie, and it was the senile grandfather who was quiet but very competent by Roy Hudd - the only non-Geordie in the role. <br /> <br /> As for the writing - Well, I'm just wondering which university sociology department the author studied. He certainly had no ear for the local accent. And I never heard the expression 'Purely Belter' - and I'm not just a resident, I'm a linguist who wrote articles on the local dialect. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time and look at this garbage. It's not funny, it's not realistic, it's not entertaining, and it's fundamentally dishonest.
