Planet Earth has suffered a terrible disaster, so mankind now survives underground divided into different religious cults. What caused the disaster? I have no idea ? Why is humanity divided into different church factions? I have no idea . Since the surface of the earth can no longer support human life, how can people grow crops to feed the population? I have no idea . What kind of producer thought this script is worth receiving? I have no idea <br /> <br /> SHEPHERD is one of those movies that creeps up late in the night on cable channels. The kind of movie you consult the IMBb to see if it has any merit. The number of people who commented on SHEPHERD on this page has not yet reached double figures and this is a movie released nine years ago. Perhaps the people who have never seen it before are the lucky ones? <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the plot, it is very routine. Former Grumpy police spokesperson Boris Dakota, whose wife and child have been killed for years, meets a woman and her child and it is up to him to save their lives, almost like a futuristic western. Throw in a former wrestler who now manages the channel of God, a fascist Christian bloke trying to sniff out a ventriloquist, a T&A for that reason, and you have a mess of a movie. I think that after seeing this Neil Marshall's DOOMSDAY may be a masterpiece of theater
