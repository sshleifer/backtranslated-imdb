This movie looks like it was shot with a videophone, it has very little plot and unnecessary nudity. The movie never really came together or made much sense and for such a movie there were of course unnecessary boobies. The director apparently tried to make the film subjective and different, but it never gave enough information about what even went on, even in the end I left a mixture of anger and confusion. Confusion of lack of plot and anger, because I wanted to get me back two dollars from blockbuster and a 1.5 hour life back. They must have a pay program for people who accidentally rent this movie.
