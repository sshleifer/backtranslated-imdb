This may be the biggest disappointment I will see in 2009. I seem to be the scarce person holding Park's Oldboy, but I think his "Lady Vengeance" and "Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance" are the best movies I've ever seen in the 2000s. That's why I really look forward to seeing it, especially as it had such positive reviews. Instead, I got the movie clip and little broken, than any new land for the vampire genre. And while I can appreciate a little gallbladder in such movies, I felt that Park did it in very difficult times. <br /> <br /> Others have compared / contrast it to "Leave the right one" and I have to say that "Let the right one in" was much better than this one and was a fresh approach to the vampire genre. Unfortunately, Park's tasks were tired.
