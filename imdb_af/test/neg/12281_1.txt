I had to write a review for this movie based on those who say gory, non stop action, great movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, these people watched another movie. Killpoint honestly sucked the word! I was waiting and waiting for this movie to get better and it was in vain. Some said this movie was brutal and others said greedy, but I can't find any of those adjectives that actually appear in it. I mean hell There are so many scenes where people are shot and there is no blood, it's not even funny! ! I think the best way to summarize it is that it should probably have been PG by 1984 standards and now in 2010 there is no doubt that it will be PG !! Bad, BAD not in the fun cute "B" variety movie !!
