Anyone who thinks this movie is wonderful should see their head desperately. It seems to me that this movie was made a joke. It has no good points whatsoever. The props cost about $ 10 and the whole set seems to fall anytime. Why are films made like this in the first place? It also has two of the most annoying characters I've ever experienced in the young boy on the spaceship and the redhead of the twentieth century. This movie is almost as bad as "Cool as Ice" with the incredibly talented Vanilla "Misunderstood" Ice.
