In & Out made me vomit. I have never seen such a shameless movie! It wanted to say seriously that it was gay, something wonderful and joyful, but had no idea how to say it. For me it wasn't a comedy unless cruel, sick jokes were something to laugh when a victim fell for it. <br /> <br /> From what I saw, this movie had four (4) big bugs starting with A) Matt Dillion's character as he reveals to the world former teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline ) is gay. Remember, it's amazing that Matt Dillion's character has won an Oscar for what looks like a serious role on the edge of a crack. But why would he say something like that? After all, it was never a problem with Howard's students, his friends, family or his finale. Nobody. So why would he say something like that if it wasn't true? More to the point, why doesn't the movie give us an answer as to why he said it? The reason is because there is NO answer and for the convenience of the plot nothing is provided. The second (B) error is that the film seems to be forgetting what homosexuality is - the attraction and sexual relationship with same-sex members. In this film gay is based on the taste of Barbara Streisand musicals and passionate about literature. It's all based on stereotypes! <br /> <br /> Both of these mistakes are met again at the actual graduation ceremony. Matt Dillion finds out about the uprising that takes place in that small town and the movie seems ready to let us know what made it so. When he arrived at the ceremony, he didn't say anything, and I wondered why he had come to the world altogether. He didn't solve anything. Then when the audience stood to announce they were gay, I was so moved that I wanted to throw! Those people stood up in defense that Howard was gay by mocking all the stereotypes. What the movie forgot is that it uses the stereotypes to show why Howard was gay. Their filmmakers shot themselves in the foot! But wait there is more! <br /> <br /> During the ceremony, Howard (C) advocated losing work as a teacher, because people believed he would influence his students as gay. What the film is trying to say is that homosexuals never recruit and that he won't influence his students. But didn't we see Tom Selleck's character endless pressure Howard over and over again, even to the point of kissing him unexpectedly, to get out of the closet if there was no cupboard in my mind to get out? The film clearly shows that homosexuals are capable of recruiting. The movie then flashes in the foot again. <br /> <br /> And (D) when Howard got out of the closet, didn't anyone see how the script closed for the rest of the movie? I only counted three lines that he later had: "Yup!" to his parents, "Hi there!" to a student and "Are you ready?" to Tom Selleck before the last fallow scene. I may be low, but the point is he shouldn't tell us what made him decide he was gay. I wanted to know what was in his head, because I never once believed he was gay. <br /> <br /> As bonuses, the film also includes several truly offensive scenes. One in which Howard asks a priest in confession for advice on what to do for a friend, who has been engaged and has not yet had sex with his fiancee. "Does it make him gay?" he asks. The priest replied, "Oh yes, he is definitely gay." Uh huh. Or what about the scene when all the old ladies come together to tell Howard's mother that she shouldn't be sad about her son's deep, dark secret, because ... well, everyone has them. Then the ladies confessed that she had never seen the "Bridges of Madison County". Funny? No! Becuase the film shows that it is insensitive and has no idea how devastating it can be to have family to announce one of its members that he / she is gay. I know. I have several friends who are gay, and none of their families did well. It was a bad way to spread the whole situation. <br /> <br /> The last straw for me was the last scene they saw Tom and Kevin marry. The camera went very slowly to the front of the church ... That's not what you thought! I was really disgusting about it, and I could never forgive that sick joke. I have nothing against movies about gay or homosexuality. "Philadelphia" and "Longtime Companion" were very honest and true in what they had to say. "In & Out" just shouts for political correctness, but has no idea of ​​the corruption in its core. What I collected at the movie is that if you're 99% straight and 1% gay, you have the infinite doubt, YOU ARE DEFINITELY GAY. It's like gayness becomes a dominant feature in genetics. In fact, if everyone told you that you were worthless and stupid, would you believe it, would you? That's what happened to Howard Brackett to be gay. I left the theater sad and angry. Angry all weekend, in fact. It was a seriously ill and cruel movie, the 1997 WORST.
