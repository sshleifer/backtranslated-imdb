It is sad that Schwarzenegger was the best aspect of this production, especially in view of the fact that he had not yet come into his own, and still as tight as cardboard in his dial-up. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's not as bad as some critics say, but it's not good either. It is amusing, and plays like a poor cousin of the Conan line, making it a conflicting, uneven and poor job. And speaking of the poor, the quality is terrible because of the era in which it was filmed, but that is not the only reason. <br /> <br /> The story here is inferior, even to the Conan line, but besides, it loses itself in the "Red Sonja must be dominated by a large, strong Schwarzenegger jersey, and completely forgets its purpose , if it ever had one. <br /> <br /> It's entertaining, but in a low budget, guilty Place "B" kind. <br /> <br /> That amounts to a 4.2 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy :.
