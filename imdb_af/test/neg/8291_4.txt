"Graduation Day" was released in May 1981 at the height of the slasher movie movie. Earlier this year fans of flicks such as "My Bloody Valentine", "Just Before Dawn", "Friday the 13th Part 2" and "The Burning" and theaters were still flashes like Halloween II, The Prowler "and" Happy Birthday to Me "I've seen all these movies, and out of all the popular 1981 slides" Graduation Day "is by far the worst. <br /> <br /> What" Graduation Day "is an exercise in poor, low-budget movie-making with bad acting, bad writing, useless characters, useless scenes, unnecessary nudity, cheese dialogue, and an experiment in editing that didn't work so well, and who can forget the classic 80's disco music played by the movie ( The music of the opening scene is only played against the music played during a chase. However, if you rent a movie like this, a person should be aware that that information will be in this movie. So why not "Graduation Day "considered a classic like" Halloween "," Friday the 13th "," A Nightmare on E lm Street, "My Bloody Valentine", "The Burning" or "Prom Night"? Why are fans still looking for those movies, but ignore them without worrying? <br /> <br /> Where slasher movies pass above all other areas, it's pacing. There is nothing worse than a slow-moving shooter, and Graduation Day moves fairly slowly. The most aggravating part is that there are many opportunities to speed things up; There are many useless characters that are set up and never get the chance to be a suspect in the murder or a victim. There is a messy teacher, a disabled principal, a cunning secretary, a dull school security guard, an indifferent detective, an alcoholic stepfather, a fearless grandmother, and a mother of an earlier victim still grieving. All these characters can have a motive to kill or a reason to be killed, but they are all wasted. The worst part is that the story still focuses on them, and sometimes the whole scene just shows their character. But for what? <br /> <br /> What astonished me about "Graduation Day" and its little fan base is that people are no longer surprised at the deadly screens. Fans go wild for deaths like the murder in "The Burning", the washing machine death in "My Bloody Valentine", the kabob death in "Happy Birthday to Me", the upside down in "Friday 13th 3", and the hot tub died in "Halloween II", and even the car killed in "Madman". But where is the respect for some truly unique (though cheesy) deaths in "Graduation Day". One victim goes through the jungle with a shielding sword, while another throws the sword at them like a spear. The best death includes nails under a landing mat. Why are these deaths not known by the genre as the deaths of more popular treasure movies? <br /> <br /> "Graduation Day" is trying hard to be a great and unique movie, but there's just one element of logic and pacing missing that really ruins the whole experience. It's not the worst of its kind (try to go out "Don't be alone in the forest ... alone") and there's a bit of tension, plus it just delivers what fans are looking for (blood, gore, nudity, sex, and nostalgia, but "Graduation Day" will not be remembered as one of the supreme films ever made. This is not a matter of budget - almost all slashers have a low budget - but it is a matter of ideas, creativity and craftsmanship. It's all that any kind of movie is making ... <br /> <br /> Recommended for hardcore slasher fans. Common horror fans may get a little bored, and people who don't have much interest in horror should be clear. It's not the worst slasher movie ever made, but it's a long way to be the best.
