... but just had to see how bad it could get. The plot line was thin to start with, but it just got worse. A female genetic engineering student uses her research on accelerated mitosis to artificially create a man, because a biological weapon used in WW3 killed 97% of the global male population. The surviving men are either high priced gigolos in backbone clubs, or crazy lunatics in running soccer stadiums that overturn the 'Lesbian Conspiracy'. The whole process equates to the microwave of a large bowl of jello. Press a few buttons and something you get a baby. Not only that, but he will grow older in the middle of the 20th, and then normally (how convenient). Eventually poor Adam gets bored with the secluded cabin in the forest where his creator raised him and stole her car to see the city. <br /> <br /> It starts 90 minutes of unlikely chases, convenient plot turns, and several subplots we never see solved. As Adam learns quickly, which survives men, it is treated as outcasts / criminals because they are dangerous animals that cannot help genetic predisposition to violence. The propaganda machines are in full swing, fearing women to believe that all men are rapists and murderers. This has led to lesbianism being the norm, the fall of Christianity, the woman only reproduction via cloning, and yes world peace under other implied results. It seems unlikely that only 30 years have passed since the war. Adam stumbles from a bad situation to the next, although it is genetically programmed to be non-violent and can't really do much on his behalf. With the FBI on his route, Madams looking for fresh meat, and his creator trying to regain him (it looks like it), he learns that violence is not limited to the male species. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> However, I enjoyed the performance of Veronica Cartwrights 'love to hate her'. Director of the FBI, and Julie Bowen did not do badly like Hope's 'closet hetero' genetics.
