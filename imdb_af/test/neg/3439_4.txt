You get an hour and a half end, I have to save the world action completely, one linen and one woman somewhere in the equation. This time he plays a man who helps people in the witness protection program. to quote the cover of the movie. He wiped out their past to save their future. Woppi, it must be cool :) I bet younger people will enjoy it, but it's a little over it for my taste. And the one linen is really something else, and I don't mean it in a good way. After killing a crocodile, he could say so. "you are luggage" If you are in the right mood, you can enjoy the movie. And as far as a brainstorming action goes, it's not very bad. But almost before the movie starts, you know exactly what is going to happen. But if you like these movies, you'll probably enjoy this one. I rate this movie 4
