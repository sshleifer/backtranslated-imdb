As a cartoon, the Spytroops movie was very bad. It is only 44 minutes long, but there are several battles that result in the destruction of the COBRA headquarters. One downer was the start of the movie. An animated battle that was better than the rest of the movie, seems to be a kind of battle simulation. It is true that there was a big turn-off and the rest of the film didn't have credibility. Then there was the issue of shipwreck tied up with his parrot and thrown into a room where nobody had been checking out for a few days. Whatever happened to cameras? <br /> <br /> The COBRA base had only a handful of characters, and the rest were BAT robots. Apart from many passages, the COBRA base did not have any weapons, tanks, trucks or any other equipment. Then there was the stupid idea that 100 complex androids could be created overnight. The plot was silly, even though it was meant for small children. Spongebob, Powerpuff Girls, and even Barney The Dinosaur pay more attention to their plots. <br /> <br /> The characters weren't bad, except I could never understand what Destro said and the Cobra Commander was stupid and not a lot of a villain. In fact, except for Stormskadu and Xartan, the rest of the COBRA characters were comical and barely impressive. The GI Joe characters were pretty good. Scarlett, Agent Faces, Road Block and Snake Eyes were my favorites here. Shipwreck and Beach Head were the worst. Shipwreck is written as a goof ball and Beach Head sounds like a grandfather of the 1990s. I think the author, Larry Hama, was trying to make a character appeal to teenagers, but he was a decade away. Just after Beach Head's Spicoli surfer talk (Fast Times at Ridgemont High), I wondered if the new GI Joes would smoke a dube before the big mission. <br /> <br /> The CGI was pretty good, except that Cobra Commander had a sprawling spastic walk, and the vehicles didn't look very realistic. The flying tank and the explosions were not very impressive. Old style animation would have been much better than that. Since Hasbro wants to do things cheaply, they have what they paid for. I had trouble watching the whole thing, it was just boring and had no soul or GI Joe spirit. Even the old GI Joe ads would have been better. In fact, the DVD included extras such as four or five current ads for GI Joe Spy Troops, and those ads were much more entertaining than the movie. The advertisements had more child-oriented fun and spirit. The ads were alive while the movie was tired.
