"Shuttle" is / was more than a boring movie that had an interesting start, but after half an hour it ended up in the worst possible way I could ever imagine. This movie lost its story if you could call it a story? ... after half an hour. All the following scenes are totally out of proportion. The driver is a kind of superman because he survives every attack with rifles etc. Even after he stabbed his leg, he could put her in the box. But what a coincidence that there was a box in that garage. I really felt sick and deceived when the movie ended. It could have been so much if the story was much better. In my opinion, even a child would make a better story. And why send the girl with water and food. I stop counting the plot holes about halfway through. And when the movie reached its almost wonderful sick-over-the-final turn, I gave up completely (better say "throw"). The worst thing about Shuttle is that it can't even be worse. author / director Anderson will learn from this lesson and give us a decent thriller next time. Think the better he will move to another genre. I hold my fingers over. But from now on I will read the comments on his future movies. first before you look. A waste of time.
