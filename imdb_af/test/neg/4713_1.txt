I remember this at my local Blockbuster and pick it up because I was curious. I liked movies about mythological organisms. I like movies about werewolves, vampires, zombies, etc. It is based on half-cabinets, a half-human half-leopard that is active on the African people. <br /> <br /> The movie is horrible! The actors are horrible! There is no script whatsoever! It's all improvised! The whole thing is filmed at night because they say it's the only time you ever see it. This is obvious bull * fur *! They film at night to make it scary. But they failed me. After the first person died, I put it back in the case and returned to Blockbuster. One of the most boring movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Now you're probably saying I can't review a movie if I haven't finished it. Well, this is one of the movies that didn't deserve to be watched completely. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10. This is really BAD!
