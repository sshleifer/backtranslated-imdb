I saw kung fu stockings Kung Fu movies. To live in Taiwan, they come instead of sitcoms in America. I've seen movies enjoy themselves, but this movie is in the sad category of movies that are trying too hard with horrible actors, terrible props and terrible music to be taken seriously. I was very sorry for the person who made the music for this movie. How sad it must be to be a composer who needs to watch shit as I thought, had to be the title "Generic Ninja Fight Scene, Op. 1" or "Variations on a Bad Guy, who girl's head pointed, backed a corner "or the daring" Flight of the Helicopter ". Then the battle was over and the credits rolled. This actually laughed me to tears. If the "special effects" were not enough evidence that it was a low budget, the fact that only two or three of the crew members were thought to be residents, which was good for the much-needed Philippine economy, was probably just about to make money. saving, ever did something since this series of movies. They hired equipment, despite making prosecutions on this movie. It was also pretty funny. The thing I really did, however, was not the music (which half expected me to show an animated Sargeant Slaughter of GI Joe), but the end ... I think it would be a devastator than There really was a plot to spoil, but when the American ninja dropped the girl in Jackson's arms and then took off his mask, I wanted to see him jump off the roof and Jackson dropped the girl to catch him. <br /> <br /> I think it would have been the perfect punchline for this joke of a movie.
