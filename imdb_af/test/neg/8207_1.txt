Why can't a movie be zero? Or even a negative number? Some movies like "Plan Nine From Outer Space" are so bad that it's fun to watch. THIS IS NOT ONE. "The Dungeon of Horror" can be the worst movie I've ever seen (some of them. I had to make it very fast!). Luckily for the rudeness of my youth and senility of my advancing age, there may be worse movies I've seen, but grateful, I can't remember them. The sets appear to be made with cardboard and finished with spray syringes. The special effects look like a fifth degree C + diorama in a shoebox. The movie contains unforgivable gaffs as when the Marquis shot and killed his servant. He immediately touches his escaped victim, who takes his flintlock and shoots it with it, without the gun being recharged! This movie was so bad that my DVD copy only had name credits. I think no company or studio would be entered. Although I think when making in your garage film and sets of cardboard boxes, a studio is not needed. This movie is definitely in my cellar of all time worst movies with such terrible shrines as "The Manipulator", the worst movie I have ever seen with a real (one-off) Hollywood premier man Mickey Rooney. The only time I recommend watching the "The Dungeon of Harrow" (or "The Manipulator") will be if someone would pay you. (I'm cheap). I'll get $ 7 or $ 8 dollars for "Dungeon" and at least ten for "Manipulator". fil-never from the can-cinematographer
