Why didn't they follow the book ... I'm very sad and disappointed. I was so looking to see this movie, but if you read the book (maybe recently), it can be very difficult to stay objective. My wife didn't read the book, and she loved the movie. <br /> <br /> Reasons for the disappointment are: 1) Cern's involvement ... away with the wind, such a shame, there is a very small portion At the beginning, where the antimatter is created, but even that doesn't keep to the facts (why not, the fact that Vittoria's father was burned with the first Illuminati brand, how Langdon was involved, was a perfect start for the Movie_ 2) Storyline between the (deceased) Pope and Camerlegno completely gone ... this is completely the motive for stealing the antimatter. 3) Storyline between Langdon and Vittoria Vetra does not exist at all <br /> All-in-all, flaky storyline, and cannot understand that Dan Brown allowed them to name it not set. Maybe I should visit this movie again in 10 years, if I can no longer remember the excellent book (chances to forget the book I'm afraid of). Very sorry for the negative review spoiled by expectations.
