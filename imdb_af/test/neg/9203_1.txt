1) Bad acting. <br /> <br /> 2) For a lot of alien planet crashes, it looks like home, especially with the homes and roads you can see in the background. <br /> <br /> 3) Terrible plot with stupid characters who make idiotic decisions and lose precious survival gear and clothing left, right and center. <br /> <br /> 4) Cool 70's scifi jumpsuits (possibly the only good thing about this movie) <br /> <br /> 5) Interesting ship at the start (this crew has admired over 1999). Sorry, it blows up so early. The escape ship also sank too fast. * Sug * <br /> <br /> 6) Anthropologists may find some aspects of the movie interesting in terms of primate group behavior.
