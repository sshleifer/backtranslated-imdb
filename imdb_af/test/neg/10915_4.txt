Don't get me wrong, I love Stephen King! And this is a nice good movie about everyone. The rabid Cujo is very scary and the film is tense. But after the first few minutes imprisoned by poor Donna and her little son Tad in the Pinto by the rabid St Bernard, I began to wonder why she did nothing to help herself. <br /> <br /> She put her foot out of the door and pushed the car backwards (I mean it was a Pinto for Pete and they were on a downhill slope) and roll to safety but then it was " a very short movie. When she started the car, did she overturn it and hope she could at least get a part of the driveway? No, she's trying to make a three-point turn in a bad alternator car. She managed to get out of the car and look around 45 seconds or so at one point to get to a baseball bat lying on the ground - wasting time! I mean, if you make a run for the bat, do it and at least you have something to hit the dog. But, forget about the bat. Were there no tools in the car, like a tire iron or something? I didn't see her in the car's tire. Really, why wait until you are bitten and dehydrated and your son has seizures before you take a stand against the animal? <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, she was snapped and torn, but still heels were wearing high heels!
