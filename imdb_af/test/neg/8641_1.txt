This film is absolute rubbish and goes even worse to the very stretched end! <br /> <br /> The plot is confused and intrusive, the actors have a chance to give less attitude (perhaps they are paid in advance - bad move, or knowing they won't be paid) and the sets were unreliable , boring and cheap. <br /> <br /> I fell asleep twice and actually decided not to save the last 5 minutes, as I assumed the actors had almost fallen asleep. More irreparable longevity wasted! <br /> <br /> If you have to look at it, take it to the bedroom and forget about the sleeping pills once. But maybe you need an antidepressant! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is good if celluloid degrades.
