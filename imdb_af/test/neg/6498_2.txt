This movie had the biggest advertising campaign any movie ever had in Russia. "Epic film about Russian culture", "Great saga of Russian spirit", endless articles and interviews. For me, this movie was the biggest disappointment. The main character of Oleg Menshikov is a stupid, immature boy who is ready to erect his comrades because of a woman who doesn't even look like a woman. What is there to admire? In the first part of the film the story doesn't develop at all. People's festival scenes seem like talking about Russian folly. <br /> <br /> I respect Mr. Mikhalkov for his previous works, both actor and director, but this film only shows his ambitions to be regarded as the "Tzar" of Russian theater. .
