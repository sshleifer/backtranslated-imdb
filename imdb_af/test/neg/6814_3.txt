Very strong, very murdered, no real drama. Why not just make a documentary? It's not exactly the passion of Joan or Arc. The only reason to see Chronicles is to hear the performances. I love Bach's music and even I found it difficult to pass through this misery of a movie. The great Gustav Leonhardt plays (in two sentences of the word) Bach. We don't get much of a feeling from him as an actor, as he is so few to do dramatically. Usually, he gets deliberate or angry from different rooms. Of course, Bach's life was not an Errol Flynn movie. It was indeed quite dead and more than a little difficult. It probably means that life is not a great candidate for a movie. Of course, the music is another story. I recommend the stations of Bach. Much more information, for one thing, and some insight into the music, which is why Bach is primarily interested in us.
