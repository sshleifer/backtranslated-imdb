I have no idea how commentators regard it as a decent B Western. Or how one commentator said the plot was more coherent than most. Nothing can come further from the truth! This movie is one big non-sequitur! This detracts from the noble B Western movies of the 30's. I saw many of Wayne's early Lone Star and Republic westerns, and this one is easily the worst. <br /> <br /> The bad guy is known as The Shadow - to cry out loud! Initially, the shoulder's scheme keeps open-circuit stage coaches. At the same time, she stirs all the cattle in the area. Then they decide to go to the robbery. To do this, they have to fire the town with a machine gun - no explanation as to why it is needed or how to get that neato little toy! <br /> <br /> No single scheme is revealed in enough detail to suggest a plot here. The shadow is, of course, just a generally bad man with all kinds of evil schemes. <br /> <br /> He gives his instructions to his gang through a false wall safe. (Knock knock, who's there?) He's apparently brighter, because when his henchmen have to talk to him, they knock on the wall, open the safe and - PRESTO - he's there. (I can only imagine that he met them face to face and said: "I have a few secret, ominous instructions to give you about our next evil act - meet me at the wall safe and I'll give them to you. "Just because the shadow requires security to communicate with its army, like most of the elements of this mess, is never explained. <br /> <br /> He has a fine tunnel to the ol 'cavity Stomp across the street from whatever view point, several of his bad things do murder. He also has a hidden panel, NOT in his secret camp behind the false safe, but in the main room. <br /> <br /> When he is not behind the safe, he hangs out on his cow-less rancher Matlock. We learn that he killed the true owners of the farm - two brothers - and adopted the identity of one. The daughter of the dead brother recently arrived from the 1930s NYC (judging her wardrobe) and she never saw her real uncle because he doubted her too! <br /> <br /> If you thought bad guys always wear black hats and good guys white hats, you should see this movie. Here, the good guys throw their hats in favor of white headbands that make them look like they all had head wounds before any shots were shot! It's like a game of basketball. Only Wayne had their bandanna tied their heads instead of just taking off their shirts. Perhaps the strangest of all is the end. Immediately after we suppressed the shadow and his gang, we jump far enough in the future to see Wayne and his wife (the former cousin) on the foyer of their home. (Remember that there is scant romance.) Yak plays with Wayne's 3-4 year old son, dressed in Injun robe! (Hiyoo, fun fun!) <br /> <br /> Thanks to this nonsense, Wayne became a screen legend. Only a superstar (packer or not!) Can rewrite this entry in a movie resume. Long live the duke!
