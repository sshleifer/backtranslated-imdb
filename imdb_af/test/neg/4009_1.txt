It has a bit of that indie queer edge that was hip in the 90s and that puts an explicit sales date on the visual style. Characters are uniformly apathetic and disturbed. Street hoods in Greece carry new clothes out of the box without skins or stains. They all seem to be visiting the same marine hares. All uniformly display the same low IQ when making their subordinate underground business transactions. When things go wrong, they are all because they are not true Greeks - they are pastoral sunshine boys caught in a strange night city world. Make a huge bunch of disgruntled immigrants, but never mind investigating the problems with Russian / Kazakh / Albanian cultures. If Giannaris had the right perspective on this project, it could have made a wonderful Bel Ami production. The volatile can of toned beef is the only spark in these generic small-time driver programs.
