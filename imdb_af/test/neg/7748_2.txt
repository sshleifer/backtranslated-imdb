This movie has a very complicated plot and very confronted environment, which I honestly couldn't follow. This is surprising as the acting and dialogue could only be the product of a kindergartener's writing. If you like Kathy Ireland, you might want to see it. The movie was probably made as a vehicle to get her to Hollywood, but if that was its purpose, I would have to say I hope she hasn't invested too much money in his production.
