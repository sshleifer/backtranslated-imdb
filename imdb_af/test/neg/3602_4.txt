What we have here is the standard Disney that goes directly to the DVD sequel, where I can expect babies to be cut in all areas, resulting in a cute animated movie that is very short of the original. It's not to say it's a horrible movie, it's just that it's a very mediocre movie, full of preaching messages meant to show children the virtues of friendship and to be good to one another and unless subtly done (which it is not here) adults can quickly become timetables. The film has a very thin plot line with Kronk to win the approval of his father and eventually find the true meaning of wealth and success. It has comedy moments, but is really enough to carry a full-length movie.
