Fun With Dick and Jane fails to entertain at so many levels. There were loose points with the writing. One of the major conflicts seems to be the claim of Jim Carrey's character, Dick Harper, but the authors never follow that particular conflict. Basically, the story is poor and mostly unsuitable, but Carrey saves some scenes with his physical humor, but frankly, Jim Carrey was not very funny in this movie, and Tea Leone might just as well appear for her because she not that is not funny either. This is just another example of Hollywood banking from franchise actors with a fun, non-original story.
