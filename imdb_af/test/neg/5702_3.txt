It's funny how instinct warns you of something. For example, once the company credits read Nu Image, I instinctively knew that I saw somewhere a real shit movie by them, but couldn't remember where. Yet I just knew JUDGE AND JURY were going crazy and it was. Maybe I'm psychic? <br /> <br /> !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> The opening is pretty violent with several people being blown away for no reason other than to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. I do not know about you, but nowadays I am getting upset with a bad language with disturbing violence, especially if it is badly mocked by the actors like this one in this movie. Anyway, the plot turns around the bad man being executed, and comes back to revenge on the man who shot his wife. Oh, did I mention the bad guy and his wife killed some people on their wedding day? Yes, he is a serious badass mofo. In fact, he is so bad (and I don't mean the acting - I'll get it in a moment) that he is impossible to take seriously and that is before he is just carried back to Elton John, Elvis, A French chef etc. I wonder if Keith David paid for this? because he seems to have so much fun on the screen, this is the only reason he plays the role. What a pity this reviewer did not have a pleasure watching JUDGE AND JURY. Hey, maybe the producers can send me Keith's fee? Gawd just knows I deserve it. <br /> <br /> I didn't like this movie as if you're not guessing and my head is not with the stupid plot or the cheap production values, but with its attitude to violence. If I cracked you a wine bottle over your head or kicked in the ribs very hard, you will know that violence is an obscene painful thing, but JUDGE AND JURY will believe that if you are thrown by hand a window , crashing through a few bannisters and falling 20 strange feet on a table, not only will you be untouched, but you will be able to overcome some racial devil dogs. It can be argued, of course, that any film with Sly, Arnie or Bruce also suffers from the same dishonest performance of violence, but with JUDGE AND JURY it has chased my chain
