When I watch this movie, let's not say I have high expectations. But just that I had a slight hope that this full-length feature would have at least some of the hilarity and whiteness of the TV's Da Ali G Show. <br /> <br /> But as expected, it can't be translated a half hour TV program for a 90 minute movie. The movie had no appeal, and it was completely applied to toilet and young sexual humor. Basicaly, I had to go halfway through it, but was stupid enough to think that it could somehow improve, how wrong I was. I loved the show, but hated the movie. This movie is just for those who find the valley through dog sleds amusing ...
