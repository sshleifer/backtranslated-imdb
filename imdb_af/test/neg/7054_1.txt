My brother worked at a cinema when I saw this movie; I saw it for free and still walked out. I saw a lot of movies in my time, but it was the worst. When people ask me what the worst movie I've ever seen, I call this movie in less than one second. This movie is bad because it goes from one lame plot setup to the next, it encourages stereotypes about blacks and the flow is terrible. If you want to see how to make children cry and vomit at the same time, then study this movie. Okay, this movie is not good "bad" but terribly bad. If you're like one of those people watching horrible movies for fun, like me, you can't even make it through this short film. Please, because the love of God destroys all copies of this movie.
