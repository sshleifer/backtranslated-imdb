Honestly, this movie is weak. Very weak. Only main character can do something. She works like a booster on a bad engine ... so, if you like red-colored Valkyrie, see it. But find better photo of Brigitte than Sonja and place it on the desk. It will save you from disappointments. Well, Arnold also does his deal ... but it's certainly not his role. Other characters - bad is not that word. Sword fights? Samples? Ridiculous. Plot is really shy. Why was her rape needed? Especially, we don't see it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, movie is weak. Although worse movies exist ... Without main characters it would just be ******. And if anyone even discusses it, maybe ...
