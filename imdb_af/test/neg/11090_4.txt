Julie Delpy starred in this horrible movie about a sadistic relationship between a father and a daughter in France of the 14th century. The film attempts to break the romantic knightly image of the heroic medieval knight by showing a rather arid image of the period, defined by psychological dysfunction and violence. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with a child, François, growing up in the shadow of the Hundred Years War, told by his father to keep his mother safe and waiting for his return. François does action when he discovers his mother with a lover in bed. François killed him in the name of defending his father's honor. As a father like a boy, François grows up and leaves his family, even after the same war. This setting is a bit of an explanation for the events that come, because on our way home we are already seeing something wrong with François. The war didn't do him well, he changed. <br /> <br /> The daughter, Béatrice de Cortemart (Delpy), is waiting for her beloved father to return from the captivity of the English. She is pure in heart and she is left to care for the estate while her father is away. In her absence, Béatrice has to deal with financial problems, which reinforce Béatrice's hope that her father will return to save her. But on his return she noticed that he had lost the will to enjoy life, and he tortured and humiliated everything around him, even his own daughter. From these aspects, the film shows different ways in which François makes his family painful. Begin with the humiliation of his own son, ending with the rape of his own daughter, Béatrice. <br /> <br /> Supposing the film in the Middle Ages to soften the bladder, as the viewer can tell himself, that this kind of violent acts was held in difficult times. And indeed, many movies on the subject of Incest, like Tim Roth's "The War Zone (1999)" that was contemporary, were more shocking about it. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Delpy appears in several daring nude scenes. Indeed, she looks angelic and beautiful. <br /> <br /> I was irritated when I saw some animal torture scenes. I believe, and it is not confirmed, that some birds were killed for making this movie, which really upset me. The quality of a movie falls if real violence is used against animals. I hope this movie will be released again without such cruelty scenes. These scenes do not contribute much to the film story. <br /> Overall, the movie is too long. The writing is problematic. We didn't get to see François and Béatrice before the war, but we didn't really get the answer why he was changing so badly. I would have passed this movie, but I have to mention a few scenes that made this movie worth watching: <br /> <br /> * Scenes from a young child who can kill in cold blood are really shocking. I saw it for the first time at "City of God (2002)". Here, François, his mother's lover, while his father left the war. Excellent scene and very graphic. * The screens of Béatrice raped by her father until she finds out she is pregnant by him is really shocking and interesting. The scene after the rape, where Delpy burned her nappies and cleaned herself. She asked her brother to kick her in the stomach, hoping to have a miscarriage. <br /> <br /> * The brother of humiliation where the father showered his son's head in the food and humiliated him and then ranted over the war. Later, his son attracted her ladies. <br /> <br /> The movie won the Cesar (French Oscar) for Best Costume Design. I agree, the costumes really make the movie real for the time being. The movie venue is Château de Puivert, a true 12th-century castle and a historic monument, located in Aude, south-central France. Beautiful castle and mountain views, really help you in the time of this movie. The film also nominated for another three César awards, but they all struggled with the great successful French film "Au revoir, les enfants". <br /> <br /> --- Released As Beatrice in New York City, March 1987. It is only tested in France in November 2007. Look at YES3 on May 3, 2007, at 17:45, at work.
