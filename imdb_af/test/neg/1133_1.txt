I was out of town, visiting an old friend. After dinner he talked about his daughter's boy. She is 15, beautiful, smart, athletic, and the young man is also an excellent family, nice, also athletic (if not smart). I told him he could only feel the normal paternal concerns; A few minutes later, however, the young man arrived, with his DVD of this movie, which he apparently had for some time to share with the other. <br /> <br /> These people have a bona fide home theater set-up, with a screen that is more than 4 feet, and the two young people preceded it, while the young swan almost increased. Frame-by-frame. <br /> <br /> I saw enough in a few moments (and with a little fascination in his horror) to endorse all the most critical comments I have seen here. <br /> <br /> I told my friend I wouldn't go as far as disqualifying the young officer on the basis of his choice of this opus - but it certainly seems like he's keeping a shell. <br /> <br /> Some movies are so bad â€” they're good: the classic "outer space plan"; and I think the wonderful horrible Bruce Jenner / Village People, "Can not Stop the Music." <br /> <br /> But this one remains firmly in the horrible category. <br /> <br /> Second / third / fourth "bananas" - even the best of these (eg Tim Conway, Don Knotts, all with Seinfeld) have a lot of trouble performing a later main series (or, like here , movie). And these were great supporting characters in their original situations. <br /> <br /> The "Eddie" character, really at about the 5th or 6th banana level in the previous Griswald movies, has never added much to it. , in my opinion. Randy Quaid is a skilled actor who has performed well. His contribution to the previous "Vacation" photos was at its best average. Both he and the other members of the cast, many of whom have done good work in the past, have achieved nothing for their efforts here, except to deduct a few years' home payments or a few IRA contributions. <br /> <br /> This whole presentation - story, performances (from lead to support) can't be worse.
