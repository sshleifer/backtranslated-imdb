Eliza Dushku is a very talented and beautiful actress. She manages to be the rock-resistant center of "Tru Calling", but it's not enough to save her TV series of mediocrity. It's a real shame that a woman should be as attractive and talented as Dushku with a flattering support role in Buffy the Vampire Slayer to this clunker. <br /> <br /> Onoriginal and desperately trying to be hip, "Tru Calling" fails to be excited at any level above hormonal. The eponymous heroine spends much of her time running here and about what a very small city should be, to prevent the death of good looks from having already met in the mortuary where she works. Despite all the runs she does, she always arrives, she just looks like a portable air-conditioned dressing room. <br /> <br /> In each episode, Eliza Dushku and the rest of the cast are struggling with the bare characterless screens, but this is a senseless exercise. "Tru Calling" just lies on the leaf and looks lifeless at the ceiling.
