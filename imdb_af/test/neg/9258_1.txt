Andy Milligan, the Staten Island movie maker, is well-known in the horror community because he is a worse director than Ed Wood. And with this as a dull example of his output, I can agree with them. In "The Ghastly Ones" we basically have three bitter couples going to their children's home (on a comfortable secluded island) to collect an inheritance. There they are killed one by one and the events unfold in murder / mysterious fashion with a scary cuddly boat added to throw you in the loop. The movie is so bad that it looks like someone just ran it through a dishwasher, the sound is terrible, the dialogue is bad worldwide, there are some primitive mannequin gore (plus some dismemberments and guts) and that is technically unclear in every way it can be unclear. But is it nice in a bad movie similar? Sort of. It is stupid to watch, but strangely, entertaining in a train wreck. Approach with caution. If you're not a fan of horrible movies, you have to die six deep.
