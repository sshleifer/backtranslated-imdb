The first review I saw here on IMDB says Vince Vaughn is a much better actor than Anthony Perkins was in this role. Make me wonder if he saw the original. It is difficult to review Psycho if you do not have the perspective of how revolutionary the film was in 1960. You have a heroine who is not very nice and is not murdered far in the movie and a villain who is scary but makes you feel like him. Add to that a few graphics and you have a blue print for some of the 80's and 90's slasher movies. <br /> <br /> Where's this movie going wrong? Let's start pouring. Anne Heche is good like a Vivian Crane, but if Norman Bates is Vince Vaughn wrong. For one thing he looks too young. Secondly, he has no idea how to play the role. His nervous laugh reminds me of Ron Howard playing a tough guy on Happy Days. Everything he shouts, I HAVE done it! The original movie, even for those who know it all, makes you still uncomfortable with the influence of the mother on Norman, and transforms her into a truly distinct character. What about the shower scene. When I finally saw the 1960s movie on a big screen, I was amazed at his power to scare the shit out of me. Bernard Herrman's score becomes incredibly shrill and hard and continues to scare you as Danny Elfman's synth interpretations at the scene. This shower scene only serves to show us Anne Heche's naked body and some nice color leaves. This brings us the choice to color film. Didn't work. <br /> <br /> There is something about the renowned classic movies that almost never seem to work. Some may regard it as a noble experiment, but honestly, if Gus Van Sant would not add anything to this film, he had to leave it alone.
