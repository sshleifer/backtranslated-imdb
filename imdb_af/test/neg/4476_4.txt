Talk about your wild life. Barely a B movie, but what the hay ... Corny Sci-Fi and lesbian sex. From the minds of author and director Cody Jarrett, a cheesy piece of fun. A chemical company dumps waste causing mutants in a fish farm. The hot Kristi Russell stars as Dr Barbara Michaels, an EPA agent sent to investigate this environmental dilemma. She just entered a lesbian relationship with bartender Trixie (Ariadne Shaffer) and their love stories are about as good as this movie. A man-sized frog incites chaos; cause a car accident, rape the daughter of the chemical company boss, rape a girl among the bleachers at a soccer match, tighten arms that tackle a runner in the soccer match and rape a nun ... all in twice the chest shot at an antidote is apparently found. The special effects ... well, not special; a man in a rubber frog costume without the genitals to prove himself. Hard tadpoles, do you still want to see it? Continue, but bribe any witness to secrecy.
