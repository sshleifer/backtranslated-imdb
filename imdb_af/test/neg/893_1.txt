I've never seen the first three, but I know they're all better than this ... trash. It's about a child throwing a party. Wow. Sounds great (sarcasm). Is it? Nooo! It starts with a child lying in bed and waking up by his mother. So, the child pretends to be sick, so he doesn't have to go to school. He goes to his uncle's house and makes a few people around and throws a party. I didn't laugh at all while watching this trash. I can't imagine anyone sitting down and writing this dialogue. "Man, that's it! @ # $ Is gonna be big, yo!" Make me wonder if they even had a script for this movie. I watched it knowing it would be bad, but I usually look at a bad movie that makes me feel, because it gives me something to make fun. It just upset me. TWO THUMBS DOWN!
