It's such a crappy movie I have no idea how it got on the shelves, they had to pay the movie store to let them sit down, seriously! The story makes absolutely no sense unless you are on some serious heavy drugs, you will definitely have to do something to look at this total piece of garbage, so much so that you will not mind what was on the TV because you are almost in a coma. The writing sounds like a 5-year-old, and the play is worse than the grade school game. The hidden special effects they are trying to do seem so stupid, which they spent a whole $ 5 to make the whole movie, it looks so! Oh me, that scene with the old woman with an 80-year-old hairstyle and the ugly girls in the rubber suits, me and my friends laughed so loudly. Did anyone actually think it was a good idea to make it into a movie? I find it hard to believe!
