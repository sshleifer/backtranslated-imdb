I don't find this show funny at all. Actually, I think it's much worse than any of the other terrible Disney channels currently taking place. Charlotte Arnold is an interesting choice to play Sadie because she can't act. The jokes on this show are terribly unfunny, and it makes it even worse than the only actor who's a bit (and I mean) a bit of acting Justin Bradley as Sadie's brother Hal. Jasmine Richards and Michael D'Ascenzo portray Sadie's friends. There are both very stupid and just terrible actors. Two words that can really describe this show are terribly grainy. It is wheat humor that only little girls find funny because their brains have not yet developed. Now I explained my hatred for the acting and the horrible humor, what's next? The whole premise of the show is a stupid idea. She changed again (not so scientifically a ben-love) and suddenly no one recognized her? It's moronous. In the summary, I hate this show, but little girls who don't have a concept of funny will enjoy it, so I think that's what they are about quality. Although I can say so much, the first season is clearly better than the second. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: JUST KNOW ANYTHING. <br /> <br /> My review: Awful Show. TV G. 30 min.
