This movie was hard for me to watch. Stan looks very old and sick compared to what I remembered, and Ollie was heavier than I ever remember in another movie. However, the most difficult were gaps in the script / production where I found myself: "How did they come from here?" It took almost half of the film before I could handle the dubbing of non-American actors - it was also a distraction. <br /> <br /> Although I miss big actors like Laurel and Hardy, will there ever be big actors like that of the old studio era ??? - This movie helps me understand why actors sometimes "bow" in their prime.
