This movie is a cash deposit. A cash relies on an exciting theme created for previous classics. Yul Brynner has been playing the ship long ago and therefore has the most production values. Lee Van Cleef takes over the lead role of Chris. I can't think of any actor who looks less like Brynner than Van Cleef. Hey, he could at least shave off his hair and lose the mustache just for the sake of continuity. Some correctional centers show this movie to punish offenders. One step out of the line and The Magnificent Seven Ride! is brought forth and worked. They didn't even try to make this movie, didn't look like a TV movie! Abysmal.
