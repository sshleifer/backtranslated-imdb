Sometimes I wonder if today's horror movies rely on human torture to scare people. If so, then there is a sad future for horror movies. Dee Snyder tries to scare you and scare you, this movie does just that but not in a good way. Now there are a few moments in the movie where there is a chance that Snyder saves this movie to fall into a hole, but let's face it, this movie didn't fall into a hole, it was already in a hole and sinner make no attempt to bring himself out of it. When you're done with this movie, you're sick, depressed, dirty and insane. I have a feeling the intention of this movie. What is lower than dirty?
