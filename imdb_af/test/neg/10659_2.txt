The pace of this movie is quite slow. It takes about 70 minutes to get Katie to China (which we know she wants) and leave 30 minutes to solve things. The storyline is so predictable that you know everything after about 5 minutes. Nothing surprised you. I think the movie is an upcoming movie, but the movie is full of stereotypes that are completely over. <br /> <br /> Katie - A beauty that realizes watching, boys and shopping isn't all. She realizes that she can "feel" and "see the real world". Touching. <br /> <br /> The mother - high striped, nervous, screaming mother (wow very innovative) needed by a strong man. <br /> <br /> The father - patient and always understanding and caring for the most inept woman. <br /> <br /> The boyfriend just wants to get in her pants. <br /> <br /> The comedian clown Chinese man who doesn't know how to speak English properly. and made a laughing stock. Thoughts Hollywood dropped those characters in the mid-fifties. <br /> <br /> The nurse who sometimes knows how to get to China is that the next moment is a carbon copy of the mother, a woman who doesn't know the situation or anything. <br /> <br /> The distorted Chinese girl who gets help from our westerners and becomes a beautiful girl. Because in China (a third world country according to the film) nothing and therefore our charity needs. Make sure there is some poverty in China, but depicting the help of Western countries (read the US) is so shallow and happy that it is. is sad and rebellious. Shanghai (where the film is set up) is currently the most growing and developing city in the world. <br /> <br /> The Chinese father, who is so nice and kind, finally has one wish ... to be a cowboy with a white hat ... <br /> <br /> The teacher (Sean Astin) has this heartbreaking story (not) that he tells without feeling. Why Sean? WHY !? <br /> <br /> Even so. It's really hard to find a "real" person in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It's nothing but a good movie for Americans under the age of 15. If you want to learn something about the world watch, for example Hotel Rwanda instead. For a better life story or a lifetime movie, I suggest that you won the Italian "Cinema Paradiso" that awards the best foreign film academy a few years ago. <br /> <br /> The only nice thing in the movie was the small town cuisine capturing some (not all) of the beautiful Chinese countryside. I was there and saw it.
