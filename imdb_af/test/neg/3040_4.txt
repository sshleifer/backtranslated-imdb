Simon West's 1979 horror class remake is a pathetic effort to bring old schooling to a contemporary audience. Starring talented teenager Camilla Belle, When a Stanger Call is unable to evoke even a shocked, or even surprising, face. Poor attempts to frighten the audience range from vague coats that look like people building up the tense music for a cat out of the shadows. The plot follows Jill Johnson (Belle), a teenage girl who has to pay an account to her father via babysitting. She is invited to work at a house by the river for the night, and thinks it's a very easy way to make cash. But little does she know, a stranger sneaks into the house and constantly touches Johnson via the phone. A pathetic excuse for a movie.
