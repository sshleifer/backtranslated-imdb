Oh, dear. This successor has a mirror, this time, housing the evil spirit of a psychopath who killed a whole family with a shotgun in the Amityville house. The mirror caught the entire ugly incident of the horrible family who didn't have time to prepare their uninvited guest. The mirror is given to a photographer, Keyes (Ross Partridge) by a bum (which just as happens to his skinny dad, and the man responsible for killing the family) and that is evil soon to terrorize a cage. like Keyes' painter Pal Suki, depicted by Julia Nickson-Soul, where he lives when they look at it. Soon Keyes had nightmares, looking through his father's eyes while he was blowing in the face in the family in cold blood, worried he could follow in his footsteps. Soon he saw other incidents through his father's eyes, as those terrible daytime puppets tied his mother's head to the floor of an institution or had a moment in the cell, as doctors had given a drug to immobilize him. <br /> <br /> Reasonably solid support player who earns better than he defends in such a litter as David Naughton (American Werewolf in London) as the owner of the cage with which Keyes resides, Richard Roundtree as an eccentric sculptor / artist, Terry O'Quinn as psychological detective, and especially Lin Shaye as a hilarious, rather strange secretary nurse in the asylum (.. the one who held Keyes' father) will soon be closed. <br /> <br /> Rounding off the movie, the sexy, bitter Lala Sloatman as Keyes's supporting friend, Barbara Howard (Friday 13th: The Final Chapter) as Naughton's betrayed wife (.. he was on the point to start a relationship with Nickman-Soul), Jack Orend as the sadistic enemy who tries to evoke his son in the murder innocent people as he did, and Robert Rusler (a nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge) as a rejected lover (.. of Nickson-Soul) experiencing an unfortunate downfall while dismantling paintings as a revenge for his dismissal. /> <br /> This movie is a bad special effect movie that only uses the Amityville title as a cash. The franchise has never been so nice to start with, but since every successor was green, it got worse and worse. After the third film, furniture from the infamous house "owns" items that plague people. The throw, however, tries hard, but the material (.. a mirror that causes chaos and murder by supernatural means) lacks quality. And the mediocre special effects don't help. O'Quinn, as little as he has to work, shows why he is such a good actor. He can even shine in the rash like this. Everyone is not lost, you will see Sloatman always wearing super short skirts (or her husband's shirt in underpants), pointing her legs straight. He must get a silver lining somewhere. Believe it or not, AMITYVILLE: A NEW GENERATION was the seventh film in the franchise! The coolest part of the film was the portraits of demons painted by Nickson-Soul's artist, perhaps inspired by the evil mirror after examining it.
