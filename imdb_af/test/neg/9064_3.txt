Honestly - this short film sucks. The dummy used in the neck is pretty good, but still stupid enough to ruin the viewing experience. The unmanned DVD is crisp and clear and I didn't think it would help or hinder it. If the film was a bit granular, it might have added a "creepiness factor" to what's going on. I have no idea why this movie has so much hype around the subject - but to be honest, the necrophilic scenes in movies like NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q are shocking, though, in AFTERMATH. All this talk about the film is about loneliness and every other way of deep philosophy is bull ****. It is an expensive, beautifully filmed turd. It's not so shocking, it's not so disgusting. if you insist on viewing it - rent it. I give it a 3 for the fact that not many people make explicit movies about necrophilia (there should definitely be a bigger choice for our sickos;) - the filming is good and it has a few gore ones cut open considered gore ... but different from that - absolutely nothing goes for this exaggerated mess. On the other hand - GENESIS - Cerda's "sequel" to AFTERMATH (now available as a dual feature released by Unearthed movies) is an absolute masterpiece of a short movie that really shows what a good director Cerda really does is when he gets the right material. . Although I do not care for AFTERMATH at all, GENESIS is so well made that I will forgive Cerda and will definitely look out for him in the future ...
