The start was decent; the end was good. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie suffers from the full and extreme levels of characters, unrealistic confrontations / fighting scenes, lack of anyone intelligent outside the shuttle. It makes for a terrible middle script. <br /> <br /> Stuff to look for: excessive shadowing, rapid healing cuts, excessive smoky fires, nice belt belts, delayed reactions. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 4, not a 0, because the beginning of the movie has some nice elements of happiness and basic character development. The relationship between the head, dark-haired girl and her fiance is briefly touched, and the placement of the blonde friend's impact on the relationship is present, but uncomfortable. The end-discovered business is becoming increasingly mainstream and well-done, but as another commentary pointed out, it is not unexpected. <br /> <br /> ~ viper ~
