Half of a mystical thriller and half of the broken fantasies of a fragile thought, "Guardian of the Frontier", is an engaging journey that quickly degenerates. Strong imagery and a compelling point of view are soon overwhelmed by incoherent plot, hackneyed dialogue, amateur play, and the most exorbitant and over-the-top phallic imagery in recent memory (here a fish is definitely not just a fish! ). Obviously, this is the first Slovenian feature film directed by a woman. Me. Weiss must be determined to prove she can be as ardent and freely explicit as any man.
