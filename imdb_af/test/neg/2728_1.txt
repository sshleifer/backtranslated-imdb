It is a little hard to believe that it came from the same director we gave HELLRAISER. Where is the style, the vanguard and the charm? I mean, HELLRAISER is not a big horror movie, but at least it has something. NIGHTBREED is like a big ball of bad ideas that are poorly executed. From the opening there is a problem with subtlety: the monsters are shown in the first shot! The open dream order shows too much too much. Our hero doesn't show professional acting skills (but no one expected it from this bastard genre). There are murders you want to interest. Then we have David Cronenberg. The man was never really meant to be an actor. He fills the role of the creepy psychiatrist adequately, but what he had to do was behind the camera and save this disaster. Then we come to Midian, a creepy fake cemetery with an excessive fake gate. This thing is not a big improvement over the graveyard in PLAN 9 FROM OUTSIDE SPACE. It gets worse when we meet the creatures in it. There is nothing really wrong with the character design and makeup effects here (well ... except for the man with no scalp, the man with a pointed chin and forehead and the thick man with dark circles around his eyes) problem is the way they act and the terrible dialogue they gave. Barker's underground city photography is tired and this part of the story could be made much better. Some may mention what follows SPOILERS. After our hero dies and becomes a nightmare, we wait to see what he will change (there are things flying and werewolves), but when the time comes for him to change, his hero seems too beautiful is a decent creature design. In turn, in Cronenberg's "character", the story becomes less interesting to the battle of freaks versus norms (which are just bad). Barker's mythology failed him here. There is no genius and little originality behind any of NIGHTBREED. The picture could have used a bigger budget, a serious script and character design that didn't let you say, "Oh ... oh, how lamb." What a waste. Not scary, not cool, not even dark, just weak.
