I approached this movie with the understanding that it was one of the worst movies ever made. I sat down to watch it with this attitude, and was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> It's not good. It's not even that good; In fact, it's pretty poor. However, it is not as bad as I was led by a long shot to believe. It is fairly incompetent, and apparently as a cost-saving measure, many stock footage is being used, many of which do not have a clear connection to the narrative. <br /> <br /> What is, however, is an intense personal film made by a man who apparently did not have the skills or funding to do his idea justice. Before you write down _Glen or Glenda, you need to explore your own artistic skills. I'd like to draw, but everything I try to sketch comes from like stickers. I'd like to sing, but all I do is scare young children. <br /> <br /> Wood had an idea, and unfortunately he didn't need to make it work. However, it was an incredibly daring movie for the Puritan 50's, but exploding or incoherently it may appear at first glance.
