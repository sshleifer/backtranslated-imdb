The only good part of this movie was the end. You know the part of the movie where the lights come and you go home. No no, it can be a bit difficult - the dance in the movie was sensational but unfortunately this is where the plot ended. As long as the film danced and did not play, the movie went well. As for Chayanne's debut - not bad, but hopefully his next movie will have a little more depth. To see how the movie is waiting for rent or TV. Don't make the same mistake I did and pay 8.50
