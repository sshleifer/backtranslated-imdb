I don't know much about the Marquis de Sade, and didn't read any of his book, but I never imagined it as a flaming queen. Carson Kressley of Queer Eye For Straight Guy, or Jack of Will and Grace, would have been easy in the role Nick Mancuso gave us. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was pretty thin and was more of a parody - or an excuse to show the Paris whorehouse several times with men and women saving a good time on the benches has. What? They can't afford a room? I found it cute that Madame (Irina Malysheva) felt she had done her patriotic duty to look after the soldier's needs. <br /> <br /> The movie was just an excuse to show many breasts - and I mean a lot! Fans of Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) may be interested in seeing him in a different role to Marais.
