If I could give this movie less than 1, I would definitely do it. I read a review of this movie in the LA Times and I walked into the theater and remembered the review. My wife and I were gambling and we thought it couldn't be as bad as the critic said. You know critics. Sure enough ... Give me a break with the horrific acting, horrible camera work, poor use of the budget (it's been mentioned as an excuse again). I worked on movies with smaller budgets that are 100 times better. It's the director and producer who makes movies work - they choose the teams. That's it. If they do not collect it and make it work, it will simply not. So they don't - and not. I don't think they can ... I just had to take the time to write this review ... although I'm sure the movie staff doesn't appreciate this review - I hope I have all of you a favor with My wish for you to do well, but - in another career. Strength.
