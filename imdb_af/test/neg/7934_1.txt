I was looking for ATTACK at Precinct 13. There the movie is so memorable. Who is the star of this? Ethan Hawke or Matt Dillon (I can't tell who's the main actor, it's a big point against the movie) Gabriel Byrne (who didn't need it to have the money so badly?) Drea De Matteo is beautiful but only because of her wonderful body. It took me ages to finally work out she is Joey's sister of "Friends". I agree that the so-called SWAT people who attacked the station are beautiful, as far as tactics are concerned. We have even learned better basic skills than the basic training of the RAF. <br /> <br /> Avoid it, even the snow doesn't want to fall on a bus full of prisoners! Very bad continuity indeed. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague!
