We all have to start somewhere, it was in movies like Escape In The Mist that someone like Budd Boetticher could learn his business before turning out good movies. In fact, the movie is dated before it even hit the movie on June 25, 1945. <br /> <br /> The war against Europe was almost two months away, of course, even Harry Cohn could not see the events of history. So I wonder why even if the public did not question why a Nazi spy ring helps the Japanese. Another very bad historical inaccuracy was that the FBI had nothing to do with the Pacific or Asian theater. The mantle and dagger was the field of the CIS in that part of the world. <br /> <br /> If you're an FBI man like William Wright, it's good to have a psychic girlfriend like Nina Foch. He is going on a mission to the East to deliver the names of major underground leaders to launch a general uprising in China against the Japanese occupation. Germans who crept into Otto Kruger's home learn about this and the whole movie is spent on those guys who have already lost the war to help their allies. Who, incidentally, refers them to 'Japs'. When Foch is hovered by a speed vehicle and knocks unconscious, she dreams of Wright's danger and sees it happen to him at the Golden Gate Bridge. She goes there and foils the plot. <br /> <br /> All the things you'd expect from a beautiful noir movie, there's the foggy atmosphere of San Francisco, the dim light sets, Budd Boetticher tried his best, just like the movie. But they were just not convincing, probably because they didn't have their hands on them. <br /> <br /> It is possible, but probably, that Nina Foch's dream and psychic effects might develop more and the developments were left on the cutting room floor. I think it was just a common script. <br /> <br /> And Budd and Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures had the fast moving events of history against them here.
