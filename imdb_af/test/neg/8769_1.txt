As an avid fan of Christian film, and a person trying to keep a keen eye on improvements in the kingdom of Christian films, I was excited to have the chance to see this movie. I was ready to see something that would make a new point in quality films. I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> The start scene is excellent, though a slight rip-off from Leon - The Professional on the corner, it shows some fantastic movie art in the early runs ... all afterwards almost downhill. <br /> <br /> I was barely able to put through this one, I was requested several times to just shut it down. <br /> <br /> While the play was quite sincere, it was incredibly terrible. But then the heart of the problem was the script itself. The dialogue was worse than anything I've ever seen, and even my amateur movie "The Awakening" (which will soon be an independent film) looks like a Hitchcock thriller next door. (Not much to say.) The bright side of this movie is that it was shot on Sony's brand new High-Definition 900 cameras at 24P. This movie and Star Wars: Attack of the Clones were the first movies to ever use these new technology cameras. Unfortunately, the camera's performance was wasted with bad lighting, poor angles and uncomfortable handling. <br /> <br /> The only good feeling I got to watch this movie was how good my Nuwie Indie movie was watching next to it. ; ) 4/10
