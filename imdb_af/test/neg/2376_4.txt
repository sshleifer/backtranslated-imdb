This Asterix is ​​very similar to modern Disney cartoons. Souless, technically good and the usual jokes for adults. Maybe it's because it's the first cartoon I've ever watched at Laputa: Castle in the air, but it was disappointing. <br /> <br /> The plot is confronted and forgotten, but it involves Asterix and Obelix going to Viking's territory to save a spoiled teen who then learns humility and also loves. Oh, and initially they do not touch, but after confronting them, they all share a deep bond of friendship ... yadda yadda. <br /> <br /> The best thing is to look out for the little jokes. The Vikings are getting the best. Like Vikea (the Viking's wife's wife) gives a list of furniture and skulls to bring back the next attack. Or the Vikings do not know the meaning of grace (literally). Oh, Olaf, the stupid Viking is actually hilarious (so much for the voice that serves as dialogue). <br /> <br /> For example, aboard the Viking ship: (After a speech by Abba, the captain's daughter) Olaf: Who is this new man? Captain: It's my daughter, cod brain! Olaf: Your ... little girl ... a man?
