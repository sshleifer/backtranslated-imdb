I mostly like Lawrence and in Australia I didn't see much of his actions. When I see it at my video store, I thought, yes, I'll look. I wish I didn't see it. Of course, Lawrence had an in-depth experience that opened his mind and I think he wants to share it with others, but it wasn't the time or place. <br /> <br /> This whole experience looked like a motivational speech in hell, it really did. I believe the night's phrase of the night was "driving it until the wheels fall", which he has tossed with mere mysterious jokes that revolve around sex and sexual organs. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I don't mind Don't think, but Lawrence doesn't have the gift to set it up in the fashion of Eddie Murphy, Richard Prior or Robin Williams. Lawrence was just ominous, the only time I laughed was when he revived his experience with the law and his recovery in hospital. If there were minuses, I'd give them.
