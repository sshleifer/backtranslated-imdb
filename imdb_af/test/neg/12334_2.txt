It may be that the movie I saw was completely different from the one the other saw. But if the actors are the same, I can only imagine that the cut I saw in Europe differs from the one that spread in the US. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this was the worst movie I've seen in the past five years. (Now followed by The Waterboy ...) <br /> <br /> Why: Because this director has, in my opinion, taken elements of every excitement this one preceded, they mixed, the wrong music was placed in the wrong order and published. <br /> <br /> (Examples: nothing happens, the music gets scary, and still nothing happens.) The "grumpy" officer, we're so nice that the actor flashes any stage class. Buddy moment to come from nowhere. There is an inescapable scene and in the next scene all the problems are gone. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a smart movie: see Memento. If you want to see a better thriller: see a thrill that reminds you. If you want to see Patrick Swayze: see Dirty Dancing.
