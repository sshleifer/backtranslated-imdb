"Hardbodies 2" is harmless, aimless and plot less. I will add "brainless" to that list, but the movie-inside-a-movie slip, though not very well done, helps to easily escape that label. The landscape has changed from the beaches of California to the Greek islands, and the only discarded members of the first movie are Sorrells Pickard (the bearded man) and Roberta Collins (who at one stage fall into a mud pit, bringing memories to her classic catfight with Pam Grier in "The Big Doll House"). All the other actors are new, but Brad Zutaut apparently has to play the same character (Scotty) as Grant Cramer did in Hardbodies. This sequel lacks the energy and appeal of the first movie, and does not come close to what it does in the "hotness" section. Of course, Brenda Bakke and Fabiana Udenio are both very nice, but the Teal Roberts - Cindy Silver - Kristi Summer team is unbeatable. Hardbodies 2 is not the worst of its kind, but if you just want to see one of these movies, the original is the one you can get. (* 1/2)
