Ultimately, a film about 'El Padrino' and 'Darkness Falls' in terms of pure and completely dull. It's actually the first movie I've ever given 1 out of 10 for IMDb, and for good reason. <br /> <br /> For one, the cast is nothing special. This is usually not a problem for me, except that the only character that is interesting or different in any case is Grand L. Bush's Harrington. Second, the production guarantees that a substandard television sci-fi such as "Stargate" has more convincing sets, and all the underwater scenes that are NOT handled by the SFX teams are filmed on dry sets with "falling particles" which not very convincing. . This film is literally 'drydocked'. The worst part, however, is that this movie is spoiling. For the first 45 minutes I felt like we were around and around in circles: "This is a prehistoric shark." "Bullsh * t." "No really." "Bullsh * t." "I don't make it up." "Bullsh * t." "There it is!" "I didn't see anything." "Let me guess?" "Yup. Bullsh * t." Then it has been rising for about 20 minutes. Then we are back to the dialogue. Dialogue is not a bad thing, but that's all this movie has. Characters speak. This too is not a bad thing, except this movie is not very good at it. The dialogue is often confronted and clicked, and is not very interesting to listen to. I don't see a point that obstructs the special effects; this film has worse features. <br /> <br /> The sets are small and unrealistic. The acting is subpar. The script - oh Lord, the script - is worse than a rubbish of scientific television. It makes you wonder where the budget of this movie was or was. <br /> <br /> Another horrible, horrible addition to the "Megaloadon" (there are about four) series of movies. Bring Steve Alten, please ...
