A vacation on a boat, a married couple, a vicious waiter and a shipwreck is the reason why these movies start. <br /> <br /> I like boobs. No problem about that. But when the main character is ally with whom most of the fish is at present, mostly by having sex with them and playing the role of the continuing victim, my anger only comes on a whole new level. Take two guys (a man and another man), put a pure bomber in the middle of them, advertise a deserted island, pull off all her moral issues, add a lot of moral issues to the men and mix it is in a huge bowl of arguments, fish and a zippo lighter and you will come up with a piece of rubbish film like this. <br /> <br /> The play is, if I say, good. There are some bloopers, but not as far as I could see. The main female character makes me sick. This is due to her lack of moral values. The man with the most fish gets her attention. Although one of them is her husband, she sees no problem with being (Manuel) the other man unfaithful because "I have to do it to survive." How can you justify having sex with another man for fish if your husband is 30 meters away? And he won't benefit from that? The female character has absolutely no problem justifying anything she does. If she doesn't accept her actions, she's a victim. <br /> <br /> I recommend everyone to watch this movie. It's the kind of movie that's just about everything else that you will see a pleasant movie experience this year.
