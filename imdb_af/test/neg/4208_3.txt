As for quality films, it is not one of them. This is actually the first Chuck Norris movie I've seen and I was pretty underweight. The battle scenes are slow and do not have much variety. Norris uses just a lot of roundhouse kicks on all the bad guys who come to him that make the battles pretty boring. The movie is also very short, but the movie doesn't even look like it ends. This is a nice anti-climate end. Yet I have watched many bad movies, and that's not one of the worst things I've seen. It's worthwhile to appreciate a watch, especially for Norris fans. There is also nothing like seeing a group of uprisings that have been hurt in the desert, which I think was the highlight of the movie.
