It's not a good movie by standards. It is very poorly written and the acting is just a little over (some performances are much lower than it is, but Swayze and Gray do a very good job with little to work with.) What was good: <br / > <br /> The dance series are very well choreographed. As mentioned above, Swayze and Gray were high points. <br /> <br /> What was bad: <br /> <br /> The writing. The "bad" guys were simply too angry to be credible. The best villains are those who aren't so angry. These guys (the owner's cousin, the waiter who fertilizes the girl) do and say nothing that makes me believe they can be real people (maybe there are guys like them, but I don't want to see a movie about it) . <br /> <br /> Another scene, the first to meet Gray and Swayze when the employees "dance". Swayze and Gray dance together and seem to enjoy themselves. The next time they meet, Swayze is hostile to her. Why? What happened in between to keep him from her as soon as they danced well together? <br /> <br /> And some of the lines, I mean COME ON (I sounded at the end when Swayze mumbled the line. "Nobody puts the baby in the corner." done a straight face.) <br /> <br /> Another thing wrong, setting the 1960s. Everyone looked and dressed like the 1980s! Who was in charge of the costumes and hairstyles? <br /> <br /> The music (original music for the movie) was laughable (with the exception of "I had the time of my life" which was a good song). <br /> <br /> Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but DEFINITELY the most overestimated
