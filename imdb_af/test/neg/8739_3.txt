To be honest, I never read one of the comics and can't remember parts 2 and 3 at all. I can compare to the first part (Werner - Beinhart) and this one is really disappointing, compared to part1 as well as compared to most other movies I've watched over the past few weeks. The first minute just seams an unnecessary clone of the first movie intro and then it gets worse. There are some good (funny) scenes, but overall, it's just another boring two-day test of the German movie industry that can't succeed (almost as usual). One good thing: The movie is pretty short (75 min.) The bad thing: it just contains story and jokes for 45 minutes;) -> Don't see it
