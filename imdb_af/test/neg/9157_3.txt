A true yawner and a bad movie even for the Chan series. I like a good Charlie Chan movie or even a pretty good one, but this one falls short of the point. Charlie is told to try and find out the murder of a scientist working for our government when someone in the house might have stolen another's plans. The mystery is many pedestrians and the play doesn't cost much better. The only saving grace for me in the film was the presence of Mantan Moreland as Birmingham Brown. He gives the film a little comedy and has a few good scared faces, but then the stickers are a little slim. Benson Fong is here as Tommy Chan and couples with Chan's daughter of all things. What about Sidney Toler? He's pretty decent, but looks like he's wearing the movie. What I noticed most was the way the movie was shot. Chan director Phil Rosen, of whom I like most of his entries, uses very long shots without any action (like Charlie's first step outside in the house). Why? The movie is only 64 minutes long to cry out loud! Shots as it says to me the director had to fill time, because the writing was even weaker than he used to. It's probably not the worst Chan movie ever made, but so far it's the worst thing I've ever done.
