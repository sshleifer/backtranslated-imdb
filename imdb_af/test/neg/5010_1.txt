I tried to see it, and was very disappointed. Don't expect intelligent and insightful humor, because Amy's brother David is in the midst of this drink ... it's the polar opposite. But if you are in the jaw, flee and joke, you'll be in the seventh heaven. It is a bathroom humor aimed at those who have had several bongs, who can only explain why many ecstatic judges have named this crap as "the best television ever". I suppose those who hate such simpleton humor could not look long enough to give a review, but I just send a warning to those unconscious viewers looking for high-end comedy. Exceeded the characters. The shock factor is set to 10. And the laugh is set to zero (unless of course you are looking for a young, low-brown mood.) <br /> <br /> I did it by 40 minutes and prayed all the time would turn the corner into worthwhile entertainment, but unfortunately it just got worse and worse. And beware of Amy's ever-present and hammy-exaggerated expression - this will make your eyes roll. It was nice to see comos by recognizable comedian actors I enjoy, but I can only assume they have agreed to participate in the Sedaris family. <br /> <br /> For those who loved it, it's a pity. This is my opinion. It was so bad that it inspired me to write my first review.
