I watched this movie for a while and the only thing I can remember about the movie is how absolutely terribly bad it was in my top 5 worst movies I have ever seen. And to think I had to persuade my friends to get this movie. from the video store, my reputation has been shot because of this movie, will my friends ever trust me again? I doubt it, they always say nothing judging, it was right when I saw the cover after skins / gang boys I thought wow it looked good as it had a load of skin heads on the front that rattled with metal bars . Don't see this movie. I can't think of anything else to say that the play is bad. story is bad, it's just bad.
