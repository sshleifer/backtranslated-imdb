This ...... Movie .... Is ..... horrible !!!!!! You won't believe this drunk of the litter is even a movie! Critters4 was better than this !!! And Critters4 was pretty worse! A lot of stupid teenagers fall into a desert, find an old run-off bungalow, and finally frighteningly bad stop-motion animated spiders. Pardon my French, but the acting was bad like hell !!! The person who wrote it didn't even know what a spider was, because he had the spiders in a colony serving a queens queen ripoff queen spider! SPIDERS DO NOT LIVE IN COLONIES !!!!!!!!! THIS MOVIE IS A STREET OF DEBT !!! In the end, the marines suddenly pop out of nowhere and kill all the spiders without even being called !!!! If you see a copy of this movie at a video store, print it in petrol and throw a match on it !!
