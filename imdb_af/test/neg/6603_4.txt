I grabbed La Bandara because it reunited Jean Gabin and Julien Duvivier, whose Pepe le Moko is a noir masterpiece. I will give it a few points, because Gabin is in it, but the clumsy plot, cheap sets and the ridiculous Annabella like an Arabian princess, put the movie on me 'sell' rack. If you see it, you will ask yourself, why did the idiots not build the fort around the pit instead of a deadly few meters away. And why use tin roofs in the middle of the desert? But by then, the mere perversion of oppression that constitutes the writing should despise you for further consideration.
