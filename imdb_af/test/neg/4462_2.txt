If you first saw this movie with Mary of the Fourth Form, then it might be possible to encourage the nostalgia of your love side. If not, it doesn't stand a chance. The young thing's hipspeak is utter nonsense, people can use the opportunity you will hear here, but not large groups of them in sentence to sentence. It is not so much that Dracula ripped it off in 1972. From the moment someone under thirty opens their mouth, it is impossible to take the film seriously and if it's a laugh, it's not even a smile. The idea of ​​throwing Dracula into modern times is a good one and worthy of a much stronger writing than Don Houghton can offer. The Thames and Chelsea Male are not a game for puppet bats, model castles and dreaded extras, but you can't help but feel better writing would have been so different.
