Wrestlemania 2 is the only Wrestlemania | thank god | It is held in three different locations, and although it was an interesting idea, it didn't really work. There are only two games that really came out, and the rest are pretty, or most of them, pretty awful. There are some entertaining celebrities on hand, such as Susan Saint James, Ray Charles and Cathy Crosby, but the experience was a waste of time for the most part. The British Bulldgos Vs The Dream Team game is the price of admission itself, but you can honestly see it. <br /> <br /> Matches. <br /> <br /> Nassau Coliseum. <br /> <br /> Paul Orndorff Vs The Beautiful Muraco / W Mr.Fuji. For the time it had, and despite the crappy finish, it was surprisingly portable, with the crowds really in it. Crowd of chants "Bullsh * t" at the end. It is said that it did nothing for either his career. Match ends in double count with those fighting outside the ring. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Intercontinental Championship Match. Randy Savage | C | Vs George "The Animal" Steele. Not so great wrestling wise, but heavy entertainment because of the people involved, and some great comedy from Steele, except barbarian, can grapple a potato and make it look interesting. Savage wins when he puts his feet on the ropes, for lever. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> Jake "The Snake" Roberts Vs George Wells. For a discarded match, it was better than it should have been, but it is too short to make any impact so ever. Roberts wins with the DDT, which looks up the snake, despising Saint James. <br /> <br /> Boxing Match. Mr. T / W The Hati Kid & Joe Frazier vs Roddy Piper / W Lou Duva & Bob Orton. A great failure in my opinion. I was bored these days, and although it may have been a marketing success, it certainly has failed me. Many Rowdy fever are also noticeable. T win by DQ, when Piper T. <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Rosemont Horizon <br /> <br /> Women title game wins. Beautiful Moolah | C | Vs Velvet Miniature. Ending too fast, before even getting a chance to start, make a record for fast pecking, as far as Woman's matches are concerned. Moolah wins when she takes advantage of Velvet's missed splash from the rope. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> Corporal Kirchner vs Nikolai Volkoff / W Classic Freddie Blassie. Great doll for the Corporal. Stupid match up, with boring violation of both involved, while far too short to matter. Corporal wins when he hits Volkoff with Blassie's crack. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Battle Royal. William Perry and André get the biggest pops. These are pretty entertaining things, despite all the NFL talent involved. It's also remarkable for Bret Hart's 1st ever Wrestlemania look. André wins when he walks out of the Heart Foundation. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> Tag Team Titles. British Bulldogs / W Lou Albano & Ozzy Osbourne Vs The Dream Team / W Johnny Valiant | C |. Absolutely amazing game, this is one of the best wrestlemania games of all time. You will not have time to breathe, with all the maneuvers on hand, and the excellent in ring psychology. It's purely wrestling at its best, you can't call yourself a wrestler if you don't like this game. Bulldogs win when Dynamite Kid clashes with Valentine <br /> <br /> 4/5 <br /> <br /> Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena <br /> <br /> Ricky Steamboat vs Hercules Hernandez. Nice decent game here, with both men performing solid performances. Hercules is a nasty brute, with above average skills, contrary to Steamboat's high flying style. Steamboat wins with a high-flying crossbody of the rope. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Adrian Adonis Vs Uncle Elmer. Terrible game, with annoying comedy involved. The fans love Oom Elmer, but I don't. Adonis wins with a rope maneuver. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> The Funk Brothers vs Tito Santana & JYD. Nice solid game here, with very memorable bumps taken from Terry Funk. One by the table was something different for that time. I'll judge it as my 2nd favorite. Funks wins with the help of Jimmy Hart's megaphone. <br /> <br /> WWF Championship. Hulk Hogan | C | Vs King Kong Bundy. Good doll for Hogan. One of the most overheated matches in Wrestlemania's history. Hogan can't push, and Bundy isn't that big. The violence was brutal for the time, but Hogan's superhero activity is kind of annoying, and there are too many boring moments. Hogan wins when he escapes Bundy. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> Bottom line. Wrestlemania 2 is a failure in most aspects. The hard wrestlers have to see it once, but you really don't. There is not enough here to satisfy a true wrestler. Vince blew it on this one. Don't be fooled by the hype of the main event, it's really a boring thing, like most of the cards. Not recommended, and known as one of the worst Wrestlemania's, beyond the brilliant marker title game. <br /> <br /> 4/10
