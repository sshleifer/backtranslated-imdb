Proud as if I'm a Dutchman, I'm really shocked by such movies. Why? why is this cheap play? Why this story just sucks? why a dozen sequels? why o why? they add very hot Dutch chicks to save this film of salvation, and guess what? all the underlying breeches in Holland will see it. I was forced to see it at a party. all the girls got mad when Daan Schuurmans got on the screen, all the guys smiled another beer ... But the thing that really bother me is the fact that this kind of movie is the only kind of movies. Dutch filmmakers can produce ... (apart from "From God Loose" and "Lek") This does not prove our superiority to other countries. It does not add to our imagination. It's just F ** ks in the brain. of the little 13 year old girls ... Johan Nijenhuis, I hope you will burn forever!
