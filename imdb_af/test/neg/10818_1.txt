It may be unfair that I comment on this movie, because for the first time I turned off a movie because it was so bad. I can watch anything, but this movie was so boring. I was bored before I started the DVD and thought it could be a laughable action horror / action movie to relieve the mood. It's not even, it's a device that increases the level of boredom with the power of 100. Shut it off after 45 minutes because everything that happened at that time, some people were diving and a big mole was discovered. Seriously, this movie is not worth it, even if you can enjoy a bad movie as I can, avoid this movie like the plague. Word I've seen for years.
