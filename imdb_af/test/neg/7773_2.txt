If you are a penny for stingy movies and see something you shouldn't watch carefully, it's worth looking at. The story itself is very unrealistic. The dialogue is also not very credible. It is doubtful that you will find yourself with any of these characters because none of them are very nice. the acting could have been much worse. Victoria Pratt is strikingly out of place with the rest of the cast because she looks a lot of potential and talent as an actress. While it doesn't say much, it's one of the best acting performances I've seen of tori spelling. she looks better with age. Overall, this extremely melodramatic movie is mediocre at its best.
