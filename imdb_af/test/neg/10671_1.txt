I have to hold my hand and say that I was one of the first (and probably the last !!!) to see this movie. Where do I start, it's a complete mess. The main attraction was, of course, the soundtrack. It is, of course, brilliant - that's what Himesh does best. But as they say, don't give up your day work - HR should definitely not. <br /> <br /> People's acting is simple and just awful. Even if the movie has a plot, the thing that baffles you most is why this man is on the screen and what hell is doing there. Two words of advice to MH - pay attention to acting and second, use coat rack. <br /> <br /> HR has no screen presence, no acting skills and the female head just looks a little too young for him. As for Malika Sherawat - just the same old Bollywood vamp chess. <br /> <br /> You can pack the product as much as you want, but if there is no dust, it won't last. Don't waste your money ...
