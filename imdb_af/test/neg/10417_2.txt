I like Steve Buscemi. I love his work, as well as an actor and director. You can say I'm non-Steve Buscemi. A Steve Buscemi freak. I like Steve Buscemi. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing Buscemi's full-length director debut, "Trees Lounge". I enjoyed the movie, but it wasn't as good as it could have been. It was just there. It all clapped, itching from the fact that they wanted to see "little" movies about small people in "small" bars in "small" towns. It was close enough where I would say it was a very good movie - one that could have been with some tweaks. But that's right. I like the movie, and I watched it more than once. <br /> <br /> But this review is not about Trees Lounge. It's about "Lone Jim." When I saw the movie's description and when I saw whose movie it was, I was excited about the prospect of finally seeing the movie I knew Trees Lounge might have been. But what I actually experienced was to leave one of those little ones, with a belly full of cheap whiskey and a poorly-stocked, cheap floozy, who walked back to your apartment with a rough brain full of exciting prospects. inevitably in the reality of alcohol-induced impotence and head-spinning regurgitation. <br /> <br /> In other words, this movie left me flat and unmanaged and sorry I lost the time and money it took me to get to that state - the film equivalent to the next morning next to that. wake up cheap floozy, or if you become the floozy, wake up beside those smelly and farting and unshaven imbecile. The film had the contents of an old white bread sandwich (with white bread, no less) and the emotion of a cadaver. I'm not sure what the point of this movie was, and since it was supposed to have some point and was not an exercise in abstract surrealism that can get without one, this lack of a point a sin of failure. Sorta like the new cars that don't come with ashtrays, although there are millions of people who smoke and buy new cars (I'm not one of them, but hey, I can sympathize). Overall, it's a boring movie about boring people doing boring things and has nothing of the grit and credibility that such a movie can carry and store. I mean, Trees Lounge was about boring people doing boring things, but it was interesting. <br /> <br /> I blame a lot on Affleck. Why do people like these Affleck towns? They suck the life out of anything they are linked to. One Affleck was in a decent movie (and it wasn't even the reason the movie was decent) and all the sudden every butthole called Affleck stinks as many movies as they possibly can. And Liv Tyler is no better. Being the daughter of a rock star doesn't necessarily mean an actress. She is as lifeless as Affleck. These people simply don't get out of the flat page of the script. People pay to watch movies and they earn actress and actresses with some charisma. These two dudes don't have the spark of the old guy who pours out cars at Wal Mart. I always thought Steve Buscemi was the kind of guy who would rise above this kind of pablum, but oh Steve, you dropped us. This movie makes me want to put you in another woodpecker.
