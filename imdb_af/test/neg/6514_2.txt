Two LA police are following a series of murderers called "The Family Man" who wiped out entire families and when one of the police officer's wife takes the deep six, questions are raised and a serial killer appears to be not responsible, but rather mobsters. Seagal's idea in a serial killer movie is an interesting concept. Indeed, Seagal can play a good serial killer, but make him a policeman who has a ridiculous fondness for prayer beads and razor bar credit cards become more stupid than just ridiculous. Also, a running joke involves Wayon's enjoyment of eating powdery deer penis and it's good, this racial material is completely out of place. Not to mention the start of a school being taken hostage, because of a boy's break with his girlfriend. After Seagal neutralizes him, the girl tells the young boy she loves him. Now there is a lesson to be learned from this. If you want to take your girlfriend back, the hostage may be able to get you back on track. I would think flowers myself or the old-fashioned call could work, but again, I'm old. Besides who I am to relieve someone's brilliant reconciliation plan. <br /> <br /> * From 4- (Bad)
