Almost certainly storing women's reads lines (very briefly) and gets naked (not very briefly) before an anonymous (and unreasonable) panel - almost certainly producer Charles Band. Thrown in is random scenes from Surrender Cinema's many movies (mainly lesbian scenes). Most of the women like "riding horses" (Hmmm); there is a Polish woman who apparently has no interest in acting despite an audition; 'a' secret a camera that lets movie actresses fall naked behind the screen ... <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Lovell (still making her beautiful) presents some of her own movie scenes and speaks in a "sexy" way to the camera (If you enjoy lesbian scenes, one is included with Lovell and Vanesa Taylor of Femalian and they are probably the nicest lesbian 'couple' ever). Weird apologies for a movie and apart from the obvious sign of naked women, an honestly boring and uninspiring experience.
