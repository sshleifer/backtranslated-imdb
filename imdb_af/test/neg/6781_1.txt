One of the worst shows of all time. The display will begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be completely out of the wall and uncalled for. The fat computer geek was incredible, the bible dump, the bad girl, who are these actors ??? Never heard of any of them except Cole who was totally incredible in that part. Every time he opened his mouth, you expect to hear, "you see children ...". The entry was a grace for this terrible performance. The stories were as incredible as the actors. Lame will be the best way to describe it. Somehow, this show makes a snail like Ice-T more credible than a policeman, and he wrote the worst song about police ever recorded.
