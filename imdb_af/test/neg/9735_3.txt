I was hoping to learn something about this movie, but I was disappointed. It's all about Rommel and lauded him as a great general, but at no time in this whole movie did we ever get an idea of ​​why he was wonderful. What made him so successful? Was it his drive, his reluctance to accept defeat, his discipline with his men? I was looking for a Patton-like version that really came in the character, but it got a little flat. Most of the dialogue is confronted and sensational, and feels old and artificial. There is some good action here and there, but not much. The tail side of the story, which discusses his involvement in the plot to kill Hitler, was the most informative part and probably the most interesting. But as a history lesson on Germany's largest general, it was a failure.
