I was 12 when this film was released and worshiped. The song was inspiring and it made me feel good, and it looked at the theater several times. I actually had the soundtrack album and played the song over and over. <br /> <br /> 26 years later ... I'm ashamed. Just sit and watch it with my 2 daughters who enjoyed it a lot, but my cynical, older-grown eyes hated it. It is very poorly targeted in many places and considering it was directed by Lionel Jeffries, I really enjoyed it. The character animation was so rough, but the backgrounds were pretty good. I remember the critics who at the time said it was a poor film and was horrible, but now I agree. <br /> <br /> It's an old movie yes, compared to what can now be achieved, maybe that's why I thought it was good then. But it does not apologize for its poor performance, direction and sloppiness. The main child's voice seems to be very distracting. Can't really see what they were trying to achieve when it was made, everything that became it was a poor movie.
