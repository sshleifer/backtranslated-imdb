There are some scenes in this movie (such as the hero's first encounter with skurleyesson Shirley Eaton), where it appears that it's about to break sexual taboos and do its point of departure (women want to rule the world by men slaves righteousness, but it never dares. The result is a movie without sexuality and some easy violence. In spite of the cunning plot, the film is not too bad at its peak, where its amateurity passes (terrible editing, over-exploitation of stock image material). Worth seeing just as a curio. (* 1/2)
