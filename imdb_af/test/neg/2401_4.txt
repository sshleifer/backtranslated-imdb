When the American film industry looks critically at their own government, they make sure it looks good, even if it's bad. <br /> <br /> The movie does one thing, it shows perfectly what is wrong with American politics. The motto seems to be with everyone who needs to do things! Mix a US Congress, a CIA agent, a Jew and an Arab ... just to meet the Rusks. Thanks to the US for giving us Osama Bin Laden. <br /> <br /> The disappointment of the movie comes to destroy the issues: the use of images of Afghan children without weapons and the stories of Soviet atrocities and then make a blatant attempt to link propose those and the reasoning behind US aid. Every sensible person knows why the $ 1,000,000,000 was raised ... not the dying Afghan children who are sure. <br /> <br /> As usual, the serious issues in the facade of a troubled dialogue are covered. "Here's for you, you M *** r F ***** s" Hoffmam chants at the end, all that is missing is the American flag in the background and the stupid military solved. The movies can't help but leave the aftertaste of the sense of American pride and delight in how we (the Americans) saved the world ... again. Not even the last 5 minutes of the movie can save it, where an effort is being made to stop praising yourself and waking up that it's just another American F ** k. <br /> <br /> However, the acting and editing were good.
