This is literally the Three Stooges again, without the charm. This show is nothing more than the worst slapstick. I'm surprised they actually have writers. The so-called jokes are completely haphazard and 'controversial' for no other point than very (very) difficult to be controversial. And people think it's 'edgy' ?? Get an idea: This show does not take any thought, time, effort, money or creativity / originality to produce. Any references present are aimed at anyone between the ages of 6 and 16, who will sometimes browse People's magazine. But I think it's just what all the kids want, as needed today.
