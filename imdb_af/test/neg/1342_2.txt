George Cukor's The Women remains one of the glittering jewels of 1939, Hollywood's golden golden years. The film snapped and flowed and it was a subtle touch of men, and was barely noticed because of all the fine entertainment. <br /> <br /> Flash forward. We see Fifth Avenue in New York City, before Saks. Big crowd squeezing along the avenue ... but something is down. The shot only reveals well-dressed (attractive and young) women. If I am Legend, the visual concept continues, in the store and later at a great fashion program. Which NYC fashion show doesn't have at least 5 gay men? The "no men" rule is thrown into our throats, creating, alienating, and distracting an alien world. <br /> <br /> Give Meg Ryan the first time in her garden in the garden with a ridiculous rise with her retro curls. and flailing arms. I immediately went with her husband and could understand why he looked elsewhere. Later in the movie she sits in an older Jennifer Aniston look and holds her arms to her sides. It seems intentional to say, "Look, I can still be relevant!" Ryan's character is loaded with a covenant of miserable friends (adding the gender and city equation here) which, if it were, would despise each other. Annette Bening plays the power rod that realizes that her life's dream doesn't really make her happy. Jada Pinkett Smith is the power lesbian, all with no use for any of the men who are not there. Debra Brass is a kind of baby factory that eats a lot. Eva Mendes is a strange choice for the bad girl to say the least. She looks fake, acts fake and any humor she tries to drop. Someone commented that his trans-generation was watching. Other different stars appear to rearrange the furniture on this Titanic. <br /> <br /> The only thing that would have saved would be the brilliant casting of Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie. They could have named their prize, put their tongue firmly in their cheeks, and took something very clever and profitable. But no, Hollywood thinks too high for that kind of exploitation. Instead, we get this thing that lumbers along with no glitter. Whole parts of the original dialogue are lifted and placed in a scene with terrible results. At one point Ryan called out something like, "It's not a 1930 movie!" No Meg, it's not.
