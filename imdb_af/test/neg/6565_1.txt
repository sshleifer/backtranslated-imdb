I am aware that there are some fans who might like this movie. I'm aware that the idea of ​​"seeking God" may be interesting for some, but it's really boring. <br /> <br /> The movie is just boring. If it gets a little interesting, it becomes stupid. Come on ... Kirk fights against God and wins? How low can we possibly get? The only good role in the movie is the campsite on the first 5 minutes, which is really good, but then the movie becomes boring, annoying, with nothing more than good music. <br /> <br /> Thank God our Star Trek VI. (Oops, Kirk beat him).
