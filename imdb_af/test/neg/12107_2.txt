One can only be completely surprised at this mess of a movie and am amused by some of the raves that people have donated to it. The biggest problem seems to be the director's inability to prevent it from being black comedy, farce or a combination of both. It winds all over the place looking for direction and has some embarrassing effects that are better suited to bad sitcoms. What a shame to see the talented Dianne Wiest's comedian talents squandered and the ever annoying Jane Birkin being over it is more difficult than usual. <br /> <br /> Perhaps much of the positive criticism is due to the "peculiar French" nature of the movie - that's why it's labeled "smart" or "genius". Nor is it. Instead, it's bad trips that leave a rather stingy aftertaste. Dealer-Ivory has to stick to the serious things, because they certainly have no understanding of the comedy.
