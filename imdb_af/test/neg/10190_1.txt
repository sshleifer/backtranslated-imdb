I thought I was going to see a UFO movie. Instead, I saw a movie trying to make the audience (me) make the decision to accept Christ in my life or to go to hell. The whole UFO thing was one big red herring !!! The action in it was pretty pathetic. In fact, it seemed as if some people from an Evangelical Church had just come together and decided they wanted to make a movie. All the characters spoke as if they were in church with other church members. It was not a real dialogue at all. I wish I had read some reviews before I saw this movie, so I wouldn't have wasted my money on it. If, on the other hand, you are to a large extent in the entire ecclesiastical scene, you want to see a demonstration of how to push your views (no matter how restrictive) on other people, then you see it all.
