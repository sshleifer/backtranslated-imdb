I think it's been two years since I saw the movie and to this day it's the worst movie I've ever seen. The only thing I thought after watching this movie was that it was made for a few tax reasons. So after all this time I finally messed up my stomach;) And now IMDb says I have to fill in 10 lines of comment: <br /> <br /> "Sorry, you need to provide at least 10 lines in your comment. The edit window (or use the BACK option if it is not a new window.) <br /> <br /> Please there's nothing more to say ... <br /> <br /> Sorry for some bad english.
