I'm a big fan of the "Vacation" franchise, and I love Randy Quaid as cousin Eddie, and at least some of the behind-the-scenes names were involved in this project (especially Matty Simmons, who manufactures or executive products all 4 of the theater releases, as well as "Animal House". For these reasons, I thought it might be worth the TV broadcast to check out, even without Chevy Chase. <br /> <br /> For the record I didn't expect it to be very good; I just thought it might be a slightly amusing distraction. Therefore, my high level of disappointment is going to prove just how bad this authentic turd of a movie really was. It was sad, jaw-dropping, passionate, terribly explosive. Yet I can't stop looking at it. It's a disease I have; I can't run out on a movie or show on a TV show before it ends. Nothing ever made me back two hours of my life more than this movie.
