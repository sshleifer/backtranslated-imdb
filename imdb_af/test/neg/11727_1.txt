It was shot badly. Looks like a rush, the last minute is decisive. Writing is very poor. Good for the stage, not movie. I feel bad for Andrew McCarthy. He is a very good actor who has not received good roles lately. This role wasn't for him. Maybe it hasn't been picked up yet. This film will stay on the fair.
