Words can't describe how horrible this movie is. Well, maybe they can. I'll stick to it: 1 - Spicy. Hollywood makes more talking animals in graphics. Apparently writing and storyline are no longer needed. <br /> <br /> 2 - Violent. Children's film, yet one of the characters was brutally attacked and killed. <br /> <br /> 3 - Blatant judgment. The film shows farm animals as human abilities. In Nemo, the fish can talk, but for the most part they are still fish. We only hear English as a translation. In Barnyard, the animals actually speak English that other people can understand. <br /> <br /> 4 - Relentless - No clever story line or even clever humor. (Okay, the 13-year-old dog on crutches was funny). <br /> <br /> 5 - Culturally insensitive - The "black" cow is actually played by a black actress. The pink cow is played by a white actress. The black cow played a stereotypical black person. <br /> <br /> 6 - Ignorance - No thing like a male cow I am aware of. I believe we call them bulls? If we were to explode our children to go, it could also be the simplest facts. <br /> <br /> 7 - Boring and Borish. My 4 year old left us after 45 minutes. He almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this movie will make millions, which is unfortunate, because it only proves to Hollywood producers that the American public is generally just filled with pennies waiting to pay $ 8. just to get the children calmly and quietly for an hour or two. An unfortunate circumstance. Why do producers have to spend real money when returns are the same?
