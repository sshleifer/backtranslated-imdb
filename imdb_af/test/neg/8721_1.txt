The Dune miniseries start with a flash forward montage of action sequences. The realization comes soon that it's the * best * scenes from the 265 minutes, and it's not good. Not good. Oh, dear. <br /> <br /> But let's not judge a book (though that's exactly what we're invited to do). Let's give Dune a chance to save himself. <br /> <br /> Well, here is the expected watery opening on Caladan. But who is this petulant, oddly ugly man? Paul Atreides? * This * is Paul Atreides? This generic plastic puppet? And why does he look so old? What is it? The actor's only 25? Well, he doesn't look *, and that is too old anyway. <br /> <br /> But at least he has charisma, right? Wrong. Alec Newman is a stumbling block, mumbling buffoon. I suggest that he be discovered in the dark in a remedial acting class because no one has had enough to tell him that the class is over, and he's just too stupid to realize it. When your Paul Atreides has all the screen prescriptions of the morning toast, and an acting range of "petulant" to "white" your Dune production is doomed from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The other actors feel sorry for poor Alec though, and give uniformly unceasing and incomprehensible actions so he doesn't look too bad. At least, I assume * that's what they do. Because I'm charity, you see. <br /> <br /> To be fair, they are given no direction at all. Random gestures, empty or inconsistent deliveries, missing their points, that's all here. It's like a master class in how not to. <br /> <br /> And surely, there are more elements of the book in this miniseries than in the 1984 movie, but there aren't twice as many because of all that. Breaks. To fill. Time. <br /> <br /> But we can forgive all this because of the small $ 20 million budget, or just $ 5 million per hour. No one can be expected to make quality science fiction on such a budget. <br /> <br /> Except perhaps, "Stargate SG-1" making $ 1.4m per 50 minute episode or "Farscape" at $ 2m. And frankly, I would rather see four episodes of one of them while I am being beaten in the kidneys, but I have to put the foolishness of Dune back into the miniseries.
