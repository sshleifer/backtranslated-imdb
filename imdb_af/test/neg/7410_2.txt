An airplane that some scientists transport and a prototype of a DNA machine, a powerful and revolutionary invention, falls into a jungle in the Pacific Ocean. The insurance company sponsors a rescue expedition, led by Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen), the owner of a large corporation, which owns the prototype, and the father of one of the scientists. There, the group finds the rest of the aircraft five miles away from the expected location and the machine and the remains of the persons. Furthermore, they realize that a Sasquatch, a kind of Big Foot, is chasing them. This movie is so ridiculous that I don't know what I'm doing, and spend my time in this garbage. The direction is terrible, the actors and the lines are terrible, copying parts of "The Predator" and even "The Blair Witch Project". To summarize how bad this movie is, his best scene is when Marla Lawson, the character of Andrea Roth, is wounded and the expedition guide says she needs an injection of tetanus vaccine. Andrea pulls out her jeans, and the guide says, "Nice bumps, but the shot must be in your arm." Ridiculous! My voice is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sasquatch, O Abomin√°vel" (`Sasquatch, The Abominable ') <br /> <br />
