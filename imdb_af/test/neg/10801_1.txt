It's the Sooooouullltakaaaa! <br /> <br /> Wow. What a skin peeling bad movie. Honestly, this is one of my favorite episodes of MST3K ....................................... .... I now need counseling. <br /> <br /> 2) There is no God, there is only Dude. I love the quote from the crow. <br /> <br /> 3) Whatever happened to the nuns who took the bus home, will we ever know? I have a terrible emptiness in my stomach. <br /> <br /> 4) Finally, don't see this movie un-MSTied ... It has Joe Estevez as the lead star. Yikes .. <br /> <br /> 1/10 for un-MSTied 8/10 for MSTied.
