I have to ask myself, movies like this get their support from people related to the movie here and criticize it? How can something so terrible be so high? My parents watched many of the more mature themed movies when we were kids, anything with an R in it until we were old enough. I just remember two movies they had, say yech! when they got home. This one, and "Catch-22". <br /> <br /> The film consists of rogue doctors and staff in a dirty hospital, winding stories, and a packet of inner city residents (who resemble a 1970-year-old Norman Lear sitcom) protest. The worst part is the "murder mystery", a crazy old man who does "God's work" by killing doctors and others. When he confessed, Scott and his girlfriend showed little emotion. They just give him out to get there where he will be "safe and happy". A doctor who is dead to a heart attack is stained as the man so he can get away. Oh, me, what a fun movie. <br /> <br /> This movie didn't "make me think", chuckle or any other feeling than "It should get better", but it never does. People wonder why it was a failure, no wonder here. I wonder how IMDb has enough members who think this movie is good. YECH.
