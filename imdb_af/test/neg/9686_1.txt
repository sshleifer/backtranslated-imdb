Who wrote the script for this movie, the staff at Disney Studios? This is the most relentless adaptation of any story ever! I wanted to laugh at a few scenes and cry on others, and that was just because it was a pity. I should give it credit, it had some funny scenes, but I could spend better time with my evening. Very rarely do I leave a movie after only a quarter of the way.
