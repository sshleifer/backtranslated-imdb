Afraid of the Darkness left me with the impression that several screens were written, too short for a feature-length movie, and then merged into the Frankenstein monster. <br /> <br /> At best, starring, Lucas, is creepy. How difficult it is to draw a bead on the secondary characters is much more sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Afraid of the Dark could have achieved mediocrity if it had only taken one approach and saw it - and it just made Lucas psychotic and confused instead of ghoulish and off-putting. I wanted to see him packed in an asylum so that the rest of the characters could have a normal life.
