*** Minor Plot Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I must confess that Wayne Crawford has a soft spot. I don't know much about him, but he seems very enthusiastic about compensating for his lack of talent. In his films, he usually performs a multi-task - leaving any 3 of the chief, director, producer and screenwriter - story lines of the basement. Despite this, the end product is usually fun for the non-distinctive. <br /> <br /> 'The Evil Below' features Crawford as a down-on-luck captain of a ramshackle boat, a bit like Bogart <br /> <br /> The story begins with an underwater scene with two divers looking for a wreck before being attacked by an invisible being. A bit like the beginning of 'Jaws 2'. The wreck seems to be the 'El Diablo', which has gone down centuries earlier. The ship is manned by heretical priests fleeing Spain, carrying a load of stolen church treasure. This allows the introduction of various links to supernatural forces with Lucifer and The Armageddon both in. The movie title refers to this sunken devilish devil, rather than any malicious sea creatures. <br /> <br /> Any mistakes the movie has (and there are many) it's nice to watch and skill. You can't help as a movie that in the last 5 minutes copy the famous beach tones in 'From Here to Eternity' and the final line of 'Casablanca'.
