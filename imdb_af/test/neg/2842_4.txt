The best thing I can say about this porn horror movie is: Boobies Boobies Boobies! <br /> <br /> In addition, this film is made by a Hindu / Indian man with some background in porn movies or so. <Br /> <br /> Plot: Talk-Show host and girlfriend are stimulated by a psychopath who is angry with the destiny of the homeless and takes it out, you guessed it, beautiful estate agent ladies! (Movies like this are why the 80's films have a rep for misogyny) <br /> <br /> This movie is not really a Slasher, but has the same kind of incompetence and stereotypes: the silly policemen, the villain is an old white male, and the women are busty babes. <br /> <br /> If you like porn horror, it's your movie, otherwise you stay away. (Adrienne fans will see her brushes for a second or two)
