A couple of years ago I saw this piece of pseudo-intellectual shit, and it is now returning to the local movie club. It uses every clich√© in the Intellectual Filmmakers Handbook (Starter Edition) to appear intellectually as the director probably suggests. You get your fast paced pace, brown color scale, slow pans through bombarded environments, empty, suffering facial expressions, over-symbolic images and the necessary unfortunate end. <br /> <br /> It's a complete failure, an unintentional perfect caricature of the typical Russian art film. The director, Aleksandr Sokurov, has an excellent command of technique, but he does not mind. He does not see when he crosses the line in the kingdom of the pathetic. <br /> <br /> This movie is a wet dream for kunshore. It lives up to every stereotypical view of the genre out there. <br /> <br /> If it was bad in an entertaining way, it would be a turkey. But for a movie that is so bad that you go out royally afterwards, we need a new term. This movie is a Sokurov.
