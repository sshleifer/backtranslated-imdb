This movie is so horrible, it's funny, not quite the Troll 2 levels of hilarity, yet it's funny. The acting is terrible, the music is horrible and the story doesn't make a blind sense. The story revolves around a man dressed in a horrible grandmother costume that kills a lot of people at a party. The dead scenes have been done so badly that they are hilarious. One girl is repeatedly stabbed in the chest, but does not scream, try or defend or self or run away. She also manages to stand, despite being repeatedly stabbed. Another dying scene with a rope is also extremely hilarious. No thought to be put in the plot. The grandmother seems to move magic from one area to another (eg, hiding under leaves in a forest world, just where the victim is standing, appearing before someone, though it was ten seconds behind them), people kissing extremely inappropriate moments (If you stop someone if you are chased by a murderous mania) and the double-ended end is completely ridiculous, they just seem to have thrown just to confuse people. I would recommend watching this movie if they love terrible horror movies like Troll 2, The Dreaded of Blood Gnome, but don't watch it if you expect a horrible horror movie, you'll be disappointed
