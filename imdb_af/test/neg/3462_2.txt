OK, where do I start? I saw a screen a few weeks ago and I was shocked how bad this movie is. Probably if you just like Beverly Hillbillies and Green Acres (bad acting) and you think they are the best TV shows on the air, then you will definitely love this movie. I personally like George's work and he is very talented, but comedy is not his fort. Some people are, of course, in comedy and I'm sure he is great to work with personally, but he can't pull off comedy on the big screen. It was a nice movie, but would I pay $ 12.00 to see it? H & LL no !!!! Now that I've seen it, I wouldn't recommend anyone to spend their money. George, friend, I love you, but don't do comedies anymore? This script is lacking, good concept, but just didn't do it.
