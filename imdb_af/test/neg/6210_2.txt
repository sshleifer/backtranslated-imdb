Honestly, I have to admit that I'm going to look at some silly movies based on the hype they've generated or are currently generating. This silly Salman Khan & Govinda feature is one of those silly movies. Well, now we all saw 'Hitch' where Will Smith, as a date doctor, was trying to help find strangers. Then why should we see that Salman Khan has to do it again? In it lies the $ 64,000 question. If you're wondering, Govinda plays the strange ball looking for the love of his life (an unattainable social company) played by Katrina Kaif. <br /> <br /> Lara Dutta plays with Sallu's Eva Mendes and Sallu's true life loves Kaif playing her character as much as every role you have seen her so far, no stretch. And for nearly three and a half hours, we are tortured with spoofs from other Bollywood movies and characters or better, but we're treated to low rate performances from previous hits. Rajpal Yadav co-stars. F
