I look at family affairs, coronation and eastern points on weekdays. Night family affairs are by far the worst, bad stands, bad rows and the worst of any soap, even worse than the Americans and it says something. <br /> <br /> I find it very frustrating that all these shows on uktv Australia "are so far behind the UK and when one tries to figure out the reason for it, they are only ruined with a story that they will show double episodes to catch It is unnecessary to say that this never happens. They finally realized how bad it was - did people stop watching it? Whatever you said is that you are not in tension. Why do you feel that you need to keep everything from your supporters or is it you just do not mind? I feel strongly that you should try to keep your audience up to date. to follow lives. <br /> <br /> I can understand why family matters to come to an end, although we are so far behind in Australia, it is easy to see that the writers run out of ideas for new plots, so many plots are repeated and old episodes come back. I also noticed that as new characters are introduced, a lot of them are really bad actors, as you scratch the bottom of the bar and end up with the dragonflies Vince
