I also waited a long time to watch this movie. As far as I know, it has never been released in Australia, so I finally got a copy on the net and ordered it there. Weeks after my order confirmation finally arrived and I was very excited to finally sit in front of my TV, ready to watch a movie that sounded so interesting and controversial and filmed in an area of ​​the world where so good movies is. What a disappointment. Within the first few minutes I realized I was ordering a B Grader, but was still full of expectation. I convinced my son (18) to see it with me, because I like to share when I find a movie of value with good underlying statements and / or story lines. About halfway through he got up and said he could no longer look at it, it was so predictable and amateur. I agreed but looked at the end. The acting was even gray for B Grade standards. The stereotyping is also predictable and I feel for the good people of Lake Arthur, Louisianna, who has to watch the movie, and thus portray the film. Undoubtedly, there are still racial prejudices in many parts of the world, not just the states, but really, I doubt today whether I will get away with all the ridiculous alibi presented here. I had to double the date the movie was made, as their attempts to film the more horrific scenes were something I expected from a high school student's first attempt to make a movie "indie". I would like to see this movie in the hands of experienced writers and filmmakers, this is an old story, but one that can handle another punch if handled professionally. So disappointed after such a long wait and with such high expectations. The soundtrack was probably the only thing I enjoyed.
