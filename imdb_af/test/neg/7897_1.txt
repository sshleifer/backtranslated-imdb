It may well be the worst movie ever made, in a league with movies like "Howard the Duck", "Plan 9 From Outer Space" and "Ishtar." I don't understand why I decided to watch this movie because it was a waste of my life. I also don't understand why one wants this movie, regardless of their sense of humor. The acting is one of the worst I have ever seen, just like the writing. The characters are all stupid, and there is not one funny scene in the whole movie. Tom Arnold is probably the worst actor ever - this movie proves it. There is nothing worthy of this movie. Don't rent it, don't see it, don't even say it's interesting. It's bad enough, I've seen it.
