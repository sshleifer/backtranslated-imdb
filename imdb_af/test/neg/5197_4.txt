I feel in conflict with this movie - it is one of the most beautiful movies I have seen, and provides insightful look at a lost culture. There was an early scene of men in caps and mustaches sitting around a table, with a woman serving, and an accordion game, which brought tears to my eyes just because it laid down a lifestyle that to be very incomprehensible today. It offers the life of the characters as inextricably linked to the life of the village, another lost concept in today's world. Symbolism is always fun, but it was a bit dated. The fatal flaw of the movie for me was the lack of any compelling dramatic drive, and a total lack of humor. I never felt I knew one of the characters as very basic universal things such as grief over the loss of a loved one, etc. The people were stick figures in the directors' tables that involved natural disasters, war, etc. Had it. The movie was just one nice tragic scene after another, without involving narrative thread and no humanity. Consequently, it was very abstract, irrelevant to the lives of real people. In the end I was bored to finish it.
