The double bill for the horrible Corny "Beverly Hillbillies" is also this atrocious, lame brained 'comedy', 'Son in Law'. Country girl Rebecca goes to wild California to attend the university, just to be assaulted by lifestyle. 'Resident Adviser' 'Crawl' helps her establish, and soon the two are good friends. Bec decided to bring the Wacky "Crawling" house for Thanksgiving, with obvious "fish from the water". <br /> <br /> Steve Rash's only other funny angle is a sexual one. It exposes us to, but to no avail. Both comic aspects fail terribly, and you know the movie is underway as Crawl hides the hijackers and writes its name on the grain field. <br /> <br /> Drama also shortens the movie, with several attempts at family and personal counseling of "Crawl" misfiring. Between them, Pauly Shore and Carla Gugino are able to get a few smiles, but little else, while the rest of the castor is just shoot. The problem is that it's almost impossible to actually like Crawl, and you'll find that you're spending the whole movie and wondering why Rebecca wants to spend a moment with him. However, if you are a fan of unwise comedy, 'Sun in Law' is right on the point. <br /> <br /> Sunday, November 10, 1996 - T.V.
