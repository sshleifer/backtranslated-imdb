it is one of the stupidest movies ever, not the stupidest thoughts, but one of the stupidest. It is 96 1/2 minutes of sleep-inducing material. Probably Jim Varney's worst movie ever. The last 30 seconds of the movie is the best and funniest part, but probably worth the effort to put the whole movie. On the other hand, if you are a difficult Jim Varney / Ernest fan, and then like me, add this movie to your collection. It has short, scarce moments of humor, although they are far and wide. The fact that this movie is so hard to find makes it a collector item and a must for your next collection. I was lucky to find this movie online at a dirty cheap price a few years ago. I believe I paid 1.99 plus shipping for it. And that was the only copy I could find anywhere. Even if it's a real, horrible movie, it's still a must if you're a Jim Varney fan and an Ernest movie collector like I. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this movie a 2 , but that's just because I've never seen one before;)
