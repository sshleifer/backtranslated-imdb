This movie is so irreparably bad, nothing about it makes it worth seeing. NO consequences, no tension and poor dialogue were poorly delivered. Oh, and neither does a CAMP or any FEAR contain it. Do yourself a favor and look at the original Friday the 13th or (preferably) Sleepaway Camp, but what you ever do DO NOT see this movie. <br /> <br /> Even Michele Bauer's appearance at the beginning can't save it. Usually, in such movies, you expect violence, tension, and a bit of gore and some T&A. The violence was poor, the "tension" was laughable, there were NO gore, and the T&A was abundant IN THE FIRST 5 MINUTES, then, NOTHING. At least one of these things, which was properly done, would at least make it lookable. <br /> <br /> To say at least one nice thing about it, Buck Flower is wonderful, he seems to be the only one who understands that they are shocking and eventually building it up. If everybody else fits that tone of voice, it would have been fun, no pun.
