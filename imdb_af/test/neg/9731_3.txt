let me first say I did not expect much, and I first looked at it when the opening evening had helped. I believe it would have been if there were more than 20 people in the theater. <br /> <br /> It sucked so hard. the acting was on his best robot and nothing was really explained until the last 30 minutes of the movie. I think it was their way of turning the plot; keep everyone in the dark on important information to understand the movies towards the end and then explain things and hope it feels like a script. <br /> <br /> Until the end of the movie: -What the Eff is a dark alley? The CG was cool, but I want to understand! - Why can't powers be willing? especially if mass murder is the ultimatum. Why are the powers so willingly willing? just normal to you? -What flight? <br /> <br /> About 50% of the minutes with just men on the screen, were shots of them in women's sleeves, sleeveless t's and then a grim swim scene of all teenage boys in the low-speed skimbo Speedos ever knew . I swear you could see the beginning of one guy. Well, it was close to the soft core. And of course there was a shower, and to mix it up was DUDES. Swap cracks were abundant, a sausage party going on. But there was a single girl shower scene in which nothing was seen and she was about 12 minutes around the nicest dorm bathroom. Then there was a girl talking to PJ party. The other thing I couldn't find was the amount of drive Caleb did in his SUPER COOL Ford Mustang GT. It was a Ford commercial for about 1/4 of the film. <br /> <br /> Don't see it. Or watch it with a friend who likes to make fun of bad movies. then it may be worth it. but don't expect anything amazing.
