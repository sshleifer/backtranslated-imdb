Since I didn't have a TV, and I've never heard of this mini-series, I didn't know what to expect from the Second Coming and it was purely based on his summary, which was interesting. <Br /> <br /> Dear God! (Every word is meant.) If someone told me that it was written by a thirteen year-old class who got the project to make the second coming into a school game, I wouldn't be surprised. <br /> <Why, o, why did they decide to portray Jesus, mark II as an idiot savant? Is there something in any of the gospels to represent it? Good, an ordinary block, but a Great Northern Moron. I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Apparently, all that Jesus did to impress people, his miracles, because according to him, his preaching is sure, because hell never impressed anyone. Surely without the night-to-day stunt, Mr. Jesus Eccleston without a canoe, a paddle or any kind of imitation. <br /> <br /> And the weird little gay controversy set in the wild, without rhyme. or reason. Unlike, of course, Russell blows to his QAF fan base. Jesus appears in the bar to recruit "disciples" (more lascivious northern losers and of course the gay writer's standby - the harp woman, night, night, hiding). Homosexual rights are ripped up to his throat, almost like Russell thought he owed the boys to put Jesus in place. <br /> <br /> I can't really see the true Jesus coming out with "Well, I have nothing in it personally, mate." Only someone who is really middle-class and woolly can imagine that Jesus is so wet. <br /> <br /> Don't start me with the end. "Please come in and eat rat poison, because the only way we can really be free is if God dies." <br /> <br /> It was like an Eddie Izzard sketch of God as Bill Gates. "Hello, I'm Bill Gates, and now you've pointed out to me that my world domination rapes your style, I'll give it all to you, my clients." And of course the rat poison eats. <br /> <br /> Often, I rate the ratings on IMDb, but the high rating on this one takes the cookie. <br /> <br /> Jesus never cares for the new millennium - it is Jesus for mindless MTVs. <br /> <br /> Indeed, God helps us all.
