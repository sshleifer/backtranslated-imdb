1980 was definitely a year for the bad backwoods slasher movies. "Friday the 13th" and "The Burning" may have been the best, but as always there were a few stinkers who are not far behind such as "Do not Go Into The Woods Alone" and this one. But in all fairness, "The Prey" is nowhere as bad as "Do not Go In The Woods", but it's not nice either. One thing is that it's just boring and acting is not very good, but much better than "DGITW". This movie actually has attractive females to watch, all three of the female slides were stunning. One thing that works with all the relentless game material was just useless and it seemed as if the director used it to use it just as well. <br /> <br /> So, what was there to love? This movie? Well, there were a few loud cheeses. I couldn't have a fiction of giggles when the final girl made a bizarre type of backward moon walk to get away from the boyfriend and there were some good screen shots my favorites were the girl suffocated with the sleeping bag ; and the nice look. <br /> <br /> All in all, the Prey is stupid, boring and the murderer I didn't find scary at all. This movie could have been much better.
