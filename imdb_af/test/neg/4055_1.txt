When I see a video like this, I have to ask how it's financed. HBO or Showtime or whatever has to pay for the production company to go through the moves - to get someone who speaks English to get high and approach something that draws a plot, to pay strippers with frightening buzz to to bounce and on dudes' torsos it was very washed, to design people to design and buy light sets, to buy the rights to oriental techno music. But I have to suggest that it should be a vanity project for anyone who serves as an executive producer ... He had to nail all those girls right? And bro is not wrong about the "Spanish looking" girl, but to call the police, "stunning" is very generous. In fact, I want to go so far that they call something very close to "terrible" or "fugly". Looking at these women - sometimes * clearly * high on pain killers - was so far from erotic that my testicles actually went up in my body. Gross. <br /> <br /> Why waste time when there is so much freely available hardcore porn on the internet? I wonder if the popularization of internet video will kill the soft video industry slowly ... One can only hope, right?
