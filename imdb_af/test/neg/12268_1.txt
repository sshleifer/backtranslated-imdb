This movie is one that belongs to the cutter floor. For one, the opening series does not represent the element of "gang" related subject. If it wasn't supposed to then at least they got that part right. Secondly ... with everything left looking and then right ??? they even do it in synchronous style. Nowhere have I seen a member of a competitive crew at a bar, look for someone, look outside as he is, and a bag o slides at a barbie and walk away without even being confronted. . I wasted money on the rent and am glad I didn't buy the DVD myself. <br /> <br /> If it's done by college (T.A.F.E) students, at least they gave it the old Aussie test. Good luck next time.
