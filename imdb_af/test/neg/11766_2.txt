There are some interesting pieces about and about Bruce Weber's preferences and disapproval. Perhaps if a professional editor put it to Biography, I would feel more satisfied. Instead, I spent $ 8 at a movie festival there. For an autobiography, almost nothing is revealed about Bruce Weber, unlike what he likes to look at, shoot interesting people, especially beautiful teenagers and listen to jazz. The director of "Crumb" would have made a much more interesting and coherent film.
