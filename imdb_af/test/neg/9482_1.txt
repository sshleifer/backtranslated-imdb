OK, I watched this movie. Someone has to kick me. WHY should the Olsen twins insist on submitting the world to this bad torture? It was another movie to watch the Olsen twins travel to an exotic place, meet some cute guys, look beautiful and leave everyone over them. The direction, the plot development, the acting. I don't know about the US, but in my country it is extremely silly to walk back 10 minutes on the bike of a man you meet. Although I am now convinced that these girls will never learn to act, I really hope that one day we will get a movie with an original, even slightly acceptable plot.
