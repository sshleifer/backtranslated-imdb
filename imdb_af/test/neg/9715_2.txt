Bad Mike Meyers chose it for his dramatic debut. This movie looks like it was composed by a committee that couldn't decide whether it was a comedy, drama, tension or sci-fi. It starts playing color, then it gets darker soon, and then at the end, apparently shortly after one of the main characters has died, the whole family stands in the backyard and laughs at something. It is totally strange and impossible to join. The acting is extremely uneven, with the older professionals paying attention, and the younger and less experienced actors look like they are in high school. This movie has shown me that it is probably more difficult to make a good movie, as evidenced by the real professional prize we see in the first-and-second art houses. It would be a good movie for a movie class to analyze. Plot, character, theme, consistency - they're all wrong or missing in this movie.
