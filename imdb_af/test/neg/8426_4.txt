I can really say this about this movie. It's DBZ ... like Tree of Might and The World's Strongest, it really doesn't fit in the timeline for the show, although it's supposed to be placed just before the start of the TV series. The action is pretty good in general. The plot has a nice enough base, with a good background to determine why these guys hate each other and everyone. Pretty good in general, there ... The problem is ... there are many very strange things. I mean, very strange things. Like the world's strongest, there is a really strange song in this one that can only be created in a drug-induced haze ... disturbing is the fact that Gohan, while singing, dries himself so much. Creepy. The villains are strange and rather comical ... more than the usual DBZ type - it looks more like a Dragon Ball movie, rather than a Dragon Ball Z movie. Generally, it's entertaining enough, but ... just ... funny.
