The dog can act ... unfortunately no one else is in the role of this sordid faux children's film. A lost daughter of a clever dog shows himself in the lives of two motherless children, to the chagrin of their bitter and cold father. In what can only be described as Dickensian, the evil widow forbids his children --- who may or may not be challenged spiritually - to play with Benji. Don't obey the children or Benji. Soon the children will be kidnapped and Benji should help the police find them. It is only then that the old man realizes that Benji is good, not bad. <br /> <br /> Tom Lester, whose only previous acting experience apparently plays the dull Eb on GREEN ACRES, plays one of the kidnappers. So is the unfortunate overused Deborah Walley. Walley's previous screen triumphs include BEACH BLANKET BINGO and the furious IT IS A BIKINI WORLD. She has also played Gidget and Tammy in the past and tries to eliminate her good girl reputation by playing it badly! <br /> <br /> Stay away from BENJI ... he's a dog and this movie is a dog!
