First, since I'm one of the people who have never seen the MST3K version of this movie, I can't comment on this. <br /> <br /> However, I saw the original version of this. movie on the Sci-Fi channel and I thought it was just as good as anything else on the channel. In fact, I thought it was one of their better offers. <br /> <br /> I noticed the comment here that people writing in detail about SOULTAKER with some intelligence, thought and maturity tend to like at least some things about this movie and right. In the original track, most reasonable people will probably think it is at least 4 or 5 stars out of 10. Five is average for me and I think this movie is average for a Sci Fi photo. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the above, I also noticed that the adjudicators who look immature, dull and flip and as a result come off as leg points from where I stand, are the same that nothing can get from this movie and basically garbage it without cause based mostly on see it chopped and fricasseed on MST3K. Or, if they both saw cuts, they seem to be greatly compromised by starting the MST3K viewing.
