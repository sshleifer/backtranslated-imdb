First, I want to admit that Chokher Bali was not my cup of tea. This movie was apparently not aimed at the masses. This is the type that critics would love to enjoy. The hype and publicity were pretty misleading. <br /> <br /> I expected something very dramatic like Devdas. I understand that the story and duration demand it. I played the movie very slowly. <br /> <br /> I'm a hard Aishwarya fan, and I'm sorry to say that I thought she was displeased. The role of Chokher Bali requires an actress who can portray herself as subversive, not innocent and naive. Everybody had a good performance. Tagore's depiction of the human condition comes across the celluloid to give the movie an interesting theme.
