Korea's answer to "I know what you did last summer" follows a similar storyline to its American counterpart. One year after a group of high school friends accidentally murdered a classmate, a masked murderer started picking them up one by one. Who could have seen them that night - or was their "victim" still alive when they dumped him into the sea? <br /> <br /> Originality can no longer be expected from the teenage treasure genre, but an effort can still be made. Ensuring movies of this ilke is entertaining and scary. RECORD also doesn't make a decent shock in the 95 minutes. <Br / a> The so-called "The House On Sorority Row" and "The Faculty"> <br /> The action is decent of the role that, as appears to be the norm in Korean theater, is an uninspiring writing with gusto and approaching an undeserved enthusiasm. Direction is, however, best mediocre; An odd choice of camera angles and the worst killer costume * EVER * contributing to RECORD's demise. Most disappointing is the end of the movie, where the two "surprises" are, it is obvious that you have rejected them earlier than blatantly! <br /> <br /> RECORD's only saving grace is the bright start - the first act is actually excellent and shows the American counterparts how character development and mood of the mood is supposed to be done - but otherwise, it's " a very poor movie. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> ** / *****
