I'm a big fan of Northern Exposure. Men in trees are a complete beating of northern exposure. There are New York City people stuck in a remote backyard town (Marin Frist / Joel Fleishman). She didn't immediately touch it with a local (Jack Slattery / Maggie O'Connell). The town has only one pilot who is not often available. Ther is just a radio program. And the whole show is about peculiar people with sincere and strange relationships. Too much parallel. Just as northern exposure except one obvious demographic, every character has changed. I am bored. Give me something new to think about. <br /> <br /> On the front, writing is pretty good. But if it were a school project, it would surely have earned the plagiarism's stamp. <br /> <br /> Perhaps people who like this show are protected from the dedicated creativity and hard work of Joshua Brand and John Falsey.
