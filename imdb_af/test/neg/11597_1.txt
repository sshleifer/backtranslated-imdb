A group of environmentalists travel to an island to discover a secret laboratory experimenting on animals. When they arrive, they discover they are too late. Apparently, the government tried a scientist to test his experiment on a komodo, and you guessed it, a cobra that made them grow very big. I'm not sure this movie really needs or deserved, because it's almost identical to the curse of the Komodo that also sucked. The computer effects are as comical as ever and the komodo roars like a dinosaur who really comes to my nerves. Like Boa vs Python, this movie is not worth seeing and it's about as much fun watching as nailing your hand to a table. Avoid!
