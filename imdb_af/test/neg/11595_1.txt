As a total movie with the happy work of the video store manager, I tend to watch all kinds of movies, from good to very bad. It was a movie with so many maize bellies, cheesy CGI effects and predictable plot points that I finally laughed before turning it off for 30-40 minutes. The genre of movies in the "creature function" has been doing some terrible things in recent years (Godzilla 2000 anyone?), But this movie makes me think the creators didn't even try. It might be worthwhile just figuring out the "fun of my" potential (counting the shootings!), But I couldn't recommend this movie to anyone in good conscience.
