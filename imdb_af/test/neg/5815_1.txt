I saw this movie when it came out. Let me see now - this man who fired from Mount Fuji earlier, succeeds in accumulating the funding and hiring staff to document what sounds on the surface like a brave and brave act --- the world's highest peak to ski. Well, here comes the spioiler - what happens, see, after a large crew of people helped him get close to the top - and a life is lost in the bargain - he gets on his skis this is a very short way, after which she PARACHUTE OPENS ... and that's it. And instead of burning the footage to make this incredible anticlimatic end to embarrassment, the man continues and releases it. SPOILER END I admire the tremendous courage and effort the movie staff had to take to get some of the beautiful shots they got. ANOTHER SPOILER - Oh yes, one of the Sherpas is killed by falling into a slit. The narrator, who calls the "devil's dancer," incidentally says that according to the Sherpa religion, since this man's body cannot be restored, his soul will swarm the world forever and never know rest. Is it worth the narrator's nuts. He replies - because it was the intention to let this clown go "Turn Everest." I can't remember ever seeing a meretrial piece of celluloid. This can be missed at all costs.
