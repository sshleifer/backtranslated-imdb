This movie is about the worst I have seen in a very long time. Terence Stamp's talent is totally messed up and just about the only thing I enjoyed was a favorite song from me, "As I Had a Million Dollars", by BNL, in the opening credits. <br /> <br /> Ashton Kutcher plays the main character, a nice guy called in his home in his home. Misunderstandings ensue. Blah blah blah. If you have time to kill and do nothing better then it's the movie for you. Otherwise, look something else. <br /> <br /> There are not necessarily any redeeming moments, but it's nice to see Molly Shannon and Jeffrey Tambor on the screen. They are always fun to watch, although this movie has even managed to mute these points.
