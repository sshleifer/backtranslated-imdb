Calling 'Rocketship XM' is a science fiction classic more than its release period (1950), its proficient ability to capitalize on the publicity for "Destination Moon" and the appearance of actors later on television as Sea Hunt's Mike would die. Nelson, Rockford's father and Wyatt Earp. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is bad enough to be good feed for MST3K and is best seen with comments from Joel and the robots. This is the type of movie that best suits the MST3K characters. something preachy, slow-paced, poorly written, and full of painfully bad acting. While unintentional funny things such as "Plan 9 From Outer Space" do not give themselves to satirical commentary (because the movie constantly raises the hosts), very bad and dull movies like "Rocketship X-M" are ideal. So add a few stars to the rating if you look at the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> The basic story has the crew following an unplanned turn at the moon and ending on Mars. What they find on the planet is the remnants of a human-like civilization destroyed by an atomic war. Only one Martian is shown in close proximity, an ordinary blind woman who has blind or at least no pupils in her eyes. The men look like the "goons" in the old Popeye cartoons, they kick hard around the cliffs and throw stones at the crew with incredible accuracy, especially if they have to be blind. Of course, nothing of this is ever explained because it will require a logical analysis of the authors of the script. <br /> <br /> The scenes on Mars are presented in something called "Sepia Color" to distinguish them from the rest of the B&W film. If you think of it, "Wizard of Oz", you will be disappointed because it is just black and white with a slightly brown tint that is placed on the picture. <br /> <br /> In line with the moronic sexism of the film, the icy female scientific screws up and goes up her fuel calculations. Her failure to measure the men caused her to be on the surface, and she and Mike Nelson kissed each other while facing their dream (adding the sound of gagging here.) <br /> <br /> The right stars of the movies are the reporters at the mission center. So much so that MST3K is inspired to greet these recurrent heroes specially. The intense group of news magazines have been recorded for the first 10 minutes, and then take stations about 12 inches behind the technicians and monitoring devices in the command center. Later, they were asked to ask the moronic questions needed by the mission director to highlight the film's already obvious message. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a very low sound level, is not subtitled and is accompanied by a trailer. Although you will be grateful that it is only 77 minutes, it's still about 60 minutes, because any 30 minute episode of The Twilight Zone has more content than this entire movie. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
