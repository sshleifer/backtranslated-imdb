Seen this movie only on the evening. I read a few other user comments that convinced me to see it ... I have to say, I wasn't impressed. I am so unimportant that I need to write these comments to save some of your people money. <br /> <br /> First, "The Messengers" are very predictable, and not so much of a thrill. It can be for anyone under the age of 13, but it did nothing to me. The climax was laughing and most of the audience left before the film's decision. <br /> <br /> The play was a little superficial. Some of the emotional arguments between the family were less convincing than the sub-par suspense scenes. <br /> <br /> If you've seen previews for this movie, you've seen most of the best parts and a strong understanding of the plot. This movie is not worth seeing in the theaters.
