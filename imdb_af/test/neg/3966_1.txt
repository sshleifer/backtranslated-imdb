For those of you who have some kind words for this movie, I suspect you didn't see it when it was released as "Parts: The Clonus Horror." <br /> <br /> It was a very boring movie. This missed the point in at least three ways. It wasn't good enough to be scary; It wasn't bad enough to be funny (although MST3K took care of it); and even in 1979 the plot was inexplicable. <br /> <br /> Earlier claimants are "The Resurrection of Zachary Wheeler" (1971). It's the same idea (clones as parts). The movie is entertaining, and it played a good role. Another is "Sleeper" (1973). Yes, the Woody Allen movie. Remember the flattened nose? A "Clone" (1973). The last two plots are not as similar to Clonus as the first, but they preach Clonus. <br /> <br /> For decades, they have been fiction books about the idea, although the word "clone" is not used.
