The idea for the movie was not bad: a horror movie shot in Halloween on a grain maze. The bad part was the clumsy camera work, the ten million shots of feet and corn, and the hour and a half walked the man packed into the maze. Oh, sorry, the "maize." I recorded this movie because it reminds me of a corn maze near where I live, and I thought it was a cool idea for a movie. But if all is taken into account, it seems that your average Joe could take the same idea and run much further with it. Bill Cowell's play wasn't bad, in fact, I'd say it was pretty good. But the lack of talent of his fellow stars did not help his efforts. Here's to hope his next movie will be easier to swallow.
