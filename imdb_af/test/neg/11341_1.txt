Racing enthusiast Fabian (like Tommy Callahan) smokes, drinks and hardships, while younger brunette Annette Funicello (such as Francie Madsen) and blonde pillar Diane McBain (as Annie Blaine) smoke. Complementary matters are Mrs. Funicello's boozy race cart, Warren Berlinger (as Eddie Sands), and her father, Jan Murray (as Pete Madsen), encourage the reckless drivers. Funicello's cow eye performance is sometimes enjoyable; But her drunk driving image is unpleasant. "Thunder Alley" offers marginally more NASCAR excitement than its predecessor, "Fireball 500" (1966) *; Be warned, it's not much. A wild party zone, with a few soft stripes, is the low point of the movie.
