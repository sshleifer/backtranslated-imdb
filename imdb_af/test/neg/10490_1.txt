This one is not even alive enough to be fun. There is something out there, people ripping off the screen after an off-screen crash while government executives investigated (out of screen) and bad actors, saying stupid lines (on the screen), including a man like Jim looks like Carrey with a hangover. The "monster", when it is finally shown, looks like an extra of "Robot Monster", but there is not enough monster fu anyway. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it's pretty short. Save it, unless you want to get bored of your skull
