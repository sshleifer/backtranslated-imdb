I had some kind of high expectations for this movie. I always thought Tom Selleck's lesser-known films (ie Runaway and Coma), where well above the one he had more pressure on. Perhaps the producers should have a little more knowledge of the former main league baseball players who have become stars overseas. The majority were players who were too good to triple a baseball, but not exactly the big league. I admire the idea of ​​placing Selle's character in Japn, versus the cliché to play in the minors. Unfortunately, this movie, like the title of the post, is stranded in third place by a movie that appears to be autopilot. I will not mind seeing a successor, and hopefully the producers will learn from the mistakes. The premise is just too unique to be alone with this uneven movie
