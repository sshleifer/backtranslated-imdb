I caught this movie on late-night television. I saw the opening credits and thought it looked good. Well, I was very wrong. While it wasn't ominously bad (it had some funny and soft moments) it had no sense of belonging. <br /> <br /> It started well enough with Kathy Bates'character who has a midlife crisis of all kinds when her husband leaves her and her song idol is murdered. But Kathy played these earlier women so well before - thought Fried Green Tomatoes. The problem was not Kathy, it was the clueless screenplay that wandered all over the place. It was as if the writers had to think what we were going to do next. The script also faced a lot. <br /> <br /> Someone who made comments on this movie wondered why it didn't receive a movie release. The main reason I think would have been to avoid embarrassment and the critics would have killed it. <br /> <br /> To put it all, I thought the little woman who played Maudie was fantastic and stole the movie, not to mention she was beautiful.
