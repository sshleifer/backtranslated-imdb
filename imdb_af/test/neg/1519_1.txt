Bottom line of Bottom crossed with Fawlty Towers sounds good! Ade Edmonson & Rik Mayall, however, managed to create a film that barely generates a tits. Ten years ago Rik Mayall's madness died and Ade's idiot was funny, now it's just annoying. <br /> <br /> The film has promise - though the most horrible hotel in Britain is not a new idea. The rescue classes were capable performances by Simon (Spaced, Big Train) Pegg and Helene Mathieu, and the film was only 90 minutes long. Sorry, guys, but you really hit the bottom
