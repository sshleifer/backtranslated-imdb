It was a strange movie. A little horror and definitely movie noir. Some fifth columnists meet and die mysteriously with a Japanese dagger in their hands after Monsieur Colomb (Bela Lugosi) arrived. <br /> <br /> Soon, the Lone Ranger comes in the person of FBI agent Richard 'Dick' Martin (Clayton Moore). Martin is ineffective at finding the killer because he is more interested in the cousin (Joan Barclay) of a missing doctor who is part of the gang. <br /> <br /> After the last man dies, and the doctor is terribly disfigured by some strange serum, the true story of the group comes out and that's where it gets interesting and strange. I won't waste it. <br /> <br /> Lugosi was wonderful like the villain.
