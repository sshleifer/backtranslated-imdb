I'm always interested to see neglected movies that have good notices, but in this case the rejection of the movie seems justified. Apparently based on a number of real-world incidents during World War II, the film does not connect with the viewer for some reason that it is not quite clear to me. One very likely reason is that - in the pressure I have seen on TCM anyway - none of the screens where the Germans talked to each other were given titles. This interesting live concept - guessing the non-German viewer of "context" the Germans say to each other - is a complete flop in my book and helps to exclude the viewer. Also, the way the movie starts - just dropping us into a very confused situation without much setup - is disorienting. Brian Keith is pretty good here, but the reputation of "The Great Escape" and "Stalag 17" will not be challenged by this movie.
