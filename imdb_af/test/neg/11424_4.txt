I, like tonight, enchanted the cute winter and long lines to see what I expected this year to be one of the best movies of this year. However, I left happy in many ways after the credits rolled. But to be honest, there were redeemable features (though very few). Let's start with what worked. First, the Lycans: on point in every respect ?? of their frightening physical nature after their pure anger. The action: sublime visceral ?? when that happened. Nighy / Victor and Sheen / Lucian: Perfect. Now, what hasn't (and there is enough). It was less a movie and more a collage of rows (and didn't expect to see any supporting characters from the other movies except Raze and Tannis). Often missing was a well-written storyline and anything from real content to bring these pieces of film together. The story started right in the middle? at the point where Lucian turned up to rebel. Therefore, there was no context; no tension; no sense of betrayal? the devices needed to make everything work. Furthermore, it ended up where the climax had to start (which had to be after the fact had smothered a little). Oh, and it was too short. Purist will also find offense in some freedoms that are taken to certain facts previously revealed in the first two movies, but judge for yourself. Eventually, this movie took a long time about what short "background" scenes should be (eg, several board scenes), and as a result we never really got the main players or cared ... or the movie. -D
