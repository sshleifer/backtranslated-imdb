What about Scream Baby Scream is not supposed to make me feel like a fool to buy it? I bought it because God helps me, I'm a sucker for the old B theater, even as worthless as that. Nonetheless, something about this movie irritates me, it's probably Janet, Janet gets cold and sneaky, apparently, with the intention of getting so deep and noble, with a look at her face shouting constipation, she doesn't even look not to anything that her sincere boyfriend wants. I'm glad this is her only role. What really irritates me is that it is a 1960s movie that is terribly wrong, and as we all know, it is untrue that Floridian is "zero gore". It's as if the director started with a Herschell Lewis style, but when he found out his wife, he got a dull conversation to the other, and basically a few annoying things. In other words, we end up with Florida Bore. Joseph Adler should be ashamed. Janet's boyfriend, Jason is almost as ridiculous as she is, this man has something negative to say about absolutely everything, think about it, he's probably the cheapest good man in horror history. The only thing this movie really is about is that it contains the B-gore vibe of the 60's / early 70's that you can find in things like Undertaker & his friends, Blood Freak, or most of Herschell Lewis. Even Rodney of the Horrific Twosome is in here, I thought his kaveman comedy routine was annoying. Most of the rules to rule are stupid, even the travel scene was stupid. The only positive thing is the small amount of the beach, but it usually includes Janet blowing over the fact that life is not perfect. In the only real ironic twist, Scream Baby Scream becomes even less interesting as the story finally begins, around the 45 minute point. If you are indifferent to whether your entertainment watches are or not, but offend the red color, you shouldn't hate it. Why does Troma distribute it? Wouldn't it be something strange videos? Scream Baby Scream very well could be the worst in the Florida horror / gore of his era, but I think among the untouchable characters, and the incoherent plot, lay potential. Shouting, Baby, Shouting, really looks as if it should follow the Bloodfees pattern, stealing a quote from Janet. If it doesn't fit, I'll throw it out. 10/02
