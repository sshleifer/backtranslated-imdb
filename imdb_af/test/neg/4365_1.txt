The acting, while improving, is still terrible. these people could not convey emotion from a paper bag. the writing doesn't help them either. stupid rules, and I can only accept no direction from the director. This script, like Shakespeare, was read at high school with a teacher who flung them as they went. <br /> <br /> while this movie (if you can call it, it's about 80 min. more beautiful than the first because of all this, it's definitely more painful to watch. 10/01.
