I'm great in acting, writing and directing, but not known. My friends and I often rent bad movies, just for fun and a good laugh, but when we went to the local family video and got a movie called Biker Zombies From Detroit, we knew it was the worst movie of all time. was! Biker Zombies Of Detroit It's Not A Script! They can say they have one, but they are liars! There was a 4-minute scene of just two guys reacting to women and sexuality, and you can say it's improvised. And if they are going to improve, at least be decent, but it wasn't, and you could tell the two actors that they were screwing up lines and saying things that didn't even make sense. <br /> <br /> To give you an idea of ​​how horrible and slow this movie is, here's the beginning: a girl flashes a guy, he hits her face and hits her and rapes her her. Then we see zombies attacking and they both become zombies. <br /> <br /> This is the beginning of the movie! Not to mention the main zombie voting on what carries through the whole movie, trying to be sinister and mindset, but sounds like Marylin Manson fits with fitness. <br /> <br /> Worst movie ever. Bottom line, people. But see if you have movies with no script, no plot, bad acting, bad editing, bad music and more than 100 F words used in the movie. <br /> <br /> If it can hit video stores, my future movies will win Oscars.
