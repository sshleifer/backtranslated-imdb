This movie was out of the 67 of 71 best pictures I've seen, by far the worst. First, I found the plot line somewhat absurd - the absent man for 25 years / still in love / not even a letter! Give me a chance. And why was the man who had not been absent for so long on an oil field next to the Congresswoman's party? This film also featured some of the worst stereotyping of African Americans I have ever seen. This makes Gone With the Wind (see Prissy) straight progressive! I barely saw a movie I love so much. UGH!
