The Calu What Now? Yes, I thought it was also a stupid name. Fortunately, Chris Carter remains unaware of the scum in his writing staff. Start with the usual cheery X-Files teaser (a baby running over a train) this episode. Well, I can't really say it's going down, because to be honest, it never went uphill. <br /> <br /> Poorly written, with us no patos for any of the characters (except maybe that baby at the beginning) the author makes us hate characters before they brutally kill them. This is the worst technique ever. Should we feel sorry for the characters they hate? Don't ask me. <br /> <br /> It's not only boring, but it's like a very bad Omen sequel with overwhelming and disgusting sequence of deaths and rotten special effects (though it's brutally honest, it's the least of my concerns). <br /> <br /> Sara B. Charno started her X-Files career with a throat and also closed it off with one. <br /> <br /> Pronunciation: <br /> <br /> In the words of my maths teacher Mr. Laverack: "Terrible, Terrible ..."
