THE PLOT: A truck (Kristofferson) fights a corrupt sheriff (Borgnine) by tying its fellow truck drivers together and forming an unstoppable convoy that runs for miles and soon creates a national media frenzy. <br /> <br /> THE NEGATIVE: The movie's setup is poor and the end is even weaker. It has all the good-ole boy / trucker cliches without adding anything new to the process. It ends up being SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT looks brilliant and inspired. Kristofferson has been very laid back for a leading role and cannot bear the picture. Borgnine's character is portrayed uncomfortably. In the beginning he is made to look like a giant of a sheriff who persuades a small effort that begins to roll the whole thing. Then he is a little more sympathetic and even secretly with Kristofferson, who doesn't work at all. Anyway, Jackie Gleason is a much better actor for this type of role. However, the worst part of the movie is the director Peckinpah's efforts to throw in a "serious message" in this deadly action movie. It does nothing but slows it down and bombs in the process. <br /> <br /> THE POSITIVE: The only good scene in the whole movie is the battle order in the truck stop restaurant. Director Peckinpah puts a funny twist on his trademark slow motion violence and the result is amusing. Unfortunately, he started all the action in the rest of the picture in slow motion until it eventually became tired. McGraw is always a pleasure to watch, but unfortunately she is given very little to say or do. <br /> <br /> THE LOWDOWN: When you read the synopsis you saw the movie. The song on which this movie is based is pretty good, but the movie doesn't add anything and should never be made. These are all very uninspired things for such a maverick director. <br /> <br /> THE RATING: 3 out of 10.
