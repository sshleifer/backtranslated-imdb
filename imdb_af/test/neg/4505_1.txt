The evil one is about a big house where a bad spirit has been unleashed to torture inside. What a washout of a movie! There is no scary scene. Not one! Richard Crenna does not survive anything. There are some animated ghosts, an escape by force saw, and a ghost rape. After nothing special happens to almost the entire movie The Evil, it becomes personal in ... Victor Buono. Great! Where did the filmmakers get the idea that Buono is scary. He seemed to be on the lap for a guest-running salary to pay his liquor bill. By then, it's too late to turn it off because the damn thing is over. I felt like throwing the video cassettes out of the window. Please avoid this litter! Hopefully it will never see the light of DVD and it will be darkened.
