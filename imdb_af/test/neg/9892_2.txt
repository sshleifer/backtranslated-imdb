I had to realize that any two-video set sold for only $ 6 would be bad. I even read the reviews before I watched this movie and it hasn't succumbed to me yet. I loved the book and I knew it couldn't be as bad as people said. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is. <br /> <br /> A patchwork of film, video and appearances To make stock film, combine to make a three-hour tour of one chapter of James A. Michener's epic novel. Well, the period covered was one chapter, but I don't remember many of the situations actually in the book. The packaging on my copy of the movie gives Maria Conchita Alonso the best invoice - though it seems she's only in one talking scene. On the second band. <br /> <br /> The actors are encouraged to play their roles well in spite of a smashing, over-ridden writing. However, they will be insulted to accept the roles in the first place.
