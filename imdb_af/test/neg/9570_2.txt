What I miss especially in this movie is that it doesn't make room for imagination, everything is said. It's like a documentary movie, but not as good as a documentary, because it's not a documentary. A patchwork film without a continuous story. Very superficial, nothing to think about, because the film tells you all you need to think. Too many different problems are being addressed, but no one is working out to make you think. I don't even know if it's a funny movie that wants to be serious or a serious movie that wants to be funny. Many scenes are very unrealistic, and the acting is pretty poor. The movie is rather boring.
