RIPPER HANDS <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> An Edwardian Doctor (Eric Porter) uses New Filled Freudian Analysis a young girl (Angharad Rees) who seems to be the daughter of Jack the Ripper, and just as deadly ... <br /> <br /> Unlikely Hammer horror, in which a respectable social figure is responsible for a beautiful young waif without attracting as much as a scandal of scandal even when she takes to kill everything with a variety of deadly tools (broken mirrors, hat pegs, etc.)! LW Davidson's screenplay deliberately moves from one murder to another, offering the material's inherent sub-texts (Porter's obvious attraction to Rees) in favor of commercial melodrama, and the tone remains throughout. Some of the gore screens are surprisingly bright, even for Hammer, and it's cut from the original US version (despite an R-rating from the MPAA), although the full version is now available on the home video. Porter and Rees give excellent performances, and the climax in St. Paul's cathedral is a definite highlight, but the rest of the film is strangely hollow and unpleasant. Directed by Peter Sasdy.
