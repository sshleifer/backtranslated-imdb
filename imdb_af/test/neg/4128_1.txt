First, I just watched a movie at SHOWTIME called Survival Island. It says it was a 2006 movie with Billy Zane and since I love him and couldn't sleep, I thought I'd look it up. It looks interesting. Looked at it and decided to watch the IMDb who was this new face Juan Pablo Di Pace and OMG, I couldn't believe it. This movie has renamed THREE and will be a new movie? It is playing again in Showtime Channel in 1 hour and 30 minutes and this date is May 28 and EDT or Florida time. You can check and view your showlist entries by title. I will not come in detail so you can see the movie, but at one point there is a lady in a white bikini going in the water and it takes everything off, you see her naked body .... when she runs out of the water you see her bottoms. Funny, there are also many other mess. I can't believe it, I decided to look for this movie ... Go figure! Wonder if the people are renaming it, selling it to a movie studio to put out, but it already plays on Showtime, ha ha. Good laugh. I give it 1-1 / 2 stars. C, D + film.
