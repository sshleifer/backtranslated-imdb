this movie was not good. I thought it was a nice movie, just like the original one. wrong. It was uncomfortable for christine ricci, who i expect so much more than that, you can just tell by looking. I think Doug e. Doug did the best he could. put 5-year-olds in front of the parent, and they may fall asleep.
