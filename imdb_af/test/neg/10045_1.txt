I saw this movie yesterday and thought it was terrible; it was pointless and just silly. the supposed plot relates to a prospective groom who also used the world's problems to relate to his bride and the other people in his life. He disappears on his wedding day (in a tux no less) and hangs with a variety of weirdos. <br /> <br /> We saw it with a bus carriage going to Atlantic City and everyone agreed it was a terrible movie. It tried to be deep, but it wasn't; It was stupid and offensive. If I wasn't on a bus I would have walked out on the movie. Anyone who is considering watching the movie or renting or buying the video has been warned.
