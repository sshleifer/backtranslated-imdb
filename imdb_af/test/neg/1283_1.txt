This movie should be one of the worst of all times in the annals of fiefdom. I will stop saying it's the worst movie ever, just because I still see every movie ever made. I can't make such high demands so far. The story is cute, the acting is terrible, at best, the "special" effects are no more than a few pounds. of dry ice and a fan. Someone had to relate to someone to make this movie. Mr Busey sent this one! The dog is well trained and cute, making it the only redeeming quality in this never-made-made film. Two hours and $ 3 of my life, I'll never come back.
