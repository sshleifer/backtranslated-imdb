I usually look good in movies, even the bad people. Unfortunately, this movie is one I miss, and the fact that there is hardly a positive review on this board shows many IMDb reviewers share my pain. <br /> <br /> I don't usually see successors, but I just had to see it because I love "Rosemary's Baby". What a mistake it was. This just confirms my belief in the fact that most successors are ugly - although very little is just as bad. In my mind it's not even a successor, it's a satire about how bad a prosecution can be. Movie is highly recommended not to watch at any time.
