Although this film was nothing special, I am aiming to respond to at least one factor that was definitely in his favor - that of the lead female artist in the movie, Dyan Cannon. Despite the movie's ridiculous storyline and what she's going to do here, she was the best acting work in the film, which makes the incredible seem more acceptable. Her turbulent scene with gay photographer David Hemmings must be seen as believed. Good work, Dyan.
