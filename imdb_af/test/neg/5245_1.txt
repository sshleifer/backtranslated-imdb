GOOD: Technomusic guides medieval sword games. Also, the movie looks slimmer than most b-movies, but let's see it: Quake or Doom has more atmosphere. BATH: Unrelenting plot, no acting and totally incredible universe. I am usually able to see the potential of even very bad movies; Heck, I love a good B-movie like "Split Second" and the containers. But this one has nothing but boredom and clich√© to offer. Completely predictable from start to finish. Oh, and I forgot the bad special effects, they look more like an old Playstation game than anything from the myth! Using a classic poem to sell this sucker insults me! <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION: Just boring. If you want to see Lara Croft, buy the game, it's better section!
