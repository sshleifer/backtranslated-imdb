What a nasty cynical movie. Apparently, this sad excuse for a dramatic urban look at what 20-year-olds do while crawling through the gutter of Sydney's nightlife, somehow ties with its target market. Made by some industry, nobody and poles who apparently thought they could pull up a dragged behavior with a young roll and throw in multiplexes, SAMPLE PEOPLES failed with the Australian box office. It is so offensive in its click imagery of obvious and easy targets. It was completely rejected by the audience who intended it. Poor and cruel and without any attempt to offer quality or resonance to the young audience that could be attracted by the marketing or casting of the SAMPLE PEOPLE, would have been interesting or even informative if not by its emerging view of "what teenagers wanted don't see a movie '. The character that Ben Mendelsohn played is particularly offensive and Kylie Minogue is again wasted by impoverished material and unprocessed filmmakers. It is as if the producers thought that teenagers would see any ugly garbage and only closed scenes and characters that were shallow and soul-less. Well, it was very wrong. A mini-budget film made in 1983 called GOING DOWN has this subject right and is an excellent antidote for this poison.
