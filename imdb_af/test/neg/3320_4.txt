"Queen of the Damned" is one of the worst adaptations of a book to a movie I've seen. The only thing I like in this movie is the soundtrack, anything else. (Since I'm a fan of Korn, Marilyn Manson, Chester Bennington of Linkin Park and Wayne Static or Static-X) <br /> <br /> There are so many mistakes and so many bad choices I don't even know how to to start. So many stories have been cut, like the twin's legend (one of my favorite) Armand and Daniel's relationship and even Louis is not present, to name a few. (The plot was dead) First, they had to make a movie of "The Vampire Lestat" because it is the second book after "The interview with the vampire", not "Queen of Damned". They tried to print as much information in a single role, so you won't get almost anything unless you read the vampire chronicles. <br /> <br /> So many meaningful characters don't seem to be really important in this movie. . For example, this is Pandora's case. <br /> <br /> The actors they choose to play all the characters do not match many of Anne Rice's descriptions, especially Marius, who is supposed to be a beautiful, tall, blonde man with blue eyes, like Lestat. (Stuart Towsend is also far from Lestat). I didn't understand why they changed Lestat's creator to be Marius instead of Magnus. <br /> <br /> '' Maintenance of the vampire '' was a wonderful movie, I loved the actors and Tom Cruise as Lestat was PERFECT and much better than Stuart Townsend. (I'm sad that Tom Cruise has refused the chance to play Lestat again.) Only Antonio Bandeiras and Armand don't match Armand's appearance, but anyway, Anne Rice was so picky about the interview that I wasn't could see how she sold the rights to this terrible production.
