I watched this movie a few days ago and it was terrible! <br /> <br /> Awfully long - even though they managed to pass most of his life! <br /> <br /> Awfully drilling - the parts they included were long-term, and for some reason the director decided to cut away some of the action and have large parts of the movie unexplained! <br /> <br /> Awfully inaccurate - the whole 'musical' side to this movie was a joke, and the last time I checked Ghengis Khan wasn't a good guy! <br /> <br /> Awfully acted - I found some of the characters hard to believe, they were two-dimensional and lacking in depth! <br /> <br /> A movie's saving grace was the movie. That's why I gave this movie a 2 star score rather than the bare minimum! However, if you want to look something nice, I would recommend buying a photo instead! <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie was a huge waste of time and money! Please do yourself a favor and give this Mongolian turkey a miss!
