Apart from the gun campaign, I felt the movie was a waste of celluloid. Robert Duvall, Kevin Costner, and Annette Bening could have played those roles in their sleep. The dialogue was marginally tolerant (and there was a lot of it - no one was quiet in this movie), the plot was across the map as if they couldn't decide how many themes would come into the story. There was no subtlety. anyway - shadowing hit you between the eyes and they led you through most of the story (I think they've added the dialogue to make sure you didn't miss anything), and the editing really had to needed the screen time of the actor was more quantity than quality - again, too much dialogue). <br /> <br /> The whole story took place over a few days, but everything that happened happened on epic relationships, much like day-to-day events were great in your high school, but in the big scheme was really not that important. Yes, the bad guys killed and killed Moses, they hit Knoppie, they killed the dog - everything Boss and Charley's blood would get. But the importance has been thinned by all the "deep, meaningful" conversations that dominated most of the movie. These guys worked together for 10 years and they are just talking about these things? The only time there wasn't much dialogue was in the rifle scene. That's probably why I liked it. <br /> <br /> Finally, someone gives Annette Bening a hairbrush! The voluptuous hair around her face that I would have made to look like made her look a little more romantic. If she worked outside the house, it would have made more sense. Plus, why wasn't she already married? There were a few "friendly and soft" (her words) some men in town, except the marshal and his loved ones. In fact, none of the bad guys seemed to be (a normal plot device in other movies). She stayed at home most of the time and didn't really have much connection with the people in town. Wondering ...... <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was far too long, too chatty, and also confronted by me. It felt like a star vehicle with lots of screen time for big stars, but not enough character depth to interest me, despite all the dialogue.
