I saw this movie 3 times. Mostly because I thought while watching it, "I missed something here." Is there any reason why this film was made? Did it try to say something and I just missed it? Well, after 3 views, I didn't get an answer. <br /> <br /> I think the worst thing I can say about any movie is that it's bored me, and I didn't finish it. I will admit that there is enough eye candy and quick editing and hip music to keep my attention throughout, but is it a movie that should be? <br /> <br /> I'm not against extreme violence, it's almost non-stop, but there seems to be some kind of inspiration. Something that is highlighted by it. The word is free, but it's worse than that. In the first part of the movie we are all insight into the motivation of the characters. And yes, the 3 principles are very good in their roles. But the roles are absolutely incredible. So in the first part we learn to know the characters, and in the second part most of the die and use sadistic pleasure to kill others. It seems to be the whole movie. And the first part has nothing to do with the second. <br /> <br /> For example. How can a nice smart man like Zed agree to join a lot of junkies and amateurs to do such a job? It does not make sense. He is portrayed so cleverly, but he continues with this suicide mission. The fact that he is surviving is completely inconsistent with the rest of the hyper-real violence and chaos. So how do we look at a Hollywood romance with a happy ending or a super real, super-violent massacre? I remember having the same reaction to two other films that this director was involved with: True Romance and Reservior Dogs. <br /> <br /> Unnecessary drink!
