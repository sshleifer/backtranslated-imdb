80's sleazy (glam) rock is like 90's house music or current boys: it's boring and has no ideas or ideals. The only thing that makes it a bit 'cult' today is that it is a long time ago so we can laugh at his folly. Bad 'Rock Star' didn't laugh at all, because it has to be one of the most boring movies of the past year. <br /> <br /> Chris (Mark Wahlberg) is the singer of a Steel Dragon tribute. When he is kicked off the band at the same time, the true Steel Dragon singer is also kicked, he becomes the next lead singer. You already know how it will end at that time, with Chris losing it with sex, drugs and r & r and forget about his long-time friend / manager, Emily (Jennifer Aniston). <br /> <br /> There is too much (boring) music in this standard formula-filled excuse for a movie and should be avoided at all costs. Look at the (convicted, but still most enjoyable) Nearly Famous, or even better, movie about real people playing real music with real emotions, what you do. <br /> <br /> What a stinker. 10/02.
