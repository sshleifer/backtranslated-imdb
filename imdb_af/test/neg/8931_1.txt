It's on my TV right now ... but only long enough to complete it in this comment. The previous comment tells me that this movie won't get any better, no matter how much I hope and pray. I will agree that this movie is a colossal waste of my time and it will be your time. It won't be better! I can't believe this script writer does Atlas Shrugged! I hope he has improved a million folds! I see some other credits on his resume that had good reviews, but I'm still not convinced. If you are familiar with his work, please insert something here because I really want to see Atlas Shrugged, and will hate it if this man changes it in the garbage that this movie seems to be.
