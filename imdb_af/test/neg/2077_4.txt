Carmen is a prostitute who seduces and steals the soldiers of the Spanish army. She is without a doubt the best femme fatale right now. When a man shows her lovely attention, she decides to do everything to destroy him. In the end, he falls into her web and he will be forced to make all the things he has just hated to be for Carmen. Despite Paz Vega being very nice, she doesn't look like a gypsy (like Carmen is) and her actions, not even Sbaraglia's, are good. The story is very boring, and in most moments it is very absurd, while intending to come true. Similarly, the scenarios and the special effects are, despite not being, but they are not acceptable, and too much artificial for a historical film as it is. In summary, boring and bad, with a very absurd development, there are many better things to look at.
