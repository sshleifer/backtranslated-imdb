I couldn't believe the original rating I found when I saw this movie, 9.5? Unfortunately, I don't seem to be alone. <br /> <br /> The movie is slow and boring. One of the sadness is that if the movie is given a realistic score of about 5 or 6, then the expectation would not have been so high. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was not the case, so if I saw the movie and see the poor story and acting, I left it to give it 3/10. /> <br /> Vinnie Jones is great in Lock stock, and also Snatch, and he plays a big hard man, but he has to keep this role. It's a bit like Stallone and Schwarzenegger comedy movies, they just don't work. <br /> <br /> He can't play the lead either, he plays better than supporting or otherwise. When he plays, his actors are "in the eye" and did not really show up very well. Average machine is another good example of this.
