The authors and creators of this movie should actually be sued ... For the polluting of the world with this crap! "Man In The Mirror" is really awful! Away, away, over! <br /> <br /> ... and people, I'm not just saying this because I'm a Michael Jackson fan! Or because it's really one of the most delayed portrayals of his life, I've ever experienced! <br /> <br /> I say this because it's a waste of time, money and celluloid! I am ashamed of myself, just after I have seen it all! It's 1 hour and 26 minutes from my life, I'll never come back! I tell you; See how grass grows, is literally more entertaining than this movie! <br /> <br /> Consider yourself warned!
