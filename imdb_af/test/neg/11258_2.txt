I have to be honest and admit that this movie was basically nothing for me, except to completely baffle me. It is burdened with a plot that revolves around the mysterious murders of several young women, which are then linked to the discovery of a body older than 40 years. The story has never seemed very meaningful, especially when Robicheaux (played by Tommy Lee Jones) started his talks with the Confederal General John Bell Hood (I never did it.) Jones was OK in his role, though I thought He really started to show his age here. Terrible misfortune was John Goodman as Julie "Baby Feet" Balboni, which I suspect is a kind of local gang figure. I just didn't think Goodman worked in this role, though I would admit it could just be because I'm not much of a John Goodman fan. Somewhere in the mix, Justina Machado appeared as an FBI agent, although I never really understood what the FBI was involved with. It can simply mean that my attention has wandered off the screen. However, if this is explained, I completely missed it. Luckily, it's a pretty short movie, so you won't waste much of your life on it. 10/02
