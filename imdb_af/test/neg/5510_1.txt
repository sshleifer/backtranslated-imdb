Actually terrible. Clearly, an attempt to cash in on the Star Wars craze, but there is no excuse for this indifferent piece of garbage. The storyline disappears before the middle, the characters are forgotten and the child is such a non-talent that all he does is stand for the camera. A strange planet on which they land is actually the Navy in Long Beach, California. <br /> <br /> This movie actually made me see physically. <br /> <br /> Roger Corman made good, bad movies in his career, but there's no excuse for this one. <br /> <br /> 0/10 - IMDb will not allow you to give a zero.
