Tug-3 is quite right. Although I'm sure Mr. Osmond wants to make a sincere, heart-warming Christmas, this one is as cynical and creepy as they come. The religious significance of Christmas is forgotten and replaced with cute children, uncultivated adults and dull villains. The production values ​​show that it is also filmed on screen or inexperienced film films. I suspect the latter is unhappy. The worst part, oddly enough, is really the music. You'd think someone with a long musical career can do better than the title song, but you'll be wrong. Even my mom doesn't like this movie, and she likes the Osmonds AND juicy stuff.
