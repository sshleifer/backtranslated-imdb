I didn't keep this movie for so many reasons, I can't even say everything. I thought it was made bad only because of the whole story line. I mean who's going to believe they've caught the chupacabra and breaking it up on a vessel. LAME !!! It was right for a lame straight to the video, but not worth spending money on it. I can't believe anyone actually gave this movie a ten. But I think there are people who like this movie. I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 just because it was about the chupacabra and it had the lord of the lord of the rings. If you want to see this movie, I will stay home and wait until it comes to the sci-fi channel. Don't waste your money to see this movie. Believe me.
