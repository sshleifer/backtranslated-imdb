It's hard to decide if this movie is suffering from a crap dialogue or if it's just made to appear by crap actors. Anyway, it is written to the story, which is at best mediocre. <br /> <br /> Although made in the late 80's, the first part of the movie plays like a 60-year-old teen screwball comedy (without the absence of any real humor), especially the part of the "good girl" who is annoying such a Doris Day figure as you can hope / fear, including the slightly cunning opposition to anything his friends want to do. The net effect is, after a while you start hoping she'll bite it so you don't have to listen to her voice anymore. <br /> <br /> Some wickedness and free nudity, plus some 80's style clothes are your only idea that this movie was made in the 80's. Oh, and also some nice negotiable music. <br /> <br /> Storywise, that's pretty formal stuff. A bunch of horny (obviously, 'mission nice girl') teenagers decide to celebrate Halloween night by throwing a party into a haunted house. Partialism and fornication accompany a bad consultative session that kicks off the demonic possession team that is the subject of the movie. After that, the only exciting part will try to guess in which order the characters expire. You're sure not to give or they want to or not. The actors are so bad that demons / zombies / dinner actually improve their performance and the ridiculous clich√© dialogue is so annoying that you're stuck in your seat. <br /> <br /> Gorewise, this movie isn't anywhere. Specially, unless you think cheesy is kind of 'special'. For example, sometimes the devil's head is so bad you wonder if it's a 5-year-old trick-of-treating. <br /> <br /> That's not to say there's nothing nice in the movie. Some of the music is not bad, and the first of our careless Scooby gangs to get possession, performs a wonderful and really sexy dance routine at one point before its getting bad. <br /> <br /> Also, and I don't know why I actually managed to do something. The tension that is lacking in most of the movie has made a late appearance, and I have lapsed instead of annoyance. That's what a horror movie is supposed to do. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I can't bring myself to give this movie a rock bottom, as it is by an inexplicable miracle (I don't mean I'm owned by demons) I was actually a bit crawled . <br /> <br /> Don't pay money to see it. It's hardly worth your time, but only hard cash. Watch it on YouTube while there.
