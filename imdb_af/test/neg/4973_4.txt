Now it's 2008, which has really taken care of the world over a man like DB Sweeney, even though he wasn't a big problem. <br /> <br /> Two tickets to paradise are a written story that is good and where three friends hit the road under the circumstances. Again, a proven plot. The problem with this movie, unlike it's so bad it is compelling title, is the script. <br /> <br /> Cliché after cliché three guys do the same things you saw in every other road movie ... and blow up Vanna White's house. <br /> <br /> John C. McGinley's acting work is great, especially when compared to the late DB Sweeney's. (His career is dead, hence the late. Although I hear he is moving to TV, good to him). Also, John C probably has the least terrible character in the movie. <br /> <br /> The score is so generous that it actually feels like you're watching a third-class movie of 1993, or Jeff Anderson's movie Now You Know (also held me back for a few years, but at least it was more welcome.) I mean, yes, I think I enjoyed parts of it. But the nerdy guy is annoying, DB is trying to be this cool failed guitarist (with some rough influences, like some of the worst of classic rock) that has a strange relationship with a stripper, and John C is a gambler who's wife and child leaves him after the death of his father, as well as a visit from one of his books' henchmen. <br /> <br /> I think of ways to make this movie better. But I think writing the disc would be a healthy start. <br /> <br /> But, as I have indicated all the time, it's not the worst movie ever. And any chance I should see McGinley in a lead role, I'll take it. Hopefully he'll start better projects.
