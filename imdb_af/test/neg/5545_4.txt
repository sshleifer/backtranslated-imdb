"Lilies of the Field" Oscar-actor Sidney Poitier repeats his role as Lieutenant Virgil Tibbs of the Oscar-best Oscar best-in-the-night heat for veteran director Gordon Douglas, "tired, unforgettable sequel ". They call me Mister Tibbs, "with no one the equivalent of Rod Steiger with whom the dialogue can vary. Apparently both" Bullitt "painting Alan R. Trustman and Robert D. Webb of" Cape Fear "of their game when they made this predictable The dialogue is dead and none of the characters are interesting, not even the main suspect, absolutely nothing exciting, exciting or surprising is present in this easy-going vodunit. Meanwhile, things have changed considerably since Virgil was last seen in "In the Heat of the Night." He worked as a killer detective for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Police Department. In "They call me Mister Tibbs," our hero works for the San Francisco Police Department. a woman, Valerie (Barbara McNair of "Change of Habit"), and a family, a young rebellious boy, Andy (George Spell of "The Naked Kiss") and a younger doting daughter, Ginger (Wanda Spell of " Hickey and Boggs "). Tib bs drive a medium blue Mustang and his wife holds the house down and hangs over their two children, as he does not have much time to spend with them. Literally, there are no surprises in this pedestrian murder mystery. Indeed, the best thing about "They call me MISTER Tibbs" is Quincy Jones's tremendous orchestral soundtrack with an unforgettable opening theme, more memorable than this forgotten crime thriller deserves. <br /> <br /> Everything begins sensationally with a struggling prostitute, Joy Sturges (Linda Towne of The Adventurers), being killed in the bedroom of her centers in the bedroom of an invisible attacker. Apartment maker Mealie Williamson (Juano Hernandez of "Intruder in the Dust") arrives in Joy's apartment and finds her dead on the carpet with a bloody forehead. He picks up the image briefly and places it back on the floor and reports Joy's death to the apartment's superintendent, Rice Weedon (Anthony Zerbe of "License to Kill"), and Weedon gives Mealie and fussy dollars and sends him packaging. . Then Weedon anonymously shows the SFPD that popular minister Logan Sharpe (Nevada Smith's Martin Landau) has beaten Joy to death and appears to be leaving Joy's apartment. Captain Marden (Jeff Corey of "True Grit") advises Tibbs to handle the case; It seems that both Tibbs and Sharpe have known each other for 18 years. Of course, Tibbs's wife, Valerie, cannot believe that the well-known, politically-active evangelist has committed such a crime. Just to give the film context, it should be noted that when Tibbs and police study the crime scene, they call the word "semen" a controversial term to mention in an early 1970s movie. <br /> <br /> Tibbs questions Weedon, what he suspects, is either a drug reporter or a pimp. Weedon explains that he has no records on Joy Sturges because she sublet the apartment from another brokerage company. Tibbs visits the realty company and broker Woody Garfield (Ed Anser of "JFK") flees and drives off, essentially doing an O.J. Simpson until he crashes his car into a long but easy quest. When Tibbs proves that Woody did not kill Joy, he is ready to divorce himself with divorce, Marge (Norma Crane of "Penelope") for divorce following the revelation that he has paid a hooker in an apartment. to stay. . <br /> <br /> Tibbs cuts down Mrs. Mealie and cleans him of the crime, and then he goes to Weedon. Fortunately, for Tibbs, our hero picks up the evil Weedon in the middle of a drug deal. One of Weedon's henchmen beat Tibbs, but Tibbs briefly gives him a go before starting a long foot behind Weedon. Eventually, he cornered Weedon in an underground car park and they shot it out. Guess who wins. <br /> <br /> The scenes in the Tibbs household are more interesting than its investigation. Andy walks aloud, raises his sister and smokes in the garden. Our hero wants him to clean his room. When Andy refuses, Tibbs appears on the jaw three times. This childcare scene can never be dealt with today because they were back in 1970. At the end of the film, as if the family series is being strengthened, Tibbs is seen walking away with his wife and children. There is a confrontation between Valerie and Virgil about the well-being of their children and how she has influenced their long hours at work. <br /> <br /> Director Gordon Douglas regulates skillfully. Surprisingly, for a movie released in 1970, filmmakers never play the race card. In one scene, Tibbs sees a billiard room owned by an African American. We see mixed races hitting the hero when he gets Mealie and dragging him in tow. <br /> <br /> Altogether, they call me Mister Tibbs "is a poor follow-up of" In the Heat of the Night. "Please note, Poitier is still performing well with nuance, but everything seems to be pre-fabricated. All sets look fake and there isn't much physical violence: one long-lasting underground car park and one battle. Beyond Jones final jazz score, the only surprise ?? and it doesn't really qualify as a big surprise, more like a convenient skill is the end, Donald Medford's "The Organization" follows "They call me Mister Tibbs" as the second, more action-packed successor.
