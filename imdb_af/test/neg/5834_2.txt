It's a space, or I think it's at least. You have half-naked female prisoners in a space prison and a monster at a space station with a virus to infect humanity through sexy encounters. She Friggin Hilarious. The acting is so bad that sperm tones look like an Emmy award-winning movie. The story is simple. Space prisoner gets a chance to reduce sentence by investigating a space station that has lost touch with humanity. She finds a doctor "experimenting" with women and an evil of alien. She fights them, and so on. It's a movie to watch, just to laugh at your pants. If you like Real sci-fi flicks, it's a no-no, but it's a good mood for the amateur movie maker because I can make sure their movie is better than that.
