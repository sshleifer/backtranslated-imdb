A very sensitive subject - 15 y / o girl left by the mother as a baby and visiting her, is still ignored, being raped by her mother's boyfriend, getting pregnant. There was not enough depth of this situation. Too much time is being dealt with by truck drivers transporting the baby. (Interestingly, this baby with asthma - you never see him cry - except once - is fed, has changed diaper throughout the truck transport test.) I would have liked to see more of the interrelationships, more focused on the fact that these girl was a minor - it should have risen to court immediately. <br /> <br /> And it was a real story! It deserves a better score than that! <br /> <br /> If it wasn't for the subject, I'd give it a closer to a 0 rating. I rented it from the library. Only later did I find out that it was a TV movie. <br /> <br /> oh well
