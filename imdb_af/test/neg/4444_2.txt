Altman's quintet should be considered more than just faulty. As many other reviewers have pointed out, the ideas behind the film, even some of the choices in portraying the ideas, should work - but very little in this difficult movie. The partially faded camera lens - I told my wife that it had never allowed the most distracting legal idea I had ever seen in the movie world. <br /> <br /> In general, there are serious problems with the mise and scenes used here. Obviously, not a small amount of thought has gone into factors such as costumes and production designs, but it is also not very effective in creating a credible world. Maybe it's a matter of scale; the film is so advanced that I laughed out loud when it was mentioned that "five million" people lived in the city. (Yes, I understand the limitations of the film's budget. Matte paintings here and there might have helped.) In all the most disappointing Altman movie I've ever seen. Great ideas and great metaphors are not always in art - it's just part of the game.
