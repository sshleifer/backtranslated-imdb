This movie about it on the cgi, I mean sci-fi really they did it the original '' BATS '' is better, it doesn't use cgi like the successor. In this movie are the simple people running from mutated killer bats. and really bats in Afghanistan?! the plot involves you swarming soldiers who find a terrorist and are attacked by bats and deaths. The acting is bad and it doesn't even look like a horror movie. In this movie is a pretty good TV movie for the sci-fi channel. but if you like the movies of sci-fi, you will keep this movie because you just love channel 43 oh and if you fall asleep, don't be surprised. o sorry I think I give it 2 stars instead.
