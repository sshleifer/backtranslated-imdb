"The Thomas Crown Affair" is a terrible remake of a not-very-good movie, just for the topless shots of former supermodel Renee Russo. <br /> <br /> That's it. The plot is insignificant, Pierce Brosnan phoned in his part, and Dennis Leary (as usual) plays an annoying Irish policeman, but I couldn't figure out my eyes. Russo does not take off. There is a cute love show on a staircase, a terrific sexy ballroom dance, a topless beach scene and a role in the bag. Oh, and there's a painting stolen from a museum and a catamaran sank. <br /> <br /> But we hope that other directors acknowledge me. Russo's beautiful features and throws her into more, highly visible roles.
