Well, they sent it on TV between midnight and two o'clock. It looks like the right time to watch it, then go to sleep ... <br /> <br /> No, it doesn't really live up to my expectations. I think the Dogma concept is good because the movie then comes closer to what really happens between the characters involved when cutting out all the unnecessary effects and mood music. But then this concept needs some interesting actions between characters. <br /> <br /> I can't say that I know King Lear (the Shakespeare version) well, if I know the play, I would probably have Lots of the movie predicted. <br /> <br /> Well, a crisis can display the best and worst sides of a character, and we definitely see some bad sides. Oh yes, the painting of civilization and culture can be very thin, and behind this paint you can find an animal. <br /> <br /> If you then compare it to "Italian for beginners" or "Mifunes's last song" (Mifune's last song), you see the same, but opposite thing: A crisis can definitely bring people to their see life in a more constructive way. And if you dare, you can win. <br /> <br /> When the movie ended, I thought to myself, "Oh, that's why I haven't seen it yet." The film has its own beauty. . The quality of the work of the cameraman, actors, etc. Is good. But the writing may need something more. A plot may not be hurt.
