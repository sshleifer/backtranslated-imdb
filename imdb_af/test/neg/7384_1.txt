This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. No story, no point, it was not funny at all, not sure why people say this movie is hilarious because it sucked so much !! Felix Bean sucked the main character. Susanna sucks. This movie was made in 1996 and it was really in the 80's. Anyway, I never let my friend choose movies again. Hmm, the film cover said it was from the manufacturers of super troops, who kidnapped them and stole their identities. Wow, that wastes of time. The only thing that was funny was Freaky Ricky, he was funny, especially when he and Emily came together. It was funny. Everyone sucks it, wasting time and sleep. Wow, never thought a movie like this could be made, so stupid to look for it to the end.
