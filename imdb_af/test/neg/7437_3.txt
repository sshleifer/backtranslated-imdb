It was okay, but really a bit disappointing because I expected more to laugh. Considering the storyline and the main actor (Bill Murray), it had to be much harder than it seems to be. Only part of this really made me laugh, like when Murray lost control of his semi and was at a strange angle on the road. (You have to see it to appreciate it.) <br /> <br /> The supporting role-play was anything but nice people. Just look for a sample of the names: Matthew McConaughey, Janeane Garofalo and Linda Fiorentino. Yecch! McConaughey's role here as "Tip Tucker" was just really annoying. He was the worst. <br /> <br /> Other people, the movie has fun moments, but overall it is not recommended. It's another Disney flop.
