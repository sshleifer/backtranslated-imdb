This movie probably started with a good idea, but it is as far as it went. When I read the cover at Blockbuster, I thought it had promise, but it was based on the overall idea of ​​the movie. The film started with a professor talking about how we can see creatures of other dimensions in the future. There was no explanation of how this would happen, but it's good, I thought it would be developed in the movie. It wasn't. In the next scene, we see two young men lying on tables with tubes tied to their heads. Apart from each other, there are two attractive women. The men start asking "Do you hear it" or "Do you see them"? We conclude that they think they see or see another creature that looks invisible or hallucinated. The women don't see these creatures. It was good for the first five minutes, but this screen goes for a full hour. It is briefly underlined by flashbacks that do not correlate with the so-called "plot" of the movie. We are also introduced to a man in a lab coat and what seems to be Middle Eastern terrorists. What is it about? We never find out. The flashbacks lead us to believe that the terrorists force the man in the lab coat to perform diabolic experiments on these youngsters, but we never understand why. At the end of the film do the terrorists finally do what terrorists do? they blow up the lab, but why? What's the point? We have no idea. This film contains so many disconnected thoughts and ideas that there is too much to summarize, but one notable one is the fact that the man in the laboratory appears in dresses and the terrorist in and out of the room in the film and does not even do the youngster not men try to escape or even let the tables lie down on them, though they are not tied! The creators of the movie also bring a comedy from cockroaches several times, but again we never learn what it has to do with the storyline. Sorry, but this movie was a $ 4 waste and the time I spent traveling to the rental shop. Take my advice. Don't rent it.
