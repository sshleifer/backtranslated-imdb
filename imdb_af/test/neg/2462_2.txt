"JB" (Jack Black) walks away from home after being beaten by his father (Meatloaf). Years later, he eventually made it to Hollywood and came across the biggest guitarist he'd ever heard, "KG" (Kyle Glass). <br /> <br /> After a little clipping, the two decide to work together and perform at an Open Mic Night on what seems to be less than popular bar. To do their shock, they do not do so well. <br /> <br /> Back at their less than spectacular apartment, try the two to find out what the legends of rock they are not doing while watching some old magazines. It was only when they realized that the guitarists on the cover had the same guitar pick. <br /> <br /> While trying to find a similar choice, an employee of the music store (Ben Stiller, who is also the movie's Executive Producer) tells him the ancient story of "Pick of Destiny ", which they are looking for. The employee, who has long gray hair and thick glasses, also tells them that the choice made of Satan's tooth is in a history of the rock museum. <br /> <br /> Now, the two stinging trophies with cruelties of grandeur go on a music-filled adventure to steal the pick. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you, if you're not a fan of Tenacious D, who gave us the comedy actor Jack Black, then you have to hit this one. I'm not a fan of these two, and just watched it because it was suggested by Flixter.com. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the jokes make silence more than anything. I might have laughed at three of the jokes and clapped some others. Tenacious D is only for a certain audience, of which I am not. <br /> <br /> This movie is in many places, and that's where the worst jokes appear. And let me say that when Black and Glass do not work, they are completely lost on the screen. <br /> <br /> All the songs in this movie are performed by Tenacious D. Lots of songs Complete the storyline perfectly by describing their adventures in the movie right now. However, I felt that the songs sound too flush to see each other off. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this movie is that the language will turn off many people. There are lots of four letter words in this movie. There are also some drug references. I wouldn't recommend it for children. <br /> <br /> Sharing Tenacious D's schtick is that Black is in your face, and Glass is for the most part in its shadow. So it's in this movie, and it doesn't really work. Now, it may have been part of the act, but I felt that Glass wasn't just there. In one scene he performs his (background) lyrics at a party and he just can't work alone. <br /> <br /> Tenacious D is supposedly rock fans in real life and may have two rock legends in the movie. , I lost count because I was so bored with this movie. Personally, I would have liked to see more rock legends and icons in the movie. But we don't get it. <br /> <br /> What we get is a movie full of lame jokes, very dirty language, a slim writing. You also get horrible acting, and an inexorable story. But you get some pretty good songs that sound almost the same. <br /> <br /> The story could have been promising, but many of the scenes appeared in the movie at the last minute. It is a bit similar to The Blues Brothers movie many years ago, but the Blues Brothers had a much bigger one - and two songs on the Billboard music cards. Tenacious D has only a small consequence, with some HBO species under their belt. And unlike the Blues brothers, the comedy is not well thought out. <br /> <br /> If you're a tough core fan of Tenacious D, I suggest you look it up. But as most of the film heard when this film was released to theaters, I would say this one is avoided. Save your money on this one, people.
