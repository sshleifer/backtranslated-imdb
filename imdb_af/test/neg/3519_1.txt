I recently watched this movie because I am a great Kinski fan. But, oh my god. Don't get me wrong. I love this man. But in this movie his entire play is just a refusal to work! But fortunately he is not the only one to blame. First, the complete storyline is completely poor, dealing with armed men who are looking for a killer while Kinski is in prison for a crime he has not committed. That's all. All the dialogues and characters are so bad that it screams you. But maybe it's the fun of all. Knowing the Kinski biography makes it clear that Kinski doesn't care about those movies. Especially his Italo-Western roles. He just took the money and it was. Again, this whole movie is totally weird. Only for hardcore fans of the genre.
