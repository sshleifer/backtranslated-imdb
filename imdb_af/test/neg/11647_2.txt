What did I think when I rented this one? What did the distributor think when he copied the tape and sent it all the way to Holland? That someone really wants to see it ***? <br /> <br /> It's about a few astronauts that get into trouble (Apollo 13 flashes but never in the shadow of this fine movie) and they want to return to home. If you're in such a movie, be glad you drifted off the ground as far as possible! <br /> <br /> In 1998, this one will be working on the small wave space movie (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere. Deep Impact and Armageddon were also not perfect (far from it), but at least they were worth watching once (and perhaps once again when we were all old). They had lots of fun. Max Q does not. It causes irritation. Okay okay. It's a TV movie, but does it mean that you can come up with such a mess? <br /> <br /> If you didn't get stuck in your own vomit at the end (through all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you should have borne yourself with the waste of time. <br /> <br /> It gets worse at the end when the spacecraft falls on land ... No, I can't spoil "this one (IMDb guidelines forbid it). So you should see for yourself. NO! Don't see it (sorry), but rent a movie worth renting (like Battlefield Earth ... just joke!) Probably the worst one I've ever seen.
