(Some Spoilers) PRC quickie what J. Carrol Naish plays, the Dr. Igor Markoff, who is not really Dr. Karkoff is not, but a fraudster who has taken over his identity in Europe. <br /> <br /> The real dr. Karkoff had a relationship with dr. Markoff's wife who led him to become the true Dr. Markoff killed and when his wife Lenore was infected with acromegaly that made her look like the "Elephant Man's" sister. It was so that no one ever wanted to look at her and he could keep Lenore all to himself; but the disturbed Lenore even got her mad man by murdering herself. <br /> <br /> This nut, the false dr. Markoff, then, mocks Patricia Lawrence, Wanda McKay, one night at the theater where her father Tony Lawernce, Ralph Morgan, a world-renowned pianist gives a concert. Delighted by the beautiful Patricia, who is a dead ring for his dead wife, Lenore, Dr. Markoff obsessed with her and goes extremely long to marry her, though she does not want anything to do with him. <br /> <br /> After becoming ridiculous In his efforts to fall in love with Patricia by sending her flowers with syrupy love notes attached to as many as five times a day, Tony goes to the crazy Dr. Mankoff to see that he didn't annoy his daughter. It was then that Tony finally got out of the good doctor who injected him with a dose of acromegaly, which turned him into a somewhat unsightly fellow man. With his hands and body swelling up and unable to play his beloved piano, Tony is drunk by his doctor. Adams, Sam Flint, says that the only one who can cure him of that terrible disease is no different from Dr. Markoff! the person who gave it to him. <br /> <br /> The movie has the usual subplots with Dr. Markoff's assistant Maxine, Tala Birell, who is also in love with him who makes the Phony doctor for Patricia. There is also Dr. Markoff's tinkering agent, Glenn Strange, who, just like his pet gorilla, is just a big bump that can't even suppress Maxine, which is less than half the size. Strangely ending up on the head and Patricia's boyfriend, Bobby Blake, Terry Frost, pushed out cold. As far as the Gorilla is concerned, it just seems like a big hairy wimp when he also tries to do Maxine and is chased away and closes himself in his cage, through the pet dog Aas. Markoff, in his desperation to get Patricia to marry him, promises to heal her father just to break her father out of his chains and in the ensuing battle with him, Markoff dies with his own gun. <br /> <br /> There is a happy ending to this mess with Maxine, who knew so much about Markoff's acromegaly cure as he did, Tony with a secret serum that made him as good as new . The movie ends, as it started, while Tony plays the piano to a packed and delightful home theater theater.
