I'm looking forward to this movie. Reliable actors, interesting plot. Great atmosphere then ????? If you are going to do something that is meant to encapsulate the meaning of life. First. Know this. OK I didn't expect the directors or writers to know its meaning, but I thought they might have offered crumbs to blow up and treat to add fuel to the fire. they almost did. Things I didn't get. A woman wandering in dark places and lone parking bays alone - unaware of the consequences. Great puzzles that fell along the way. The promise of the knowledge contained therein in the original so-called criminal. I had no problem with the budget and didn't enjoy the stress. I understood and could lyrical about the fool and found that Adrian Paul's role was decisive and pervasive and then ????? Actually, the story line and the font where good to a point and the point was last 10 minutes or so. What? Run out of ideas! It is a pity that this movie had to drop us so badly. It can't understand the meaning and I really didn't expect the authors to understand it, but I was hoping for an intellectual, if not a spiritual ride and a clash in the road.
