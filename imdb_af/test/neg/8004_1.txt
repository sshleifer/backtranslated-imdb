This movie could have been better if they didn't use Brian Conley as a gangster and if they didn't start the movie with Christopher Biggins. <br /> <br /> When I watched this movie, I have absolutely no idea what is going on. There were too many double crosses and plots to make the film credible. The movie deserves a 0, but since I'm not there, I gave it a 1. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy, but I'd rather stick out my eyeballs with a few rusty scissors than to watch this movie again. I tell you, it was half an hour of my life. I won't be coming back. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a gunman movie, don't get it. Instead, look at "Big Time" or "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels".
