Like almost everyone, I became aware of this turkey at Mystery Science Theater 3000. It's easy as one of my favorite MST3K episodes of all time. I really couldn't predict watching this movie myself, but it really is really really really really really bad. <br /> <br /> Miles O'Keeffe stars as Ator, a muscle-bound Fabio wannabe living in the time of cave men. We are asked the viewer to suspend our unbelief because he knows alchemy and chemistry and manages to build a complete fan within about 5 minutes. Yes, right! There is also a pretty attractive actress (can't remember her name) wearing a hub cap as a breastplate. Oh, and I can't forget that wacky Asian sidekick Thong. He had the easiest role in the movie, as he did not express one word of dialogue throughout the movie. He had to find out how to make his character interesting without speaking ..... and unfortunately he failed. <br /> <br /> The movie is not visible in any way and should only be viewed in the correct MST3K format. . If you look at that version, you'll laugh yourself! <br /> <br /> "I'm GREAT !!!!" <br /> <br /> Rating: 1
