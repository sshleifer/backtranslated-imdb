I'm sure I'm in the minority (I know I'm among my friends), but I found this movie long, boring and free. The fact that DENIS LEARY played the role is the most similar character (the only other time I liked him was in "A Bug's Life"!) Speak volumes. Rene Russo's character was annoying, and Thomas Crowne was flat and stereotypical. To say he is two-dimensional can be a little generous. (No, the scenes with his psychiatrist didn't help him really make him.) <br /> <br /> With the exception of two wonderful scenes (both in terms of museum creator and not Rene Russo involved) at home television television golf.
