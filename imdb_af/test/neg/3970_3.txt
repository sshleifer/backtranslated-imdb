Parts: The Clonus Horror is not that bad of a movie. I have tied up the MST3K version and it's hilarious, but it's still not the worst movie ever done. I will go so far as to say that it was better than 80% of the movies they made fun of. The concept could have worked if they had a better writing, more money and decent actors. It could have become a classic if it wasn't so boring and had a little more excitement. Unfortunately, it is blocked in production and ends up on MST3K.
