Simply unlucky Lana Turner-Ezio Pinza vehicle. Pinza had a beautiful voice, but he rarely used it in a movie reminding me of "The Student Prince" with adults. Pinza is also not a leading man. He looks like an elderly man who is ready to gather social security and go fishing. <br /> <br /> The plot is extremely thin and the supporting role of Barry Sullivan, Marjorie Maine and Debbie Reynolds is given so little. Mr Cedric Hardwicke comes to the end to announce that our king Ezio returned to his people better. As for me, the faster the better. Is it really Lana Turner singing with Pinza? Not bad if it's her. The photo will also remind me of the 1960 film "The Prince and the Showgirl" with Marilyn Monroe and Laurence Olivier.
