Carole Lombard stars in this transitional film. This film is a typical example of a very early "talkie" (first practical sound movie was "The Jazz Singer", 1927). Overall, the play in this movie tends to be extremely broad and very melodramatic. <br /> <br /> The viewer can easily notice that the actors are still "acting" for a silent movie, in combination with the exaggerated, excessively serious dialogue (It seems likely that a elocution drama coach extensively employed to teach the "silent" actors to speak lines), creating rather spectacular scenes that had not been planned at all. <br /> <Carole Lombard's later great acting ability is anything but unrecognizable among all the broad gestures, melodrama and eager seriousness. <br /> <br /> Essentially interesting as a historical curiosity of the era, and it's totally unintentional comedy camp value.
