BEGIN SPOILER !! Well, I saw it at the film festival in Cologne and I have to say it is ridiculous ... sorry, writer and author and ... whatever but it is the worst trying to make a good movie I have ever seen have ... if you have 5000 times the chance to get away from your enemy and you do not .... it gets boring ... there are szenes in the movie witch gives you the impression that they are forgotten, eg. . A szene in front of a security camera, they ask for help and someone sees it and calls the police ... if there is a cut and .... Nothing? ... the killer gets a shot in his head and 50 seconds later he acts like nothing happened ... no, it's not a zombie movie ... and finally the final ... the BIG END that we promised .... hmmmm, let's say, take a little guy who always wanted to give the world one of the best ends in history, so bad that everything goes wrong .... I'm not going to vote because the actress is nice ...;)
