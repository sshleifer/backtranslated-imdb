Yes, said the title line actually appears in this movie. Why? I'm not sure. When the line was actually said, did anybody in the crew laugh at some point? I would love to see the outings of this movie, mostly because I think they would be more entertaining than the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Helmed by director Jim Gillespie, ("I know what you did last summer,") comes a teenager treasure film that shows we've never seen a teenage treasure movie. Of course he shouldn't get the blame. There are also three authors responsible, and this is somehow based on a video game still in production. The title of the game mentioned is "Backwater", but in search of information I have found absolutely nothing. <br /> <br /> And so we start the movie ... I'd like to say before I continue it I didn't expect it to win an Oscar. If I'm in the right mind, I enjoy a fun horror movie to pass the time. I think there is an opportunity for an effective, original, and clever film. "Venom" is not this movie. <br /> <br /> There is almost no character development. It is good. You don't expect much. But instead of a good piece of a couple, this movie decides to introduce us to the following many horror movie cliché characters ... <br /> <br /> 1. The final girl: She just got up for her boyfriend. This means that at some point in the movie when they are in danger, they will decide to come back together. What more than likely means he'll die and she'll be the last survivor of the movie. "Eden" is played by Agnes Bruckner, without much enthusiasm, which I can add. <br /> <br /> 2. The Boyfriend: He's just going to end up with The Final Girl. Certainly, he can save her, but he's doomed and we know it. "Eric" is played by Jonathan Jackson. <br /> <br /> 3. The Bimbos: Usually horror movies are just the need for one of these, but here we have two. Their shoplifter, they steal, they can show their breasts (not in this case) or they may be alcoholics. A staple of the genre. They also wander in dim light areas all on their lonely, usually saying things like, "Hello? Is there anyone there?" "Tammy" and "Patty," which are appropriate, are played by Bijou Phillips and Davetta Sherwood. <br /> <br /> 4. The Jackass: Sure, he looks pretty, but he's the idiot in the movie that is just an idiot. He says stupid things, does stupid things, has never seen a horror movie, and is one of the best things to watch to see this sort of thing. "Sean" is played by D.J. Cotrona. <br /> <br /> 5. The girlfriend: She loves the Jackass although pretty much no one else does, and she is usually the one who lived for a while so she can scream and cry until she starts walking out and left behind. "Rachel" is played by Laura Ramsey. <br /> <br /> 6. The Creepy Janitor: In this case, The Creepy Gas Station Attendant. Enough said. "Ray" is played by Rick Cramer. <br /> <br /> I can go on, but I think you get the picture. The remaining characters are not so common, as they are equally deadly. There is "The Gay Guy" (Pawel Szajda as "Ricky") who was definitely robbed at the time of the screen, and "The one who knows what's going on." Of course, nothing of it matters, because everyone always thinks you're crazy. "Cece" is played by Meagan Good. <br /> <br /> There are a few other characters, namely a Deputy Man played by Method Man, but he and others are killed fairly quickly and receive even less character development than the following clichés. <br /> <br /> So, you probably think, "why does this movie require such a deep analysis? It's just a summer horrorflick, because Cryin is out loud!" Based on demand, does it deliver the goods? Yes, and no. The acting is not particularly convincing, even the amount of talent involved. Byou Phillips was welcomed for her performance in Larry Clark's Bully, and Agnes Bruckner has been a talent for some time. <br /> <br /> So, how about the gore? There are a few. It's really about it. Many of the best bits are slices. On behalf of a scene where someone's face and a sandblaster were involved, the paint removed cars. <br /> <br /> For the filmmaker's credit, there are some interesting scenes. I like the little bit where a house of a house is literally moved so that the unstoppable villain could come to the characters. <br /> <br /> If it's all about a smarter script where the characters didn't make the same stupid mistakes literally made hundreds of horror movie characters ahead of them, which could have made for a more enjoyable experience. All of the most interesting characters are immediately killed in the first third of the film and then it just becomes an unbelievably interesting count until we know it's just The Creepy Janitor and The Final Girl. <br /> <br /> I suppose I should be a bit, but as a horror movie fan, I'm going to wonder why I should have bothered if I could write a better script myself. I won't even mention the many cases of terrible CGI.
