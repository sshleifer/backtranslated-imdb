Notwithstanding, "The House of Adam" is intended to be a mainstream gay movie; that Anthony (John Shaw), who is gay curious and a big candy hunt and Adam (Jared Cadwell) who is openly gay, and a close second in appearance; that there are a whole minute wonderful, convincing and naked love stories (sorry, no front) between Anthony and Adam 41 minutes in the movie (it can be for many of us alone) --- despite everything I give a thumbs up ), "The House of Adam" is a terrible movie almost any other filmmaking standard. A big thumb down. <br /> <br /> Shaw's and Cadwell's acting abilities are either sophomoric or rather suffering from the bad writing, direction, and editing, or rather the lack thereof. Their love domain is nevertheless convincing, and can do more with their real being in each other, taking into account the rest of their essays and plays. <br /> <br /> Jorge Amer's (Bonus Feature) self-congratulation is off the wall. <br /> <br /> So, the writing and lack thereof is a thumbs down. Overall, the play is thumbs up with just the slightest exception to Shaw and Cadwell. Alexis Career as Nina could have been the best, except for the limitations above. By far the absolute worst, and irreconcilable, acting by Thomas Michael Kappier as Albert Ross, Anthony's father does not even have a basic school acting quality. He truly represents a colossal decisive failure. <br /> <br /> The actors playing the new cabin owners are probably also bad acting nominations. <br /> <br /> If only the production, editing and post-production were as good as the trailer, this movie would have been quite different. The trailer offers good stones to scenes that helped me rent the movie in the first place. It and the hope that this gay-centered movie is thought to be prominent and played on gay movie festivals. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is a big inch off. <br /> <br /> Is It Worth Buying / Renting And Watching? Just as you have an irresistible jen to see the naked love show, and a few minutes of semi-convincing dialogue between Anthony and Adam. Or if you really just like watching bad movies.
