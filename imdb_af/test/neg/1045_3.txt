The Twilight Zone has achieved a certain mythology - much like Star Trek. That's because there are many dedicated fans of the show, no matter what each episode was as a winner. They are the one that shows each individual display 10 and cannot objectively evaluate the display. As a result, I've been reviewing all of the original Star Trek episodes (the good and the bad) for a while because overall ratings and reviews were just too positive. Now is the time to do the same for The Twilight Zone. <br /> <br /> Now I was very surprised when I saw reviews for this mere episode that described it as "among the best" and got it scores of 10 If so, why is it that everyone who I know who saw this episode, hate it as much as I do? It is possible that my family and friends are all the crumbs, but it is also possible that this is another case of rabid fans who inflate the score on an average or below average episode. <br /> <br /> The episode itself stars William Windom and other than different archetypes - a soldier, a dancer, etc. They all sit in a cylindrical room without escaping and just at the end you realize the "shocking truth" - which is not shocking at all and is actually largely paralyzed. No, it's a badly written and unengaging episode. Yes, there were many episodes of the series that earned a 10, but little as undeserved as those due to a shallow writing and an unattractive resolution.
