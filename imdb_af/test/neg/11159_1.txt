Let's make a summary of how silly this movie is with two details: Arnold to the Antichrist: "Let's see who's the most mean", say with a straight face. And you can say they didn't try to be funny. <br /> <br /> How do you think Arnold will fight the evil of all evil? <br /> <br /> Blessed Water, a crucifix, a priest. .nooo! With a bazooka, yes, not even Satan expected them to be so smart. <br /> <br /> After a tempting start (reminding you of the devil's advocate), it doesn't go anywhere. Someone gets me back that two hours of my life. Don't ever see it, rent it, don't buy it. <br /> <br />
