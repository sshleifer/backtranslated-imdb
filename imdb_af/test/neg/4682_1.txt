While writing these users comments, Tim Burton's interpretation of the Sweeney Todd story makes huge money at checkout and the film even earns a few Oscar nominations if I'm not wrong. I haven't seen it yet, but I sincerely hope that Burton didn't look at inspiration and / or stylish brands in good old Andy Milligan's Bloodthirsty Battles. Yes, although the title calls so-called butchers, the main characters in the plot are a hairdresser (the infamous Sweeney Todd) and a female baker. Together they form a dirty alliance where he kills the customers in his shop and processes the bodies in her well-known London meat pie. In other words, an Andy Milligan premium on his most typical, derivative, delirious and amateurist. I think the IMDb rating for this movie speaks for itself. Although the real story is definitely not the worst I have ever seen, Milligan draws inexplicable ambiguity. The production is a huge mess, with an incoherent story structure, really boring photography, poor lighting, lousy acting and directing, laughable gore and zilch tension or atmosphere. More than half of the footage is pure stuff and words don't describe how SHORT the movie is, even with a running time of just 80 minutes. Ed Wood, Ted V. Mikels and Bruno Mattei; you should not fear because no one but Andy Milligan is ?? loose ?? The worst director ever, but I don't think he cares. Perhaps if you have a very high level of tolerance, "Bloodthirsty Butchers" is worth a look.
