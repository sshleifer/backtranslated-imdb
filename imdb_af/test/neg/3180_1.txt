I'm shocked and surprised to find reviews that aren't a pity for this horrible movie. I hired this "movie" or feces, whatever you want, with several friends, and after thirty minutes we had to stop watching. Just after the dialogue, a terrible taste of sour milk left in my mouth. This movie was about as intelligent as a donkey pussy. I hope I will never see that bradless, ragged Anne (Julianne Nicholson) again. It was like watching the most acclaimed pilot for a sitcom that would never make it to television, but instead of a quick but painful 30 minute (all I could bare) it was a turbulent 90 minutes.
