It must say something about the state of our nation that this program is one of the most popular ones currently being screened. <br /> <br /> The 'square' is placed by such an unfortunate, unreliable, amoral, indifferent, relentless arid group of characters as can be imagined. Everyone sticks someone in the back, everyone tries to commit adultery, everyone tries to cheat someone. This, whether stung, stolen or swam. Nobody is happy. No one was laughing. No one has blinding luck or a very nice day. It's hell, with khaki accents. <br /> <br /> I suspect this program should be sponsored by the Samaritans. It's perfect to look for the depressed. It does not encourage them; What it does is a whole community of such terminal despondent sorrows that the viewers move to believe their fate can be really worse. They may live in Albert Square. <br /> <br /> Apart from the top; As a representation of London's eastern end, it is pure loft. The programmers have never been in town. The first thing you meet on the Mile End Road is a colossal mosque. And this pretty good defines the majority of the population. White British Londoners is a dispersed and rapidly decreasing minority. A major ad currently being hung near the Bow Road airport, sponsored by Tower Hamlets Health Care, boasts that 'Eight out of ten community members can now see their doctor faster'. Ten healthy, smiling faces are delineated by the observer. Eight of them are dark-colored ... <br /> <br /> In addition, I worked with a lot of Anglo-Saxon - I dared to pukka a few years ago - haanneuss. And I can tell you that a more unpleasant racist experience I've never had before. Every day was like an Oswald Moseley rally. They could not pass 5 minutes without harming another race or nationality as their own, and in terms of repulsive and obscene. 'Fackin' Pakis 'and' fackin 'Maceroons' was the small change of conversation. In fact, their entire (and extremely limited) supply of adjectives tied to sex organs and their application. Alf Garnett was a paragon of liberal virtue in comparison. <br /> <br /> Any program that allegedly represented London's native East End Caucasians in their true nature would be totally incompetent for broadcast - even after the 9-hour watershed. Imagine a Ku Klux Klan script written by Quentin Tarantino and you will be near the point somewhere. But when they weren't busy white, they were at least extremely cheerful. <br /> <br /> I don't know how such a soap opera came. This imaginary island island of white misery has absolutely no influence on real culture. And if you have a relatively sanguine attitude, it will quickly reduce you to tears of grief. Comparative ordinary actors who claim that they are relatively common chronic depressants with cocky accents - what is the point? <br /> <br /> Rude, foolish, relentlessly disillusioned and ethnically annoying. The most popular program of a seemingly sick and dying nation. <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the pest.
