I'm a big fan of British movies in general, but mostly gang movies. Unfortunately, this movie was shockingly bad. I think it's pretty depressed that this movie gets good customer reviews. The idea that this movie is eager and realistic is laughing. I have read and heard fist hands, much more about the real life events shown in this movie and they are almost all glorified by the top violence. The only grim truth in the whole movie was the Range Rover killings where some overwhelming bouncers were rubbing with people they couldn't handle. This movie is a disgrace to the British cinema! It has no plot and no decent acting and just trust it to be violent (eager and realistic as some people want). The kind of people who made this movie should not be allowed near a budget or movie camera, just like the kind of people this movie is about, should not be given the opportunity to tell this pathetic violent little story of no consequence.
