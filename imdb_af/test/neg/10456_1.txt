I thought it couldn't get any worse than "Army of the Dead", but this patch of shit made the movie like "The Godfather"! The special effects are HORRIBLE (Make the original Nintendo graphics such as HDTV). When it comes, it does so, I went to a play with my 6 year old cousin and she gave an Oscar-worthy performance compared to this D-List (and it's fun doing it) actors and actresses. So basically, if I had a gun on my head and head to choose to watch this movie again or to cut my own arm with a dull knife, it's a difficult choice! You know what, what needs two arms?
