I have never seen such a story of such talented hangers, so ungrateful that their golden goose didn't lie. These spunk monkeys are parasites and bad examples of friends. I was sorry for the consolation when he tried to join all his friends with Hollywood performances, but as soon as things got sour, they all hung up. Overnight was a confronted effort of self-giving retaliation on a man who acted against the powers of Hollywood to maintain story integrity. The basic premise of Overnight is to try to communicate the message, "look at this man, he has blown it all", when he actually followed a strong underground, helped hard by friends and drivers. done the way he intended it. Honestly, the only productive couple who played any of these guys in the overall performance of the Boondock Saints shooting, reached no more than extra bodies in the first bar room scene, and then they just thought they were not greater agreement was not. based on the climbing of their frantic efforts on top of comfort shoulders.
