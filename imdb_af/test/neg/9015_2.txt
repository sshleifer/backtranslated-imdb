Another winner from the 50s, 60s era I love so much for the comic value they give with every look. Corman never lets you down with these movies, they take themselves seriously and they have very low budgets, a recipe for good looking for sure. Ed Nelson a very capable actor started with Corman, as well as many other favorites that appeared in Superman and many of the west of the day. The costume is pretty bad and the noise of the stranger speaks, but the reverb was a bit off, but it's the beauty of it. Movie makes for the love of it, not looking for perfection just digging the action of doing it, it comes through. These movies are a fun time! Even better is the MST3K version !!
