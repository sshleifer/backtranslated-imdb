On the heels of the well-received and beloved classic age, on the lives of teenagers while in adulthood, George Lucas's American graffiti, we have Cooley High. An adaptation of species by one Eric Monte, co-creator of the popular 1970's CBS sitcom Good Times. <br /> <br /> Cooley High was and is considered a black version of American Graffiti. Instead of central California, as in American graffiti, we have the black slash of Chicago's Cabrini Green as the backdrop for the story here. Instead of America in 1962, Cooley High was located in 1964. The movie stars Welkom Back Kotter, Lawrence Hilton Jacobs and Glynn Turman as the lead actors and main characters. It played Garrett Morris, the chief who tried to keep Jacobs and Turman's characters, Coceise and Preach, out of trouble, much of the time. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that Cooley High is a worthy comparison for American Graffiti or that it is a good movie on its own, but I can't. The problem is that the producers of the film can't hide the sad bottom of black life in America. The movie in the Cabrini Green section of Chicago does not help to do things. <br /> <br /> Here too, the crass rough attempts at humor are here. When Coceise is looking for a college intent, he finds his little brother tossing a toilet. When the gang to the Chicago Zoo, one of the gang called Pooter, is mist, he is thrown onto a monkey. When the Turman's character, Preach, is chased by two hoodlums in the school's hangout (a dirty and depressing place to meet food, he meets less people), he opens the door of the girls' bathroom while a girl lighten herself when he escapes through the window of the same bathroom! The high school, the characters' homes, the bathrooms, almost everywhere in the film, show the unhappy view of urban decline and poverty. <br /> <br /> If that wasn't enough, there was a rough display of humor in the movie. The use of violence and curse in the film. Cooley High may be an upcoming lifetime movie, but it is a hard and rough upcoming movie with little or none of the moods of using nostalgia that make people appreciate and appreciate American Graffiti. <br /> <br /> Motown Records had a hand to make the movie. The company's music was part of the movie's soundtrack. But even here you get a sense of the same old one, the same guy you heard all these songs for a million times. Not that they were not big songs within themselves, but black music, from that time on, was more than just Motown. Especially in Chicago. The song that reached the end of the movie, by the Spinners' G.C. Cameron wasn't that impressive. There were better Motown ballads that were better done by better Motown artists than Cameron. <br /> <br /> The last part of the movie in which characters are portrayed to pay tribute to the film, Cooley High, was aimed at, American Graffiti. It shows that Preach, an intelligent but engaging student, went to Hollywood and became a successful television writer. Eric Monte showed himself Turman's character. The last shot of the movie's Preach ran away from Coceise's funeral, held on a dark rainy afternoon, and all the sadness Cooley High represented. Eric Monte, through Preach and the final scene, had one lesson for all of us when we looked at Cooley High and for the love of the past. Don't look back.
