OK, I have to admit that I enjoyed the home of the dead properly despite the well-documented failures. However, this was the worst movie I've seen since Demons by the Door. Compared to DATD, the effects are much better. However, the plot is poor, the acting reminiscent of everyone's favorite, the porn movie, and the decisions and actions of the "characters" focus on the moron. I feel like Uwe Boll's latest movie outings just to get a sense of perspective on HOTD2. I am not suggesting that he is really the drug, but rather a case of another disease, but if your senses are insulted in such an abomination, the only way to act is. OK there it is. I achieved the ten line minimum and will no longer waste our time wasting celluloid that is the House of Death 2.
