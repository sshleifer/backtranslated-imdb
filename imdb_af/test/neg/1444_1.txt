Put this movie out of its misery and burn the negatives. What do I say? The whole movie was negative. Fortunately, only a few will find this movie the least attractive. This is what the great American majority will call too much sex and violence. It will probably show up on some non-premium cable channels, just for the shock value, but after the nudity has worked out (most of the violence will remain), anything left will be 45 minutes from a very bad play with 45 minutes of advertising. There are just too many hungry actors in Hollywood.
