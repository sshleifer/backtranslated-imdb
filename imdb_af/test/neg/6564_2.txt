No one expects the Star Trek movies to be high art, but fans expect a movie that is as good as some of the best episodes. Unfortunately, this movie had a devastated, unquestionable plot that made me shrink - it's by far the worst of the nine (so far) movies. Even the chance to watch the famous characters can vary in another movie, can't save this movie - including the goofy scenes with Kirk, Spock and McCoy at Yosemite. <br /> <br /> I would say this movie is not worth renting, and probably not worth watching, but for the True Fan who has to watch all the movies, renting this movie over the only way you will see it - even the cable channels avoid this movie.
