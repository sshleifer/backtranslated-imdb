Perhaps it raged them in the fifties, but it is one of those flicks that are not aging well. It has the ministers, serious, rounded working man's vibe of a second-rate Rod Serling live TV show. The plot, by the book, appears to join the Cassevetes character's turbulent background, and the love interest is unconvincing and half-hearted. <br /> <br /> Sidney Portier gives a good performance, but the man was probably an annoying, arrogant snot. If I had to work with the man in a warehouse, I would also like to hook him up with a joke. Jack Warden is good because he usually plays Jack Warden. <br /> <br /> Like 90% of the movies rated on IMDb (whether classic, mediocre or crapola), the one is classified with 7 points. -Some stars. It was by no means earned. Save your time
