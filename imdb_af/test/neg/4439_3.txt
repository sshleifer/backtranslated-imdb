Quintet is definitely not a movie that most people will find amusing or even interesting. There is no scene, dialogue, acting or plot development that would spark a spark. The icy world is one thing, but an uncovered plot is something you really can't carry. The characters are not only three-dimensional, they are not even one-dimensional, there is no emotion and there is no sense in anything that goes on. There is a world in ice, where nobody really works, except to play Quintet, and the rules of the game are never shown. The houses are not heated, even if there is electricity, but who and what makes it? There is wood, but there are no animals except dogs, where clothes come from or shoes for the case, as apparently there is no industry, and everyone is dressed like in the 16th century of Europe, which is in strange contrast to not as futuristic pavilion backdrop. The whole movie names are stuck in Altman's imagination, and he never bothered to share his ideas or his vision with audience. Destruction or hopelessness has nothing to do with a lack of appeal to this movie. The world of George Lucas's "THX1138" is not a better place and characters are no longer fun, but the story has its way. In Quintet there is no clear or even supposed road, and I think it's not even the idea to think it, such as a similar movie, John Boorman's "Zardoz". It's not even done in Altman's unique style, and it doesn't appeal to its fans, and I'm one of them. All in all, Robert Altman had a dream, and he woke up without telling anyone what it meant, not even to him.
