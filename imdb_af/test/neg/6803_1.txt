What did they think when they made this WARNING movie? <br /> <br /> Arbus, one of the main photographers and women of the Twentieth Century, had a fascinating and dramatic life. What did anyone have to make this film, explaining her unique artistic vision because of an (imaginary) relationship with a grotesque, yet charismatic hairy freak (played by Downey)? <br /> <br /> In real life, Arbus has broken out of a traditional marriage and wife's role in expressing herself. In this movie, Arbus is an ultra-dry Nicole Kidman whose inspiration is attributed to a "Beauty and The Beast" commitment to an interesting man. <br /> <br /> For this revival, the movie is really shameful. Independently, it is also dull and dull.
