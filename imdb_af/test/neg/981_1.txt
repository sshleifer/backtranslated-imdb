I was an extra on this movie, at the airport in the first 15 minutes or so; I was one of the refugees (mostly Mexican) Bangladeshi refugees running across the runways at Ryan Field in Tucson. At one point we died in a turbans while we were still waiting for a shot. One of my fellow extras asked me what the move would be. I told him it would be a remake of Lost Horizons, just as a musical. There was a long break, then he replied, "Man, this movie is going to suck". Basically of him, I thought. I had a good time and made some money, but even with some interesting personal memories attached to this movie, I can't go through the whole thing. <br /> <br /> If you've ever seen the movie "The Swarm", you can get the idea very well. You get many well-known and talented people who are being wasted on an idea that is just BAD's face. The idea was that if you throw enough money into a movie and get enough big names, then a good story and good writing is not necessary. Just turn the big crank and the product comes out. It's just not worth looking at.
