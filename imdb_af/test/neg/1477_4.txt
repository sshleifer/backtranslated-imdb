... and it's not a very good documentary or American MOVIE seems to have confused some people to think it's a mockumentary and even some newspaper TV lists have described it as such. I will not laugh out loud because it is easy to miss this documentary as a big wind, even if it is a brand new one. <br /> <br /> What caused the confusion is that the documentary center is about emerging film maker Mark Borchardt. Yes, but it's not necessarily a bad thing, because if we didn't have dreams, we would all still live in caves and the fact that Mark is obsessed with horror movies is not considered critical. since both Sam Raimi (yes that one) and Peter Jackson (yes the one) both started with low budget horror comedies, so again this is not a criticism. No, it's just that Mark Borchardt (yes that one) is a parody of American trailer waste <br /> <br /> Remember there is something about MA RY Ben Stiller gives a lift to a dodgy hitch hiker ("Get into my office because you f *** in") Well, that's what Mark looks like with most of Jerry Springer's guests, so it's very easy to see why some people thought it was Not a real documentary, nor is it a very good documentary, as Mark and my fellow give me the crawls. Did you know that someone thought Mark would grow up to be a serial killer? time to make it happen?
