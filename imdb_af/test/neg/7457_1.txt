This Canadian "movie" is the worst ever! Pleasing amateurist. When the bad guys rob a boat, we see two women with machine guns and one of them, with a very low voice, "We rob your ship!" She shines and is completely ashamed! Very intimidating. ROTFLOL !!! <br /> <br /> The two karate snacks are 40 years old, five feet long twin brothers! They're really bad actors. In fact, everyone involved in this production is a non-actor. <br /> <br /> There are so many errors in continuity in this cheap production that it's great. In one scene the guys wear one kind of swimsuit. In the next shot they wear completely different swimwear. <br /> <br /> Absolutely terrible! A must see for any fan of bad movies. I got it on VHS. It's very rare. I cherish it.
