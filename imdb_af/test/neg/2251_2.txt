I'm sorry people, but I have to say I can't understand the overwhelming feelings that everyone gets by seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> When I saw it, I looked at my watch to know how much more time I <br /> <br /> So, why is this statement? <br /> <br /> First of all: The movie tells a story that doesn't get excited! It's not even the wonderful distorted reality of a Quentin Tarantino we used. This story came out of every little child's head. It has nothing intelligent, and nothing is inventive and it takes hours. The story has about 30 minutes of suitable content. The rest are just terribly improved scenes that are supposed to leave a somewhat cool image. Not working. Even the previously-seen cuts that Tarantino often uses, confuse and are not cool at all. <br /> <br /> Second: Some guys go to Germany and kill Nazis. Oh really? Do they? The only Nazis who killed them were a handful of guys, one of whom was enough to die rather than betray his companions. Is this the ugly face Tarantino wanted to give the Nazis? A brave soldier who is more brave than any of the Basterds? Certainly not -> Fails And what happens to the terrible Nazi-killing Basterds? Well, they are all murdered by Nazis except two who are taken hostages -> Wow, how horrible vengeful monsters are they ... <br /> <br /> Third: Any characters? Yes one! The only role and the only smile of hope for the whole movie is Chritoph Waltz, who here builds a very deep and very detailed character. Great play! Brad Pitt really sucks and is completely out of action by Waltz. Never seen such a poor performance by Pitt. And the rest? Well, some Germans have never seen you and will never see it. When the movie started and I saw the group of the seven Basterds, I was hoping to see something like the "Magnificent Seven": A group of extraordinary guys, each with a distinct character, fearing their way to their destiny and fearless. I was very disappointed then when I saw the "ingelourious Basterds". No details, no characters, no real men, just a few random guys, you won't remember who didn't give the chance to distinguish themselves. But you don't even have to distinguish, because the "Inglourious Basterds" except Pitt don't play a role in this movie anywhere. <br /> <br /> So I was really disappointed and seeing this movie in place # 40 of the best movies of all time is the only thing about this. let me open my mouth ...
