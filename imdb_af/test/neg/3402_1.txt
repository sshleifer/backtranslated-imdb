Basically, it was obviously designed to be promotional material for the movie produced by the same terrible director. It's even worse than this documentary and absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen. Avoid it at all costs. <Br /> <br /> As far as this documentary is concerned, it is entertaining; entertaining and blatantly misleading! Most of the "historical" search material is probably just those historical footage of completely unrelated events that are unfortunately cut and pasted into these documentaries to make it more dramatic than it ever would be. There is no doubt that Waverly is a very interesting place, with much of its own fascinating history, but producing a documentary to market the local and related production is, due to better words, terribly useless. <br /> <br /> And yes, I've lived in Kentucky throughout my life, and I've visited the place several times. Waverly Hills deserves respect; and there is no respect for this lame documentary.
