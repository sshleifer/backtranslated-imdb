As usual, leader Leo Gorcey (like Slip Mahoney) and "The Bowery Boys" are hard pressed for cash. After not successfully selling their old jop, the boys are looking for help from the local bank. There, the unfortunate Huntz Hall (as Sach) took his photo by the pretty photographer Teala Loring (as Cathy Smith). But since the shot was broken during a robbery, it made Mr. Hall's looks like the first suspect. With Pals Bobby Jordan (like Bobby), William "Billy" Benedict (as Whitey) and David Gorcey (as Chuck); Mr. Gorcey wants to clean Hall and raise the $ 1,000 reward money. <br /> <br /> **** Bowery Bombshell (7/20/46) Phil Karlson ~ Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Teala Loring, Bobby Jordan
