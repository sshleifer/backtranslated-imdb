As Americans, we expected curvature as "par for the course" when it comes to HORROR and unfamiliar directors who direct unfamiliar actors acting on unknown authors. We really expect it to suck and when they do not suck it becomes an over-all success. <br /> <br /> It is NOT a supernatural success, nor is it over the weekend or over the month's success. It blows from start to finish, and my only recommendation is this: Go into this knowledge, it struggles, enjoy it for what it is, and for which you can't do anything, keep it at the back. . It's fun to see the elderly seeing a busy street in rush hour, but don't expect much. They are hardly ever hit by a real car, it's just a bunch of hoopla.
