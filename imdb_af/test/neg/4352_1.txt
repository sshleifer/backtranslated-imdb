It's the slowest "movie noir" movie I've ever seen. Very poor writing only offers opportunity for Jack Palance and Rod Steiger to deliver extraordinarily good, lines made for an acting audition. Palance and Steiger confirm they are indeed serious actors who can portray their respective roles with power, emotion and drama. The story itself moves incredibly slowly, mostly in a lounge. Of course, the director chased the actors in a rhythmic circle, as they had exhausted long lines to keep the slow pace of the public eye-catching. The action doesn't take up to the last ten minutes of the movie. If you are one looking more deeply in a crime drama, it's not for you!
