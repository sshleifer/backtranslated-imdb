It is included on the disk "Shorts: Volume 2" - a rather dull collection of short films. Shorts are one of my favorite styles of movies, but somehow the people collecting this second collection had a hard time finding quality content - and it wasn't as good as the first volume or other shorts. <br /> <br /> This short film feels like it is badly incomplete. There is a story but so much unanswered that the viewer, like me, feels a bit left out and unfinished. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a woman, her boyfriend and her Westie (it's a dog, casually) to a lonely beach. The lady speaks with an accent that is sometimes difficult to follow. Since I heard hard, I would have loved it if it was closed. Anyway, the boyfriend is going to swim while she is dumb. When she wakes up, her dog is gone. She panicked and let the man follow her to look for the dog. They spend most of the time on the argument and are unpleasant. Then, out of the blue, they stop having sex. Later they find the dog's end of the story. <br /> <br /> As far as the characters go, both seemed rather dysfunctional and unlikely. She was a tough and demanding woman and he had contempt for her. When you wondered why they were together, their small sex break showed what the band was holding them together. <br /> <br /> Some people like the characterization - I still found the people annoying and unreal - more like caricatures than people you can meet or know. Also the payout for all these is just not worth the wait (unless you want to see the man naked).
