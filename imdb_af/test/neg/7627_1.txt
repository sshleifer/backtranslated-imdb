Forgive me, but this work of director Peter Hall is terrible. If you can't get to the plot, don't kill someone's cat or dog. It certainly reaches audiences. This viewer is tired of seeing animals sacrificed for the plot of a movie. And believe me, I saw it before opening the package. How predictable you can get. Take a cute animal and then kill it in a horrible way. I have never been a fan of De Mornay and this show tells me why. Overstated and somewhat stagnant in interpretation, I found her rather stupid and definitely boring. I looked like Banderas, but felt bad about playing across De Mornay. He did much better in other films, "Philadelphia," where he was honest in his dialogue. In this chestnut he did his best to really keep his character. But the writers, Green & Rush, have done a good job of avoiding it with their proud story and incessant dialogue. Please, let's not be subjected to this kind of entertainment. Some of us are not deceived by grass plains, blowgeoning animals and generally long winds dialogue. As she got away with it, I became furious.
