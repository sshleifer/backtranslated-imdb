SPOILERS <br /> <br /> This movie was hired as a joke, and what a joke it was. The film is based on a dog catcher that El Chupacabra is looking for. The dog that catches is so ridiculous. He seems to have tied the plaster on his hat and for some reason he shows off his "muscles" by rolling up his sleeves. Throughout the movie, mostly at night, you can see how bad the lighting was. They're in a car that is brightly lit and they drive a pitch black. Often you can see the camera's shadow on the ground. The costumes are terrible, the lighting is terrible, and the play is terrible. It's a good movie for a laugh ... maybe.
