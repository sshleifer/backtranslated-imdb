!!! Spoiler Warning !!! <br /> <br /> The point, though, is that I didn't think this movie had an end to spoiling. I only started looking in the middle after Matt came in Sarah's body, but then I was fascinated by the bizarre plot, even for a Channel 5 movie ... and can't see Matt's finally happy. What about his fiancee? At one point he seemed to be getting his best friend, surely wrong and wrong ... and then the whole "oggi oggi oggi" thing didn't work as a friend's touch, it's just ridiculous. .. so was he not going to come back again? And how can he stay as a woman? 'and then the movie just came by ending and not explaining anything !!!!! What's this about ??? I was so cross, messed up my life for an hour! :) but was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, so, swing and roundabout
