I saw a big clip of this movie, which I will talk later, and then the list of roles, and I thought I might as well do it. Actually, a bartender, Randy (Matt Dillon), his shabby cousin Carl Harding (Paul Reiser) and murder investigator Detective Dehling (John Goodman) have all in common, they saw the girl of their dreams. (whether married or not), and they will do anything to please and be with her, even die. All three saw her a night at McCool's, and the bar that Randy worked for, didn't know each other, but all three couldn't stop thinking of Femme Fetal Jewel Valentine. All three tell their stories to someone they hope to listen to their beautiful, intense and revealing stories. Randy talks to Mr. Burmeister (Michael Douglas, Michael Douglas). Carl, psychologist / psychiatrist, dr. Green Reba McEntire) and Dehling for the priest, Father Jimmy (Richard Jenkins). They confess all the details of what they were willing to do, their sexual contact with her, and eventually they were all brought together in one place, with the purpose of being with her, and all involved in the final shooting that one death, one run away (and eventually die) and one stunned, and the unexpected man she chooses (but at the same time obvious, because it is Douglas's obsession). Also see Andrew Dice Clay as Utah / Elmo and Sandy Martin as Bingo Vendor Woman. If I had to pick a favorite moment, it would definitely be what was mentioned at number 11, along with Cool Hand Luke on the 100 biggest sexy moments, where Tyler laundered the woman with the lubricant and before Goodman, very sexy! Apart from that, not the most memorable movie. Okay!
