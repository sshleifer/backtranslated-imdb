Patsy Kensit and a random Australian blocker as a duo of wannabe hard buyers in the midst of investigating a series of art gallery related murders, but between them can still have the time to shoot young shoplifting and the new Man of the Man policeman of adultery. The murderer is suddenly no more important than the alleged woman's lover (who is actually only a co-worker of her) and the male police become the first suspect. "Tunnel Vision" is a very dull, indisputable and stress-free Aussie thriller that imitates, of course, popular sex thrillers such as "Deadly Attraction", "Disclosure" and "Basic Instinct". The characters are extremely one-dimensional and almost every good cop / bad cop clich√© is described in detail in the script. The struggling position of police women in a corps full of men, the shooting first-question-questions-later mentality, alcohol problems through stress, and so on? Even the unhealthy eating habits of policemen are a running prop. To yawn! Kensit is trying her best to make this movie more bearable, but she does not have the credibility and talent of a real biosheroin. The final turn is more or less interesting (not at all original, do you think), but then you have long since provided the characters. The screens filmed in the sex clubs seem ridiculously false and Clive Fleury's direction is completely uninspired. What a total waste of time?
