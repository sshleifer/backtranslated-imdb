Essentially, it's a horrible movie with some features it might or may not have for you, depending on how much you want it to be. In the opening of the "Red Green Show" for the big screen, the filmmakers sparked the rustic charm over a decade of worth of episodes envisaged in and around Possum Lodge from a common photographed "road movie" with An abominable faux-Hollywood "big" musical score and a very boring story not adorned with enough good gags to make it as entertaining as even the most mediocre episode of the TV show. <br /> <br /> Having designed a plot line that most likes the Possum Lodge members screen off for most of the movies and requires virtually everyone involved, meanly, for the lovely Harold (who is the hero of the movie, the usually neatly crusty Red creature rejected in this incarnation, nothing more than the role of chief Harold abuse, the only artists who really shine, are Patrick McKenna and Peter Keleghan as Harold and Ranger Gord, who deliver satisfactorily large-screen versions of their small-screen characters.
