Drive around on bootlegs, sometimes thinking of an urban comic book legend, the first FF movie is almost as bad as everyone's fear. I think Marvel Comics now suggests that it doesn't exist, which is with the 2005 version in theaters earlier this year. But it is there, a reminder and the last of the first wave of bad, low budget. Wonderful superhero adaptations (Captain America, Punisher, most of the TV movies). 'Low budget' is too easy a description for this FF photo. Because of basically no funds, which were the powers of the super four, it was limited to very fast shots (Mr. Fantastic), quasi-animation (Torch), and faded (Invisible Girl - the easiest to do). The suit wasn't bad and probably half the budget; The face team was almost convincing. The acting? Alex Hyde-White as Reed is pretty good; the other 3 is OK, tho Jay as Johnny sometimes works like a spaz to point out his "fiery" temper. The dialogue is cartoon style, which is the supporting role that eventually inflates, trying to make it work. Dr.Doom is much more melodramatic and incessant comics, and his two main henchmen are a case study of how not to act or write dialogue. <br /> <br /> The plot? Not too good. By the way, it was true to the original story of the FF (more than the later big budget version), and although the non-budget is limited again to show, for example, the actual crash landing, it was the essential ingredients of how they had their powers discover a remote area - this is the best part of the picture, you have to wait half an hour for it. I also found the music strange in places; when the 4 are bathed in those cosmic rays, a kind of church choir is heard, as if it is a religious experience. However, the rest is hopeless. Even without any budget, the story could have done without the jewel character (like the Mole Man villain of the books); It spends too much time with him and his underground gang, as well as the blind Alicia. These parts are a waste of celluloid and very boring. The climatic battle with Doom and his men starts well, but degenerates into a terrible debris as the Torch races a laser beam (cool animation but in a cartoon). Fans can have a laugh at the bad FF FX and relentless story, if they don't get depressed and get angry.
