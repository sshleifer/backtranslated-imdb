This is another of Hollywood's anti-communist polemics of the Golden 1950s. Stalwart American Gen. Barry, beautiful English woman Valerie French, and three others are kidnapped by a stranger and get clamshells that contain fantastic - and fantastically vague - power. What will the Earthlings do with such power? Throw it in the sea or use it to wipe out all mankind? Anyone who knows the American cinema in 1957 knows the answer to what the commissions will do, but the story is ripe when Americans actually test the things in the middle of the Pacific. Then one scientist, alone with the ultimate power in the universe, comes up with his own theory and uses it! His smart attitude is, and the disgusting attitude of everyone else is frightening. <br /> <br /> Here's the spoiler for this dog: the capsules in the clamshells have a mathematical code that tells the professor that they just kill "confirmed enemies of freedom"! It's right - don't worry about the ethical wars to kill anyone who decides a stranger, is an enemy of freedom; just do it! Hurray! No comics! Silly female - and you threw yourself into the sea! Ha ha! Kiss me, baby!
