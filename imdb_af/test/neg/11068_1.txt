I am an avid movie guard and enjoy a wide variety of movies. However, I did not find any pleasure in this movie. It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I didn't feel that it had much of a storyline, the characters were not nice and the relationship between the characters was at its best dysfunctional and the end made me more of the movie. This is definitely not in the same category as "The Cave", which in my opinion is the best cave film ever made. Even "The Descent" was better than this movie. <br /> <br /> It was a waste of $ 3.79 and my time to see it. Do yourself a favor and remove this one.
