An American researcher Owen (Vincent Gallo) travels to Moscow and gathers a rescue team to search his friend Sergei (Rade Serbedzia), an archaeologist in the catacombs of Russia's capital. They will be shocked to discover underground residents who thrive and thrive in the dark and complex system of caves and tunnels. The searchers will come across the gatekeeper of hell, Andrey (Val Kilmer), and will enter into an agreement to continue their business; Just to succeed in being scared is almost whitish when they realize they're dead.
