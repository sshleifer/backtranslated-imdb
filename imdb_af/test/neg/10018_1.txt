The best thing about "The Prey" is the tagline ... "It's not human and it has an ax"! The movie itself is a stuffed stinkaroo .... endless insects and game shots make the viewer want to die! No slasher fan will keep this garbage. Look again "Friday the 13th" and burn any copy of this movie you find! <br /> <br /> It's also one of the 25 worst movies ever made!
