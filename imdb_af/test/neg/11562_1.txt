Mystery Science Theater 3000 could not deliver a redeeming quality to display a "gem". <br /> <br /> This one is like a cheesy 80's pirate copy that you could buy on VHS from a 42nd arcade. before buying Disney all the time and closing them all. <br /> <br /> But wait - all the sex scenes are cut. I challenge someone to find a worse movie. This film can replace water entry as a human interrogation method. <br /> <br /> No, I take it back - I prefer water entry. <br /> <br /> The only credit this movie can earn, apart from the worst movie ever made, would be to threaten the Middle East to solve its problems under the pain of watching this movie .
