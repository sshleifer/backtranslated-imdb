What the hell was the point of this dull movie? It looks very interesting at first, but quickly gets flat on his face. It is supposed to be based on a true story, but to cry out loud, are no more writers left in Hollywood? man I saw these guys in some of the best movies ever made. Defoe can just play anything and if I see him in a movie, I don't have a problem renting it, but I'm starting to wonder. Redford also slides a great actor too; Perhaps they are difficult or lose their senses. The dialogue was long and terribly heavy, especially at home with the family. I wonder if the actors thought they had a hit here? maybe ... you are an Oscar?
