This is Wes Craven at his worst! this is the worst horror, if you call it horror, you'll ever look, especially from one of the masters of horror Wes Craven, Poor Board, Poor Working, Poor Set, Poor Atmosphere, make it the biggest hope of waste! The bad man is totally unconvincing, you can't even feel sorry for the guy! The gore and the horror involved in the movie is laughing, it's just plain junk! The only good points I can think of are: The stars Natasha Gregson Wagner, Giovanni Ribisi and Lance Henriksen, but not even the role, can stop it from getting out of control and into one of the worst horrors ever. If you don't see it yet, don't worry, you'll just hate it.
