While it was many decades since I last read, Mr. Wells "War of the Worlds" or "The Time Machine" or any of his works, I believe they were all in London, or at least in England. This grade "B" ("C"?) Movie is in the eastern part of the United States, as Orson Welles's excellent radio adaptation 67 years ago. However, this movie does not display the narrative style of the Mercury Playhouse program. Thomas Howell's emotion won't be acceptable in most high school drama clubs. I was really embarrassed at him. She rolls around in the grass on the hill crying: "My family, my family" was almost laughing, just as his reaction to the death of his brother. Of the three movie versions of the story I saw, it was by far the worst, with Gene Barry's 1950s version the best. In addition, it was the first time I ever saw a "machine sample" dripping sticky saliva, as the creation did in the "Alien".
