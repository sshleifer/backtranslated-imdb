As other reviews have said, some of the innumerable number of Alien clones are being thrown in with the great Terminator wodge this time. Add a bit of the classic SF Story "Who Goes There?", And a bad stupid plot device lifted from The Andromeda tribe (seemingly shimmering red lights make disaster killers not afraid of people who are three inches away from them. don't see). <br /> <br /> OK, the story: after a series of people moving around in a spaceship and killing each other, we get a caption. <br /> <br /> "25 years later". <br /> <br /> The crew of a relay station that bypassed Mars in 48 hours is relieved in 48 hours. Discover a huge spaceship on a collision course. It's the Siberia, the ship we saw in the opening sequence. It's not a good time to do everything on the relay station that is useful to do repairs. The approaching ship does not deviate from his career and does not send a "NO CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE CREATION! Warning. After many screaming at each other, the crew of the relay station are gathering something and getting the station out of the way just in the neck of But the ship changes course and rams them in any way - to set one of the crew to a solid pointed crewmaker.The satellite is starting to "lose integrity." Bits pressurize under pressure. over where only two crew members are sucked backwards. (Why are they always sucked backwards?). <br /> <br /> After a few keystrokes, the wheelchair is bound techy (called "Wheeler" - the only noticeable joke The whole movie). This leads to the fact that the Siberia drains them from all their power and they have to go aboard and switch off their engines. They all go aboard and take off their helmets. " of course! "means, of course, aboard the ship to come and expose yourself to fatal infectious diseases. One team chief for the Main Computer room where they find a dead frozen guy who looks like an American Express card, but seems to be a mini-disc. The other team finds some switches. Surprisingly, it appears that the dead blue is the father of the attractive female crew member who probably survived a devastating stranger encounter. They turn off the engines, but that means the ship's reactor will explode. A Greek Point of View Shot is killing people. There are a few guffies about the Siberia that have discovered a new ore, a millions worth of fuel force, which means that the more friendly members of the crew immediately threatened to get hold of it. The POV shot back with who! whoosh! Run sounds on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, it gives you the idea that the killer wears corduroy trousers and the effect is wasted. Then it is just to walk around and kill in order of ugliness and acting ability, until only the obvious survivors survive. - with the cute dog who managed to lead at least two crew members to their death. Just why space-borne veterans in the jaw of some deaths are wandering for their pets. Cats and dogs have long been a mystery to this kind of movie. Other stupid highlights include forgetting everyone to act on the falling levels of oxygen until it is reminded by the voice of the on-board computer (not that the low levels of oxygen dampen any of the impressive fires that these cargo idiots start). If the Killer Droid ID is so clever, it can send the ship into a stiff curve and go again to rattle the relay station. Why not turn it off! Don't sign up under any circumstances! warning signal. I'm sure if it was looking for more people to kill, then shout GO! was not a good way to go about it. <br /> <br /> Musetta Vander is the only person to do any acting. Everyone blows their nostrils all the time as they burst their teeth and scream and show each other. This is the kind of script; full of exclamation marks - the only thing that showed me to the end was the hope that the writing required her to take off all her clothes or get wet while not wearing much. Unfortunately, it didn't. One of the things that is wrong with this movie (except that it has more cyan on the screen than any other movie ever) is that there was no free nudity.
