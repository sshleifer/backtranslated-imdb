When Pam Grier made COFFY in 1973, it was an exciting but erroneous film. The plot was eager and satisfying - even though the acting was often amateurish. It was so successful that American International Pictures decided to reshape the formula next year with FOXY BROWN - not a bad movie, but definitely like "COFFY II". Now, just a year later, the studio apparently gave up on anything new to Mrs. Grier to create. As SHEBA, BABY was the same plot of COFFY and FOXY BROWN. Because the idea has been recovered and because the acting and acting are so tired and low energy, it really scrapes the bottom of the Blaxploitation barrel. <br /> <br /> Just like these other movies, SHEBA, BABY begins with some local black people pushing and eventually killing someone loves Pam Grier. In the past, it was drug dealers and pimps, and it was now an attempt to run all the loan companies and pawn shops out of town so they could disturb the market. And, like the other movies, Pam is a one-woman hit group - justice and a good bat that picks up. And like the other movies, there is a "cat fight" between Pam and a White woman right in front of "Mr. Big". And, like the other movies, Mr. Big a white man pulling all the strings. And like the other movies she is caught by Mr Big. And, like the other films, he doesn't kill her right away, but gives her ample opportunity to escape (here is a knife to lie around). And like the other movies, she finally gets free and saves her jief - @ $$. <br /> <br /> While this formula was interesting in 1973, it was honestly a predictable drill. Even if you didn't see the other movies, it was still bad because the action was so slow - the punching and kicking was so slow and upset. The same can be said for the games. In one scene, four guys attacked with machine guns, an AR-15 and shotguns. Pam responds by opening the fire with a .357 revolver and murdering 3 of the 4 and giving the others! Even though she was a good shot, she was pretty slow and the guys just wanted to wait until she killed them !!! Plus, even a world champion or Rambo could not have succeeded with such a one-sided chance. After all, these guys had very impressive weapons and they already showed her when she poured out her pistol and sent it out easily. hit these professional men !! <br /> <br /> In addition to slow and crippled action scenes compared to any other Blaxpoitation movie, the film has many logical gaps suggesting the writing was terrible, but the studio just didn't mind. In one case, her boyfriend, Williams, knew about the hunt and Nu-Tronic at the end of the film, but Pam never told him - how did he know about it? In another, the police approached a boat full of hoods and the hood immediately fired. The police, however, have no evidence that something has happened and the crooks started fire with little provocation. And the crooks had 30 caliber guns and other incredibly powerful weapons, but in many cases they were killed by police who were snub-nosed .38s! <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that it is a good example of "being / done .... a whole lot better". I love Blaxploitation movies, but this one is just too dopey and slow to watch merit, except by many dedicated fans of the genre.
