They must be. I will list them so that they can check their one-on-one: <br /> <br /> - Police regularly leave tens of millions of dollars of cash and drugs just lying around, because they don't have evidence facilities. <br /> <br /> - If you are shot, you always hide the same and fly the same back, although there is never a mark on your body. <br /> <br /> - Police are unable to identify the sound of gunshots and do not think anything is suspicious as a sheltered policeman's phone call during a high-level gun-and-money deal by gunshot cut. <br /> <br /> - Bad men can hit mannequins with one shot, but can't hit a huge, bulky martial artist with 100. <br /> <br /> - If you start a car in a parking lot on the missile, the next three cars in a line will inflate equally between 15 seconds. <br /> <br /> - Next to the last point, all the cheap cars are parked side by side. <br /> <br /> - The smoke caused by the fire of the rocket launcher is much greater than the amount of smoke caused by four cars that inflate. <br /> <br /> - Long, ahead virtual reality games that any other gambling company can produce on five disks. <br /> <br /> - Virtual reality games that are a long, long way ahead of anything that any other gambling company can produce, have graphics that look like Windows 3.1 screensavers. <br /> <br /> - Floppy disks can even be read. After they were fired. <br /> <br /> - Semi-drunk guys in bars, watch the news carefully at the pub, and have a deep understanding of American modern military history, Agent Orange, and the family trees of high-ranking military officials. However, they can only articulate their points through a stupid dialogue, from someone over the age of seven. <br /> <br /> - Although battles are almost hourly in a bar, the bar has only one staff member, who both throws beer and handles security. Of course he knows martial arts. <br /> <br /> - Gold medals Olympians regularly make the simple transition to corporate company heads in a matter of years. <br /> <br /> - A woman who works for a computer games company knows everything about playing a game she never played, constantly races over her rival's great games and can do the facts and figures from her company's competitors are shrinking - but she didn't know that they had taken over almost all the other companies. in the field in large corporate mergers. <br /> <br /> - Bad people always die in slow motion. Always. Women tell their husbands they are pregnant by dreaming about their husband's bravery to kill bad guys. <br /> <br /> - Women do large amounts of their husband's police work; It can explain why she moan and complain every time he needs to work. Although it doesn't explain why she worshiped him so much every time he got up in the morning, she could read about his murderous escapades. <br /> <br /> - It's quite typical that a police officer is involved in kidnapping, killing thousands of people on three different occasions, and stopping a variety of illegal acts involving more than one million dollars a week. <br /> <br /> - If you try to lose a car that follows you, it is wise to continue driving the speed limit And if you follow a policeman, subtlety is not important - you can back him sit back and park right next to him. He won't notice. <br /> <br /> - All police are experienced martial artists. <br /> <br /> - It is possible to kick a man four meters away. <br /> <br /> - People shout or shake in pain when they are kicked or kicked, but if their arm breaks, they do not make a noise. <br /> <br /> - Bad guys clean their blood-related axes with their handkerchiefs, and then for many days in their pocket. <br /> <br /> - Pieces of wood, when swung with a sharp blow, crush solid heels in six or more places at once. <br /> <br /> - The photo and special features on the back of the DVD cover may not necessarily be on the DVD. The advertised interactive menus? Why not a menu! The advertised scene index? Why not use the whole thing as one scene / chapter and not an index! Similarly, it is good to use the font and title of the matrix in the tagline, and not in any way a rip-off. <br /> <br /> With all of this I am shocked that 12 out of the 15 credited actors never acted again.
