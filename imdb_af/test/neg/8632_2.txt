If I had to choose the most depressing movie, try to be tense. I saw it would be this one. I know how good the original is supposed to be, it was better than this one. The film is so dark and depressed, but it is also not interesting to watch. I saw depressive thriller movies saved because of the tension to counterbalance and balance the dark quality. Vanishing didn't. It was so disturbing to look to start and there was nothing positive to make it a classic type of movie. I think another IMDb poster had the right to say that this genre is just excited to do in a much better way. I totally agree. I would recommend exceeding this one. Maybe I'll see the original one day, but I doubt it. I give it a 2 out of 10.
