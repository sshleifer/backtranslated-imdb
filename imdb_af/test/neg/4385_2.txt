I love movies in this genre. Beautiful girls, toilet humor, free neck. So why didn't I keep this movie? No movie like this should add even the slightest confusion to the plot. Who's who, where's the money, it's not SE7EN, just let me laugh. Maybe it's me, but I never looked frustrated at watching American Pie movies or any other more modern National Lampoon movies. This movie has no flow that makes me smile and waits for what's next. Instead, I find myself thinking, "Why did they keep that scene?" I don't recommend this movie. If you expect from Wilder, think again. The only pleasure I watched on this movie was to guess which movies were the actors when they were kids. 2/10 generous.
