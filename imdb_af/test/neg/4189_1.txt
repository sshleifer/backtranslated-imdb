It's by far the worst ever horror movie, no, make that movie I've ever watched. Shame on Block Buster to even wear this kind of crap. I never ask for a refund on any movie, but I think it will be the first. <br /> <br /> The movie is so bad I had to stop just after 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> I had more fun watching any of the fuzzy YouTube movies than watching this piece. <br /> <br /> The marketing companion for this movie should have a kind of silver screen to move this thing into a business as a blockbuster.
