It was a Hindi movie. Hindi = horrible. reasons: cheap dialogs, cheap special effects, cheap directing + stretching 2 hours maximum movie in 3 hours. <br /> <br />% ^^^^^^ spoiler ... bit %%%%%%%%% <br /> <br /> Specific to this movie: 1. Dialogues are not funny. They are cheesy and cheap. Although akshay tried his best acting for which I admired him, comedy wasn't funny at all! I just laughed 3 times during this movie. 2. The first half of the film was useless for the story of the 2nd half. The 2nd half was the real story / movie. The first half was time passed / built up. 3. The characters are not well developed at all. paresh rawal is smart in the first half, an idiot in the 2nd half / rest of the movie. we do not really develop any feelings or caring for akshay and govinda. their characters are no longer stupid. they don't seem to struggle with their problems. Jokes are funny, but they're not funny in a very serious scene. The gang's characters and drug traffickers are cheesy and have been used in the past 20 movies. there is nothing new about those characters. Again, it is proven that they are stupid to be funny. however, stupid = funny when stupid is the norm throughout the movie. the only character that made sense was that of lara dutta with a real story. 4. Special effects were crap. At the end, the pallet falls off the load of a truck. You see that they are not really on the ladder in the air. Secondly, ppl begins to fly off when the ladder begins to move. ppl cannot fly a ladder when it moves ... they fall directly to the ground due to something called gravity. 5. The whole movie was baptized. All the dialogues were taken to the movie. The actors' lips barely synchronized with the dialogues. <br /> <br /> There are probably many other reasons why this movie is crazy, but I can't remember them. Watch this masterpiece of crappy Indian movies by non-intelligent, even stupid, directing yourself and you'll agree with my review. ppl who likes Hindi movies, please increase your expectations for good quality in Hindi movies. <br /> <br /> Let me say that not all Hindi movies are bad. I like some. I didn't like this one. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10 (1.5 for the attempt by akshay and lara)
