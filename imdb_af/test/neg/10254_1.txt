Incidentally, when humankind was ashamed, the cavemen sat around and made lame jokes, hit each other over the heads they could ever grab and women were never seen and apparently had one tails. These cavemen live in a geographically diverse region with a cockatoo, a camel, a monkey - but no women. This film tells of the "hilarious" misadventures of seven (or so) cavemen - after burning their land with the new discovery of fire - moving through water to a new land where they find this woman with the extra attachment. Along the way we get such "big" moments of comedy like a fat caveman swallowing a frog that stays in his stomach in the stomach. A monkey throws rocks on their heads. A man swallows a mouse to get the frog in his stomach. The compulsory gay caveman. The list can go on. This movie is the very definition of cinematic drink. I was bored from the beginning and it just got worse when the cavemen beat each other, make bad jokes like words on the word bank, beat each other, and beat poor Seta Berger who seems to lose a commitment to a producer has. to appear in this nonsense. She is indeed one of two bright spots in this film. She's not a lot of actress, so you have to guess why she's an ass? The other "bright" place is the music. Once I heard the score, I told myself it was very familiar. I have never heard the actual score, but the music was undeniably that of Ennio Morricone. It's a good score and the best thing in an otherwise rough, boring, ominous, imaginative and ridiculous movie, mainly about a group of Moes who first find a woman and first wants to eat like an animal. what she could do. Awwwwh! Sorry, I'm making a yawn while reliving the plot! The end of the movie has about 100 or so mostly naked women on the screen with all the erotic feeling of pulling a villain off your knee. This movie was painful to go through and offers nothing of any real merit whatsoever. The fact that it has gained a successor does not surprise me, because it offers one thing that highlights the viewer's interest in the viewer.
