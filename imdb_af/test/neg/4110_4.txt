(Review) In the year 2055, the wealthy could travel back in time and watch a lively dinosaur for a great price. Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack) has developed a machine that can take people back in time. Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley) took this technology and opened a business known as Time Safari. Anyone with the money can travel millions of years back and shoot a dinosaur. Dr Travis Ryer (Edward Burns) leads his team with the big game hunter on a floating walk to a place where they can kill the dinosaur. The travel protocol is that they should stay on the tread and not disturb the land or any other creature around them. Unfortunately, one hunter stops for humanity and shoots a butterfly. This insignificant act causes a great impact on the Earth's climate and creates new species of animal life. The course of evolution as we know it is now changing through time waves. Travis and Sonia are trying to stop the changing process before it becomes permanent, and humans become extinct. <br /> <br /> (Comment) The movie was a bit slow and the concept to go back in time and change things was a little exaggerated. The death of a single butterfly that causes the tremendous changes in the atmosphere and evolution of the world is simply ridiculous. They changed the Chicago skyline to look modern, but the new cars of the future were stupid. You can wait to see this fantasy on DVD. (Warner Brothers Pictures, Duration 1:43, Rated PG-13) (4/10)
