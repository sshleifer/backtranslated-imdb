No doubt about it, Rampling is beautiful - a classic beauty, here very young. Its management is sophisticated and attractive at the same time. Her two male foils also work well. But in 2003 the movie is all. <br /> <br /> American-try-to-artsy-and-non-Hollywood-while-shoot-beautiful-shoot-of-the-French-Riviera-and-three-pretty-young people-in-their-cute-old-r. I enjoyed the view (both actors and nature), but the movie is boring and pretentious while trying to be the opposite.
