I can confidently say this is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I usually like foreign films. The movie is nothing short of weak pornography. If you choose to see it, prepare yourself for endless sexism, free nudity shots, and a stupid sensational rape scene, which I am sure is the main appeal for those who love the movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the plot plots purposefully, and none of the characters are nice. Many scenes are filmed from the bushes around the river, after which the girls continue to give a constant feeling that someone is stealing them, which was a pathetic attempt to compensate for the lack of story telling. Maybe I wouldn't have wasted my time watching the movie if it was accurately described in the reviews.
