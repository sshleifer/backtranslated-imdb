This show should be titled "If Bad Writing Happens To Good Actors", most players regard the great talent in other places, eg. Andr√© Braugher in the murder: Life on the street and David Morse in St. Elsewhere. I hope the surprising pacing of the show is adjusted as the series develops with the obvious cliches and dialogue so absurd, I just wondered how silly the authors suggested. We are struck with the headlines of this show, rather than inventing it gradually, almost as if the authors feel that they should say that the main character is a kind of repentant angel who has been condemned to deliver himself from sin, both friendly and mortal, through a bump in his taxi, many things go. Looking at the premiere, very incredible suspension demanded that Mike Olshansky's rates be wasted as soon as they were worried and he would feel driven to enter the lives of strangers. That he has the "Super Cop" capabilities, to be everything for all people, weapons expert, martial arts master, psychologist, pajamas, locksmith, et cetera, ad infinitum. Pure drivelesque fantasy. What about the recent televisions based in Philidelphia that they all seem to be looking for with a nasty ex-wife and a very careless kid? Exaggerated. I wanted to do this show very much, because it had the virtues of having a performance slightly different from many of the clones that come in this season's prize and some of my favorite actors. But I'm afraid it's just another possible good idea to be destroyed by careless execution.
