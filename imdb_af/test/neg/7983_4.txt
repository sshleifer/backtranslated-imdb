There is not much about "Reckless" that feels right, starting with the daunting title (thanks to scriptwriter Craig Lucas, who has adapted his own play, brought the title with him) and continued with the decisive (Mia Farrow playwoman Tony Goldwyn, who is young enough to be her son). The couple live in an idyllic winter world that looks inside a snowball, but Farrow gets a spectacular dose of reality after admitting he hired a man to kill her. She flees at night, retreating with a very strange couple who wants to help her rebuild her life. The production design and art direction of "Reckless" is good, but it is services rendered for a perfect, often alienated script. It is supposed to be a dark holiday comedy, though the cast is lost with occasional offensive material. * 1/2 of ****
