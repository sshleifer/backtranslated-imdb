Well, <br /> <br /> First, as many reviewers pointed out, it's a deterrent to the Martin Cahill story - first represented by the BBC and by the John Boorman movie "The General" - which is a great movie and far, much better than this one. <br /> <br /> If the native British person speaks, Kevin Spacey's supportive role was really good in terms of British and Irish acting talent, especially Peter Mullan - but it was totally messed up. The characters were c ** p! And as for Kevin Spacey - did not come as a sweet villain, but as nothing really significant or significant. <br /> <br /> Not much to loose this movie. The best bits are the gags and tricks of the other movies that detach it. Compare notes on this movie and "The General" - I would be interested to see what others think. <br /> <br />
