I heard a lot of things about Beowulf, maybe because I'm from Romania and a good part of the movie was filmed here in my country. And I expected a lot from this movie. In the end I was disappointed. It's not as terrible as other users have said, but it's definitely bad. It's about a monster that kills people in a 6th century castle and Lambert, the one who kills him. Lambert is good, because he is sucking in all his roles, but the rest of the characters, and the action is not too good. Plus, maybe the only thing that saved this movie, the special effects, also very bad, the monster looks terrible (not terrible, but terrible). Oh, and another bad thing: the music. The film is trying and managing the atmosphere of the 6th century. But all the action sequences are presented on rock music, which is very bad. I mean the action on rock works perfectly on a movie like Charlie's Angels - where it's the perfect way to shoot your action. But here it was a very bad idea. <br /> <br /> Vote: 4 out of 10.
