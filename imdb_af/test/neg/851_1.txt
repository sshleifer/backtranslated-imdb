The Italians are unmistakably masters of dubious "art" to snatch and imitate movies. What they do is take on an innovative, money-making and foreign concept, maintain the basic plot and add a whole host of actions, sleaze and political inaccuracy. But what to do when the non-Italian original is already a well-known notorious movie and quite difficult to overcome in terms of demolition and controversy? Well, you think, you ignore everything in terms of story building or stylishness and focus fully on making something that is virtually a porn movie! This Italian turkey is inspired by Richard Fleischer's successful slavery saga "Mandingo", released one year earlier, but since the makers were even too lazy to devise another title, you shouldn't expect anything even on a narrative depth does not seem, character traits, disturbing atmosphere or mind-like statements about cross cultural relationships. "MandingA" is pure and purely a sex-fluttering effort where the plot first develops for the last ten minutes, in other words when you have not cared for a long time. The characters in this movie are a gathering of despicable bastards, which of course can be expected if you are dealing with rich and unpleasant white people who operate a plantation in South America. The elderly and extremely sloppy owner of the place is a widower (who also probably won some awards from the "Mustache of the Year") swinging the slaves who work for him. His mistress, who, if I understood correctly, is also his cousin, is a real bitch of a woman who enjoys exaggerated arguments and sneaks out of the house overnight to copy with crucified slaves. When the plantation owner's son returns from Europe, after about 25 minutes of pure wasted time, the plot begins to develop. The handsome young man has sex with the bitchy woman several times (even before the slaves, who supposedly "need to demonstrate" how their masters do it?) But eventually he falls in love with the cherubic preacher's daughter. Of course, his romantic appearance angered the stingy woman, and she denied a terrible vicious revenge that would change life forever on the plantation. Hey? I just realized this brief description of the plot actually made "Mandinga" like an interesting movie! Well, that's not and I apologize if I have raised anyone's expectations. It's an incredibly boring and ominous movie to hit, but if the themes appeal to you, definitely check out the "Mandingo" mentioned. Much rather than ill-exploited, the film is a truly informative portrait of one of the darkest history pages of man and it was also a well-crafted film, featuring real actors, good music and impressive filming. "Mandinga" has nothing, absolutely nothing to offer.
