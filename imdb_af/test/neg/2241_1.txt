Many Historical and Cultural Mistakes 0/10 <br /> (1) A Jewish man named OMAR !!! Hahahaha (2) Brilliant detective took out the least intelligent man in the movie! (3) Jewish suicide bombings !! It was funny. (4) Hitler and his top guns watched a movie in the center of Paris !!! With two guards at the door. !! shoot me. (5) Brad Pitt persuaded and it was painful to see him. (6) Mr. QT was written about writings, "Hitler was killed in a theater!" The funny thing about this is that people "and I mean stupid people" will actually believe this plot. <br /> <br /> And finally, someone can tell me how this movie made it to the top 250 movies of all time !!! Shame shameful, wondering how can anyone like this movie.
