I recently flung 8? to go and see this movie in the theater. It was a waste of time and the only feeling that you're going out of the theater is a little nausea of ​​all the disgusting social pornography. <br /> <br /> It might have been interesting if it had a pretty absurd twist, but it wasn't so, it was just awful with maybe one or two scenes that could be pulled out and made to very nice short movies. <br /> <br /> Another thing I thought about is the way the director uses all the Finish stereotypes as characters. It's quite extraordinary how you, as a Finish director, can make a movie with the worst stereotypes of your own nationality. It was sad to sit and hear the audience sitting and laughing at what they thought was typically finishing, but in general just making people fun.
