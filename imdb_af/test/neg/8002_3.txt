Mockney comes to Brighton; In spite of a poor reception in the British press and state-funded British film written on it, I had hoped that we would get some of the grim, stubborn London-by-sea from Graham Greene. /> <br /> It doesn't even strive after that. Characters straight from their clone a crimp trailer reproduces Guy Ritchie's types. The format looks more like a British TV series than a movie (Brighton is a background gold mine, wasted with plastic studio work). <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in pursuit of a good performance by Famke Janssen ... She's a little fun for this company, her brand of big screen unmistakable which should be more than Deep Rising. As far as this is concerned (even a role!) Continue the search. Circus is boring. 10/03
