The Cavern: 2 out of 10: Blair Witch meets the cave and gives me a headache. <br /> <br /> I have something to ask all film schools, please teach future directors how to hold a camera. <br /> <br /> Also the movie, like Betty, with 12 drinks, is headache. <br /> <br /> Film is also primarily a visual medium, directors can indicate their camera's general direction. Film also requires light to work. Maybe a light source should be used so you can see the action on the screen. I know it's a cave movie, but it's absolutely nothing scary to see the pitch for minutes at a time. <br /> <br /> For the case that the movie is upside down, does not indicate confusion on the screen, it indicates confusion in the editing box. <br /> <br /> A last note to the director. I'm sure there was a good reason to have a terrible fake CGI campfire. I honestly can't think of one's life for one. <br /> <br /> Now to the author. Try to make at least one character likeable. I prefer two or more, but one decent person I can root or care may help. Even if you have flashbacks, make it relevant to the story. <br /> <br /> If you're going to end a surprise, it's probably best if it doesn't contradict every single thing that comes before it. And try to add some fancy gameplay terms to a cave movie. You may have started with spanking. <br /> <br /> The Cavern is a very bad movie, poorly shot with a confusing, unlikely and anticlimatic end.
