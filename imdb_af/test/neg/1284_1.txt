I had to watch this movie with my 5 year old. He didn't even laugh at the whole movie ... and he loves dogs and will laugh almost anything! This movie was terrific of all aspects: poor writing (even accounting for a G-rated movie of children), poor production (the turbulent camera shots made me feel nauseous for the first ten minutes), poor acting (maybe they were directed on acting cartoonish, and even poor sound quality (there are parts where the sound level looks good, then you can't hear what the next actor is saying). I'd like to see a child's movie, but it was worse than having a stick in my eye. I also didn't like being over the head with the god-heaven-faith thing. In all this was the biggest waste of 90 minutes in my life ... and I did some serious waste of time in my day!
