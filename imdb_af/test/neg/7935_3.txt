OK, here's the deal. I love action movies and usually have no problem suspending a great deal of unbelief about plot holes or other undisputed actions. However, this film went beyond minor errors and went straight to the ridiculous. Let me get it straight. The police are sending a notorious gangster and policeman (along with a number of other prisoners) on a bus with a total of two guards. They are then forced to stop in an area where exactly two police work, one a day away from retirement and the other a burnout. Apparently, the building is about to be closed, so the police decided that everyone else in the area would spend the night for the new night. Right. But wait, it gets better. Gabriel Byrne points out to take Fishburne out before he can eliminate him and other dirty cops. (although we never find out about their relationship or relationship). Interestingly, the area police are in full SWAT gear with night vision goggles, attack guns, all nine meters. Later they even bring a helicopter with MORE people in full gear. I'm not a policeman, but I'm pretty sure you can't just roll out of the station with a whole pack of equipment, without anyone asking you what you do. And the police helicopter ??? In the so-called terrible winter storm ??? Also, no one near the area happens to hear or see this huge siege going on with flash grenades and heavy gun fire? I mean seriously, come on. I know it is in Detroit, but even there it will be suspected of a so-called top secret mission. I also love the fact that they get a Tommy pistol in the witness room and somehow the gun still works and they still have dots and uses. <br /> <br /> I could live with some of these problems if there were other fights. The first few minutes of the movie were shot in a very frenetic and hyperactive way and I thought the scene would be for the rest of the movie. Unfortunately I was wrong. The rest of the film has no sense of pacing or tension or drama. The "characters" do not relate in any way, which is probably mainly due to the fact that they are not particularly interesting. There is not enough interesting action to make it a good action movie, and there is not enough character development / storytelling to make it an entertaining thriller / drama. The "relationship" between Hawke / Fishburn is the only thing the director is trying to make interesting or intense. Oh, and by the way, the final scene in the desert? Uh, I thought it was in the middle of a run-down industrial part of Detroit and suddenly we're in the woods ?? The acting is not terrible in this movie, it's just that the directing and writing of horror is. I enjoy many of Hawkes, Fishburne, Byrne, Dennehy's other movies, but this one is terrible.
