I've never made one of these, but this movie was literally so bad that I had to say something about it. <br /> <br /> I'm all for independent movies like last year's The worst (in my opinion) of Hollywood's performances, the mainstream seems to have come up with what makes good movies. The fact that movies like this are called, really gives independent film a bad reputation. <br /> <br /> The characters are boring and too stupid to experience with empathy. The direction is terrible, the plot is terrible, the plot itself is terrible, stay away, far away. Only one short scene with a woman's naked chest, and even that wasn't a second look. <br /> <br /> The frightening thing about this movie is the idea of ​​ever watching it. I gave it a 2 and not a 1 given just because the actors were visible and the sound was audible - it earned one point for each of the features.
