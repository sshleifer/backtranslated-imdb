I'll be honest - the pimp-out press plane with Snoop Dogg at the helm is an entertaining visual gag. It would have been a decent commercial for 30 seconds, or maybe a 3 minute music video. But the producers committed the centuries-old concept comedy probe to stretch 30 seconds of material in an hour and a half, and the results are predictable. The rest of the 89 minutes is filled with the typical spectrum of racist and sexist humor and fiery jokes, offensive and worst of all - painfully unfriendly. The appropriate plot screams under the weight of its relationships. Best to avoid unless you are drunk or stoned.
