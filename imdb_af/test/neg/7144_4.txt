I finally hired this video after searching for many months. Initially I just wanted to see it, because I'm an out-of-the-box Neil Pearson fan (Patrick, Isobel's boyfriend). However, the movie is very good without Neil (although he handles himself very well in this movie, he is overshadowed by the three main female characters). It's a frightening, intense movie, the kind the Brits do so well - definitely a "chick flick" of the house and it's an isolated environment that gives the film an almost "Wuthering Heights" aura. The movie is full of tension and end, shocking, but somehow inevitable. I'm glad I watched it, it was worth the wait
