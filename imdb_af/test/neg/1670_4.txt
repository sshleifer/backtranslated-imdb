This movie looks a bit clunky around the sides, as not enough zaniness was thrown when it should have been. But I mostly enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> The storyline is more than a little ridiculous, so no expectation of something real should be included in your viewing experience. Enter your brain at the door. It will not be necessary and may otherwise be an obstacle. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed Clennon's performance as the real Dr Baird. His role was about giving Aykroyd's character a protagonist. What a putz the real dr. Baird was. <br /> <br /> And Matthau was pretty good as the main character's sidekick. Annoying at first, but finally loving. Sort of. Kind of. Or at least something would be more than useful for using soap and plenty of water. <br /> <br /> Really worth looking at? If you're in the mood for a spoof on the psychiatric profession, sure, why not.
