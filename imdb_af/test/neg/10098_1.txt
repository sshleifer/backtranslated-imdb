2001 was not perhaps Eric Roberts best year. Both Raptor and it came out. Looked at Raptor a while ago and really thought it sucked and was Eric's worst. But it had its part moment of fun and D standard. This one has nothing. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Thomas is the name of the most likely actor in these days. The story has no punch and the whole thing feels even slower than a snail breaking in curves. <br /> <br /> The two things that stand out are Martin Kove and Eric Roberts. You can argue that their efforts are good or what, but compared to the rest, they are above all criticism. <br /> <br /> Thank you Roberts will see you next time (and hopefully better).
