This movie may if not for all the language in it. I think the storyline itself is not bad, but I would be too shy to show my wife or children. I know children will learn all the swear words along the way, that's true, but parents shouldn't help them. Show them the stuff in the cover of entertainment. <br /> <br /> I got used to Robert Loggia; He has a clear quality with his coarse voice, but in the last few years all I have seen him is roles with a lot of language in them. If we had an F-word over-utilization award, he would have to be a contender. Unfortunately, I think he lost me now as a fan. If I see his name on movies in the future, I will think twice about picking up the title. <br /> <br /> Look, I'm not prudent. Sometimes I also use language in extreme circumstances, but if we watch a movie, it is because of E N T E R T A N N E T, something we hope will bring us a little joy and escape. I don't want to be reminded of what is happening in the streets of a big city these days, and it's hard to wonder if a movie is good for my family to watch. <br /> <br /> I also like Matt Modine, but it is a pity that he has committed himself to a picture that has dropped his image. He probably has an ego. working in the movie, but I switched off about one-fourth of the way after I had repeatedly beat my ears to others. Why can't these actors just say no if these scriptures ask them to continue with this gut language? As soon as there are enough actors (especially the big names), it makes a fuss about it, the authors will stop posting it in the movies! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can't recommend this picture. It's a pity, too, because I think it would be good if it were good enough to look after decent families! Thanks, I just wasted $ 2.00 on it!
