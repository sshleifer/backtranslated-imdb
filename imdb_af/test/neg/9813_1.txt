Anyone who knows something about evolution will not even have to watch the film saying "fake". "It's never rejected" is also a bad argument. To say the universe was created by a giant hippo cannot be rejected. Although, to be honest, the only people who believe are the same people who open email attachments from people they don't know or give their banking details to a man in Zambia. No bones of any primates were found in the United States or Canada. There is also a good reason why legitimate scientists don't bother. The same argument applies to the Loch Ness monster, ghosts and god.
