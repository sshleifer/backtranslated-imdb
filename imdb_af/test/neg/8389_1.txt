This movie was so bad it looked like a home movie. In one scene, the camera moves slowly and gradually and moves back into its place. The sound is cracked, and occasionally fades again. In another scene, the camera is only visible in a mirror. <br /> <br /> Then came the scene with instructions on how to put a tent down ... who believes me, has gone forever and was completely irrelevant to the plot. Most scenes dragged on with conversations that were not entirely relevant. In my opinion it was just to fill the movie and make it longer. Even with these scenes, it added that it was very short. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about it was the cut head that looked very realistic.
