A New Generation 'is the third Amityville entry to base its plot on author John G. Jones' premise on an item taken from the Long Island home that causes spectral misery and death for its new owners. First a lamp, then a watch, and now a mirror. However, it is also the first Amityville since 'The Possession' to join the real-life events that started the whole series. This time, Keyes Terry (Robert Partridge), an artist, will one day be a flawless mirror by a homeless man. Soon people will die around him, eventually leading to his discovery that the mirror was ever hanging in the Amityville house. At night, a man named Franklin Bronner (Sonny Montelli in 'Amityville II') killed his entire family. Unfortunately for Terry his discovery of the mirror is not entirely coincidental, and he soon learns the truth about his past a truth he has been buried since childhood. <br /> <br /> This 7th installment in the often exhausted franchise is a disappointment to me. Things got stuck with the stupid and uneven, but entertaining 'It's About Time', and gave how much this film is trying to draw on its roots - not the first episode, but the source material itself - it had to be better if it . <br /> <br /> But three times the same thing with another Amityville House's evil artefact, with another explanation for the malignant paranormal visits, carries the least of me. One of the biggest weaknesses of the Amityville franchise is the set determination by each set of producers to completely ignore every other episode in the series. On the one hand, it is perfectly reasonable that they do not want to be linked to each other's continuity, but at least they may recognize story lines that have already been done and possibly * do not repeat it over and over *. <br /> <br /> There is also something that unleashes the way the story unfolds, undoubtedly because of the inevitability that this repetition brings. As you already know what is going to happen, the careful build-up is simple but slow and boring. Or maybe it's just a little bit dull. Director John Murlowski could probably have done more to increase the tense atmosphere associated with the mirror, rather than just flipping it red and splashing out 'evil' voices, lacking any kind of subtlety. There were times when characters were fairly untouched by its extraterrestrial characteristics. If they don't take it too seriously, why should we? <br /> <br /> What a shame, because a new generation has a more than capable role. I stood to look at it until I saw the name 'Julia Nickson' in the credits. She enchanted my attention just as she always did, and if it was something, I was irritated that her part was no longer expanded. Terry O'Quinn was equally charismatic and underused. Partridge starring himself at the early nineties overcrowded lumberjack-hearted square heart, and while I'm not sure he'd really given it the gravitas, it's not like someone is doing Ibsen here. /> <br /> The sets are also remarkable, from the dramatic artwork that Suki's room fills to the claustrophobic corridors that appear in flashback / supernatural sequences. To get the look of this right is especially important, as certain sequences are repeated by the movie into simulated fragmented memories. Obviously, Murlowski is more of a visual director rather than an actor's director or one of the horrors. Unfortunately, it's supposed to be a horror movie. <br /> <br /> A new generation sees the same race that is being presented for the third time in 4 years. Add to that the lack of direction where it really was needed and the whole effort failed to stand so long. However, it must be acknowledged for its strong ties with the source material and some good actors in not necessarily their best hours. Honestly, the ideal person for this is someone who has not seen any of the following 'The Possession', for whom the story is not such a massive deja-vu journey.
