When I saw this movie three years ago, I thought it featured many of the features that appeared in Singapore's art house movies: moving slowly, with minimal plot and dialogue, depending on the movie composition to make it work . <Br /> <br /> In the course of time, local cinemas are unable to appreciate "Be With Me", meaning that "Citizen Kane" or any of Ozu's later films will be burned. I have no idea how "With me" such sacred highlights in Singapore's film awareness have been achieved, but I always felt that Khoo's "12 floors" is a better movie, although the latter movie is not as good a movie as Adrian Tan do not boast. , Khoo's DP for "Be With Me". "12 floors" has a story that is more closely related to most Singapore people and also bites, which is a shaky misconduct of mine. <br /> <br /> "Be With Me" is basically a scarcely related trio of narratives joined together in Khoo and his screenwriter Wong Kim Hoh. It's about a security guard falling in love with a girl he only sees in the distance; two girls in a hororotic relationship; and the story of deaf-blind Teresa Chan. <br /> <br /> "Tan With Me" is filmed very well by Tan, with a Varicam camera. The film compositions are masterful. The movie, almost completely silent, has no dialogue. Characters move around, not in a realistic way, but almost as if their models are under the direction of a director, they almost always look at the screen and feel: either loneliness or sadness. Unfortunately, the characters do not act together. This kind of movie has been seen before: in Tsai Ming-liang's films, in Khoo's protégé Royston Tan's "4:30" and elsewhere. Unfortunately, its ultra-slowness (essentially plot less) and the use of a lento keyboard soundtrack simply didn't appeal to me. <br /> <br /> To criticize, "Be With Me" almost seems to ignore the inspirational story behind Teresa Chan, who is blind and deaf, yet lives a fulfilling life despite all this. things, but I'm afraid this movie doesn't do anything for me. I am willing to appeal to Chan's steadfast and courageous march in life and Tan's striking cinematography, but try to tackle the same subject with more meat (without the two other boring and distracting subplots). Try Werner Herzog's "Land of Silence and Darkness" (1971).
