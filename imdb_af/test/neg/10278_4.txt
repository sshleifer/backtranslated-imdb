I watched this movie a few weeks ago and must say: I was not at all impressed. I'm doing the other posters about the fine performances, but some good performances don't make a good movie. <br /> <br /> On the board I found an overview by an anonymous poster that caught some of the highlights. It says, '' Deck Poll 'is a movie that comes up with many questions, but hardly any more answers, a disturbing movie and above all attempts to categorize: an experiment and a very conventional sexual drama despite of shocking scenes. from Barbara Kowa and André Schneider, the partially impressive editing and the good camera work (Steffen Ritter) provides for brutal plot holes and some technical slips (especially in sound). The boredom that the audiences have to deal with for 40 minutes. "Unfortunately it is true. I was not inspired by the story at all. The protagonists are cold, ambition-less people. They have lots of drugs and have a lot of (blood) sex. So what? For many times the direction was almost non-existent. does not exist and not the technical aspect: the poor sound quality was very disturbing. <br /> <br /> What is the point of the movie? What is the message behind it? The anonymous reviewer said: "Biermann somehow failed to make a clear point and so the movie stays in the middle of the air without a message. So the boredom I blame on the movie. The film is reserved and emotional, cold, almost neutral and it does not take long to see the mistakes: for long regions, the characters of Sean and Ivy are not credible (they clearly have problems with the English pronunciation), the character of the dumb brother was not very well developed. Some moments are very promising. although - in the scene where the call boy is (the only true love image) is reached an intensity that one wants to see the whole movie. As a spectator, the chances must be given away. "Again, I have to agree. I liked the final scene, especially because of the pretty faces of Gianni Meurer and André Schneider, but it was nothing compared to the boredom I had to suffer for the first thirty minutes. ( However, the sex scenes were staged and perfectly edited. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Deed Poll" was not my cup of tea - a good, controversial idea was wasted - but it was an interesting thing to do. see how a movie can be made with virtually no money, maybe if they had a bigger budget and a more experienced director, it would have become a better movie.
