If you haven't seen the first one, you should know at least someone you have and you need to know it's painful to go through. There was nothing good to say about it. So what's different with the second one? Why make a sequel to a miserable movie a successor? This one does not take too seriously. It knows it's made for television and doesn't try to impress with great or serious dialogue. There are moments where it tries to get 'serious' or 'intense', but these moments are so maize you have to laugh. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, there are any elements of Uwe Boll and any hint of being out of a video game (except the title of course). Don't go into this movie and expect nothing to call your friends unless they are in the camp, lame zombie movies, or interested in making a drinking match from this movie. Take two shots when Ed Quinn's character calls his dead brother! Take one shot when a bullet would be better in the head of a zombie instead of pumping three in the chest! etc. etc.
