I saw this one on DVD. It had a big picture of Sandra and said, "With Sandra ...." and she seemed to have had a big part in it. Not so. She is scarce in it. She does what she can with the writing, but it's not much. <br /> <br /> The noise was terrible. By that I mean things didn't go along. Shots will be fired and the number of shots did not match the sound. People talk in a car as it moves and the shot is from outside the windshield, but there is no car noise, road noise or any other noise. Kind of strange. <br /> <br /> Count was terrible. It sounded like the same few notes over and over. Dialogue very terrible. <br /> <br /> The action was terrible, I couldn't believe it. Vegtonele was like a Batman cartoon without the "BIFF" and "BAM". They were really lame. The shooting scenes, I mean by firearms, were literally literal. I sent this movie quickly. Even then, it was too long.
