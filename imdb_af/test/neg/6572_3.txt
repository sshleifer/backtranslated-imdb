The journey here is a search for God, the great guy in the air, the big cheese with a beard. Nice disguised as the thirst for ultimate knowledge. The transfer of Leonard Nimoy in the directing chair is The Shat himself, Captain Tiberius William Shatner Kirk. In an effort to blend the funny aspects of the series with sci-fi histrionics (Klingon dialogue consultant, really?), Shatner and his co-authors have only achieved what is almost an embarrassing parody of a parody. Where's the danger? where are the brothers in the spirit? In fact, where is our bad underwritten crew? Star Trek humor is a great thing when it's in the right places and is done with a straight edge that just goes to the final border. There are a few light moments, but they do not compensate for the lack of serious moments. While we really need another Spock revelation? really ?. <br /> <br /> A few nice sets and little knowing Trek aside, The Final Frontier is just a bad movie experience. 10/03
