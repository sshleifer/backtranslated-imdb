Oh no one of these attacks of the Japanese ghost girl flies ... I don't even remember how much I saw. Maybe it sells ... but not to me. not scary at all. the Japanese horror movies are very similar since the first one of these ... also the drawing of the child. I've seen so many times in so many horror movies. cellphone scene is also nothing new ... the dramatic character of the guy hit by a train sucked ... i mean it all remained dramatic ... OK it's for kids 14-16 who are after japanese rock listen and think they are so unique ... let me tell you. there are a million of you = D this is one of them. 3/10 I have seen worse but you will not miss anything by NOT seeing it!
