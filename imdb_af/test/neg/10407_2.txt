Louis Gossett Jr once again returns to the pit as Chappy Sinclair, who goes to Doug Masters. (Played by Jason Cadieux, who has agreed to Jason Gedrick who refused) to teach a new group of recruits, but this time they are discovering corrupt air force pilots dealing in toxic waste. It's a series that only gets worse with each subsequent entry, but one doesn't have the zip or even the action to even see it on the cable. Iron Eagle IV is so indifferent that dog fights come down as if we are watching a playstation 2 game played by two lobotomized teenagers. It is terrible to watch and Gossett Jr. who made his part of turkeys appear to have stayed outside. And I saw Cover-Up, Firewalker, Aces: Iron Eagle III, Toy Soldiers and Jaws 3D. What is mysterious about Louis Gossett Jr is that he, like Christopher Walken, seems to be striving to do anything as long as he works. As I win Oscar's post. Some of his better films include Iron Eagle, The Punisher and The Principal. As the latter two films face him along with Dolph Lundgren and James Belushi, it is indeed something to say that three guilty pleasure action flashes are underway for his better work. Of course, the Enemy Mine and Diggstown continue to be their best after-win wine. <br /> <br /> * From 4- (Bad)
