After missing countless times at TCM UK, I decided to find out with his sci-fi / adventure / camp tree. I knew I'd be a very crazy ride - but it was also amazingly bad! In any case, perhaps the appropriate characters for the characters in question, the script titles are also rounded off from recent vintage - SOYLENT GREEN (1973), ZARDOZ (1974), LOGAN'S RUN (1976; to the extent that on some of the self ! STAR WARS (1977), Alien (1979) and MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR (1981)! <br /> <br /> The plot is simple but does not touch exactly. From the title one can conclude that water has become scarce on the planet where it all takes place - so our taunt-mystery takes it upon themselves to steal ice blocks from the tyrannical Templar (!) Rulers. Also involved is a beautiful princess (Mary Crosby, daughter of Bing!) Looking for her father, the deposed king; Incidentally, the film includes another well-known progeny: Anjelica Huston (daughter of John) as one of the pirate bands. Fortunately, the actress's mistake in accepting such a role will soon be forgotten in the wake of her Oscar win (under her father's guidance, no less) for PRIZZI'S HONOR (1985). Since STAR WARS had Peter Cushing as the "Commander-in-Chief", the filmmakers decided to have a screen legend of their own - the 78-year-old John Carradine (who is trapped in a short desk in his one short scene!). <br /> <br /> The most noteworthy bits (for all the wrong reasons) are: the stranger using the toilet; the castration machine; the clumsy ancient (including karate fight!) of the inevitable robots; The goofy slave / eunuch makeup is worn at one point by the heroes; the repetitive attacks by "space herpes" (whatever); the climax in which the characters are made to age when going through a time warp (Crosby conceives, gives birth, and sees her son grow up in the space of 30 seconds while leading man Robert Urich himself is replaced by John Ford stalwart Hank Becoming for this scene!) - incidentally, the jumps adopted here (which indicate the rapid passage of time) are not only unsuccessful, but rather irritating.
