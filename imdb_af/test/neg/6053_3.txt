I didn't hear anything about this project until I saw it going, so I looked at it with a completely open mind. And, give, the throw is full of strong players. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately. . . it's terrible. I don't mean it's not good; I mean it is exceptionally bad - sometimes legally so, but mostly it's just boring. His strongest appeal comes from handsome people like naked as American networking TV will allow, but it's all pest and no substance, and with nymphs as backup characters, a couple of hours of bad TV can't justify. <br /> <br /> There are two basic problems that the cast cannot overcome. First, the writing is * terrible *. Yes, changes to the Hercules myth (which is definitely not a single monolithic story) are traditional, but this version is relentlessly dull and far too often stupid (and sometimes frighteningly), with terrible pacing, borrowed bits from here and there (and several parts apparently in different movies), and really terrible dialogue. The dialogue is often unbearably bad, in fact, to the point where you feel ashamed of the actors. Sean Astin, who is apparently now typed as a second banana, looks particularly like one other line. There is no consistency of tone or atmosphere and little cohesion to the plot. <br /> <br /> Second, most of the special effects are really bad. Really bad. There is occasionally a decent bit of CGI, but most of the time, you feel very shy about the cast. I have no idea how the budget for this project was, but it looks like a shit compared to the "Clash of the Titans" or even "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" and doesn't even compare favorably with old Lou Ferrigno and Italian. 'Spaghetti' Hercules movies. Not painfully miserable. <br /> <br /> There are many other problems. The story is unnecessarily complex and cannot sustain itself, and Hercules itself is not presented as a very interesting character. Almost everyone who does not have a European accent is trying to decay one or the other, which is not only amateur and dated, but never really made sense: drama doesn't get any better, just because the actors British accent use all. But the terrible writing and the equally terrible effects sink the whole thing right from the bat. <br /> <br /> In fairness, "Hercules" is believed to be a four-hour miniseries, but cut down (for this airing anyway) for a three-hour television movie. I don't know what they are cutting, but it is possible that the changes made things worse. I don't think you can make "Hercules" good by adding it, but that doesn't mean that the continuity hasn't suffered from network edits. I can't see the US version to see.
