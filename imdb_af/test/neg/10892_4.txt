As horror movies go, "Rest Stop" on many levels may have been better. Director / writer John Shiban shows he probably had the best intentions when he started it. Unfortunately, he was not sure what to do with the material, or he was under pressure to produce another film of what he was planning, either through the studio or the background. Several endings are included in the DVD, but unfortunately the one chosen for the final product is probably not the best. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a psycho boasting the back roads of a remote part of California offers many possibilities at first. After the disappearance of Jess in the ghostly resting place, things come out of hand. Poor Nicole is left alone to find all her strange things she finds on the road. <br /> <br /> It was clear when "Amazing Grace" got the background that there were forces trying to avenge the roads. in which Nicole and Jess profane the neck of the forest by taking part in careless sex that is not appreciated by the natives. <br /> <br /> Watch it at your own risk. There are many gigs for the aficionados of the genre.
