Free Willzyx (Stupidest name / title ever) is the worst episode of any of the TV shows I watch, including X-Files, Alias, All 3 Law and Orders, All CSIs, Family Guy, Simpsons, Chappelle's Show, Colbert Report, and more. South Park was my favorite of the comedy programs because it's shockingly obscene content and disturbing black comedy. Free Willzyk has NO of the content I mentioned earlier. It was so comfortable, so unofficial it might have been an episode of Sesame Street. Kyle goes to Sea World where some of the workers play a prank on him, thinking he is talking to a whale. He liberates the WALE, actually satisfies it. Hello? It's South Park! the same show you "Cancel", "Chickenlover", "It Hits The Fan", "Death Camp of Tolerance", and so much more! Not SpongeBob SquarePants! Ugh. I actually watched the whole episode, which is 30 minutes of my life, I'll never come back. Anyway, I was very frightened of this episode and I can't believe the shocking decline in the quality of Matt & Trey's work.
