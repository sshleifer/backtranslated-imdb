Milla stands out in this movie because of her personal sense of style and the way the clothes hang on her. I learned to hate that curly, three-year-old face she made when she pretended to cry. It makes any points she tries to make if a serious actress comes down quickly. Of course, in a movie with Baldwin and Denise, she still shines as an adult actor. David looked like Woody Allen was being done by Howdy Doody. Not a single word or gesture throughout the movie was sincere or even sincere. "How Harry With Sally" and "Two Weddings and Funeral", even "Sleepless In Seattle" had scripts, places and ACTORS. The script seemed to be a string of bad and rough gags, separated by a lot of talk. The places appear to be within a few blocks of each other. There are only two actors in this dishrag of an indie movie, Milla and the woman who played the chick in the stars. I watched most of the things with the sound for the first time, and just look at Milla. The subscription was old when I saw it and it's a foolish rip of a song in "How to succeed in business without really trying".
