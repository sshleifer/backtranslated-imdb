This movie without a doubt is one of the worst things I've seen. It was so boring that I simply couldn't wait for it to end. I talked to my friend to see it after this site had good reviews and after even 30 minutes she looked at me as if you had to say "your nuts". The scenery was as boring as the movie, with nothing but watching the car. wind blows around forest. The play was not inspiring and the movie was just a waste of what was a good idea in a DVDR's waste. <br /> <br /> Guy Pierce had to be held in neighbors because he had at least washed his hair. All he did was talking on his cellphone, but he didn't sell anything as a salesman. He would have been dismissed weeks before. His girlfriend (once in Coyote Ugly) had to be danced on the bar because she at least looked warm. <br /> <br /> The guy Vincent played was so annoying with his calls. that any normal person would drive to his house and hit him with 4 by 2. <br /> <br /> I don't know on this earth anyone liked it. I really want people to see it to suffer the torture I have suffered.
