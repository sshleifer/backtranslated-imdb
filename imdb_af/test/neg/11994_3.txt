Glenn Ford, a young boy from New York, who saved his cash, thumbs and hobos on his way to the Arizona ranch, he bought, where he hopes to find HOMEL WITH A CLOSED WATER FIELD. <br /> <br /> A movie with a Dalton Trumbo script and story, led by Mr. Ricardo Cortez, villain superordina, and the lead roles of regular Glenn Ford and the restless Richard Conte, shouldn't be so good. Although the system - which is mostly seen as average policemen and railway bulls and real estate agents - is as horrible as that of left-wing Mr. Trumbo can be expected, every proletarian is just as sweet and tasty and salt of the earth that one feels nausea. It does not help the heroine - a lovely blonde thing that is an illegal alien refugee fleeing Franco's Spain - is annoying for reasons of both essays and acting. <br /> <br /> So why look? Richard Conte, in his first role, already has his persona and a fairly good role. And there are a few moments of 30s left camp that is pretty amazing. (Needless to say, Dalton made a big part of the movie in the Russian worker's mission? Everything missing was a portrait of a radiant Joe Stalin!) This is also Glenn Ford's first substantive role (although his performance isn't good is not ). <br /> <br /> Why not look? In essence, the movie offers an unconvincing vision, it is a political point of view, and the two leaders made much better films. Also, the strengths of Dalton Trumbo as author writer are nowhere in evidence. Instead, we get a film written by Coen brothers Barton Fink in a flash (and this completely avoided the writer's block).
