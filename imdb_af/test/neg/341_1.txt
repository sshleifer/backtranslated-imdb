It will be necessary for you to breathe deeply ... <br /> <br /> Terrible special effects that have tried to go far beyond the limits of the budget. Blatant and unashamed plagiarism of other sci-fi movies (such as Pitch Black). Terrible acting. Endless slow motion scenes of characters deliberately walking across sand dunes. Meanwhile dialogue that does nothing to promote the story. Characters wear turtle neck jerseys on a desert planet with two suns. A "cargo" ship manned by a camouflage portable crew of armed soldiers (why would you actually need bush camouflage in space?). Some of the worst decisive choices in the history of a non-budget film production - a steroid swollen "captain" who comes more like a muscular beach jock as a trusted commander and a "perpetrator" who looks dangerous and acts like " a rabbit rabbit. 70 minutes, of which 35 could be retired if the director had any concept of "pressure of time through editing" ... <br /> <br /> I'm not going. It's enough to say this while some components of this horrible movie (and must) are forgiven because of the low budget; The bad idea, laughable plot holes, and snoring-inducing writing are unforgivable on any budget. The end result is a boring, boring, waste of time. Sorry, guys, I hate being so hard on an amateur movie, but you have no excuse to eliminate this kind of work.
