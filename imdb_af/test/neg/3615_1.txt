Now we know where they had the idea of ​​snakes on a plane. To put it unclear, don't pay to see this movie. If you really want to waste 90 minutes of your life, then grab it on the cable or get it as a free choice from NetFlix or Blockbuster. Don't pay to rent it. If you pay to rent it, then you are one stupid individual. The act was terrible, the plot was terrible, everything was terrible except the snakes. Whether they were actually generated or CGI, they looked well. But it is said, still this movie has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Even the newly-dancing scene was pretty bad that I had actually transferred to it quickly. Don't sit down, I didn't warn you.
