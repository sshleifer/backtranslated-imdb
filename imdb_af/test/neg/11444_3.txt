This movie has it all: it's a thrill, a chase movie, a novels story, a gang story, a comedy, a road movie ... and it's not at all. <br /> <br /> All the time you are waiting for something interesting to happen, but no, you still look the same, dull, uninspiring and superficial clich√© of a movie with a very bad soundtrack. Even the star cast actor is lacking in credibility. A striking man with his cravings, a hard-to-play girl, mobs, guys doing tough and incompetent police, yawn ... <br /> <br /> I would recommend not watching Back Track. If you want to see a good movie directed by a well-known actor, look at the three funerals of Melquiades Estrada by Tommy Lee Jones. Now, it's worth looking at.
