I promised some time ago never to get a Joe Castro movie again (maybe after "Near Death"), but I accidentally landed this one as it was a Troma release and I have the cover not read carefully. Oops. Well, I watched it, and it's no good at all, but that's, I think, kind of "tongue in the cheek". If not, it looked the same. Some frightened people from the Rio Grande University have determined whether the Chupacabra exists, due to the recording of the cameras of someone's GATBLAD that stretches this strange thing about the field of vision. And also because the person who supposedly killed this thing was the uncle of the expedition leader. There are some camera men, one of whom is all the time, and there are some ex-Marine called "Army" (?!), Which is a kind of ammunition expert or something. Anyway, the Chupacabra finds it on an old man's farm and suggests finding it, with two suspected witches on the go. The creature itself is pretty ridiculous, with spine on its back and a big big long tongue that Gene Simmons would die. Eventually, after a lot of people were killed, it did the Chupacabra, and they took it back to the university for an autopsy. So, is it from another planet? Is it a genetic creation of a laboratory in Puerto Rico? Uh, they don't really tell us. Not exactly intriguing, but not really terrible. Certainly not a wide audience for this one. 4 out of 10.
