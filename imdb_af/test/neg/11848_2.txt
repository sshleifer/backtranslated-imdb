Oh yes ... Jurrasic Park is Corman-Ized. As usual, the plot waffer is thin, of 1 foot long dinosaurs weighing 150 pounds and the tracks bigger than they are, into inexplicable science that lasers use to hold the dinosaurs and poultry trucks that loose chickens in large pens enough for big dogs (I have seen chicken trucks, they are all in cages, the size of coffins). And all that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of a movie. All the male actors are uncomfortable (think that a grizzly in the desert can be lost, immediately drop things off to give the raptor an easy death) and the female actors all seem to be just a model shot for Fredrick's or Hollywood came. The raptor itself has been the worst since the Hobgoblins (from the movie of the same name), they seem to have had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the "motion" shots. If you want a good movie to sit around and make MST3K style, it's gold. If you want to make competent film and good acting ... don't look at a Roger Corman movie. Acting gets a 4 out of 10, some of the players at this stage have tried. Story gets a 2 out of 10, it reads like a drunk story telling goes bad. Special effects get 2 out of 10, I've seen worse, but not much.
