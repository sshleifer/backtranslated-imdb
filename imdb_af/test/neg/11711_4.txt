I was happy to read the book in advance and I know a little about Tudor England. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the writing and editing of this TV movie was really terrible. I felt like I was watching a very bad drama doc over the period, a movie. <br /> <br /> First, there were too many cuts between key parts. And from the important events that happened at the time, one of Henry's fall with Rome is about his desire to separate Katherine from aragon that led England to break away from Rome and establish its own church. they hardly stuck to the book. I'm all for creative freedom, but for a limitation, especially if you're dealing with a well-written book as your starting point. In the book, Mary gives young Catherine the first time and then she is young, Henry was born. Both of them are Henry's eight. In the movie they show Harry's first then Catherine. And suggest that Catherine's father is William Carey. <br /> <br /> There are too many bad moments in the movie to write them all. <br /> <br /> I would say, however, that Jodhi May and Natascha McElhone depiction as the Boleyn sisters were probably the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you haven't read the book and don't know about Hennry's 8th court, I would recommend staying away from this movie. And for those who read the book, the movie will annoy you because it lacks detail and important plot.
