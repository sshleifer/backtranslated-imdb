This movie knocks everything out there. Well, depending on what you are looking for ... it can be a 10 or a 1 on the scale. This movie is in a complete league of its own. I don't think any movie might be close. I'm not sure what the director intended to do as an excitement or a comedy. If he thought he was making an excitement, then he was lucky, he created one of the best Bollywood comedies of all time. You have to see it to believe it. A Matrix + terminator + a host of other movies that went in one go, along with a storyline dating back to 1980's Hindi movies, with a calamity hahari (a mythical snake man can become) . <br /> <br /> It is an ideal movie if you sit with a lot of friends with alcohol and plan to laugh at the movie! I don't know if it's a 1 or 10. On the basis of a coin I decided to give it 1!
