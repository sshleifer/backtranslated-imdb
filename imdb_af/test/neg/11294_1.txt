I fully understand why this film was made. Silence of the Lammers was an amazing movie - a horrific thriller with an excellent story and high jump factor. <br /> <br /> What I don't understand is why this film was made ... and why Anthony Hopkins agreed to repeat his role as Hannibal the Cannibal in this horrible and disgruntled movie. <br /> <br /> There is no possible way to spoil the movie further than to see it, but for those who prefer to waste your money, DO NOT READ. The movie is absolutely horrible. It's so bad that the transition from Jodie Foster to Julianne Moore becomes a non-problem. <br /> <br /> The only way to really enjoy the movie is to set your watch and leave the theater exactly two hours in the movie, because until then it is quite an interesting thriller. The reels between Moore and Hopkins are similar to Hopkins and Foster, and the performances of the other characters are pretty good. But literally at the two o'clock point, the movie does not lapse anything other than a cheese-like D-grade horror movie. It's sick, and it's stupid and almost like the crew kicked out of the filming season and came to an end in one day. filming. <br /> <br /> Initial buzz about Thomas Harris's unsatisfactory and bizarre ending director, Ridley Scott, ordering a rewrite ... and honestly, after watching the movie and reading the book's final , I don't know what is worse. <br /> <br /> Please - don't waste your money OR time on this movie unless you are willing to go EXACTLY at the two hour point because it's the only way you'll feel happy about the saga of Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter ... the mystery that made the first movie, and waiting for this one as well.
