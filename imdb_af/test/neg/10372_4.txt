I absolutely love the first three movies, they were wonderful! I caught Part 5 on VHS 10 years ago, and I was disappointed. But maybe it was because I had never seen the fourth one, because they were shot back. but after looking at a copy today, I have to say it was no better than number 5. My expectations were not high to start with, but it is cheap live video material, not even a horror movie, that is PG -13. The acting was not convincing, the story was quite silly without any excitement and there weren't many effects. But the biggest problem is that there are no deaths or gores (the annoying child killed in his car should be the highlight, but come on.) <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, both parts 4 and 5 was directed by Sequel director Jeff Burr who gave us the excellent Stepfather II and Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. I love the Puppeteer: The Legacy, though it was nothing but a tribute to the best scenes of all movies. <br /> <br /> Overall, Puppet Master is much like the Hellraiser series: A great trilogy, but forgets the rest.
