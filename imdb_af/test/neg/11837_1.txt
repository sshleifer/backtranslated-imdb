I understand Roger Corman likes doing things cheaply, but it's just sad. I bought this movie from the dollar box at my local video store, not a month after I watched the original Carnosaur. I was blown away; It was the same damn movie, featuring just a few Corbin Bernesen! It reminded me of all the 80-year-old ninja movies that took old Kung Fu movies and split into a bunch of white ninjas who wrote cars called "ninja" on their headbands (if you didn't see them don't go, see "Ninja Terminator", "The Thundering Ninja", "Black Dragon" and "Ninja Warriors". Thanks Roger Corman; You just made me waste a dollar.
