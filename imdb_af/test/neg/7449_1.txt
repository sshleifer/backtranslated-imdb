The first Robocop had a sense of cynical humor and a sick sense of violence. It was a fine line to walk, but Paul Verhoeven pulled it off and the film did so well, they made a sequel. How awful. (Possible Spoilers forward - anything that can spoil it is beyond me). Irvin Kershner is not the director of this type of film. He clearly did not understand the white of the original and as a result the massive exaggerated senseless violence seems very bad - and worse is very unpleasant. Even worse is the musical score. Leonard Rosenman was an old man of another era and the heroic, light music doesn't fit the screen images! What did he record? The Great American Hero?! Worst of all, he completely eliminated Robocop's first film theme, which was so memorable and perfect. Can you imagine a Superman movie without John Williams' fanfare, or Indiana Jones, etc.? How can he do this? !! <br /> <br /> The plot is just a collection of ideas that have not been laid. In the beginning we see Robo stalking his old wife. Good, good idea. But they let go completely. Then there's a stupid idea of ​​the company Robo reprogramming to be nice. It is thrown in for 10 minutes and then dropped immediately. Or the stupid idea that the apostate 10-year-old drug remind Robo of his son. Again, a poor motive, which is briefly shown briefly. It can work in a comic book, but not on film and Frank Miller was unfortunately inexperienced at the moment and throws every idea with the kitchen. It doesn't work as a whole. <br /> <br /> Some people here seem to praise the corporate bashing in this movie and the privatization of the police. This is the best part of the movie that matches the first. In the original, however, the old man was a difficult businessman for a profit, but ultimately fair. In this film, he is merely angry in his desire for money and power. You can't just change characters like that for no reason. And Nancy Allen's character is useless in this movie, while in the first case it was essential for Robo's quest for himself. She is as gratuitous as the violence in this movie. <br /> <br /> And the violence, yes the violence. I enjoy many violent, bloody movies when they serve their purposes and are meant to tell a story. Irvin Kershner seems to be blown out, broken, children slumber for death and torture and people's desire for drugs. He doesn't know when to stop. Do we really have to see every last innocent bystander (even people trying to help others) get fired ???? It is distracted when we see the bad Robocop shooting repeatedly! Instead, Mr. Kershner has very little taste for this kind of work and creates a horrible debris that is a huge piece of art and worse, a disgusting message of violence for any young person watching this movie. <br /> <br /> No, this movie isn't meant to be message-y and I'm definitely not looking for Robocop movies or Alien or Predator movies. However, if you go too far and cross the line, much of what you do must be questioned. And as for this movie, in the words of the evil child drug dealer's last words when he dies, "it still sucks".
