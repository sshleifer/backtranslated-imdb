I believe Cockpuncher is the best piece of work that came from the Steven Seagal factory in a long time. This movie was the first one I've seen since that fine movie preview. My point? He's done. Each movie is the same. Maybe he'll be good at Machete because he won't be the star. We can only hope. <br /> <br /> P.S. Thank you for talking to UCSB when I went to school. It was a wonderful speech. You influenced many people out there. <br /> <br /> So should I write ten lines on this movie? Umm .... I like the smoker guy who killed a bunch of fools. When someone smells menthol's LOOK OUT. Because there can be a killer with a silence (and another hard one) who wants to kill you. <br /> <br /> Is it ten?
