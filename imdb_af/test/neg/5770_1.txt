And believe me this is a beautiful thing. Take "Jolly Roger: Massacre at Cutter's Cove", change the killer from a pirate to a prospector, change his obsession with buried treasure into old gold and his color from green to deep blue. You now have "Miner's Massacre." The problem is, at least, "Jolly Roger" was enough to remember - albeit in a bad way, keeping it for the whole two hours. There is no strip-joint-murder scene or any bizarre murders. I can't tell you how many times I've lost interest in "Miner's Massacre" and start making or cleaning dishes. And the end is absolutely stupid. The 49er dude only randomly comes back nowhere to kill the local sheriff while the main actor and actress screams in the sheriff's cruiser. A really horrible movie.
