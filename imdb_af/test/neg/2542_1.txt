I just watched this movie and for me .... it takes ages to end because it's so boring ..... and the storyline is extremely bad. <br /> <br /> Now ... where do I start .... Oh .... the movie is called "sinking of japan" .... yes yes ... it shows that Japan is actually sinking, but the action part is very bad. Compare with the movie "the day after tomorrow" I would have classified it at least 8/10. <br /> <br /> The "sinking of Japan" doesn't show much of the disaster that really happens before us. there is not much excitement ... boring ... all i can say ... <br /> <br /> one more point ... i would recommend this movie to get a better title .. maybe something like "the romance of sinking of Japan" because this movie has lots of talk (waste of time ... speaks nonsense) and the love story is extremely boring and has dragged on for too long ... honestly. <br /> <br /> Overall ... this movie does not show enough details of the disasters, eg many people running like hell to avoid death. The story part was not enough for me. <br /> <br /> But hey ... there's one thing we should appreciate about this movie though .... & it has good songs!
