I first saw the movie with a Saturday matinee when I was very young. I thought it was cool and often thought of it. Well, I finally resumed it on DVD. It was still very entertaining, but in a different way. It should be regarded as one of the most gracious, funniest, 1950s sci-fi movies. Stock seemed to be military imagery. The dialogue is stilted and the effects are rough. There was one line of dialogue that had me in stitches. The line Jeff Morrow says on the beach with the baby. Rent it if you need a movie to watch with a bunch of drunk friends. It's a classic.
