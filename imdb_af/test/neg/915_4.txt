It is difficult to evaluate a writer / director's first attempt. This is one more movie than I wrote or directed. James Hunter wrote a story that was interesting, but suffered from an uneven flow. <br /> <br /> After all, the idea that a man (yes rule) should choose between dwarf life and straight is common, and even in love with the daughter (Tatyana Ali) of the man you killed. was done. To do this again requires something that is original and lacking in originality in this movie. <br /> <br /> I was drawn by including so many favorites: Tia Carrere (Trues Lies, Wayne's World), Pam Grier (Jackie Brown), Frank Langella (Dracula, Good Night and Good Luck), and Ving Rhames (Rosewood, Dawn of the Dead). They did not disappoint their achievements, but they had little to work with. <br /> <br /> Directly to video is becoming more common, but that doesn't mean it's wasting time. Perhaps the so-called Hunter's attempt will be more enjoyable.
