Am I the only person who saw and remembered Amadeus. Each scene in "Copying" accompanied his counterpart in the Milos Forman, Amadeus - from the galloping wagons of frenzied strings, to the entrance of Anna through the dark corridor preceded by the man with the key, to the much dialogue of the conclusion with Anna at Beethoven's feet a la Salieri before dying Mozart. Don't remind anyone else the dialogue in that script: <br /> <br /> Salieri "Time?" , Mozart "Ordinary time". ..... "We start with the strings ..." and so it is a copy. <br /> <br /> Remember Cynthia Nixon leaned against a door jambie, tears falling under her torn face - the same scene, just replacing her with Beethoven's cousin. Even the skatological humor (jokes) is the same. We even followed a cardinal followed by a plate of sweet cookies reminding Salieri in the banquet room. Remember no one else? !! <br /> <br /> And the scene where Anna cries to God: "Why did you give me this gift?" ... Salieri said the same thing! <br /> <br /> And above all, we have a script with an opening layout that reads like the character identifications you find in a children's story. "I'm Mr. Beethoven. I'm the composer ...." <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of the bridge builder? Unlike adapting the technical to the artistic ... a comparison not developed at all - probably because it has no meaning, especially when it comes to Beethove who is the master of the technical. <br /> <br /> There's only one big play - playing the ninth. First, the music, which in itself leads you to tears. But then there is the highly erotic interaction of Anna, the Copistical Time and Beethoven that surpasses the explicit sexual intimacy. So intense, it's almost embarrassing. <br /> <br /> But, please - the rest of the movie - Where's the world's collective memory? You've seen it before ... and better!
