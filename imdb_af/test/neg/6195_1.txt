Well, I felt that a movie by Mormone, about Mormons, would be a disaster for Mormons waiting to happen, but little did I know how painful it would be. A little known fact is that Mormons have always made extremely fine propaganda films. The church's official film campaign produced rare and enduring jewels that surpassed the Mormon community, including the wonderful short film "Cipher in the Snow" which eventually made the rounds as an educational film in the late 70's. Then there is Neil LaBute's disturbing masterful elder. <br /> <br /> However, the success of these films is largely dependent on the fact that they did not focus on Mormons or any specific Mormon theology. Instead, they choose to focus on a universal theme and deal with it at a basic human level. "God's army" leaves any pretext of universality and walks in the silent and myopic world of the orthodox. Although it may be enough to alienate anyone other than the most dedicated Mormon, Richard Ductcher's dissatisfaction as a film maker and his youthful approach to storytelling is sufficient reason to judge almost any standard "God's army" incompatible. <br /> <br /> Dutcher's own terrible woodworker sets the tone for his army of the least interesting Mormons you'll ever meet. Of course, the performances of the cast are not exactly helped by Dutcher's pathetic writing. He must get credit not to avoid the more controversial aspects of the Church, but as he can expect, he conveniently puts these controversies into a sympathetic light. It should also not be so surprising that most of the answers from the church's dark side are addressed with little other than faith. At one stage, a black-American missionary is shaken by a black couple gathering at a church separated until 1978 (about ten to twenty years after nearly every congregation in the most degenerate parts of the deep south). already done that). Instead of addressing the Church's active racist history, perhaps the most difficult place in Mormon theology, which even church leaders no longer defend, is the inflamed character of Joseph Smith in the murder of Joseph Smith - an obvious one lying and perhaps scary addition to line work. Stay out of this oxygen milestone with third-degree leper jokes that come as comic relief and you have a strong case for the revival of silent movies. <br /> <br /> If you knew little of Mormons before watching this movie, you might be inclined. to avoid them at all costs. If you are Mormon, this movie offers absolutely nothing to be proud of.
