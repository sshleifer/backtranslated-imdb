I just watched this movie with a few friends. They said I had to see it, but from the beginning I knew it was going from bad to worse. So I can only give this movie 1 because the effects used were so badly used and thought everyone could see that there were no "real" ghosts. I feel the worst part was this so-called "old haunted house" contains a whole bunch of new items and some "stuffed items". I could have thought effects that would look much better than a chair being reversed by an invisible ghost (or should I say the thread). Then, later when they check the tape of the chair, it flips in another way. Uh O, it's a big continuity error. If it were a really good movie, they would have caught it and all the other "old house" items. This movie is like a rip from the house on a haunting hill and the Blair gate project has all thrown into a bad idea and compound movie. I would be ashamed to postpone something with so bad acting, effects and cheap video shots of the girls' coffins and how conveniently the camera falls if something "paranormal" happens. This movie is an insult to people out there who are actually looking for ghosts and to get real ghost material on tape.
