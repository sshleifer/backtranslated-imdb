A four-and-an-hour O'Neill game is boiled to a little under two, and much of that running time is dedicated to actors with frozen expressions on their faces as they cast their characters' voices into voices. about reading. It can work on stage, but it looks hilariously in this soap opera adaptation, which softens his heroine's bad behavior and never explains why she has so enchanted so many men. Norma Shearer and Alexander Kirkland, who are ridiculously persuaded, are released by a naturalistic Clark Gable - he is the only one working the frozen face technique. It gets even harder when Shearer's and Gable's son, a fiery mop, shoots the frozen face.

By the time they pop up, the voices review was largely abandoned, playing it as a ripe soap, with a sentimental fade out that actually played "silver threads under the gold" as background music. Robert Leonard's direction is stodgy and he shows little facility for reworking in hyperactive actors. It's definitely entertaining. There is nothing but that, unless you consider Groucho's satirical parody in "Animal Crackers" or an old Mad Magazine satire that Shirley Booth's sitcom "Hazel" made a low "Strange Interlude". But it's not good.
