This game is from a genre of games that have tried to capitalize on the entire Myst-inspired trend - walk around, talk to people, solve puzzles. The puzzles themselves are absolutely horrible, but I like the acting itself, which is only slightly better. If you are looking for a convincing display of any one character, you will not get it here, but this game is worth buying if you only see the true hilarious performance of Christopher Walken. His play is so horrible in this game that he seems to imitate someone who embodies him. He is a caricature of himself. <br /> <br /> Buy this game if you're masochistic, a Walken fan, or just want to hear the F word a lot.
