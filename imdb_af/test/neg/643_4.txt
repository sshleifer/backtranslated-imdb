After watching this movie on TV, I watched it in IMDB and surprised me with a 7.6 user rating! It's not a good movie. Especially bad is editing; The poor way the story jumps from one point to another was amateurish and a great distraction. This was not done very smoothly. I agree that the acting was pretty decent, especially Kelly Kapowski, and that the story was enough.
