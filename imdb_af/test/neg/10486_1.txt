This movie was terribly horrible. Most of the movies consist of people running in the bush, walking through the forest, or dancing in the woods. More than half, at least. Then came two children who discovered two "terribly mutilated bodies" in the bush, the next night to the bush for a romantic walk. ????? There is no time continuity. His day, his night, his day, his really really night, his twilight, his pitch black, his day. All the bushes go on until you think you will lose your mind. really bad. The sheriff discovers a five foot claw print embedded in the bush forest and theorises that a super big alligator has learned to walk upright. Really entered a silly movie with no real motivation for the characters. Can entertain young children as an alternative to really graphic things.
