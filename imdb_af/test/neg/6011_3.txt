I managed to prevent Hemingway from being read in college. From what I could tell, along with his reductivist expansion, he presented editorial lines. This movie transfiguration of AF2A in a simplistic, haughty, confident story, does not disturb me from my suspicions. A man who barely acts on the European Battlefield (Hudson) falls into a nurse (Jones) and conspires to spend time together. Hemingway's great contribution to narration was the romantic travel book? Who knows what these two lovers have in common? They are so generic. The film doesn't even bring the utmost irresponsibility needed to abandon the front in favor of a love adventure. The two have a season on the Alps, straight from a J. Crew catalog. A number of better scenes are undermined by cliffs, conventional melodramas elsewhere. The movie features small, unlikely, unspecified details that combat epic treatment. The hollow hospital where Mrs. Barkley works, is virtually empty, so no secondary plot line might derive from the poor main story. Complicated, it's not. <br /> <br /> The camera work is better than average, with amazing location photography. Director Charles Vidor (or maybe Huston?) Does striking things in the first hour with an on-screen, widescreen camera ... there's no second unit cop-outs. Vidor shows massive, panoramic tableaux, over a line of hundreds of soldiers moving through the mountains; and then with a 90 degree lathe of his camera comes up with Hudson's ambulance that comes down to him. <br /> <br /> Hudson looks good. He is a better actor than he gets credit for, but with unlike material like this he can become very mechanical. Mercedes McCambridge plays a one-dimensional screw. Jennifer Jones is puffy and overlooked in the clumsy female head. The movie is best when it is off the screen. The love scenes are about a coffee commercial.
