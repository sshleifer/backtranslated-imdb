Hollywood has made many strange films over the years, but no stranger to it. WHY this movie was given, I will never know, and how Paramount would think it would sell any tickets in 1947. It's the strangest mix of genres I've seen long ago, a movie that doesn't really know if it's trying to be a serious war drama or a Viennese operetta comedy. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of a British spy trying to get a poison gas formula from Germany in the days just before World War II. Ray Milland, a good actor, plays the role of an escape from Monty Python, a very exaggerated English prep school dialogue. In Germany, he meets a gypsy, Marlene Dietrich, who helps him travel under cover, of course, another gypsy. She plays her role as the typical Viennese operetta gypsum, just like the other "gypsies" in the movie. But there are also Nazis who are not funny at all. And then Milland finds he's starting to think like a gypsy, and it's not considered a joke. Sometimes the music is for a light comedy, sometimes for a drama. Every time the Nazis appear, the movie character Wagner, who is funny in itself, plays. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been a comedy, or it could have taken the fate of the gypsies seriously and done serious work to show how the Nazis treated them. Both were pinned in this movie but not pursued. What we are left with is a really strange mish-mash genre that is ashamed of everyone (except the director). <br /> <br /> Bizarre.
