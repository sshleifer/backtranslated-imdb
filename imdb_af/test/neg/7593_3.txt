Strange things happen to Americans Will (Greg Evigan), Maura (Alexandra Paul) and their young daughter Aubrey (Briana Evigan, Greg's real daughter) as they move into a large, newly-inherited house in Ireland. Crusty corpses are found in the basement, a turkey presses blood, furniture moves and the ghosts of a dead child and an old old lady frightening the baby. Paranormal investigators are eventually reported to ban the evil spirits, but Maura is owned and chased anyway with a nail. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of claws, but there's a striking show by Alexandra Paul. .. it is not too bad in this movie (or anyone else I can think of)! She can barely keep a straight face and her over-emotional and hysterical screaming tantrums are a joy to watch. Anyway, she is much more interesting to watch than anything else in this movie. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
