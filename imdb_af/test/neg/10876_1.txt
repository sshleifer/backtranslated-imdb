Or that's what the filmmakers would like to believe you. <br /> <br /> This movie is so hard to be cool, it's ridiculous. Everything from the look of the movie, the cinematography, the editing, the dialogue and the acting, is in the super cool anticipation from the beginning. Just to make sure no one knows how cool this movie is, there's a soundtrack of really cool rock n roll tunes and a twangy western-surf-tex mex guitar playing throughout the film. As a last reminder of how cool this movie is, all the actors were instructed to speak in a harder voice, because as we all know, it's bad. <br /> <br /> The plot (if any) looks pretty simple. But as someone else has pointed out, the director and star of the movie seem quite determined not to tell the story, but rather to focus on an abundance of naked babies and dialogue that is supposed to be bad, but get tired surprisingly fast (did they have a game to see how often they can attach the words "pussy" and "f * ck" and its derivatives in an 80-minute movie?). <br /> <br /> This movie was absolutely horrible.
