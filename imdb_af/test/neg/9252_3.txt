"The Mill on the Floss" was one of the few novels by Mary Ann Evans, who wrote under male pseudonym George Eliot. I tried to read this dull and very worn novel years ago, but couldn't finish it. I will only review this movie report on its own merits, as I do not know how faithfully it follows the original novel. <br /> <br /> The film's opening points are printed in an Old English font that represents the medieval suggestion period, and is therefore a very poor choice for a 19th-century movie. (On the other hand, about halfway through the film, we see a close-up of a handful that publishes an estate auction. This hand letter is in true Victorian fonts, and looks very convincing.) Most of this movie is Extremely convincing in portraying the architecture and clothing of the early 19th century England. The exact location of the film's story is never disclosed, but - by judging the actors' accent - I place it somewhere in the Cotswolds, perhaps Warwickshire. <br /> <br /> The plot, which is there, involves a mill that changes hands several times (over a few decades) between two competing families, one rich and one working class. I disagree with another IMDb judge who claims that James Mason has only a small role in this movie. Mason has the largest and most central role in this drama, as the face of the richer family. Like the spoiled and petulant Tom Tulliver, Mason is dark-breaking and turbulent. His performance here is in a better movie: it showed me that Wuthering Heights is being reviewed with Mason as Heathcliff. <br /> <br /> Since it's a multi-generation saga (something that Eliot has done much better for Middlemarch), several of the leading roles in this movie are split between two actors: preschool children's, adult in the main story. The prologue of this film has a very well written scene, intentionally establishing Tom Tulliver and bully-ragging of early age, and young Philip Wakeham as decent and considerate. Through hard labor Philip earned a half-penny: Tom tried to squeeze it from him, but was unwilling to take the coin by brute force. He wants Philip to give it to him. All the children's actors in this movie, male and female, are talented and attractive. Unfortunately, all the children speak their dialogue in beautiful voice-like accents that are quite unlike the accent of the actors and actresses who play the same roles as adults. This contradiction calls attention to the staginess of the material. Unfortunately, none of the later scenes is as good as this prologue. <br /> <br /> The climax features a crowd of workers in a rainstorm, much better and photographed than the previous scenes. But modern viewers (in Britain, at least) can no longer take this kind of material seriously. By now, almost every British comedian has done a "trouble at t" mill, a comedy routine that just parodyes this topic, so hard to watch this movie with a straight face. <br /> <br /> The character actress Martita Hunt is well into a small role, but the opening credits (in the Old English font) failed her first name as 'Marita'. I will rate this dull movie 3 points out of 10: one point for James Mason's performance, the early scene with the kids and the authentic Victorian typing in the auctioneer's hand letter.
