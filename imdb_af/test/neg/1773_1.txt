This movie was absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot could be made to work, if the movie was written better. The acting was the worst I have ever seen. I was very slow and let me leave / switch off the movie. I watched the whole movie in the hope that the end would make it worthwhile, but it didn't. this movie i think must be judged in the negative numbers. (In my humble opinion)
