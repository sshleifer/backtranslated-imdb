Komodo vs. Cobra starts as 'One Planet' environmental conservationist Jerry Ryan (Ryan McTavish) and his friend Carrie (Renee Talbert) hire Captain Michael Stoddard (executive producer Michael Paré) to take them to an island in the Southern Pacific. hesitant, as the island is a top secret military research base, but rapidly changing when a cargo is offered in cash. Together with TV news reporter Sandra Crescent (Jeri Manthey), they sailed for the island and once they realized that the army funded illegal DNA genetic experiments, which led to large Komodo Dragon's & King Cobra's living almost every other living eat something. There & Stoddard & Co. are next on the menu ... <br /> <br /> Written and directed by the ever terrible Jim Wynorski under his pseudonym of Jay Andrews, it's just awful, it's just hard to sit by and is worse than the usual 'Creature Features' garbage, the Sci-Fi Channel has the nerve to air if possible. The screenplay is horrible, predictable and completely boring, some giant monsters of some kind are created by DNA-brushing scientists, a group of people are trapped with the mentioned monsters and must try to escape to be eaten. That's it, it's the whole plot of Komodo vs Cobra. Perhaps it has tried to tear off AVP: Alien vs. Predator (2004) with the title, but all the "vs." little amounts are a waste of thirty seconds between the two titular animals at the end, boring as hell and certainly a great disappointment to anyone hoping to have a full on monster mash. The character is poor, the dialogue is terrible, the pace is slow, the story is predictable and Cliché is ridden and the whole movie really sucks with a lazy script that illegally declares both Komodo Dragon's & Cobra's amphibians are not no. Hell, Komodo vs Cobra is not even worth watching for any unintentional laugh, because it is so boring and almost anything happens even though the eyes of a woman hiding behind the smallest rock on the Cobra beach are pretty funny for the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> How does Wynorski still work? He's probably consistently the worst director currently working, how can he still keep fun-sounding movies in beautiful places with half decent casts and still expose such a horrible movie? I think it was cut to get a PG or TV show, as every time someone swears it is masked by a parrot peep! There are zero gore or violence and the monsters screens are limp, people are just standing there, the monsters are just kind of stands there that are sissy or roar and it's about it. The CGI computer effects are terrible, it's very bad things that just look awful. <br /> <br /> With a so-called $ 450,000 budget, it looks as good as it was, the Hawaiian locations are great to watch, but that's about it. The acting is poor of unobstructed cupboards. <br /> <br /> Komodo vs Cobra is an absolutely horrible Sci-Fi Channel 'Creature Feature' by Jim Wynorski, movies don't get much worse than that.
