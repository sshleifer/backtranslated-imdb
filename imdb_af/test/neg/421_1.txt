It is hard to imagine how the engaging Dan Brown novel "Angels and Demons" can misfire as this movie version. Here are ten reasons why the movie was a failure. Due to the spoilers, please do not read unless you have already seen the movie. <br /> <br /> (1) In the film there was no love affair between Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra. Even worse, there wasn't even any chemistry between the two leading actors. <br /> <br /> (2) The breathtaking places in Rome, as described in the novel, have not been visually realized in the film. I'm aware that director Ron Howard has been having trouble filming on the spot. But there are superior photographed images of Rome on the History Channel than in this film where the Eternal City is presented in perpetual stock footage. The great works of art described in the novel are briefly portrayed in the film. The wonderful Bernini sculpture of the "Ecstasy of St. Teresa" was just a few moments, and the West Ponente lighting in the Vatican Square was not visible at all. <br /> <br /> (3) The most tasteless choice made by the filmmaker was in the portrayal of the deceased pope who actually looked like the beloved John Paul II. In the novel, the pope is clearly fiction without any resemblance to any real pope. <br /> <br /> (4) One of the most colorful (and important) characters of the novel, Maximilian Kohler, Director of CERN, was <br /> <br /> (5) There were many cases where the rules of dialogue were inaudible due to excessive noise. <br /> <br /> There were moments when the faces of characters were not visible due to the shadows and chiaroscuro film lighting. This technique worked in The Godfather movies, but Ron Howard is not Gordon Willis. <br /> <br /> (7) The Cardinal College was quite a motley crew with one of the voters talking in a southern draw. This dude would have been more at home in Texas than in the Sistine Chapel. <br /> <br /> (8) The critical relationship between the Camerlengo and the late Pope was not defined in the film. This relationship was central to the theme of science vs. religion and the relevance of the Illuminati to the plot against the church. <br /> <br /> (9) In the novel, the character of Hassassin was a memorable villain. In the film, the assassin's role was a cardboard cutlery. <br /> <br /> (10) Overall, the filmmakers did not trust the operation of the successful novel. <br /> <br /> In the novel, Langdon makes an impossible fall from the sky and into the Tiber River. In Ron Howard's movie, it was the movie itself that landed in the Tiber.
