The main character is a whiny, irresponsible study of how to pity yourself. She lost it by the drop of a hat, did pathetic, was schizophrenic, and surprised me why she did not understand on earth why these "friends" of her hair did not call in three years. (Get an idea, sister - you're a young mess!) I couldn't stand her or the friends. I never felt related to any of the characters. To make the whole movie even more unbearable, someone has gone a long way from setting up the world's most beautiful collection of hardy and knitted hats for all eternity. It should only justify someone being tested on a wardrobe for a decade. !) <br /> <br /> The acting was not terrible, but not really credible, and in the end the only thing I care about is the two hours I will never return. Don't waste your time - rather go for a dentist appointment!
