I watched this world prize on the Starz Action Channel. They call it Vampires: The Turn. The plot was a bit confusing. There is a voice over in the introduction about an 800 year war, and I didn't understand it well. The film is about a young couple somewhere in Asia (maybe in China, I don't think the movie specifies). The couple have an argument and Meredith Monroe walks down and is kidnapped by a biker gang of Vampires. The boyfriend finds a group of vampires who don't kill people, and enter a fight with the cyclists. A human group of butchers is somehow involved, and the final battle order takes place during a solar eclipse. This movie is not related to Vampires or Vampires: Los Muertos. Confusion, but decent action. Four out of 10 stars.
