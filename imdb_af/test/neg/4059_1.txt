This is without a doubt the WORST successor I have ever seen, and I have seen many of them come to the conclusion. The plot is simply ridiculous. I can catch a ball and also walk around a field. Why can't I play in the Superbowl? Yes I know this movie is meant for kids, but there are only a few stands that can even realize children, totally stupid and unrealistic. The first Air Bud movie was pretty good, but this one was a total accident. Disney loses it. If I had control over who won the Razzie Awards, I'd give this one some. Enjoy the day! =)
