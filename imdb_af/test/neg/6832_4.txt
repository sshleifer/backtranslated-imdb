Very short: a bad movie. If you are looking for pure action and no brain (or brain illusion) or you are under the age of 15 and like Bruce Willis this is the movie. Also, don't expect the scenario to be consistent or even credible if you think a little, don't do it if you just want to enjoy yourself.
