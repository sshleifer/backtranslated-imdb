At least if you're a Disney fanatic (well, the variety that loves their live action movies as well as the animated stuff), if you're a kid, if you're a kid at heart, almost the extent to which you hardly realize you are an adult, if you absolutely love any movie that contains animals, especially if they do tricks, or if you are just not too demanding, Air Bud: World Pup is a bit nice to watch. I am a Disney fanatic. I enjoyed this movie enough, and I'd love to see it again. <br /> <br /> But the boy has many problems. The main error comes from a combination of too many characters, too many plot threads and not enough time to care for everyone. In the space of 82 minutes, our adults were getting married, teenagers fell in love and tried not to be uncomfortable about it, teen competition for love and jealousy, pretending to be spies, fall in love with dogs, dogs playing soccer, dogs with puppies, manipulative parents who do everything to make their children win, are set up and executed by their children, household dilemmas, and crooks. I probably forget something, but these are 10 major plot issues to be addressed, with less than 10 minutes per thread to handle it, and presumably they are weaving into a coherent whole that is not both too complicated - it's a kid film, and it is also humorous and heart-warming. Not surprisingly, director Bill Bannerman, in his first turn in complete control (he has a lot of previous second unit experience), was not quite the job. I'm sure it didn't help that at least three writers were involved, and probably dictated to producers as well. <br /> <br /> The end result is that Air Bud: World Pup is extremely hooked. Events occur with little justification, and worse, often little explanation. People find out and do things mainly because they have to - and quickly - so that everything can come where it should come within 90 minutes. From one track to the next, the time can jump for six months or so. We both have adults who seem to be mentally disabled and children who only intuitively find out what a dog thinks and hurts in an unexpected action. Some of the wires simply had to be removed because it is difficult to get involved in the movie as soon as you get an idea. It's already over. <br /> <br /> Also not helping is the fact that one of the wires is actually a rip-off of One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961), minus a Cruella De Vil character. And another problem is that the way the movie is processed, I have to accept that the dog, Air Bud, probably can't do much with the soccer ball. Unlike the first two films, a sporting dog is almost a memory here, and when we see it, it is in very fast-paced glimpses; Each time these fragments look even by computer animation. <br /> <br /> Yet, for someone like me, there's a cheesy charm for Air Bud: World Pup. The writing and performances are often between ridiculous, hokey and kind clich√©d. I tend to hold that combination. This makes the movie a bit predictable and subtly bizarre. And at times, like the end, when the film leaves the consistency completely and basically becomes a trademark for the US women's soccer team, Air Bud: World Pup is so blatantly sticky that you can't help it but love it to have.
