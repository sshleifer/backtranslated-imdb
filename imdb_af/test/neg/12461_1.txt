For the first time in the review of movies, I immediately found myself uninteresting in this story. I don't know if it was the way it was filmed or the story behind the characters, but it was vague, over-exploited, and totally untouchable. Within the first thirty minutes I saw myself both apathetic with all the characters and the story. I felt like I had seen this structure before, and Tart had nothing new to surprise me. After I thought it might be my mood, I stopped the movie and chose to start fresh this morning, but the same feeling persisted. I just didn't mind. This is not a good sign. The characters were slim. If I say greasy, I literally mean by looking at them, developing, you will never smell any palate. The story was reclaimed, almost to the point of plagiarism. Now I'm not saying Christina Wayne stole this story, but she didn't add anything fresh in the perspective. The casting was horrific, the underlying symbolism and themes were so far that no critic could find them (or the characters), and the stories were vague and messy. You didn't know anything about anyone or anything, and instead of putting more emphasis on the characters, we pushed ourselves into drugs, less gender and money in our faces. These are themes we've seen in every movie since the beginning of movie time, but somehow it couldn't be captured by Wayne in a creative way. <br /> <br /> What immediately pulled me off this story? It was mainly the characters. I saw most of Brad Renfro's work, and frankly he has to redefine himself. Director Larry Clark has defined him, and strangely, he can't get out of that stereotypical character. Within the first twenty minutes of Renfro's screen time, I got bored. I knew exactly what he was trying to portray and why. It was spectacular or impressive, just repetitive. He had to bring some excitement or tension to his role, rather than just playing this random socialite. Without a strong character, the final highlight of this movie comes instead of a countdown. Renfro did not show the best of his abilities in this film. While on the subject nobody showed the best of their abilities. What goes on with Dominique Swain, outside Lolita, I do not believe she really came up as an actress, and does not help follow up roles like Cat Storm. Byou Phillips was the only actress I witnessed to bring something remarkable to the screen, unfortunately because of the frightening action of everyone, she was lost. Here and there running, and almost almost forgotten during the second act. Melanie Griffith was a relentless throw and most of this movie's budget probably went to her TWO scenes where she was in. Perhaps the rest went to the random guy from The Kids in the Hall, who desperately had to go far away. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem, outside of acting, was pacing this movie. Nothing, and it's hard for me to say, but nothing coaxed together. There were so many sub-stories that occurred during the film that no real substance was formed. The robberies, the teen "anxiety and woe", the rich social people are learning how terribly real life is, the random children in the salmon, and even the end has just hurried and terrified. With this messy workmanship, the whole story never really formed a true form. Family structures have never been defined, characters are never given emotions, and all we have left is bits of honest remnants. Wayne did not complete the task at hand. <br /> <br /> While I hate to put the full burden on the director, with this movie I have little choice. With a terrific title that is just the complete opposite of what this film was, the amateurist direction left history in every scene very emotionally, leaving us with disgusting plays and poor developments. With vague storytelling it is difficult to place a "good" behind Cake. It was a movie I didn't hear about, and I saw it when I saw it. All Wayne did with this movie, is random, takes excerpts from other films that have done a better job of defining all the elements above and cutting everything together to make the movie Tart. It's hard for me to say this, but Wayne ruined this movie. While I didn't believe there was a lot to take out of the story, any remaining elements of excitement were drained as Wayne took the helm. While you can save most of the time, perhaps strong acting, or even the music, you can't find anything in Tart. From the opening to the end I felt like swimming through a lot of oats. No consistency, no power. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is a waste of your time. If you are looking for some deeply symbolic elements or perhaps a bitter one for our society, you will not find it in this movie. Knowing this is what Wayne is trying to show, the final product looks like it was edited on an Etch-a-Sketch. It was an embarrassment to go through and did not encourage anyone to pick it up. Wayne throws all the teachings of her Columbia university education into the wind and destroys two hours of my life. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Degree: * Off *****
