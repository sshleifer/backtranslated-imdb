I love this movie. Although I rated it a "4", it is because the play, the plot and the budget all knocked down to the "B" hall even before this movie was released. But that's right! It's an entertaining movie that has a lot to offer! <br /> <br /> I remember what Leonard Maltin said about "Plan 9 From Outer Space": a movie so bad it is great! Lack of the UFO Alien Plot, The thing the King cannot die, relies on the supernatural (divination, a buried head looking for his body, hypnosis, etc.) to tell it. The play is silent, the camera works second class and the settings are limited, but boy! what a movie! This movie is available in the bootleg market. If you get a copy, buy it!
