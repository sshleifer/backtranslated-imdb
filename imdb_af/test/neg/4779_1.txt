I must say that this movie was not what I expected. Although I didn't read the book, the fact that plants can attract one and then wait for a murder to happen just to drag a body out for lunch. With the title ruins you would think of 3000 years that a kind of deity or ancient animal or god would be the culprit. It's like another movie, where you think it was something strange that villagers fear most, but not a crocodile. Anyway, this movie is so, it attracts you to think of the ruins of Mayan or Inca folklore that lead to awakening and old god or people have a different agenda for sacrifice or something for it. But plants? .... come on, is there anything else producers can come up with to want a crowd? As for this movie, it will hit the 'b' list within a short time. I have to say that some of the gore were excellent to watch, but it didn't notice for the rest of the movie. And a plant that mimics a cellphone or folk voice is just too much to believe. I'm a fan of horror movies, but I'm not a stereo-typed fan who doesn't rely on gore or mechanical effects. I rely on great tension and what will bring the next scene for more tension. The thing had a better story line than it did. Even the ring jumped for more, but the ruins were just as devastated for the use of a plant to kill or kill the victims by the residents. The premise was good for the villagers to keep it with salt and such trees, but still a simple torch and lots of napalm can easily do the tricks to end the turbulent plants with a meat eating disorder.
