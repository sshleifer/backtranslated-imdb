STAR RATING: ***** Indispensable **** Many good *** Good ** You can go out for a meal instead * Avoid at all costs <br /> <br /> The story of the titular Adam (Markus O 'Halloran) and Paul (Tom Murphy), two heroin addicts in the slums of Dublin and their daily amblings in their meaningless lives looking for the next solution that will make their day. Along the way, they are trying to reconcile with a close family and friends who have completely dropped them over the years. <br /> <br /> I know many Irish people like to drink, but they seem to have heroin problems, even through the appearance of this movie. I know there is a bit of a drug problem there, as there are in many parts of the world, such another humorous approach to the subject is not a completely unexpected thing. <br /> <br /> I don't remember the last Irish movie I saw (the movie is shot in a style that stands out from any movie I've seen lately!) And from there I'm Of course, not so relieved about their humor as I could be. The movie is pretty funny in some parts, but of course it's another comedy that's not afraid to laugh. The scene in which the mentally handicapped boy is robbed at the back of a alley is certainly true of what a few junkies can do to feed their habit, but is absolutely despicable and I'm not sure if it is meant to be dark humor in any way, but it certainly did not put a smile on my face! It is also in stark contrast to their previous actions where they are seen, which makes their soft side rock and baby move back and forth. In view of this, some may find the end grief, others may see it as just dessert. <br /> Overall, I just didn't see the point on the movie. I have seen no motivation in the 'story' that told it. It just seems to be together without really involving the audience in any way. Unlike Trainspotting (which has dealt with similar themes!), It is an unsuccessful effort for the bulk that is about to kick me off, although it is very short for 83 minutes. Really no more enjoyable than following two real junkies for a day. **
