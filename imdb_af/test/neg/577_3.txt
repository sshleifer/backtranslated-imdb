I have to be honest, I like romantic comedies, but that wasn't what I was hoping for. I thought Ellen Degeneres had the most, what should have been, because I didn't like the two active bedridges. It was awful. Poor Tom Selleck !! He had to act with someone so much in the picture, while he and Ellen had to be in most of the movie. They were the only believers. And the only, very funny parts, they played, not Kate Capshaw and the Everett guy. It's nice that the mummy comes out of the cupboard, I thought it was a nice surprise. <br /> <br /> I'm just glad I saw it on the cable and I didn't pay money to rent it.
