If you are one of those people who do not really like Sci-fi because of their sometimes overlooked ideas and surreal world perspectives, you stay better than you can with Stuart Gordon's Space Truckers! It is truly an absurd space adventure, filled with eccentric characters, colorful kitsch and ridiculous plot twists. In all honesty, I would probably never have made this movie, if it wasn't for Gordon's name on the credits. This man comes very close to a genius in the horror genre, with unmistakable milestones such as 'From Beyond' and 'Re-Animator' on his CV. Apparently, Stuart Gordon likes his humor as distorted as possible! He has gone all over the comedy summit (with Re-Animator), but with the slight difference that the bizarre humor was effective there. Something not really the case for Space Truckers? Most of the gags are nowhere to be found and the completely exaggerated atmosphere only works in small doses. In the end, all that remains is an occasional amusing but totally unnecessary mess. Dennis Hopper and Charles Dance (or at least a semi-Charles Dance) are always delighted to watch and the still-amazing Barbara Crampton has a small role near the end of the film. Crampton was Stuart Gordon's regular heroine in previous horror films. The story of Space Truckers is as stupid as they come. Dennis Hopper plays the self-made loner who is full of work. Who wouldn't be transporting piglets over the galaxy for a company called Interpork? He sees his change in flight as he brings his moss to the ground. They float in Space pirates and find out their load is meant to erase half of the universe! Stuart Gordon returned sensibly to make this little escaped horror again. Since Space Truckers, he already has the sublime 'King of the Ants' and the absolutely brilliant `Dagon'
