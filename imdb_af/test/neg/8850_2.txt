It would be promising if it were a student video. Never know where it is going, as if deciding on every next scene when they made the movie. As a result, many repetitions and a fatal pass. There is an absolutely confusing process by which the ghosts touch people in this world: it involves the internet, telephone calls, a computer science experiment, a suspicious grade student, withdrawal behavior, red rooms, dark spots and suicide. Good luck finding out the connections, or when a character is still a ghost or just acting strange. Characters are hardly sketched, which may be good, but they are totally uninteresting. It is too long and ends only when it reaches a promising scenario, although the conclusion is nonsense. Worst moment: when "the boss" sits down to give incoherent advice.
