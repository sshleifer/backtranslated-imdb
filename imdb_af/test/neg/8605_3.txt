I watched this movie with some kind of dangerous fascination, like a hedgehog trapped in the headlights. There is no doubt that (even if you enjoyed it) it is a bad movie, but the important question is why? It has a good role to play; it is alive; It is prepared to tackle the beak. Some of the characters actually get a few of them, and it's unusual for a British comedy. It also agreed to Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook, Marmite artists, but they had their moments in the past. <br /> <br /> What it lacks is charm. The characters are impossible to idiot, unbelievable and alienating, so that instead of a film of men who trade poorly, the producers made Game On. Any mediocre writer wishing to make a film about the sexual attitudes of foolish sexist British men would have had some copies of Loaded, Zoo or even Viz to read Sid the Sexist and the thing would have written itself. Instead, the producers clearly tried to make a few moronies, difficult to give over characters. Character comedy - unlike slapstick etc. - works only if the audience can recognize a human truth for the situation. But watching this movie is like telling an annoying joke you know won't end up funny, but you can't stop it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film has also been made poor. The plot structure is poor, there is little character rating or development, and many of the screens are not funny. Each time the same lame reggae enters into dividing scenes, senseless and stingy. There is a lot of unnecessary repetition. If you did one joke about parking outside a sex party, you don't have to do it again. One wonders what the British film board saw in the screenplay. <br /> <br /> It is a world where most men rake, and most women are constantly there. The apartment and Alfie put a lot of the same world view, but the producers of this film accept it without criticism. So they ended up with some kind of inferior update of Confessions of a Window Cleaner. Someone British must once again go to this sort of thing and do it right? a good next project for Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, I think ...
