Katharine Hepburn as a mountain woman who mixes prayer with positive thinking - and is thought by local people to be a witch. Kate works too hard to convince us she's a backwoods hick (called Trigger Hicks!), But you can't even see her believe in this unintended comic scenario. Continuously smiling Robert Young plays a foreman working on the construction of a mountain dam that becomes Trigger's first lover ... but unfortunately, he is married! No amount of white magic can revive this formula, based on a play and by R.K.O. brought to the screen. With too wide a mountain billy is thriving. It is ungodly, and just about unavailable. * 1/2 of ****
