(Warning: Some forward spoilers.) <br /> <br /> What an incredible crappy movie. This makes Iron Eagle 2 good. <br /> <br /> The story is as follows: Captain Holiday (Rutger Hauer) is shot down by his friend Banning (Robert Patrick) to stop him shooting an iraqi plane, filled with innocent civilians. Six years later the holiday comes back to take revenge. He's sitting in a tank, Banning (now a colonel) and his pregnant wife over a field. He manages to fire shells while driving the tank. After blowing up the tank through a bazooka, he miraculously lives and fights a fighter plane. With that, he shot down a number of Allied fighters before attacking the NATO headquarters in an attempt to kill Banning's wife. <br /> <br /> An added bonus is that big Baxter (who hangs out of the office in her office) put the rank insignia on her right shoulder backwards. Smart.
