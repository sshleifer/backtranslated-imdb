Well, let me start by saying I love the original RS for the 64. The graphics were new, the ships were really fast and cool. The missions were a challenge, but you had a strategy to do. The computer has not told you every step of your mission, you can wander and explore. <br /> <br /> It's the first thing wrong with RL, everything you do is under a grid and controlled by other people. I mean, don't you if the leader tells people how to handle each mission? <br /> <br /> And talking about missions, why do they intersperse the original trilogy with completely snapped up crap? Never mind. <br /> <br /> I was so waiting for this game when I heard they were going to fly you through the asteroid field of Empire Strikes Back. I think anyone who's a fan of the movies wanted to do it. So, they give it to you. This is the stupidest level in the game. You start by flying the asteroid field with tires driving behind you, and your whole purpose is to get into the field while shooting the tires. You have to kill them all to get ahead. Hey, remember how much Han killed when he was in the field? No one had any bad lead skills compared to him. I just wanted to evade the asteroids while they were coming to me, but I had to use my automatic guns to kill tires behind me. <br /> <br /> It was the biggest disappointment, you have no control Over your flight, everything is slow. Except for the A-Wing, probably the fastest and most manoeuvrable ship in the entire fleet. But, oh yes, didn't Han say the Falcon was? Anyway ... <br /> <br /> You finally get the Battle of Endor. Here's the ultimate level, you can destroy the star star, everyone's first instinct is to choose the Falcon and be the leader. But of course you get there and have to be stupidly chosen strategies like finding (not to mention the difference between) the tie boomers. It is impossible in the falcon, by the time you see one group, the frigate is destroyed. The only way to get this part is to choose the A-Wing. Then you have to attack the star destroyers and this is a real stupid chore. This game makes you feel like you're the only one defending the rebel alliance. After getting frustrated with the 'fun' fight, you come to the star. And here you can think 'yay! I get to destroy the star star, and again, as in the Asteroid field, you have to do a boring thing while passing the tunnels of impending punishment. Your goal is to protect the ship in front of you, remembering the return of the Jedi? It's so moronous, because if you choose the falcon you will die because you are not maneuverable, but if you choose the x-wing, you must close and unlock your s foil. So, it's a choice to kill the bad guys, or to catch up with Lando, which apparently doesn't know how to maneuver. So die in the process. <br /> <br /> The bonus stages aren't even worth pursuing, as each level becomes more and more frustrating. It makes me feel like I did when I saw the new three movies, upset and in need of something to kill. Fortunately for me, Smash Bros Melee exists. <br /> <br /> I hope with the Wii they get something better and carry the original trilogy levels to full capacity. I'm going to get this game the first chance I get.
