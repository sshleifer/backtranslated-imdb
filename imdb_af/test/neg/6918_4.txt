Carrol Naish (like Dr. Igor Markoff) plays "The Monster Maker" in the low budget Bela Lugosi. <br /> <br /> Mr. Naish's serum causes an actual disorder, "acromegaly", which defines the American heritage as "a chronic adult disease characterized by enlargement of the limbs of the limbs, face and jaw caused by over-activity of the pituitary. gland. " Ralph Morgan (as Anthony Lawrence) plays the oppressed man with some dignity. Pretty Blonde Wanda McKay (like Patricia "Pat" Lawrence) is the daughter wanted by the bad scientific Naish; In early scenes, me. McKay and Naish emote, hilariously. <br /> <br /> Look for Tala Birell (as Maxine) in a surprisingly good supporting performance; She plays the somewhat Garbo-like, and long-suffering, Naish assistant. Miss. Birell definitely steals the movie; and you have to ask Dr. Markoff's common sense to set aside her. Glenn Strange (like Steve) and a crazy gorilla (Ray Corrigan) add to the fun. The monster makeup (Maurice Seiderman) is very good. <br /> <br /> **** The Monster Maker (1944) Sam Newfield ~ J. Carrol Naish, Ralph Morgan, Tala Birell
