Worse than mediocre thriller about an abused woman going to the lamb after being related to the death of her husband and sister. To prove that her husband is alive, she follows the state, her danger is increased at every stop. After her, the traditional 'good-cop' and 'bath-cop' are some partners. One is convinced that her innocence is interested in closing the case and coming home. These couples are often able to corner their suspect, but never to catch her. All the main players meet in a remote desert village and the truth begins with some deadly consequences for some. <br /> <br /> Wow! It was a bad movie. The lead turned out to be calm. The police could not find a suspect if he or she was in the police station (it happens twice) and everyone else is one-dimensional as it can be. Avoid this one at all costs. <br /> <br />
