So I was busy on a plane weekend during my snakes, after the movie we wanted more. Why not snakes on a train? How bad it can be, the snakes are likely to kill people on trains. The snakes had to be rattlers. First of all, my friends and I thought the snakes were innocent snakes and pets with the same cherry sound. In fact, we have made the whole thing completely ready to turn it off (we are too lazy to walk and drive). Next thing we knew we didn't know what the dick was going on, but something incredibly funny happens at the end. It's one of those ends you will flush a few times just to express the laugh, because you've suffered so long. <br /> <br /> Last 10 mins a "8", rest of the movie a 2.
