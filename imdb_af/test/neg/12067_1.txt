The cover and the prescription written there are so promising. As slasher maniac I expect a lot from this. But, what's going on? The movie is terrible. The direction, the plot, the tension and the act of the casts are so amateur. I even thought they were using a home video camera to shoot it. Fortunately, it's still a few good moments for me that makes me look. Thank you for the bad package of so-called "Camp Blood". <br /> <br /> 1/10
