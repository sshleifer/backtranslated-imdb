What a terrible movie! It perfectly represents the state of degeneration of French society, where the most elementary respect for sound values ​​and traditions has completely disappeared. The plot is stupid, the movie is not funny at all and the characters are completely level and uninteresting. To say the least, the direction and the cinematography are very poor and uninspired. Catherine Deneuve is as bad an actress as she always was, even when she was directed by Bunuel in Belle De Jour. The rest of the usually good cast (Vincent Lindon, Line Renaud, Jean Yanne) looks completely lost in an ocean of vulgarity, platitudes and restlessness. I can't help making a parallel with the wonderful James Ivory's "Le Divorce", with his thoughtful portrayal of French and American mores. His superlative cinematography and star cast are well used. After watching "Le Divorce", you can feel a kind of empathy with the French, regardless of their foibles. "Belle-Maman" leaves you with just a failed contempt for his morally bankrupt and clueless protagonists.
