I'm sorry, but this man is not funny. I swear I heard 4-year-olds heard the better jokes than she did. For example, "Dee dee dee" is possibly the worst catch I've ever heard. It doesn't have any creativity at all, and having fun with mentally handicapped people when reaching your own show is incredibly dull on Mencia's part. <br /> <br /> Although everyone compares this fool to Chappelle, they are no match. First, they had many different shows. I think Menica's performance on average only had about 2 short 5 minute sketches between his 10 minute rations about God knowing what. The Chappelles show came more than a sketch comedy, with 2-4 sketches that occupied the entire show. All the chapels did, was a brief summary of each shit before and after each. This is where Mencia fails even more. What would make Mencia think of having a show consisting of the same stand-up comedy about his stand-up specials would be a beneficial idea? Does anyone really want to listen to a little George Lopez who was born years before Mencia, but just went over the point where she died? The snowflake's chance in hell. <br /> <br /> My point is that although most people hate this man for his rascal, I just can't stand him for his imcompetence. Comedy Central was looking for a minority that could mark them as controversial and then left him to follow Chappelles's path. The problem is this man made it very clear that he didn't want to be Chappelle. So he puts his crappy show like a burning train wreck right in the ground. If anyone wants to see a weekly action on the same things every Thursday every week, I'm sure I know so much, I don't know. <br /> <br /> I can't say thank you to Comedy Central. This idiot show was done. Personally, after watching his actions, I don't know how he got his own performance in the first place. There are so many more deserving comics such as Jim Gafigan, Zach Galifinakis, etc. In fact, anyone is better than this fool.
