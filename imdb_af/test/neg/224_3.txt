In 2003, I was amazed by director Antal's Kontroll. His first American project, Vacancy, was less impressive, but a decent start. Armor is his second feature and while the visual signature is recognizable, the film never rises above the level of a B movie. <br /> <br /> This is a pity because the main premise has all the ingredients for turns and the ensemble cast that many quality actors need to deliver. Antal could have made a big movie, but rather go for an action movie. Then he could have shot a cool action movie again, but it doesn't really deliver in that department either. <br /> <br /> What you left is an infinite situation after another, a group of badly-sketched characters bumping and fighting over a sum of money. If you look past the sharp cinematography, throw and the strict music score, you're over with what a below-average direct-to-video with Van Damme or Seagal could have been. <br /> <br /> It was probably the most disappointing movie for me in some time.
