Originally, the Spiders were planned as a four-part series, and it shows. I don't like magazines; They are typically ridiculous, complicated and banal. This one is no exception. In the first part of the Spiders, "The Golden Lake," a wealthy adventurer oblivious to the plans of a gang of criminals - the Spiders - to steal gold from Incas. A foolish love triangle follows, with some Cowboys and Native American action. The sensational and exotic of them didn't entertain me. <br /> <br /> One can really explore themes from this two-part series after Lang's later exalted work. And the movies are better than other magazines I've seen this time, including 'Les Vampires' (1915). In the Spiders, the camera is not so static, and this movie is fast, grateful. The tinting and lighting are also sufficient. None of this is remarkable. It's almost ominous, how now this series looks like Louis Feuillade's series; the criminal gang dressed and behaved like those in 'Les Vampires' - just the names, and to a lesser extent, the situations changed. <br /> <br /> For further comment on the Spiders series, see the web pages for it.
