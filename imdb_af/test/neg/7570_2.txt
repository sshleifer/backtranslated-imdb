It must be one of the most horrendously written films I've ever seen. It's basically a remake of The Beast of 20,000 Fathoms (1953), but done with your standard snake-like puppet monster instead of a sleek Ray Harryhausen creation. Combine the plot of that classic monster movie with the production qualities and acting level of The Creeping Terror and you have an idea of ​​how this movie is. <br /> <br /> The movie is called, though by the original actors (I think the film was originally heard in Italian for those countries, and then released for American version), which just looks strange. .. the sounds, like in a Japanese monster movie, do not fit very well with the performance on the screen, even though the actors' lips are right. <br /> <br /> Poor Ray Milland ... he's definitely a long way off the lost weekend or call M for murder or any of the great movies he was in. Add it to his other sci-fi traps (Panic in the Year Zero, and you can see a one-time good actor who falls into a Boris Karloff syndrome). really do bad horror movies abroad just for work.
