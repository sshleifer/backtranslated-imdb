Technically horrific (with audible "pops" between scenes) and terribly amateurish, "Meat" requires a lot of patience to go through and most viewers will probably turn off. But the dialogue is incredible, and Joe Dallesandro, who exposes his body in almost every scene, also gives a very convincing performance. A Curio, sure, but the more polished "Trash", made two years later, is a definite step forward. I suggest you look at it instead. (* 1/2)
