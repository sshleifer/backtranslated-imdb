I don't really know why so many people like this movie. Maybe it's funny, okay, but it has already destroyed one of the best novels ever written. As the author himself said, this film betrayed the book: not only is the story cut critically to about 1/3, but all the symbols, all the complexity, are all lost in an 80-year-old fantasy / adventure movie for children. . Today, we have bonds, directors, new attention to books. I hope somebody (Tim Burton, Peter Jackson, Hayao Miyazaki ...) will one day lead the REAL Neverending story. A good dead writer, a wonderful book and many literature lovers deserve it.
