First of all, I have to say that I loved Winnie The Poo as a kid and I enjoyed the Tigger movie a lot, though I'm in my 20s. <br /> <br /> But this movie was so bad I was ashamed to be a fan in my youth. <br /> <br /> OK, I know it's a movie for kids and not aimed at people like me, but it's my mind on the movie for other people of my age. <br /> <br /> The biggest downfall in this movie is the heftalump itself, it must be the worst character I've seen in a children's movie (possibly even more annoying than the young child in Monsters Inc.). It has the most annoying voice and sniffing to sing bad things and even more stupid comments. I know Pooh movies aren't exactly high-foreheads, but it was offensive to even a 2-year-old's intelligence! <br /> <br /> Secondly - where was the story? Previous Pooh outings had at least a point in the story. Yes, I can see it is about accepting people who are different in your heart - but it really ended and I felt like I was watching a 5 minute cartoon on kids TV. br /> <br /> I don't have children of my own, but when I do, I plan to show them the quality of children's movies like The Tigger Movie, Toy Story and Nemo (even if they're too childish for me these days I can see how they would be a big appeal to young children). Not so with this terrible attempt at a movie. <br /> <br /> Oh yes and another thing - NOT Eeyore! He must have his own movie!
