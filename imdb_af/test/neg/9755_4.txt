Step Up is a fair dance movie about some kids who get their big show. The movie is average in all ways with a little more for the viewer. A Jock fights external bias to become a dancer with an adult partner and a teacher who sees something special. The acting was good, but the dialogue and direction had little to add to overcome a predictable story. Still, you still feel very good about the outcome of the movie. There were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about dancers who went a little overboard. It is a class B + movie with moderate continuity errors and dialogue accidents. The scenery was good and the characters were true in life. It's worth the watch if you like that kind of movie.
