Dakota incident must be one of the strangest westerns I've ever seen. Not good, but definitely strange. <br /> <br /> A driver-less stagecoach ride in the town of Christian Flats with all passengers killed. It's scheduled to continue, but very few obvious reasons want the Cheyenne on the warpath out there. But Linda Darnell, Regis Toomey, John Lund, Whit Bissell, and Ward Bond each have their reasons to continue. And Dale Robertson, who killed John Doucette in a gunfire to Doucette and shot Homier and killed him in the desert, is so eager to go he is willing to run the team. <br /> <br /> Of course, the Cheyenne attack has the fearless group of passengers if forced into a dry wash for cover. Who will live and who will die is the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Dakota's incident came at the end of Reproduction Images before Herbert J. Yates pulled the plug on his little studio. Western was their specialty, but usually of the kind Roy Rogers made. It would not have been a Rogers product. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's out of faith. The characters are not aimed at any kind of reality. Whit Bissell takes ore samples from his claim, but Robertson discovers it is iron pirates, foolish gold. Toomey is a guitar-playing cynic that is thirsty. Darnell is after a fraudulent manager of her, but really doesn't know what to do if she gets him. Lund is looking for Robertson who committed a crime for which he was raped. He must bring him to life. He needs help for this, but he doesn't. <br /> <br /> But the worst is Ward Bond who is an American senator on his own peace mission to the Cheyenne. In real life, Bond was a legal individual and I'm not sure it wasn't a caricature of what he would consider liberal. He's really the fool's fool, but I think it could make him roll. <br /> <br /> I was trying to get into the Dakota Incident but couldn't. And the end was a bizarre fantasy to say the least. <br /> <br /> Give it three stars for that particular role.
