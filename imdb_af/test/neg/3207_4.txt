I didn't see this movie in years, the last time I did that, at least I was drunk after 5 pence tenant at my local Witherspoon, but even though it was quite awful. this movie is pretty awful compared to other critters movies, the first two were pretty good, 3 were quite crap but miles better than that. The story takes place 53 years after critter's 3, Charlie, the treasure hunter of the previous movies found in a pod in outer space by a crew of some space miner, em, people and aboard. Once on board, the last butter eggs left in the galaxy, which Charlie brought with him from Earth, tore open and we got bitterly aboard the spaceship, an obvious 'Alien' rip and a lot of terrible FX, and you have pretty much keep this movie in a nutshell. only good thing is when we are introduced to UG again (or so we lead to believe) who is now a villain and wants to keep the beef eaters instead of destroying them
