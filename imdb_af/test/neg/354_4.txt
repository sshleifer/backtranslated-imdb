You'll hardly know that MGM has Norma Shearer in THE DIVORCEE a year later that glows with MGM technical know-how. How far they came in one year. CHENEY is a very early talkie. The camera barely moves. Shearer is her usual charming self and Rathbone does well in a romantic role. They are all very careful not to speak clearly and slowly in the microphone source that softens a naturally flowing dramatic scene, but the play is a sturdy and fun warhorse so you can enjoy if your expectations are not too high. Oh yes, the plot involves a ring of high-class jewelers who penetrate into society to prey on their victims. There are a few clever twists in writing and true love conquers all. An Oscar nom for the best script adjustment.
