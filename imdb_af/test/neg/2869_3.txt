I love CKY and Viva La Bam so I couldn't resist it when I saw it at £ 1.99 in Gamestation. This is Bam Magera's debut written film, written by himself and Brandon Dicimaillo, and stars throughout the CKY crew (Ryan Dunn, Raab Himself, Rake Yohn, Jenn Rivell, Don Vito, and so on). Brandon is also in charge of the artistic direction - which is one of the greatest merits of the film - his CKYish in his color style - but also shows progress. <br /> <br /> Basically, it follows (very loosely) Ryan Dunn's break with girl Glauren (played by Jenn). Vilo (played by Bam, who was named after Vilo Valo by any chance?) And Falcone (Bran) plays his best friends causing havoc through several stunts. <br /> <br /> It's a bit like the CKY movies, but with a linear storyline (very basic) and poor acting. The strangest, usually super-charsmatic gang, looks as if life is sucked out of them when they know what they meant to say next. <br /> <br /> The play and script are mostly frightening, but the second Half of the movie is much better than the first (90 minutes is a stretch for the movie though), and there are a number of redeeming Factors such as Tony Hawk's cameo, Dicimaillo's subtotives such as 'The Futurstic Invention Awards' and 'The Diamond Bike', the soundtrack are also very strong (it's not ALL CKy and HIM. Bomfunk MC's feature the movie because of the use of music). In the second half of the film, the feeling of fun is much more real - especially since Don Vito has a rather prominent role in the latter - and he seems to steal every scene he is in. <br /> <br /> The film will appeal to those who love the CKY antics, but only because of the core material and not the fill or story line bullshit. Oh, and someone will tell Bam that skate montages, especially in movies, are sooo 1998. <br /> <br /> The best part of the package on the DVD, however, is not the movie, but the 40 minutes make Van 'doc. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of documentary handling of Raab Homs alcholism and the crew's real feelings toward each other is incredibly open (as usually Bam comes over like a dick, especially over Raab's drink problem and Ryan Dunn comes over as a very nice man. The last ten minutes of the documentary agreement with a friend (who is an irregular CKY member) is trying to kick heroin while staying with the Magera household with the crew - and a caring unitary leg (especially Ape and Ryan ) Really comes across - a spectacular jewel in an otherwise dull DVD. <br /> <br /> For £ 1.99 I am very satisfied. Although I hope Bam from now on stays on the improvised and short sketch.
