Why is Canada able to watch good movies, in every genre, other than action? I caught Dragon Hunt on TV, and it was like a train wreck. I just couldn't change the channel, it's pure stupidity that sowed my will. It is good to say that the IMDb codes threw this monstrosity, never worked again. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, bad writing, bad narration, bad music, bad hair, bad cinematography. It just goes on and on. The movie really has nothing to recommend it. If you are looking for bad action movies to enjoy by laughing, there are a ton of other movies that you don't need to imitate your retinas. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie does not get government funding for finance, otherwise I never pay tax again.
