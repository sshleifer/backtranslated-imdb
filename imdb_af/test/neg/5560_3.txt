It's a silly movie. Like many of these karate movies, it is poorly written, uncomfortable, and sometimes just silly. The action is really not all there and the film in general leaves much to be desired. Everyone here speaks jive, does bad karate and does a very bad job of acting. <br /> <br /> Look for Scatman Crothers in a small role, he's too good for this movie in general. Jim Kelly is good at karate, but he is a terrible actor. Gloria Hendry is really bad. All of them are, there are just so many parts to this movie that makes absolutely no sense. The supposed love / run-away scene with Hendry and Kelly, what was hell? They destroyed the man's guitar for no reason! <br /> <br /> Then there were the mandatory girls on trampolines !!! Now what was it? They were five seconds in the movie, then you never heard from them !!! Then there is the whole racial-charged element of the movie, which is cool and everything, but in this movie it doesn't go anywhere. As I said, it's a laugh once, but don't look it up again.
