I must say I was disappointed with this movie. Although well behaved and directed, the underlying story simply keeps slow. <br /> <br /> Permitted, in another mood, I would have liked it better. I struggled a lot but laughed out loud aloud; and there was actually a sense of tension to discover who won. But unlike another movie that my wife picked up on the same day (one of us never heard before), this one compared. <br /> <br /> If you see a lot of movies, then you see it anyway - it's clearly better than your average price. But if you (like me) have a limited time and just want to watch the best and most entertaining, save it for later. <br /> <br /> [Grade: 7/10]
