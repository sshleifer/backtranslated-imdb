Any movie should have an idea; Simple or more complex, it needs one ... The problem with Fragata, it is once again that when he decides to make a movie, he is so eager to do "everything" he forgets the main detail and as a result Do the characters who behave without justification without proper reasons ... they are simple dolls that go with the movie about the smell of the wind. It's boring and sad to see them appear and disappear as cards are thrown away in a game. Fragata always looks like talent in advertising, is own work ... and it leads you to see what he did ... but eventually there is always a big disappointment. It's not enough to have a movie full of "hot Portuguese's pink magazine stars" ... especially if half can't act, just make them feel funny. Here's my only good point to actor Helder Mendes ... one of the few non-stars ": he tries to establish credibility and in such a messy movie without any direction I give him the credit to try hard. But this movie is worth checking out as a guide on how not to make a movie ... and as Fragata's previous works where bad ... this one is a "masterpiece" get the title AWFUL. In a few words, just look out! It will make you good ... and if you have home-made your family movies ... and always feel bad about your work ... so just spend 30 minutes after this "calling" professional work ... your homemade things will look like like Powerful Hollywood Flicks compare to Black Nula.
