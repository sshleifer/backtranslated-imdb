This movie is horrible, and don't blame Jesus Franco because it's not his fault. <br /> <br /> This movie has been pushed over many years over the years because it got the money to bring a crew and the actors to shoot. How much movie Welles actually shot is not clear, though not all the movie or sequences are here, as several "key" rows, such as Quixote in a cinema, are in the hands of collectors or backers who do not give up them. The movie here is just under two hours and I will be hard to think that it will ever work at any length. I believe, based on several comments made by Welles before his death, that he never really wanted to release the film, but bring it as a personal toy. <br /> <br /> What is here is for the most part beautifully shot, but dramatically dead. Very little happens for the first time other than Quixote and Sancho wandering throughout the countryside. Dof will be a good description of the material. In the second hour, Quixote ends up in modern Spain and in a series not very good rows about everyday life. It is not to say that there are not a few nice moments, the windmill and the chicken sequence are pretty good, but mostly it is a big waste of film and time. <br /> <br /> "Complete" by Jesus Franco, who assisted Welles assistant director on the much better Chimes at midnight, we have a lot of movie fragments compiled as well as possible. Many people have crucified Franco as the reason why the film stinks, but frankly, one cannot make a good movie. One critic went on record because he saw another cut from the movie in the 1970s, which meant Franco made this version on his own and destroyed it. Although it may be true, I have clipped stories of Welles and cut the film many times over the years, as he could never get it right. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible, no matter how you cut it. <br /> <br /> Eventually, I'm going to wonder how well a filmmaker Welles was. Apart from Citizen Kane, almost all of his films were plagued by a lack of budget or interference with so we have the excuse that many of his films would have been "better than just ...". How do we know this? How can we know? Welles Welles was a man of less talent than we thought, and many of his border films are just not as good, and would never have been. While this is not the place to argue Welles' film history, Don Quixote's surviving material is based on what Welles meant (I think so), a good thing to reconsider how we see the man and his work . <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 for the good order (although 2 out of 10 is probably closer to reality)
