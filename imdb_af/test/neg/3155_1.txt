Barney and friends ... the Dora, the explorer of the 1990s. <br /> <br /> OK, I'll admit it. As a child, Barney was my ultimate hero. I had my barney plush toy and I watched the same barney episodes over and over on videotape. Maybe it's like sugar cover and thoughts. <br /> <br /> But by the time I became 7, I started to hate barney. everyone at school would be Barney, and I went with it (mainly because it was funny) and that's what little boys do. but a few years later I discovered something else about barney that I will never forget. <br /> <br /> A person known on the IMDb as Angel_meiru did an essay for the school, explaining the dangers of barney, and he or she placed it in the message boards. many of the dangers made sense. <br /> <br /> Barney is a dinosaur who comes to life on a school day. He is supposedly educational, or so says Sheryl Leach (Barney's Creator), but really, all I can remember him, teaches me that magic can solve anything that's not true. <br /> <br /> To end this comment, I want to tell you a little story. There was once a young boy who watched a particular episode of barney. One day he was alone when a stranger lured him into his car and drove with him. I don't know the outcome (but it is safe to assume the child died), but why was he kidnapped in the first place? because he was watching the Barney and friends episode titled "A stranger is a friend you haven't met yet." <br /> <br /> 0/10
