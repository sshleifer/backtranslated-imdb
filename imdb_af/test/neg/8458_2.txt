I thought "It was Hollywood" was the worst movie I saw showing clips of horror, sci, crime and drama movies. Of course I haven't seen this beauty yet. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with "Terror in the Aisles"? Four things: <br /> <br /> 1) It assumes that most of the great moments in shock theater history began in the 70's when directors such as John Carpenter and Brian De Palma went along. And what bones are thrown to the true classics (ie the black and white movies), such as Frankenstein, Dracula and The Wolf Man, either appear with or not with Martin or Lewis or Abbott and Costello! br /> <br /> 2) The cuts are mostly short and original from their original location, giving them only an instant shock to the viewer, and for those who are unfamiliar with these movies, it will not make sense at all not, the moment the shark jumps out of the water at Roy Scheider in "Jaws", much is shown to the effect of a siggat. While in the original context, it had power. <br /> <br /> 3) Do we really need Pleasance and Allen in the audience that reminds us that "it's just a movie" or that most violence in the horror movies "are unhappy against women"? So, is it a charge against the filmmakers to add those scenes or movie-goers trampling into the theaters and look at the same kind of feeder time again? Sorry, there are quite a few worms to open for a more deserving movie. <br /> <br /> 4) And most importantly why the movie is so short? It is not as if there were not enough of these movies to use. If they just opened their resources and used every available movie, they could become a "That's Entertainment!" Had - style movie that would be relatively more entertaining. Even from Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing (Cushing was alive, you think) and even better, even Vincent Price would have been more than willing, I'll bet! What a courage that would have come from the audience! <br /> <br /> But no ... all we are left with is a brave little movie pretending to pay tribute to these movies, but all that it does is feel the viewer cheating on less than 90 minutes they could go and watch a real movie. Do not misunderstand me; It was good to see what cuts they showed, but if they could do more with the goods! <br /> <br /> Two stars. Another good idea lay in the roads.
