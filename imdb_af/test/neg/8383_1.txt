This movie is a nightmare! The feeling you feel when you wake up from a nightmare is the same as I got when I watched this movie: "Uff? OK, it ended, what a relief!" I watched pain watching this movie, it was so bad! It's a B-series low-cost movie, that's for sure, but I think it's not an excuse to be so bad! I watched brilliant low cost movies, with nice plots, good production, beautiful acting, and most importantly, some! This one has nothing of it! The plot is hilarious, it almost looks like an "American guide on how to transform old Chinese mythology into a ridiculous teenage movie, with some kids playing with the occult? I don't know if the Chinese story that is in this movie , really is or not, but if it is, the "damage" is even worse! The production is just awful, a normal zero (what are the "special effects"?). There is no voltage. "is a complete failure. The acting is no better; and what about the dialogues? Oh my God! A movie that for several times dialogues just like," I'll pass there later, okay? Is it okay? "OK, okay. OK? OK, okay, day? I'm sure it's not worth a 1/10 score! <br /> <br /> Too bad to be true!
