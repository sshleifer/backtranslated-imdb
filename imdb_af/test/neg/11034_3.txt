What did Rajiv Rai do for himself? Once a hit director of films such as Tridev and Vishwatama, now make one bad movie to another. I was initially excited about the thought that Rajiv Rai had returned to the action genre, but it soon found out. As a Rajiv Rai fan I thought I should give it at least once, but I left after an hour. One reason I left the film so early, so the amount of Paki bashing in the movie, was not in Rai's previous business. <br /> <br /> Many directors tried Paki-Bashing, but I didn't expect it. That from Rajiv Rai Another eclipse was the music. Rajiv Rai's has always had good music. There is only one good song and that is Tere dekh dekh Ladgayan. The performances are not at stake, not even Rai Loyalist Naser-Uddin-Shah. One-time avoidable price of my favorite director.
