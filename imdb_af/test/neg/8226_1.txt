I have no doubt how the movie does NOT catch New Jersey (like Zach, I'm from there). Fine. Whatever. I lived there long enough for WAY. I don't need to see a movie capturing the Garden State. <br /> <br /> What I qualified about is how bad this movie is. Let's make it easy on you. We will use some bullet points. There are probably some spoilers that follow. (Not that you can never predict the movie): <br /> <br /> -The music placement was maddeningly forced and patronizing. Example: Big: "What are you listening to?" Sam: "The Shins. Ever heard of them?" "None." "Listen to this song - it will change your life!" And then they are going to play the Shins song that was in a McDonalds commercial. (Don't love when the characters in a movie tell you blatantly - the viewer - how to respond to something? I love it! "chuckle", "Say" aaaaaw "" "cry" "feel inspired" etc.) <br /> <br /> The screens were so bad. SO Cliché. SO MELODRAMATIC. Example: The whole movie. But no, really, example: They are in the straight quarry at the ark. Big up - in the pouring rain (oh he is so corrupted!) - on top of a lot of heavy machinery and SCREAMS! Oh, how move! But wait! Here comes Sam and his buddy (the annoying drug addict), and they are all screaming !! BUT WAIT !!!! OH MY GOD !!!! Here it comes! They kiss !!! LONG, DEEP !!!! IN THE RAIN !!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> The dialogue was so bad. SO Cliché. SO MELODRAMATIC. Example. They leave the ark and Sam says something like, "Hey. Congratulations on exploring the infinite abyss." And the man says back, "you too." Oh ... Oh me! I never realized ... could it be? Oh my God this is! Big's life is like ... ohmigod ... A INFINITE ABYSS !!!! Another example: Big and Sam at the airport. Sam says something like, "Is it goodbye?" Not enough for you? OK, Largeman says something like, "It's not a period at the end of the sentence ... it's an ellipse." And guess what happens if he tries to get off the highway and go back to his life in LA. You know what? Don't guess. It's a waste of your time. <br /> <br /> This is a Grade Z West Anderson rip-off movie. When it's not melodramatic and cliché, the movie spends many times with mal-kooky-off-kilter characters. Hey, Sam's brother ... thank you, Zach Braff, because he included him because it made the movie so much more texture. Anderson also rounds off the dialogue. Scene: Sam and Largeman are in a bar. In walking friends, "Vagina!" says one of them. Then they see him with Sam, so one of the friends says, "Sorry, I said vagina." And Sam says, "That's right." <br /> <br /> Inventive cinematography that is not inventive but useless and annoying. Give me a break with the speed of the movie. Again Wes Anderson does it effectively in his movies. And it was well done in "Donnie Darko." But really, it was pointless. Wow. A crazy party where people take X and sniff cocks. Better roll out all the tricks! <br /> <br /> - You can count the good moments on one side (even if you miss fingers). It even makes it WORSE. The delayed quarterback thing ... well, it was good! The little thing he (bigman) says when they enter the quarry (something about huffing turpentine) ... it was good! Oh, wait, it's about it. <br /> <br /> You know, Zach Braff is, I think, always a little too cute. But he's nice. But man, it's forced, pretentious, melodramatic (did you still get it?), Excessive, Excessive. This movie is terrible. Apparently, I am surpassed as this waste of time is currently 8.0. <br /> <br /> But if you are looking for something really attractive and subtle and unique DO. NOT. RENT. IT. MOVIE.
