"The Italian Job" is a caper movie done by the numbers. Riding on the back of each barber's climb, it does not rise to any specific heights and will be a movie footnote by the end of the month. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is that the Italian Job has no imagination at all. I've seen it all before and done better. The play is good, the movies are quite acceptable, but this film absolutely doesn't break new ground. <br /> <br /> Let's mark the clich√©s: <br /> <br /> - "old school" criminal dad figure and his protest <br /> <br /> - another gang member who jealous of protein <br /> <br /> - a double cross <br /> <br /> - just bad guys use guns while bender criminals don't have to be <br /> <br /> - good Criminals always convince the bad guys <br /> <br /> It's about the first fifteen minutes. Everything is so predictable. Even the hoist and caravan scenes, presumably the highlight of the movie, seem pretty common. This is especially true because they appeared in the trailers for the movie, so I already knew what to look for. <br /> <br /> For me, a caper movie only works if it has an element of realism - it may just be maybe it can be subtracted without relying on a deux ex machina or "just because" moments . Parts of "The Italian Job" just throw it out of the window, with computers doing things that computers can't do, the good guys don't hit anyone with them (especially down the stairs) and not one single police car responding to the street not explosions, reckless-run minis or even a low flying helicopter. Must be a slope of a city for these things not to evaluate an answer. <br /> <br /> The play is sensible, with the crew (Seth Green, Jason Stratham and Mos Def) at least having fun watching. Mark Wahlberg is just too smarmy as the "nice old" hero, while Charlize Theron is the only actor who wants to show a sort of series. Donald Sutherland is a class behavior as always and shows Wahlberg's shortcomings every moment they are together. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a nice uninteresting movie. Given the IMDb ratings, it is the girls who really love this movie, which I can understand to some extent, but there is such a better caper film out there - even the weakening of the recent "Ocean's Eleven" The Italian Job ". <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> In conclusion, take a moment to think about what will happen to Norton's character. good guys to cheer for his downfall, especially as it looks long and painful, he didn't deserve it, and he crawled when he was. <br /> <br /> *** END SPOILER ***
