If you are looking for a movie with beautiful shots from Mount Everest, you can enjoy this movie. Just before the mountain views. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler Alert) But if you, like me, believe life is precious and not wasted, this movie will have a bad taste in your mouth. 6 people died, 5 Sherpas and a member of the Japanese party, just as one man could try to hide on Mount Everest. <br /> <br /> The question is raised in the movie about whether the continuation of the expedition meets his personal goal was still the cost in life, and he replies an express "yes". <br /> <br /> The part about skis is in the last 15 minutes. He skis for a short while, then the rest of the road falls until he stops in the snow.
