It's just the same old crap spat of amateur idiots, who has no idea how to make a movie. Maybe that's why it's a straight-to-video movie! <br /> <br /> I guess it's my fault to actually spend money seeing it (one of the worst decisions I've ever made). What a waste. I usually like B-movies, some of them are actually pretty good - but it's just too ridiculous and stupid to be funny. <br /> <br /> The losers who made this litter deserve to be out of business. waste everyone's time and money to make a movie that will not even be on film! These so-called movie makers have absolutely no talent! <br /> <br /> Silly plot, act horribly (especially the drag queens - which sicko would actually find it sexy!), write Lame (if even a script - looks like the kinda bull **** someone has just put on the spot) <br /> <br /> What is great about this movie is its absolute lack of anything well done. <br /> <br /> How much attention to detail will it take to ensure that every frame of a movie will be below any reasonable standards? I don't think it would be possible to deliberately make such a bad movie, and it is unthinkable that sheer misfortune can consistently produce terrible results. <br /> <br /> Anyway, avoid this stink bomb at all costs! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
