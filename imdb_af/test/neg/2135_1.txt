Never before has such a large piece of ugly people come together to make an equally ugly movie. <br /> <br /> Something big and terrible is loose in the waters of the Florida coast. she woke up. Unharmed beer dependent Bob thinks he has caught the thing's "evil voice" on tape. Bob's assistant, the incredibly unattractive and painful skinny Stella, decides to help the help of smart ladies man Peter, an electrician, whose equipment can help them find the mysterious creature. But anyone who sticks their noses too far into the mystery is killed, killed by a baboon who has the hit with a bad perm. What is the horrible secret behind the Sea Killer? <br /> <br /> Ugly scientists have villages, inadvertent policemen and doctors puzzle about the increasing number of bodies. Stella and Peter are out on the beach and characters we don't care about are killed or wasted. The Sea Killer, a weird combination of a octopus, a shark and some great dentures, never really looks so threatening. The conspiracy behind the monster's creation does not make sense. None of the characters are particularly similar, and those who are possible are immediately killed. It's a bad shot, poorly baptized, plot less mess. The whole thing is so dirty and smelly, it made me urge for a hot bath. I had sushiplate scarcer than this movie. Avoid it unless it's the MST3K version.
