I don't see why everyone loves this movie. True, it has good intentions and meaning, but you cannot compensate for such poor writing. Woody Allen is a brilliant filmmaker, but I'm afraid it's just a piece of garbage. It is extremely predictable and the subject is too visible. I'm a great Woody Allan fan and love most of his work, but I can't recommend it.
