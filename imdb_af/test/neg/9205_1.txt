Now, I love bad, old ski movie movies as much as most people. And I understand that a budget is a budget. That said, Planet of the Dinosaurs can get as bad as a bad movie. The thing has no actors, and only one attractive woman who kills them two minutes after the swim. There are literally no redeeming properties in this stack of wasted celluloid. The only one not wasted was paper ... the script should not have been more than four pages long. Certainly no one really WROTE dialogue this useless. I'm constantly surprised that such movies were ever made, much less released. I'm just glad I didn't pay to see this waste of time. It's 75 minutes of my life, I'll never come back.
