What can you say about a movie whose funniest episode sees a fat man wrestling a hose? The acting, especially that of chief Jerry O'Connel, is embarrassing. The dialogue is so confronted and unsuitable, it at least makes you. The controlling idea is actually not a bad one for this genre, but somehow the director manages the least. I rate it a 2 out of 10.
