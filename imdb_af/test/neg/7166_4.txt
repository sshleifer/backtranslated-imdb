I saw some pieces of it on TV, and when a friend recommended it, I started looking, although there seems to be no place in the area. I eventually found it in an antique store and couldn't wait to see it. Oh, I saw it a few years earlier and really enjoyed it. I was surprised that this movie was only 80 or so minutes long and I think that's what the plot and story are missing. The plot sounds really good as a good one, both on the trailer and the movie's commentary: a teenager, Angus (Jesse Bradford) and his newly-found lead runner. Yellow is on an island on a boat on a boat on a boat with his father (Bruce Davison). Together, they can survive the desert and wait to be found and saved. Yet, what is never mentioned is that everything is shortened and that the events of the plot are rushed. There is a potential love affair between Angus and Sara, but they are never shown together for a moment. Yellow is an uncomfortable dog whose parents are reluctant to keep, but in a few days it seems he has appreciated enough to go to a boat. The scene of the mother (Mimi Rogers) who is vague, who is the death of the younger son (Joel Palmer), does not go anywhere. At a short time we learn that 9 days have been spent on the island, then it is suddenly 14, then 19. Of all the animals a castaway can be exposed in nature. Only one species - a wolf - attacks them. Why couldn't anything else be a problem instead of having the same kind of animal - maybe even the same - twice strike? There are few views on how Angus prepares food, except when he discovers fruits and roots, and when he burns a rocky rat. If he knows so much about survival skills, why aren't there scenes with it? The one thing that made me empty was why the dog didn't have much part. When he is saved and the dog is left on the island, there is no scene showing how he survives without the help of a man. I wish I had opened it more when I looked at it, but I enjoyed it. The acting was good, and the score was enjoyable. Although I wondered why the father looks so much older than his family, and why he and the lead search and rescue leader share names. This is a good movie for kids, but although starring 14, no one will be interested in more than 10.
