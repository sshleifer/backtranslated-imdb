This movie is terrific of his direction "Julian Grant", and his incompetent head, Steve Guttenberg, who made a firm effort to win a game for Bruce Willis! The writing is reckless Hollywood action thriller; Sean Bean - one of my favorites - David Fraser, and Kim Coates give a decent performance. The movie is definitely below average. 3 out of 10! I wonder what Hollywood studios thought, actually going, to poor director like Grant. And I want to say to Sean Bean, "What do you think, even if you're considering taking part in a movie like this, after such a big movie like GoldenEye, Ronin and Patriot Games!
