Two-page boys working on a radio network are trying to solve murders to play in black face between shifts. Jack Moran and Sidney Miller star in this wangennit from 1945. Very fast talking, everyone shouts and the two-page boys call police detective "Marty" (played by Ralph Sanford). It is a true short of 59 minutes, and it has the feeling of being adapted to a play, as it mostly occurs in a radio station soundtrack. We don't really care about any of the characters, it's probably why it's hardly ever shown. No big problem. It was Phil Karlson's second film director. We don't get any clues about who can break people down, so we're just some kind of police detective and page boys, as they all try to solve the puzzle first. I will no longer say that I should not give a treat.
