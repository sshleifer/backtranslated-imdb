"Menace" is not funny. It's trying hard - too hard. but rarely bring a smile. There is no acting, just overpowered. One of the main characters carries the whole movie a stupid grim on his face. No doubt, as the less talented Wayans brothers die, the film wrote and produced, they were totally blind to their lack of talent. <br /> <br /> Menace consists of a series of unfunny, one joke sketch. The punchline can be seen a mile down, but you have to wait until it unfolds. No zippy one-liners or snappy dialogue here. Just one scene after another build up to the joke. The jokes themselves are young. Loc Dog (the one with the perma-grimace) speaks to a beautiful woman - but then she has ... bad breath and then she picks up her nose and then waits for it (remember you should always w-a-i-t) she sails! How funny is that? Ten-year-old boys can find it funny because they haven't heard the jokes so many times before. Alternatively, if you like watching movies drunk or stoned, you will be able to follow it and it can even be amusing. The challenge will be drunk enough to reduce your mental state to the level of the movie without going out.
