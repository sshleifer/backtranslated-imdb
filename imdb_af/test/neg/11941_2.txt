Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhart star in a "romantic" drama about a continuous chef played by Zeta-Jones, who eventually carries her cousin when her sister is killed in a car accident. While out of family care, she was replaced by Eckhart. <br /> <br /> Independent maudlin storytelling without clues (she's a dead fish and he's good but not much). When I see this, I wondered why anyone would like to see it because Zeta-Jones's character is so unlikely. Come on, she's so obsessed with cooking and to be the best she does, cook for her therapist or talk about food. Ugh. I won't use any of the many word spellings in mind. I couldn't finish it.
