I usually do not write reviews, in fact I never write reviews. This movie was so horrible that it actually inspired me to start. Virtual Sexuality seeks to be a light-hearted and fiery teenage comedy about the ordinary bumps; virginity, boys, etc. apart from the main character apparently in her perfect son she created using a machine at a technology fair. <br /> <br /> Sounds interesting? Well, it's not. The play is the most half-hearted and horrible thing I've ever seen. The unfortunate thing is that they are really supportive of scripts and movies, which probably explains why I've never seen them in a memorable production. I didn't bother to teach the actors' names or characters. The charge lady doesn't surprise or charm you and so you don't care for her. The front lady's male friend does not give any sympathy, even when the writing screams aloud for you to pity him. The only rise he will get from you is one of extreme rage and sudden violence. The only half decent actor was the blonde front man, who in spite of his miserable poor role really gave everything in his ability. It wasn't much in the light of such a terrible piece of work. I won't even talk about the acting horror that the bad guys of the plot are. But then again, what plot? <br /> <br /> I watched this movie unfold as I had no idea how anyone would write the folly of the script, never produce, act and direct. I can only wonder. The only reason my companion and I remained such a defective example of film was the unbelieving laugh that we could get out of as cohesion, logic, class, and even impotent storyline within half an hour in the movie . I have absolutely no idea why anyone wanted to violate the film industry by making it known to the public. It's a joke of a movie and is best to collect the dust in warehouses for the rest of eternity. 1/2 out of 10. If so.
