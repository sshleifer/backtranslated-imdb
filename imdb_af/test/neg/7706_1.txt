So many of these kinds of movies from these days. This zombie flick falls into the great "cheese" category as opposed to the much more polished dawn of the dead, and the day of death. In all fairness, these two movies were great studio releases with huge budgets behind them. But they were also good movies. A low budget movie can still be good if they just stop accepting and using the worst scripts. Whoever wrote this movie had to be drunk all the time. <br /> <br /> This movie had such special effects and a very uneven plot line. The one big difference from other movies of its kind is the time it takes to turn people into zombies. In this one, it only takes seconds to die and then change into a zombie. But with ease, this "infection" spreads you can kill zombie blood over you and even the risk of infection, and believe me the people in this one are covered in blood. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I had was that our 2 main stars were at times dozens of zombies and didn't get a bit. When everyone else changes incredibly fast into zombies, these 2 are swam by zombies when they were even unarmed and could get out of it without a problem. Our hot chick star even survived a missile strike on the building she was in. I laughed at that point. Untitled, with 10 zombies on her and a missile, does the building manage to get out without a scratch? OK, sure. <br /> <br /> Of course, those who advised these people on how to act special powers never spent time in the army. They first had to watch a movie like Blackhawk to at least get an idea of ​​how they act in combat situations. <br /> <br /> One soldier was a fat overweight SPECIAL FORCES private. LOL it was a good one. Another thought the zombies were survivors and even put his weapon at one point. These guys are there to fight zombies and they were like the soldiers of the movie Stripes. Special Forces, fun ... Then they came to the point where they tried to explain the zombie girl in the rubber room and the whole thing became very confusing. The explanation is hidden and does not even follow the first movie. It makes no sense. <br /> <br /> The only thing I wanted was the Anti Bush jokes. The military lady said at the beginning they had found the Vice-President's order to the president and in the end it was the vice-president of an "unknown place" who gave the orders. This was the best part of the movie for me.
