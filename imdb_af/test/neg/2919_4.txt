Although it is not a classic comedy, it is a good movie to see if you catch it on a rainy Saturday morning while not much more. <br /> <br /> Harold Lloyd plays Ezekiel Cobb, an American who comes home after rising in China where his father was a missionary. He came from China to find an American woman and plans to return to China to continue his father's work. Cobb is unwittingly appointed to run for mayor of his corrupt hometown when the existing political machine controlling the town realizes that he would make a perfect patsy to run against the current mayor, who is also the head of the town's underworld . They see the stumps, stumbling blocks, Cobb has no chance of winning. therefore the current mayor continues the town and runs his schemes that make them rich. <br /> <br /> Lloyd doesn't do the physical comedy here as he did in his silent movies. He did a convincing portrayal of Cobb with a reserved valuable dignity was good from everyone involved and the story and writing were also very good. <br /> <br /> In 1934, the film becomes quite racist when it comes to the Chinese language and it also has a typical black character era, but these stereotypes are not nearly as much as I have seen from other movies. <br /> <br /> Although not close to Lloyd's best movie, this movie is entertaining and Lloyd is very good as Cobb You won't be blown away by this movie, but it may be enough to interest you in Lloyd to emphasize and you want to see more of his work.
