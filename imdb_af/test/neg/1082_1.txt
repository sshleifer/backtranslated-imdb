Well, how to start? I saw the Italian Job for the first time a few years ago and visited a rental shop. I couldn't quite remember why I had a bad feeling about it. Now I do. <br /> <br /> After I voted for the ratings for this movie, I saw the statistics. Apparently, this movie makes the most of 18 girls. No wonder. They didn't pay enough for Charlize to flash, and I think some magazines have rated Mark Wahlberg's abs "AWESOME". <br /> <br /> Unlike this, this film is completely predictable, the actors are mostly B-stars forever. And even the good people are being abused, the film is filled with obvious product placement and suggests: it is able to repeat itself without making a successor! The first 15 minutes are the best part of the movie and it's all down the mountain and as soon as they have figured it out, they decided to use the best hour again to repeat their golden hoist. All in all, a lot of noise about nothing. <br /> <br /> I think Charlize Theron is good and Ed Norton can be more like he was before. Apart from Donald Sutherland's "look, I'm here too" appearing in the beginning, I would say this movie should be a "pass if you are above 18".
