There had to be lots of background information left out of the movie. In fact, in the film, Lizzy's girlfriend didn't even appear depressed. She just looked like a girl who was out of control when she finally came to school, mainly drinking drugs and alcohol. It was her problem, not mental illness. Sure, she had emotional problems because her father was gone and she barely saw him, and her mother looked a little out there. But the way she treated Noah and Ruby was just mean and I didn't think because of depression. She was very much needed, which Rafe chased away, but she was so because of her father. <br /> <br /> But I think the main reason this movie never got a theater release is that it's not enough with the plot. and the story is not well written. <br /> <br /> FINAL HIDDEN: Truth, I'll only recommend it if you're interested in seeing Ricci's first nude scene. Otherwise it is not very interesting.
