OK, I've seen more than 100 Troma movies, and some of them are pretty bad. "Sizzle Beach U.S.A." was horrible and "I was a teen TV terrorist" was incompatible, but it is the WORST FILM IN THE THREE LIBRARY! <br /> <br /> A lot of women are being held and tortured in a prison while trying to escape. <br /> <br /> It's really awful. Even if exploitation movies go. Doris Wishman and Hershall Gordon Lewis will probably kill the director if they have seen this poor excuse for a cult film. Avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br />
