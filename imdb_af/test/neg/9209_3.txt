The movie opens with Charlie (Jeff Daniels), a businessman who only completes his lunch in a neighborhood deli. It seems that he doesn't have enough cash to cover the check. Instead of reaching his plastic, he looks briefly to see if the coast is clear and comes out of ducks without paying. Unknown to Charlie, "Lulu" (Melanie Griffith) saw him from the other side of the deli. <br /> <br /> "Lulu" was devised for the cool back in the 1980s with a dark-leaf-your cut. She followed him to let him know that she saw what he had done. He tries to deny it but cannot escape her accusation. Thinking about it, Charlie is surprised when "Lulu" says she's not working for the deli and offers him a ride back to work. <br /> <br /> If they go in the opposite direction, they start cavorting over the Middle Atlantic coast. <br /> <br /> We are supposed to be so thoroughly modern. "Lulu" puts Charlie straight into humiliating situations. It's good if the two dedicated adults get a little kinky in a motel room, but scare them when paying out the check at a family-style restaurant. Stealing labor from hard-working people is not my idea of ​​'wildlife'. Charlie is a while. <br /> <br /> "Lulu" is a payday jerk. She passed Charlie as her husband. First, to her mother (who tolerates the charade tolerably) and then to her convenient timely 10-year-old high school reunion (an event later used by another too-cool-for-her-own movie "Grosse Pointe") white "). <br /> <br /> The "marriage" comes as a surprise to Lulu's real husband (Ray Liotta), who was recently released from prison for armed robbery. Ray gives the two a welcome turnout and shows them how nasty crime really is. <br /> <br /> I can't add irony by writing that I first looked at it by sneaking into the movie. No, I'm not doing that. I tied it to cable television and made sure I saw it strictly in the privacy of my own home. <br /> <br /> So I thought why I pasted it if I didn't like it and came to the conclusion that 20 years ago I was on a reggae kick and the soundtrack of "Something Wild" prominent feature of reggae. The closing credits begin with the dissertation of Sister Carol who performs her version of "Wild Thing".
