If you've never read the classic science fiction novel, this mini-series is based, but it can actually be good. Unfortunately, if you're a fan of the book, you'll probably not be able to watch more than the first hour or two. All the political plot is taken from the movie, the main scenes from the book have been pulled out, character motivation is completely changed, and words from the wrong characters' mouth. Where in the novel Paul Atredies was a teenage boy with an incredible political skill and a good understanding of the way the world worked, in this movie he is hot and frustrated. Avoid this movie at all costs.
