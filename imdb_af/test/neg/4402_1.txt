It's like a school video project and a propaganda movie that sleeps the whole class as well as the teacher. <br /> <br /> Better boring long silence (yes, quiet) strings of unrelated video clips. <Br /> <br /> Instead of this movie, the paint looks dry or the grass grows - it would be more interesting if you didn't see that Arabs are malicious for everyone around them. <br /> <br /> Sulieman (the Director) must be embarrassed by this lame waste of film. <br /> <br /> It deserves one for movie quality, zero for the ridiculous propaganda message and a negative number for the writing (or lack thereof).
