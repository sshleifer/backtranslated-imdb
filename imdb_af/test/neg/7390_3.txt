"The King is alive" is a flawed and confronted mess of a movie coming down as a self-explanatory author's excuse to transport a bunch of actors to a God-Lost Namibian desert where he can mainly dogma-domo and movie play that is self-understood. stupid, overwhelming drama with extreme disregard for the real forces of human nature, market appeal, common sense and even good art. In other words, it's a dumbassed flick and if you don't believe it, your fine is watched. Only for movie heads, critics, dilettantes and the like. (D)
