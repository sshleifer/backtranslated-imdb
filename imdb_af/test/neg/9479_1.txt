This movie sucks so badly. It's funny to see how a poor story has it, where two pea-brained American twins who know nothing outside their school can come to another continent and do unimaginable things there. It's just as stupid and so bizarre. How can they just get two French guys, beat them and end up kissing, do they not kiss them? More realistically, the guys would have to take them away and rape them, which could easily happen in such a situation. What the little they make the French president is drinking 'bad water', it was just lame. I don't think he would have been happy in real life. Everything worked out for the girls too easily, and they could have been in real trouble in the movie many times, if it actually portrayed real life. <br /> <br /> My rating: 0/10
