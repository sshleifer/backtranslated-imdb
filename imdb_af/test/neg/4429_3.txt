I watched part of the first part of this movie, and little bits of other parts. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think this movie is really worth watching. The strange characters and events attract your attention and are quite interesting, but there are also bad things and some brutal things. The magical and mythical side of it turned me off, and for most Christians this movie would not be very suitable or worth looking at.
