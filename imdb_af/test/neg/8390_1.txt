Unless you want to be bored half bored. I've never been a fan of Gus Van Sant and as part of what previous posters described as the new youth generation, I was very disappointed and slightly angry at the stereotypical portrayal of the characters in the movie, especially because they were with the rope. used was the film's ridiculous story that pretty much enforces the viewing masses that reject skateboarders socially and must be convicted of crimes. As a skater, I watch a lot of skate films and the filming during the skate scenes, which is of course a big part of the plot, is the main character of a skateboarder, was horrible and Bourne identity player to have a horrible effect. This movie is just full of ridiculous stereotypes, as shown by the 'emo' soundtrack, which only adds to the media myth that all skateboarders are white rockers. Usually just a very bad movie.
