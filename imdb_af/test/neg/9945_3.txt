I heard a lot about the original camera work and direction in this movie. I thought both were a mess <br /> <br /> also some really horrible acting. the main 'heroine' in the movie is annoying and it is absolutely no use to contribute in any situation. everything she does or says is stupid and she mostly seems to abandon people. if she could fight, i could forgive her <br /> <br /> All the women in this movie are generally stereotypical "broads" that a man needs to save them. and all the men in this movie are muscular dull who are unable to save anyone <br /> <br /> it is a poor film and I encourage you to avoid it. look something like "the sword of punishment" instead, I hear she much better than this confusing mess of a movie.
