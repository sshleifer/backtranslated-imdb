For a country that has produced some of the world's best playwrights and has such a rich musical heritage, it was always a source of confusion for me, why so much of Ireland's homemade theater was so terrible. Perhaps because those who are talented in the Irish cinema have quickly abandoned their own country for career in Britain or America (Colin Farrell is a recent case) and that the really successful Irish directors have continued working in Ireland and with Irish subjects, they made films with international money and an eye on the international market. I especially think of Jim Sheridan and Neil Jordan who alternate between films with an Irish environment and projects filmed overseas. <br /> <br /> Middletown, however, is a lot of Irish film, even though two of its lead players are English. It is definitely made good of its kind and could have tended to say that Irish movies aren't really good. (Paddy Breathnach's "I Went Down", written by brilliant young playwright Conor McPherson, is an important exception). Unfortunately, this story of fundamentalism in a fictitious Irish town, presumably in Northern Ireland, has been judged by the accent (Mid-Ulster Bible-Belt, if you ask me) and presumably in the recent past (the fifties of the sixties?) , is so top-notch that it's really ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the movie rings is true and you can't help feeling, it's writer, Daragh Carville, is heavily influenced by Flannery O'Connor and the whole thing could make more sense , it was in the American bible chord and not in Ireland where even the most extreme Protestant fundamentalists were never as nice as this. It's all meant to be grimy in a big guignol and that's definitely, though I was more likely to giggle than Frisson's right-handed Reverand Matthew Macfayden's antics. He has the Ulster accent from the claw and there is nothing wrong with his acting or indeed that of Daniel Mays as his brother, Gerard McSorley as his father or Eva Birthistle as Mays's wife, but the writing is so terribly derived that good acting nothing can do. to save the movie. So rather than a step on the ladder for Irish theater "Middletown", I'm scared, just another nail in his coffin.
