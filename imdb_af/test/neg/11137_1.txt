Of course it was the worst movie ever made ... ketchup was the lead in this movie and would be the only nominee for an award. The plot, actors and everything related to this farce was absolutely horrible and ridiculous. I could have made a better horror movie in my backyard within two hours, with a hand-held camera using grass-covered dummies as the actors, at least the acting would have been better! Don't waste your time or money on this one ... it's extremely cheese and awful !!
