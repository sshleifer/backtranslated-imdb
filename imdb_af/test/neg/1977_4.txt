I give this movie a 4 because I am a strong fan of the video game series. the graphics and animation are excellent and it is nice to see the whole gang in CG form. Sephiroth is quite cool. <br /> <br /> Now the reasons why it only has 4, the characters feel like wood boards with some of the worst voice play I've ever seen (I've watched an epic movie) <br /> < br /> The movie looks just like clouds so oriented that it even makes the fans with this cloud and the cloud shy. Clouds mentioned so much that it shows you that you don't want to see him in this movie <br /> <br /> The villains have awarded the worst villains ever (I was more afraid of the wicked witch of the west) . <br /> <br /> All the other characters in this movie are simply put in the movie for a wink to the fans and don't take it further than the <br /> <br /> wtf's with the chilly chally? ?? <br /> Summary: Waited 9 years for this movie and that's what I get a huge useless and boring cut scene I beg the head of the square cenix the man responsible for this fire every copy of the film and any one involved and a new movie of the ashes (it would be nice to make the movie live and based on the original game)
