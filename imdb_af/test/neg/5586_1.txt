I hired this movie for $ 5 and felt sorry I did it ... I won't give a 5c for it if I kneel. This is the worse movie ever ... None of the filming stations were in former Yugoslavia, map at the beginning what the ...? English actors are trying to speak crockery, eg. As if they were Serbs, they did very badly. My first language is Serbian and I couldn't understand what they were mumbling about. They drove a big jeep in a country where 3 sides (Croats, Serbs and Muslims) are in war and they write this peace 4 Sarajevo ??? Ha, ha, how stupid it was ... Don't know why English dull films about war like this one ... or even if they do, they blame Serbs for everything, when there are also two sides in a war was. And we all know that they also kill, not just sit and pretend to be innocent, so they must at least show the whole truth. This movie also includes Harrison's flowers, behind one-day lines, The hunting party and few others were totally bullshit and this is proven, eg. The hunting party was the biggest loser in 2007/08 spending 20 mil 4 and they earned 800 000 ha, ha, what a crap ... The truth will come sooner or later. to be Serbian !!!
