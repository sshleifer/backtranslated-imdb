Good action scenes, but the movie is sown with a slow, winding story, almost non-existent dialogue that leads to minimal character development and a serious horrible storyline. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that the storyline doesn't make sense? But in the defense, the action scenes were impressive enough, even if they let your head scratch over why they just happened. <br /> <br /> There is not much more to say about the movie. It's a smooth, senseless action adventure that doesn't make sense at all. It's like watching a worse version of the Matrix and hitting all the storyline and dialogue.
