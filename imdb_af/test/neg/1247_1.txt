I rented this movie and hope it will provide good entertainment and some cool poker knowledge or stories. What I got was a documentary look at an average guy life that was really good on cards. Do I want to see the romance with his wife? NO Do I want to see everything going on in this man's life except poker? NO. Well, that's what you get with this movie. The acting is good for such a low budget piece crap. The film never tries to break the shape or do something original. It just sleeps through the writing. The end is disappointing and never really looks like Ungar. Instead, it focuses on what was already obvious. He was an average-sized card player, unlike any other average Joe in Vegas. The movie focuses on the aspects of his extraordinary UN life, rather than the extraordinary. The poker scenes throughout the film add up to about 4 minutes of recording. Ungar's achievements to win the WSOP 3 times look like life. A 10-year-old can do a better job managing this movie. Or maybe the writing was a bit of a crap from the beginning that condemned this joke of a movie. <br /> <br /> If you're a movie about gambling show Rounders. It has at least style.
