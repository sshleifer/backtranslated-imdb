This movie was crap. The writing is so full of holes; I can't see how the producers agreed to finance it. <br /> <br /> We are never given an explanation of ANYONE. The acting is terrible. The plot sucks. This movie is of course written for the 8 and under. <br /> <br /> I have to say, why are high school classes only 2 minutes long? Teacher walks in, finds a frog in the desk, or draws on the board, and 30 seconds later, the bell rings, the class is over. The children didn't even open their books. Can we have at least some continuity? <br /> <br /> The dialogue. Milo Jeter is the herincarnated, aborted fetus, zombie thing. Do we really need the line: "This is Dr. Jeter's office. Dr. Jeter, Milo's father. " Thanks for the hint; I could never assemble it myself. It never gets better. <br /> <br /> Why does Milo speak like he does, even in the beginning? Was Milo ever really? Or was he never really, just always what he is now? And if that were always the case, why did the unexplained "accident" have Milo? <br /> <br /> Besides "What is Milo?", what are all the unsolved items? We see all these contractions in his father's medical office and are never given an explanation of what they are or what they have to do with the story. What are the injections for? What about the aquarium contraption? Of course they are not needed. (See the movie, it will make sense). And what does this medication do to anyone? Apparently nothing, because it has no effect on the main actress. <br /> <br /> This movie is a very, very bad rip off of all the other slasher movies. It's a very frightening Friday the 13th / Halloween demolition by a 10-year-old writer. It's not cheese enough to laugh, it's just an incredibly frustrating drill.
