Only one word can describe MR MAGOO slapstick. Unfortunately, it's not an AIRPLANE. Look can decide, and that's exactly what MR MAGOO does. Based on the old cartoon, Leslie Nielson Magoo, a bumbling near the blind man who stumbles on a few jewels, plays. Now he has to hunt them using ... blindness basically. And that's all this movie is playing. The blindness of MR MAGOO. Now maybe if they had funny jokes about this, but pretty much, it's just one of those "dumb dumb smiles on your face, because you're ashamed to admit you're paid to watch these" movies. <br /> <br /> But MR MAGOO is not as bad as it was. It has at least some funny jokes, and it's good family fun. (Nielson tried to make a "NAKED GUN" for families in MAGOO, but it's not that close). So see it once, you may hate it, you can also love it. I personally did not hate it, but I certainly did not like it, or even assessed "okay". 2/5 stars for MR MAGOO- <br /> <br /> JOHN ULMER
