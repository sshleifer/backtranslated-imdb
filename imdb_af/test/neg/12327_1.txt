Audrey, I know you really love your husband Ted's memory, but PLEASE, do his legacy justice and consider his wishes. Dr. Seuss refused to license his characters for a very good reason during his lifetime. We beg to please stop his stories, images, fantasies and characters. They are disrupted by the powers of Hollywood and Broadway. The children of tomorrow will be stuck with these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will pollute the loving warmth and innocence of his books forever. <br /> <br /> It is indeed your property to do with whatever you want. I just wish you would listen to the advice of others for a while. Save what is left of dr. Seuss. Thank you.
