Lord protector is a kid, but for whose children? Obviously it was shot for television or STV. KRULL has several stock characters - a wizard, an assassin, a fighter, a scientist, on the trail of something or other to defeat the Dark Forces to become theirs. planet. Poorly written, performed and staged in available California places such as municipal parks and a ranch, HERE PROTECTOR has nothing to recommend it, not even a time warmer. Jay Underwood is the only "name" factor, and most people, especially the intended audience of five-year-olds, will probably not remember him from such an old Disney trip as non-human. A No-name actor who plays a wizard in a poor passport at least plays it with a tongue planted in the cheek, while people act around him as if they were in a dinner theater production by KING LEAR is. At least I was hoping for decent action or special effects. Unfortunately, the action ranges are pathetic and the few special effects are the old-fashioned comic strips we saw in the fantasy fashions of the 1950s and 1960s, such as Bert Gordon's THE MAGIC SWORD. The filmmakers have planned a successor who never came graciously. Often such inexpensive Hollywood back-end productions use a combination of legit and porn actors. I occupied myself during the movie's seemingly unlimited run, and tried to figure out what was in this one. I didn't have much luck.
