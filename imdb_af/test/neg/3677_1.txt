Wow .. where do I start I rented this movie because it sounded like something I'd be interested to watch. With a name like Val Kilmer in the movie, I thought how bad it could be? It must be the worst movie I've ever seen with such a great name attached to it. I wondered why it slipped through the cracks and I never remember anything about it when it first came out. It starts pretty well, and is somewhat reminiscent of the intro order in the bourne identity, but after the initial 30 minutes or so it goes from bad to worse and then takes it into WTF country. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and don't rent or buy unless you're a masochist or looking to see every Val Kilmer movie there. There are many more titles out there that will earn you more time. This movie (if you can call it) is a bona fide waste of time. I want me back 82 minutes.
