Some people thought it was funny because they loved the political issues discussed in this piece. However, I am so tired of the state of the two-party system in our country that I cannot propaganda because of her. I was hoping for an abomination but have a "cute" zombies and biased bulk. I'm watching my horror movies scared. It didn't even try to be scary. This also does not have the fame of Romero in his political / cultural satire in his films ... it was a blatant, imaginative story that was hard for me to stomach (for the wrong reasons). On the shining side, if you hate Bush ... you'll like it (I don't reject hate or Bush with this statement)
