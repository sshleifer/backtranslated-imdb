Actually, I was pretty surprised to find out that a movie based on the Far Cry game was created. The story here is not something I would consider to be a strong point in the game universe. No worries, but as in the typical Boll mode, the story in the movie has very little to do with the game on which it is based. Now I understand that certain freedoms need to be taken to make a transfer of one form of media to another, but it seems he is not just trying to make a connection. Not only that, but the acting and action sequences are so wholesome, it almost makes you feel that the whole project was one big joke. It has been said a million times before, but why could anyone no longer add up talented video rights to create a movie ????
