It just happens that IVAN THE TERRIBLE, PARTS I and II both had entries in the 50 Key Movies book by Harry Medved. Now, I think they're claiming to be one of the worst movies, is an overstatement, though they are still both pretty poor movies, especially the first one, as it is more eye-catching and googly eyed looks than I ever seen it before !! Director Eisenstein and a lot of other people out there thought it made the film "artificial and deep". And since I'm legally healthy, I have to say I hate this first movie !! The second, while still very incomplete, is a major improvement, as the eye scrolling is minimal, although it is overworking and long boring scenes in this movie, as in Part 1, are present! While part 2 looks pretty incomplete and needs at least another hour (especially since it doesn't get into Ivan's insane behavior - like killing his son and heir in anger). Since both parts 1 and 2 were ordered by Stalin to excuse his own murderous rule and glorify him, it is not surprising that Ivan's life story is left very incomplete. Even without all the really terrible behavior of Ivan, apparently the highly evil Stalin still didn't have the movie and would not allow his release during his lifetime. Maybe he didn't allow it, because he was more concerned that people would see what a BIG waste of money and resources was, instead of seeing Stalin as a crazy man like Ivan! <br /> <br /> Incidentally, there was one segment of this boring movie that was just as cool that the movie earned a 4 (without it, a 2) - and that's the scene with Prince Vladimir at the meal ! It's well done and pretty funny in a dark way. And the scene was done in a Russian version of 2-color Technicolor. It is very strange, incidentally, because in the mid-1930s a very improved true color process was developed by Technicolor which no longer makes everything look orange-red and green-blue. So, this movie during the color series looks very much like a quiet or early sound color film. Very strange indeed for the 1940s.
