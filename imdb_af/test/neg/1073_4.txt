I couldn't relate to this movie. I am surprised that people praise it because they are so "realistic". How many people at your school were victims of incest? How many cups of homosexual jocks were there? How many quiet people you never saw have committed suicide? Hmmm. OK, you won't know, though they were. But these are actually explosive problems that many of us never handle. And yet there are so many teenagers with subtle problems that could be investigated. But hey, where's the 'entertainment' in it? <br /> <br /> With regard to the girl who committed suicide - I found it to be exploitative. In fact, I think many people in high school at one stage feel invisible, ignored and unwanted. But what has someone been able to commit suicide on another day of being ignored and unnoticed? The filmmaker decided to make this girl suicide to make the movie more challenging. And the graphic nature of the suicide to make it even more challenging. I didn't buy it as a real scenario. <br /> <br /> And the problems of the other students I didn't quite relate to. Bullying is being investigated, but it has been killed, we all know it goes on and it is really a matter of solution within that person. Does homosexuality include? Pfft, another cliché is rolled out. That's the thing really too many clichés. I guessed the end at the beginning. There was a predictable unpredictability when it made sense. You have all these characters with explosive problems, and one with apparently none. And I thought, what's the point of this character, unless she's the unsuspecting suicide victim? And certainly. <br /> <br /> One thing I will say, and this is the saving grace of the movie, is that it does NOT commit suicide. The suicide is very graphic and heartbreaking to look at. This is a powerful scene (no matter how confronted) and one who discharges suicide as the easy option. But the film isn't really imaginative and doesn't use stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Not bad, but definitely not groundbreaking OR worthy is a 17-minute standing ovation in Cannes ???
