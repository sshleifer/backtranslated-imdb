Seems to me that Joe Estevez spent most of his time under the shadow of his fairly successful brother and appeared in bad movies. Joe spends most of his time dressing in black and looks totally moody. He commands a puffy-convicted angel of death, which you may recognize as the puffy-faced villain from Tango & Cash and as the puffy-faced cyborg of the Future War. Well, Joe and Puffy have a job to do, and some kids from a few kids are driven into a big car by a dumb gal who asks Led Zeppelin. Well, the car crashes and the chase is on. The lucky ones to escape Joe look like Tonya Harding and Rick Springfield. They are being chased around, things are broken and Tonya is taught by her mother as she climbs for a bath. The action winds up in a hospital where we learn that heaven is a lift. In the end some green lights flash, Joe shouts and Puffy disappears without a trace. Wish I can say the same for this movie. Look at the relative safety of MST.
