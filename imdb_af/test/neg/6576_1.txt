I almost find out how the Star Trek fans would like this movie, despite the incredible number of errors. <br /> <br /> To begin with, none of the well-known characters is so full of character. Scotty is portrayed as a rogue thinker rather than the competent engineer he was in the original series. Uhura ... God, I can't even think about what they did to her character. All her dialogue was painful to listen to. McCoy was like a neurotic stepfather to Kirk instead of his trusted friend. Spock ... let's just say that Leonard Nimoy was terribly wasted. He gave a bad dialogue ("I don't believe you understood the gravity of your situation, Captain." Gravity, get it? Come on?) And almost made a buffoon. Kirk ... oh man, don't start me. William Shatner is a hammy actor to start with so he can really lead is to invite disasters we have. <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous outside. To give Spock a brother is a pretty desperate story line and unnecessary soap opera. But hey, let's go with that. The quest for God. Again, a poor plot base. Don't you think so? OK, let's go with that. If the two plural elements mentioned are supposed to be sound, what is the error with the writing? Well, for one thing it recovers too much. For example, the business is again, not working properly. Should we assume that Star Fleet will send a scarcely dysfunctional ship with a skeleton staff in a potentially dangerous situation just because they want James Kirk to handle the situation? If so, you should not place him on a better ship as an adviser. In addition ... the crew is incompetent. Scotty has the ship in pieces (and apparently clumsy enough to bump his head and hit himself in unconsciousness while there is enmity on board!), No one seems to discover the Klingon ship at a critical moment (despite the The fact is that the ears are clearly changing the ship in arms) and the crew seems to be all too familiar with each other. In other words, there is no sense of discipline. If it is the flagship of Star Fleet, then it is a wonder that the Klingons have not already overthrown the Federation. <br /> <br /> Regarding the personal struggle with pain, it was crazy. Lawrence Luckenbill is a skilled actor, but even he couldn't save this turkey. In short, no one could. Of all the people involved, I think Leonard Nimoy is most shy about it. I hope he is anyway. <br /> <br /> Thanks, the original cast didn't throw up on these claws.
