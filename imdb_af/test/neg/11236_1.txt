I had to watch this movie for a movie class, I suffered all the time. I'm not Asian, but still very offensive by this movie. The film's base is racism, overall minorities (Rex Harrison is not even Asian!) Depicted in meticulous fashion. The ban on the film in Thailand illustrates the degree of inaccuracy and subjective portrayal of Asians. In addition, critical attention was given to Anna's biography. Many critics argue that Anna has added many fictitious events to her story to project herself in a good way. Some critics of the film and biography even said that Anna had compiled the whole story. A horrible movie but good for discussing BioPics as a form of meta-narrative fiction rather than a work of non-fiction.
