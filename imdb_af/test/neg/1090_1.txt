Strange in a bad / good way ... this movie is officially the worst "made for TV movie" in my book ... except for the camp value it offers, I give it a 1 in quality and a 10 for the camp value. Suggestions: Look with friends, champagne and many popcorn ... you'll be throwing on the screen! Prefer friends who love Chris Noth from his 'Sex in the City Days' ... this movie is very funny. It's definitely the lowest point in the careers of all cast members ... honestly, I don't know how they control the laugh as the lines are delivered! Daniel J. Travanti is absolutely pathetic. Everyone participated in the school of excessive acting; and poor Joan Van Ark, I believe she was the only one of the absurd theater, serious ... she was credited as a producer. Her "Mommy" teams and bad plastic surgery are play theaters. This movie also crosses the oh so delicate line of social inaccuracy as they enter a mentally challenged character into the plot. This is an obscure movie that appears on Lifetime as {With Harmful Intent} .... did anyone else have the pleasure?
