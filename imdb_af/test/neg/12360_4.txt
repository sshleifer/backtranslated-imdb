The limited view of nature was the only saving grace for an otherwise unpredictable and boring movie. The play was absurd, which I blame on the screenplay and script. Nicole Eggert didn't see the part, didn't act the part and was totally unconvincing as a mountain guide. After watching it, I was left with the feeling that some friends had free time and decided to make a movie. It must be produced on a budget of business change. The plot was at its best thin and with the low caliber that sometimes traded, the question asked to be asked, "Why are we doing it?". I managed to go through the whole movie, but also asked me, "Why?".
