People can say I'm hard, but I can't help it. The movie is so bad, I was absolutely amazed. The first movie was bad enough if you asked me. It was very exaggerated and stupid, but this one, despite the creepy scenes, has a really cute story. They actually investigated Kayako's past and found out that she had a mother (who speaks wonderful English) who was an exorcist and "fed" evil spirits to her daughter. Stupid? Yeap. OK, it started with Kayako, who was a normal housewife who had a relationship with a few blocks and killed herself. This part is still OK. Because of this moment of anger, she became a fiery spirit killing someone entering her house. Acceotable. Now her murder has begun a little where she actually had the opportunity to travel through Tokyo just to complete her victims. (Her victims were traveling, weren't they?) It hit me hard. Now, if a ghost can actually do such a thing as traveling across a country without paying public rates, I wouldn't mind. Ask someone to come kill me then * snorts *. And to crown things completely, the ghost once portrayed as a very inventive man (In Ju-on: The Resentment, which was better than this garbage) is now portrayed as a ghost who truly enjoys and feels herself It is her mission to complete people. Things got worse (for me, the viewer) when the ghost came in shapes of big strings of hair. I mean, ??? If a ghost had such power, I'm seriously slim to be one. I never really liked movies that make up ghosts like SAMPLES because they aren't. The overall results are just bad. Like the grudge 2. With a better story and less exaggeration, this performance would have been better
