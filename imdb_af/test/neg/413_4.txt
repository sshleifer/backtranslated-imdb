Review: Angels and Demons <br /> <br /> The movie is directed by Ron Howard. He also made famous films such as The Da Vinci Code & Cinderella Men. He also directed the well-known TV series 24. The best-known actors are Tom Hanks (The Da Vinci Code, The Green Mile, Forrest Gump, and Ewan McGregor (Cassandra's Dream, Moulin Rouge, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, ??). <br /> <br /> In the beginning I was shocked because they changed the start of the movie so much. Because they changed the father of Vittoria Vettra (Ayelet Zurer) into someone else, Silvano Bentivoglio (Camren Argenziano). Another change is that Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) never goes to CERN. It was nice to be able to film them on the spot in CERN. <br /> <br /> Then the movie continues. They are spectacular motor racing in Rome. I also love the part in Chirstian Archives when they destroy Galileo's work, it was funny. It was also funny that they locked up in the archive the second time, Robert Langdon destroyed half of the archives and when they erupted, did the electricity turn up? <br /> <br /> I found it very stupid that Robert Langdon did not go into the helicopter, but the Camerlengo (Ewan McGregor) came in alone, another detail is that the Camerlengo is an adopted boy out of the pope. In the book he is the true son of the pope. <br /> <br /> When I get the best acting performance, I have to say Pierfrancesco Favino who plays Olivetti's inspector. The worst actor of the killer, played by Nikolaj Lie Cheese, I think he was accommodating, because in Adams Apples he played Faboulous. <br /> <br /> I think the whole movie was harassed because director Ron Howard made some very stupid changes. I'll rate the movie at 4/10.
