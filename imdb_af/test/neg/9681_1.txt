This film is a totally inaccurate depiction of the real story of Noah's Ark. The producers probably didn't even read the Bible. This is the worst movie I've ever seen! Noah's wife was never mentioned in the Bible, but the authors of the film gave her the name Naamah. This movie shows the destruction of Sodom a good 1000 years before it happened, and what about Gamorrah? It was also destroyed at the same time that Sodom was. (Perhaps the producers thought that Gamorrah was not included in the story and that the city "Sodom" knows in you what would produce more eyebrows.) This movie is extremely dirty and mocks God and the Bible. It is a wonder that any true Christian wants to participate in the production of this awkward, horrible, confused mockery of the Bible.
