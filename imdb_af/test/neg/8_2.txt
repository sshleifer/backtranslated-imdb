I'm not a big fan of musicals, though technically it doesn't qualify as a musical. But I thought I'd give it a chance, because I love war movies. It was mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> Hudson looks completely out of kilter in this role. It just didn't work for me. Julie Andrews probably played her part as well as she could, but I find it hard to buy her as a torch, misleading spy. Sorry, I know this is classic stereotyping on my part. But I have to say I think it's July at her most beautiful and feminine look. I always thought of her as more matron, but surely this is the result of her roles in Sound of Music and Mary Poppins. They undoubtedly tried to get her out of typing in this role. She was special in appearance here, but I never bought her as a spy. <br /> <br /> I couldn't keep my focus through the whole movie, and I put myself in and out - and had conversations with those in my room (which I usually never do - I always shoot) . So it tells you how little it has my attention. Don't waste your time!
