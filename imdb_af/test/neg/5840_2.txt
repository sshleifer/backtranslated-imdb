This movie has a premise that is good enough to talk to someone, and a sure-fire conversation starter. "Will you sleep with someone you don't like or know about one million dollars?" While the film has a lot of potential, the poor performance becomes a b-grade soap opera. The film has a good performance, and after the proposal is made, we are really in the movie, but then it falls dramatically. The last 3 quarters of the movie is spent by characters who complain and regret what they did! The end was so split that it had me in tears! It has a very similar premise for 'honeymoon in vegas' which is much better. See it instead.
