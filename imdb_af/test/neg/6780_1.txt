I had great expectations about this movie (not as it was an apocalypse, or an 8 1/2 but high enough), and when I saw it on cable, they were all smashed. Beginning of the acting (poor, almost mediocre, an astonishing waste of good actors and talent) and the story itself: Since when has a 5-man squad on patrol on a so-called "hot" zone? Say one big mistake, which costs the movie expensive. Many good actors are doing very poorly here, such as Sean Penn, recently repeating the annoying way of talking about "I'm Sam" and Michael J. Fox, wasting a good opportunity to beat Charlie Sheen on "Platoon" . But the most annoying character was Diaz (played by John Leguizamo, another folly of good talent by the director). It was a cheesy, scary and insecure person, even more annoying that Jar Jar Binks (yes, you heard it). The battle order is average, the only one that really stands out is the opening sequence, with Michael J. Fox trapped by his feet on a VC tunnel. De Palma did a bad job here, and if it wasn't for movies like Scarface and The Untouchables, I'd consider him a bluff director: too much publicity, bad filming. br /> <br /> 3/10
