This movie starts by showing you a map and then explaining radar and it's quite a while before you ever see the deadly mantis. Probably a better movie in the 50's, this dated piece is slightly slow to move and the discount in the end is not very good. Although it has moments like Perry Mason's husband arguing with an old man and saying, "I have reduced the possibilities of one." Excuse me, but if you put something down, you have some or more possibilities, not one. If you put it on one, you didn't settle it, but you actually figured it out. The monster is standard 50's sci-fi stock market, better than the locusts in the beginning of the end. Acting is sub-par and the heroine is the most unappealing ... In fact, in some shots she looks like a man in tow. You see a lot of the aircraft stock and other stuff, but you won't see much of the deadly mantis.
