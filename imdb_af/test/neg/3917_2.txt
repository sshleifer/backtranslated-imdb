Dennis Hopper must have been very hungry to do this movie. Horrible special effects, very poor writing, cheesy dialogue, stupid killer bio-robots. Remember the blatant disobedience of science. The uncomfortable scene with the 2 young leads off their clothes. The best part of this movie was the cyber penis on the hidden cyborg pirate captain. 2 out of 10 stars because I'm in a generous mood.
