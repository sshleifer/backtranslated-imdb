Some movies you will watch because they touch your soul or challenge you in ways that grow. <br /> <br /> Some you will look for, because you want to be exposed to adventure or shock outside your experience. It will not feed you directly, but they will help you place yourself in a larger world than you would otherwise have. And after all, the difficult parts of life are in what you choose not to accept. <br /> <br /> And then there are movies that don't do these things, that you will look out of obligation or because you have a need for historical context. These are pretty worthless experiences in terms of building a life. <br /> <br /> Of course, the problem is that you often don't know which of the three will be a movie. You might get an indication of people you trust, but because a life in the movie is so personal, you really won't know before you go blindly. <br /> <br /> For me it was pretty worthless. Yes, yes, I know many Bunuel are the symbol of the sublime and the rich. And if you don't know, under my biggest movie experience, it's a lot of strange movies, very funny. <br /> <br /> It's not that it's not filmy or symbolic deep, or apolitical / politically friendly as I think. That's how it gets there, which is off the base. This is the departure from real disorder that irritates me. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is that it is a successful alternative art, which means it is successful commercial art. This, in turn, means that it can be simply explained and the explanation is not only widely accepted but only coded. Surely this is true. <br /> <br /> When the term "surrealistic" is used, it is generally mistaken for any film or world that is deviated from reality or strange. But when used correctly, meaning consensus theory, it's always about Bunuel, and especially this movie and the one he really did to Dali. So because they invented surrealistic theater, they define and control the term. It understands myself and I have my own alternative definition that does not come from their philosophy. <br /> <br /> That's because the philosophy is completely in conflict. It is not a philosophy, but a rejection of philosophy, an anti-order. Its packaged anarchy, carefully choose the things they use and the things they resist, without clearly distinguishing them. So good: against linearity, against narration, against history, against religion (an easy one), against deliberate love. But for an infinite linear story, to establish its own history (celebrated by many film school professors; what else can they do?); for a kind of transcendent "casual" love. <br /> <br /> It's his own enemy. If there was a Bunuel today, when he sold his image, the first thing he would do was attack the church or the surrealism. <br /> <br /> My regular readers know that I play almost everything in the role of the movie, Spanish and avoid the French. But in the case of the surreal, I'd like to consider the reverse: get your surrealism from Alfred Jarry, not Bunuel. <br /> <br /> Ted's Evaluation - 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.
