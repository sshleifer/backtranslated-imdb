I avoided this movie one day ... because I saw it as an unnecessary installment for a series that only had 2 parts. But after reading some favorable reviews ... from some IMDB viewers ... I spent $ 1.50 and rented it at my local video store. Should I go further ... if I say .... it was a buck-50 lost. This movie is one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen. Firstly .... I realize that no one wanted to see a 33-year-old Macchio in this movie ..... But why couldn't they have read Miyagi a letter or something about Daniel-San? What happened to Daniel ... hell, they could at least have made a quick mention of Daniel or something. But no ... and to compensate for the already bad writing .... they added those stupid monks. I thought monks had made a vow of silence. Guess that these yapping monks don't take their vows seriously ... hehehe. The training the girl had experienced in the movie was hasty and stupid ... and the paramilitary group of young men .... was a confusing concept to say the least .... it was far from even a martial arts film. .. with the girl just fighting shortly in the final scene .... and then she didn't even come close to touching once ... by the male fighting her .... give me a little. .. she would have hit at least once. I think the authors and directors thought it would be shocking to see a girl being beaten by a man in this one. I can go on and on ... but basically ... I'll finish by saying that this movie was just as bad .... even the girl they chose wasn't nice to even watch (she was sorta "butch" look ... .... I can only think of a handful of movies I've been sitting ... which compares to how bad this movie was ..... DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS. ........
