Strangeland is a terrible horror / technological excitement. Dee Snider plays Carleton Hendricks, a disgusting computer freak who prays on young girls through classrooms. His ridiculous philosophies of pain and suffering are both deceptive and totally unfounded. There is no commitment to reality with the ideas presented in this film, it is more like Dee Snider sitting down and trying to find the strangest things to impress horror fans and perhaps of his old fans, but the end result is just awful. <br /> <br /> It seems to me, as a horror fan, the cover of this movie very well and it caught my interest right away, which is the main reason I watched it. I assure you that this is not a quality horror movie. It is a disturbing but boring attempt to imagine what can happen in the minds of people who deal with themselves as Carleton Hendricks did in this movie. The sad part is that no one does these things to themselves. Marilyn Freakin 'Manson doesn't even go that far, and the fact that he had a song on the soundtrack makes it clear that the film was not meant to make fun of his kind of music (it would be a joke Snider himself), it is more like Dee Snider tried to kill himself and introduce himself as a sick-minded individual. Dee, it seems the time has come to make it die.
