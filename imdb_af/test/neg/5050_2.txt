It's so sad when high-quality actors and actresses get involved with pure shit, probably because they've been offered a lot of money. None of Helen Mirren's better career moves. The acting of the "teens" is simply frightening, not helped by a writing that is totally unclear in parts. <br /> <br /> Most of Kevin Williamson's work is above average, but it's really lower. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you watch on TV when there's nothing better and you have half a bottle of wine to drink and wait for the Pizza delivered so you can drink the drink . other half.
