Fortunately, I didn't see this movie in a big screen movie, just on a small video screen. I doubt I could sit in the theater through the movie and see all the violence in the movie. After looking at the first 30 minutes, I became both disappointed and curious. <br /> <br /> Disappointed by the difficult storyline, the scarcely understandable screens, the huge amount of aggression, I still don't know why. I have shown that the Daesu (main character) is cutting off another person's teeth, his affection for women, he is cutting out his tongue. And also curious to see what the film will say as a conclusion, what is the final summary of all this brutality. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, although the film was not boring, I didn't get any answer to all this cruelty that I had to watch from start to finish. In my opinion, if you want blood and want to laugh, there is Kill Bill 1-2. If you want blood with more meaning, you can take any recent war movie, and if you want an East movie, there are much better titles. out there. Then I will take the Cannes film festival ratings with more precautions, as Oldboy had much praise from the jury. It didn't matter much to me and just got 4/10 on my scale. <br /> <br /> I'm hungry to see something beautiful, harmonious, with true feelings and a clear message.
