This movie didn't do it for me, an avid SNL fan for the past 14 years. Jamie Gertz's portrayal was OK, but there was something about the movie itself. The facts presented in the movie are completely skewed. But Merv Griffin produced it, so it will explain a lot. He was never on SNL, and has nothing to do with it. The points in her life when she was on SNL are back. When we first see her on the SNL, it runs through the studio with Lorne Michaels, the logo on the wall is about 1988-1989, not 1975. And we're talking about the movie - who are these people ?? I've never heard of one of them. Very dissatisfied. This movie shows why TV movies are just that, TV movies.
