This one is doozy. From 1949, Scene of the Crime plays more like a Coen Bros. movie set in the 1940s and filmed in black and white, except that the author's ear for pastiche is not so well-designed. Maybe it could be seen instead as the forerunner of Oscar baiting sklock like Road to Perdition. First, it is a wonder that this film is not regarded as a classical classification as a film professor and critics, as it is in false sense in terms of exaggerated articulation excitement (like the grandmother of all such "false art" films) Citizen Kane, or something from Murnau.) <br /> <br /> MGM is usually a studio that can do nothing wrong in my eyes, and I think any story, atmosphere, even eager realism can only benefit from grotesque overesthetization. You can say I am a disciple of the Minnelli school. But it takes a light touch to write a male dialogue from the Dashiell Hammett line, a willingness to pass one or two scenes without a line like "Cautious, Mr. Wiggly, or you'll be thirteen fish for to fry and not little worms to catch them. "I made the most of it -" Mr. Wiggly, "unfortunately made the cut - but believe me, the dialogue has just been inflated and beaten with non-successors. Even the chief's wife, played by Arlene Dahl, speaks like a moon-shaped scar under one eye and the Christian name Rocco. By the time Van Johnson turns his line into the badge, "I'm dead to the death of death and murder," you'll wonder how the author's fixation with decorated literary devices - in this case, zeugma - could ever have misunderstood as "street." <br /> <br /> For those who have outgrown the Naked Gun series, it's the funniest cops-n-robbers movie.
