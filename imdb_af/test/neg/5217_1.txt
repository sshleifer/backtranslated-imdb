Drilling, a relentless plot, some of the worst directions I've ever experienced, inactive and terribly clicked. The movie ends with one of the main characters waking up from a dream. WHAT IS WITH THIS? Even JR from Dallas couldn't survive that lame turn. <br /> <br /> You have what can only be described as an inappropriate relationship that develops between a main character and a young girl, apparently supposed to be paternal, but who comes down as perverse. You've got fellow community college movie school special effects with loopholes the size of the Kimberly hole. It is like Children of the Cross meet the Passion of the Christ imposed on an endless loop of government administration training video. At the end of it, if you don't consider it, you have no brain. <br /> <br /> Don't worry.
