Wow! I don't even know where to start with what made this movie so terrible. Perhaps I should first say that during a "heated confrontation" between the antagonist and protagonist, I had to leave the theater because I was so loud. Yes. The acting was really so bad. However, the acting was not the worst part. The plot was almost completely shown in the previews. The characters are all poorly underdeveloped. The dialogue and the "dramatic moments" are ridiculous. The bad guy is a caricature of out-of-control, power drunk, sadistic. <br /> <br /> But the actors are beautiful, so it's supposed to make it all better.
