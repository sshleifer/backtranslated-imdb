Despite working for the worst government of the 20th century, Erwin Rommel is generally regarded by historians and World War II buffets as a gentleman, a soldier's soldier and a brilliant tactician on the area of ​​mechanized warfare. If Hitler gave him the troops and matter he gave in Africa, the argument goes, things would have been very different. And that's probably true. Rommel was actually a military genius and by all accounts a sincere, honest man. <br /> <br /> But this film goes out of its way to portray it as a near-saint. He does his job to win the war for Hitler, but the Fuhrer constantly interrupts and gives him ridiculous orders, which Rommel (James Mason) surprises but rarely questions and never obeys. Only when it is clear that Hitler leads Germany to destroy, Rommel thinks of betrayal against him; playing this dilemma as the main theme of the movie, a good man in bad circumstances, trying to do the right thing. <br /> <br /> Mason is good like Rommel, but it's hardly a memorable line-up, says George C. Scott as Patton. Of course, Rommel was not as colorful as Patton, but this film is so intent on making him look like a decent man who forgets to make him interesting. Does he occasionally fall into a little warmth when he throws well with his wife, Lucie (a young Jessica Tandy,) but usually Mason a solid British performance? as if the British are trying to claim rubbish for themselves (though in all fairness all Nazis have English accents except Hitler). <br /> <br /> Made on the cheapest, with any fighting scenes doubling stocktaking and accelerating the beaches of Southern California for Tunisia, there's nothing to recommend this movie especially. A reminder can be interesting (I only choose Ed Harris because of a slight physical deal and Harris can act) it is a bit bruised, but this movie has mostly shown me how much more claim we have become as viewers in the last fifty years; A biography of these will never cut it any more.
