ASTROESQUE (2 out of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> I have no idea what the title is supposed to be, even less of an idea of ​​what will be in the movie half time, it still has me so interested. It's a low, low budget movie-up in the line of "El Mariachi", filmed in 16mm ... and for what it's worth, the shots are very well composed and visually stylish. Filed, written by and starring author / artist Michael Allred ... It's no surprise that the movie looks good. Unfortunately, some of the acting is bad ... and the rest is at its best. Satisfying himself comes from the best ... but just because he doesn't really talk much. He just pushes to look cool most of the time ... or runs out of the crazy Rednecks trying to kill him. The sound is also pretty bad ... almost as if it was unfinished in places ... maybe they couldn't afford to pay for the music they were planning to use? Strange, blurry science-fiction plot ... similar in tone to "The Man Who Fell To Earth" ... but most of the movie comes down to a standard-run guy and kills them before -The kill - Your plot. Ultimately sloping to be successful, but not without interest for adventurous filmmakers.
