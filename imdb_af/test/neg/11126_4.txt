A Cryptozoologist captures a mythical chupacabra on a Caribbean island. To get it back to civilization, he wrapped his way to the freight bay of a great luxury cruise ship with funny and I think the script had devastating consequences. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the one thing I really don't like about this movie. The monster really looks like a man in a rubber suit. The CGI scenes look like another movie. OK, it's off my chest now on all the fun bits about this B-movie. <br /> <br /> The best thing was John Rhys-Davies (his daughter, the eyeball, a second second.) John was intermittently funny and suave and it didn't matter what the authors had to say. He said it well. Good work he had to work. The Cyptozoologist was at the top and also to watch. He had some funny pieces. The marines were all good and made good gunfeed for the monster as some of the crew and guests did. There are some pretty funny lines in this movie, and a fun subplot that involves a thief. <br /> <br /> The special effects are generally low and I swear they reused the same blood spray on the wall scene in about four different parts of the movie. I was equal to the mind of the legless man. Really since this movie wasn't terrifying, I feel a little more, it would have been the way to improve the watch capability of this movie. <br /> <br /> All in all If you like B monsters, this one is worth a visit.
