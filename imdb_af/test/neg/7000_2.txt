1st watched 6/21/2001 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Emmanuel Itier): Pretty much worthless suspected thriller spending more time pulling us into sexual encounters with and without the star 'Amber Smith'. It tries to turn a story around the sex scenes, but as usual with these types of movies it is not done very well. I was so bored with this movie that I was actually moving forward fast to get it over. The video version I watched is called 'Tell Me No Lies'.
