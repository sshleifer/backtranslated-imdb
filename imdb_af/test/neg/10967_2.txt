A look at the rating should tell you that this movie was voted by shills, in an effort to artificially increase this movie's ratings. <br /> <br /> This movie brings nothing new to the zombie genre. In fact, it is laughably bad (in acting and cinematography) and derivative in its plot. The make-up looks terrible and the zombies look even worse when it's shot. Lines are firmly delivered and bad tides, with the exception of the female bounty hunter, who is the only good actor in this mess of a movie. The worst offenders are the Italian man (Hans), Ryn the lead, and the chief bad man. I saw a better delivery of pizza truck with a flat tire. <br /> <br /> It's a self-proclaimed "zombie western", but the only thing that makes it a "zombie western" is the fact that people wear cowboy hats and the main actor's real name is Clint. The protagonist is not cool and mysterious like a traditional Eastwood hero, and as an anti-hero he does not have the wise cartilage to pull it off as well. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled. through the false glowing reviews. It's just another B-grade zombie movie made up for the budget it has (it does have proper lighting), but it's a series of low-budget, first-time directing and bad acting. There are a LOT of stupid scenes that this looks really amateurish.
