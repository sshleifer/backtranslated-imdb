I've always liked Bill Murray in movies like Lost in Translation, and the trailer for this movie looks really good, but the result was very disappointing. Basically, Murray plays Jack Corcorin, who recently found out that his father died, and is expected to hear his will. He finds out that his father was a clown because he left a big shoe, his squeaky nose, and his hayfire, an elephant! The only way Jack can get rid of this elephant is to travel 4,000 km in four days and give $ 30,000 to a safe zoo. Also Pat Hingle as Vernon. There are tiny moments of humor, like the front of a truck, and Murray screams, but in general it's senseless. Nice arm!
