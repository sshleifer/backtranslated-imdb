Not only does the VHS and DVD cover (at least in Europe) show a scene that has nothing to do with the real plot of the movie, the acting is so bad that the movie exclaims to make fun. If you have nothing to do, you are with some good friends and you want to laugh a bit about a movie, which is supposed to be serious, watch Tycus and Peter Onorati, a man you will learn how to beat bad guys over bad guys! Shame on Dennis Hopper, following Travolta's example, staring at his own "battlefield earth". For those who want to see a good movie about the earth being destroyed by a terrible force, please do not choose Tycus, but do yourself a favor and look for Armageddon for the 20th time!
