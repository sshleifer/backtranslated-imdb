It could have been a good biopsy, but what a mess! I had this movie when I was a theater manager. When I put the movie together and watched it, I thought I had some rules out of action. As it turned out, I didn't, and if I did, no one would have noticed. I couldn't figure out what was going on! Everyone who almost walked out felt the same way!
