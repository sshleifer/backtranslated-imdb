It is one of those wonderful martial arts movies that starts with two possessions of tough gangsters facing a park; And when the deal goes wrong and starts the fight, they all know karate and kung fu! Everyday Cynthia Rothrock plays (as usual) a cynical, death team, good cop, this time in Los Angeles. She and her police partners are trying to break up a counterfeit ring, and when the plot line is exhausted, the story just goes over to something else, and Cynthia becomes the personal bodyguard of a rich, wonderful magnate. Within the film's natural rock-bottom budget, there are a few helicopter action, a speedboat action, a few car hunters, a noise where Cynthia all hit a rural bar, a few swimming pools with bimbos the bikinis and a surprisingly good horse chase. About a dozen and a half police are fired. Many plot twists happen that just don't make sense; Don't worry about them. (And the fake currency is a federal crime, so where is the FBI? I think they were too busy.) The battle choreography was done by Cynthia Rothrock's regular co-star Richard Taylor, whose attractive and witty presence in front of the camera would it really have made a better movie. He also tended to make Cynthia a better actress when they appeared together, and she could honestly use it. She looks tired and bored, and plays her in GUARDIAN ANGEL when she plays against a pet, to whom she delivers drunk monologues. The dog almost does her! She also wore some of the most horrible clothes any front lady ever wore in any movie: loose, pocket-legged jeans with light acid wash areas across each buttocks were the most shocking. The other actors are across the map. You can throw pictures of many of the minor characters in this way: "Hey, I and some other guys I know are going to be in a movie. You also want to be in it? No, men, I'm serious!" Then there are the slumming professionals: the most beautiful are Lydie Denier, the beautiful French model and veteran of Red Shoe Diaries, Baywatch, Melrose Place and many other variations on the sexy French bombing screen. here she plays a psychopathic killer as if she were in BAISEZ-MOI or an "alias" section, and not a direct-to-cable trash. There is also the long, dark and attractive Daniel McVicar, now a regular on 'The Bold and the Beautiful', John O'Leary, who played a worthy old man in dozens of movies and sitcom episodes and again here and Aharon Ipale, veteran Arab character actor, perhaps best known as "Pharaoh Seti" of THE MUMMY AND THE MUMMY RETURNS. For these professionals, GUARDIAN ANGEL must be the most ridiculous entry on their CVs. I gave this movie a better score than it probably deserves, because my daughters, who are enthusiastic martial arts students, like to see a woman kicking the ass and having the big action scenes for a change. They are a little too young to worry about a low-quality picture, and just enjoyed encouraging Cynthia as she did her swings, high-kick, stick-stuff. If you like this kind of movie, you can probably enjoy it at that level.
