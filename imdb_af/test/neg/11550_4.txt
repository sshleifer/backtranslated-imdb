"Escanaba in da Moonlight" is Jeff Daniels' first exhibition writing and directing exhibition. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse debuts, but this one isn't that good. <br /> <br /> "Escanaba in da Moonlight" begins like a decent parody of this part of American culture. We follow Rebuen Soady (Jeff Daniels) on the eve of deer hunting season 1989. He comes close to the record of Elder Soady to never pack a goat. <br /> <br /> The movie takes places in the upper regions of Michigan and has all the usual cliche characters. Well, there's a warmth it tells you. It's not moderate. <br /> <br /> Well, Reuben is heading for The Soady Deer Camp and before his wife (Kimberly Norris Guerrero) gives him a Native American chain, his happy hat and two types of fluid you probably don't want to know no. <br /> <br /> Anyway, she's really the only one who believes in him. He eventually arrives at the camp where his father, Albery Soady (Harve Presnell) is waiting and his brother Remnar (Joey Albright) will soon show. <br /> <br /> Well, let's make it ahead. Here are some laughs, a few moments when I shouted loudly. But most of the jokes here have been used many times. <br /> <br /> But the biggest sign is the spiritual / native American events. Just when you come in with the characters, these strange things occur. But the special effects are so cheap all that is, is a big flash of light and then head back quickly into the bubble. <br /> <br /> And the end, though, is worthless. <br /> <br /> The move itself wasn't bad, the peculiar character and fun parody was good. But it had to remain there. Instead of having dull mental awakening that resembles rejected scenes of a devil's movie, I give Escanaba da Moonlight a 4.5 out of 10.
