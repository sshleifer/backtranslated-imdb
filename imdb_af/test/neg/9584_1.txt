It's a crummy movie, a prince to a genre of surprise that ends with movies. And a genre so much better done before. The plot strikes, with a predictable end. (Yawn) The characters are unlikeable, and some are so unlikely they are almost incompatible. Matt Dillon, a fine, intense actor, is completely ignored here and is stiff and manicured. The other is forgotten. Much of the dialogue is sophomoric, again a prince who tries to be spiritual. I will not use the author to write my grocery list. Yes, it is so bad, which is from misogynistic to just as rough as abroad. With so much real talent out there, I'm really surprised with this movie ever made. It shows the total lack of imagination of the office suits ...
