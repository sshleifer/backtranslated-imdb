This movie was so frustrating. Everything was energetic and I was quite prepared to have a good time. At least I thought I could stand it. But I was wrong. First, the strange loop? It was like watching America's Funniest Home Videos. The damn parents. I hated them so much. The stereo-typical Latino family? I need to talk to the person responsible for this. We need a talk. The little girl always hanging on someone? I just hated her and had to call it. Now, the final scene transcends, I have to say. It's so bad and full of bad that it's a movie of its own. What a crappy dance. Terrible and beautiful at the same time.
