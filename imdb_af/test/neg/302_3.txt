"The Secret Life" begins with the worst possible narrative intro: "The crimes committed by Jeffrey Dahmer are too terrible to make a movie ...". Well, so, what do you suggest? That we should not save to continue watching because the movie will not be accurate or bloody anyway? And they were right too! The film is not the least shocking and contains almost no blood or gore. Although I think it is mainly due to the low budget production values ​​and not because of Dahmer's crimes too terrible. Basically, "The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer" is just one repeating sequence. Young, sorry and mentally confused Jeffrey picks up victims (always men, as he was a homosexual), kills them and then talks about how it was not his intention to hurt them and how lonely he was. It gets boring very fast and even the admirable performance by the unknown actor Carl Crew cannot save this movie from a total dud. Yet this version is much better than the pretentious and hopelessly confused "Dahmer" released in 2002.
