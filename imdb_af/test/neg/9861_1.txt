What a game about: Kasparov and the machine are doing the best in the 1997 competition against IBM's Deep Blue in Garry Kasparov's psyche. You see him becoming more and more paranoid and becoming more and more unraveled, because in the second game Deep Blue made a move that looked like one's preconceived idea of ​​chess. Kasparov thought, and still, that IBM was cheating. <br /> <br /> Game Over tries to look unbiased, but it is clear that the director thinks IBM has deceived. However, they do not give any real evidence to support the fraudulent claim, but only that IBM's security around the computer room was because IBM actually hid grownups hiding the computer on certain important occasions, and Kasparov's claim that the computer was not playing do not have a computer usually do at one point in game two. In game two, Kasparov played a game designed to deceive the computer and try to pioneer a situation in which previous computer chess programs would have taken the pawn, which would lead to the computer's ultimate loss. Deep Blue didn't take the bait, and Kasparov was so scratched because the computer looks like one, he didn't even see that he could play Deep Blue for a draw and finally resigned. That game chased him out so much that he couldn't recover, and after playing games 3,4 and 5, game 6 was terribly lost. <br /> <br /> The question of IBM cheating comes down to that single movement in play two, where the Deep Blue made the move anyone would make, but until then, computers have acted. Joel Benjamin, a chess master of IBM's programming team, explained in the documentary document that they knew that chess computers had always risen in that situation and therefore spent a lot of time and effort to program Deep Blue so that it would not don't do other computers. If you believe Benjamin's assertion, then the case is clear, IBM did not cheat. Unfortunately, the director quickly touched and never mentioned IBM's explanation for the rest of the movie. He prefers to cut between shots of the shaking 19th century hoax, The Turk, and Deep Blue's shots. by man too. As someone who has an understanding of programming, the explanation makes sense through IBM. If you knew what you were doing it would not be very difficult to put something in the code so that, if so, conditions would be reached. Do this and so - for example, tell the computer what to do if a situation such as that created by Kasparov in game 2 ever happened. It is not deceptive, it is going well with programming a computer. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it is extremely clear that the director believes that IBM has deceived and that recurring comments on IBM's stock are 15% The day Deep Blue won, indicates that IBM has deceived pump share price (Kasparov even compares IBM and Deep Blue with Enron). However, there is a lot of outside opinion, within the chess and computer science communities, that Deep Blue has won just and squarely and that Kasparov has lost because he simply could not pass his view of computers as "stupid machines" through a machine that doesn't seem so stupid. I just wish the director showed us the alternative opinion. <br /> <br />
