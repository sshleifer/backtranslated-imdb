Ever looked at something so horrible, you just have to look to make sure it's really as bad as it looks? This is one of those movies. It was criticized by its critics for its release, not least for the way it was funded. I caught it on TV last night and handed it into curiosity. <br /> <br /> In that case, what is on the box is no more or less: low level humor, cruelty, much in the 'Wear on ...' but with 'adult' language. Indeed, it goes back to the 60s / 70s British porn industry, cheats by promised real sex and not the delivery of (the nipple). This whole tawdry era is lovingly recreated, but with modern cinematography. <br /> <br /> It benefits from Mackenzie Crook (The Office, Pirates of the Caribbean and more) and also Johnny Vegas. The chip shop girl is really sexy. Besides these unexpected positives, let me wonder what happened to England. Innocent food, low paid jobs, council properties, desperate lives. As a bonus, there are some nice shots of Birmingham's leaves. Foreigners can find it insightful about British attitudes and aspirations. However, generally I feel unbelief that I have put it through.
