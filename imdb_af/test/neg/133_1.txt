Nowadays, writers, directors and producers are increasingly making the "surprising" end. The old art of closing a movie, with all the information we have learned through the movie and bringing it to a complete end, is lost. Now that's what we have, a movie that can be completed in 5 minutes, no matter how complex, detailed or frivolous it is. It was all in his / her head. This explanation is the director's safety net. If everything else fails, or if the writing was not as good, or if we no longer have money to finish the movie, we can always say, "It was all in its head" and the movie ends like that. The audience will buy it because none of us are psychologists, and none of us suffer from schizophrenia (not what we know), so we take the story and believe it. After all, the mind is a powerful thing. Some movies pulled it off. But those movies are why we are getting more and more of these crap ends. Every director / writer now thinks they can kick it off, because Fight Club did it and it made a lot of money. So we get movies like The Machinist, Secret Window, Identity, and this movie (just to name a few).
