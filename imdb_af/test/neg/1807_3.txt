Heart of Darkness Movie Review Can a book known for its eloquent wording and intricate concepts ever be made in a movie that is good enough to portray the deep meaning of the book? So far that goal has not been achieved. The heart of darkness was made into a movie in 1993, but it was a failure compared to the book. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to make any book in a movie. There is always the concern that it will not have such a descriptive or similar meaning. So why the novel, The Heart of Darkness, is made in a movie, I am clueless. There is so much description and hidden meaning throughout the book. If I just read the words, I think one would think it's pretty boring and won't get the symbolism. I think that's what happened in the movie; The movie just sharpened the story on the surface. <br /> <br /> The movie didn't even follow the full story of the book, major changes were made that I thought the movie was getting worse. For example, the driver did not go with Marlow and the rest of the crew on the boat, but the spy instead did. I think it took a few big plots and pulled out the great deception of the Kurtz manager. Also, Kurtz wasn't even on the steamer when he died, which made the whole trip even more useless, which became irritating just after a while. And when Marlow told Kurtz's fiance about his last moments and words, it wasn't as close as descriptive or important, the fiancé didn't even upset it. <br /> <br /> As far as acting is concerned, none of the actors did a very good job, except for the actor who played Mfumu. According to me, Kurtz wasn't very angry, and it was kind of an important thing in the book. Other characters like Marlow, the manager and the fiancé also didn't do the characters justice they earned from the book. Their actions were neither exciting nor memorable. Over all, I do not believe that this book should even be attempted to be made into a movie. I think it's good to use some of the themes in a different story line as in Apocalypse Now. But to follow the same exact storyline of the book just makes it shameful.
