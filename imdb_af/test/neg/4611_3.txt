<br /> <br /> I thought this movie did not lack the building's dramatic tension that had the first movie. It's hard to reach when the movie takes place over a week. The original movie led to the final climate over a year and it was still less violent than the successor. One good thing about this movie was the movie went relatively fast because the plot was rushing. When Rachel's best friend died, there was no funeral in the movie. Another decrease was Amy Irving's involvement. All her plays brought the movie pace. The dialogue in this movie was terrible. This in no way reflects how children speak. Lastly, this movie could be a hit, but was secreted to the opening scene.
