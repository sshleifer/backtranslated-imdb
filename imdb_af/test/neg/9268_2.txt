This is perhaps the most ridiculous crap I've ever watched. Three unattached stories about completely silly and random things are interrupted from time to time by a bus and a boring monologue about relationships by a stupid man. Christ knows why so many people got involved. Highlights: A green fridge man who reads Jean-Paul Sartre, the slobmans meals guests and her horse hair products, a RIDICULOUSLY reasonable woman in the third short, suspects a dirty man just to have interest in her generic activities, blowers. <br /> <br /> I still have to use a few more lines, so even more stupid things about the movie can be. The first film involves a man who drives a talking car and obeys his unreasonable demands for absolutely no clear reason. The only way to watch this movie is if you were blind and had other abnormalities in your personality and brain. It is funny, ironic, but also extremely tiring, like chewing on a bleached back.
