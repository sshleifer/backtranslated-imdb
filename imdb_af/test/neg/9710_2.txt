This movie is simply bad. First, the story is just strange and it is not well written. This leaves you with questions when you're done. Sometimes it's OK, but not in this case. <br /> <br /> The acting is nothing to write home about. The adults do an OK job, but the children, who are considered, are kids, not a good job. I thought the lead, Ian Costello as Mickey, was the worst. Well, to be honest, I'm not sure it was the lead. Never realized who this movie was over. Mickey or Pete. <br /> <br /> There were a few shots that stood out, but over everything there was nothing excited about the movies. However, the sound was better. There was a good score. A little adventure kind of score, though it doesn't look like an adventure movie to me. It had some elements of an adventure movie, but it was more of a drama. However, it was difficult to tell who this movie was meant for. Children? Rare. There is too much language and violence for that. Adults? I do not know. It had to have many elements of a children's film in it. It was like an adult movie in a children's film package. <br /> <br /> The story was just weird. I don't have much of an idea of ​​what it's about. You were immediately thrown without knowing anything, but there were always references to something you felt you should know. For example, the fact that the children's parents were dead and Mickey Pete blamed it. You expected to know what happened, but you never got it. <br /> <br /> All this movie was bad and a waste of time. There was no drive in it. Nothing to really move the story forward. This is not what you put on Saturday night.
