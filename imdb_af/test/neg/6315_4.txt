This movie is based on the series Street Fighter Alpha (or Zero)! It's placed in a different environment than Streetfighter, the animated movie! This movie is about Ryu accompanied by Ken and Chun Li. I recognized Rose, Zanghief and Birdie! There were no other characters used in the video game (which I could discover)! The fighting tones were OK, but nothing was really spectacular! And there weren't many of them! To me it is strange! Isn't Streetfighter fighting! Streetfighter's animated film (1994) is much better than this movie. It tries to be more than it really is! The use of the "Hada Power" and other supernatural claimants has nothing to do with the skills the characters in the video game have! And in this case it's a bad thing! The story is so boring that you don't really care about it! The action was shown! Why? And what happened to the other characters from the video game! Surely they are more interesting than the villain in this story! The main attraction of the video game is the characters with their own special skills! In this movie it's about Ryu! That's why this anime fails!
