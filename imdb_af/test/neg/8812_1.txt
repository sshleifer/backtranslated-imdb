Why is it that every time I mention this movie to someone, I have to hear about it for 10 minutes. I have come to the conclusion that any movie that turns on becomes a "genius" from anyone who sees it. Is that really what film has become? Or is it that anytime someone says, "Wow, it's so cool," everyone should agree with them and have no opinion? How this movie has a 7.5 rating is a disgrace to the film industry in general. It has also become a movie that needs two successors, so I will hear about this terrible franchise for a while. <br /> <br /> Now to the movie and why it's so bad. The original concept of it is not that bad, as there has not been a good series of killer movies in a while. The writing for this movie is terrible as well as the performance. OK, so it's a low budget movie, but it shouldn't change the story or writing. The actors can't be worse in their effort to scare us of this killer or just scare this movie. So they go out and get a big name in Danny Glover, but his talents (whatever) are wasted because his character is effortless. Why was he even in this movie? What was his whole struggle ultimately useless and misleading to what the audience believed to happen. This is, of course, the intention of the filmmakers, but could not be a better way to do this without looking at all that garbage. And then the "big" turn (was it the third or fourth?) And the whole audience was shocked and walked out of the theater as it is a kind of masterpiece. Certainly the movie lets people talk about the storyline and what, but it wasn't the only mistake in this movie. The direction was trying to be creative with what it worked for, and the flashback sequence was used only as a shock effect. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, even if you enjoyed it, go back and review the movie and you'll soon understand why it's not the praise it receives. For a great serial killer movie, watch Se7en if you haven't. This is what this movie wanted to be. I got more arguments about this film than probably any other and will continue to argue there. Please do not support this franchise not only for your sake but also from me and everyone else. Hollywood needs to make a good horror movie, rather than 1000 remakes, sequels and shock factor movies (like this one). Oh yes, the 2 line line sounds really promising: "Oh yes, there will be blood." Yaaayyyy !!!! Sweet !! blood, it must mean that it is right? Give me a chance. Sorry everyone who loves this movie, but bad writing, flashing direction and bad acting doesn't make a good movie.
