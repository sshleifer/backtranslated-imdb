I heard that Jon spent some time on spiritual experiences. I think the movie will be interesting. In fact, it is not at all. Not so much deeper for such a subject. "eternity" endless life. Experiences after death and "dejavu". The movie is not like a comedy, but not at all funny, at least not yet printed. It's so naive. Charming movie but naive movie. A must to avoid. The medieval rows seem to come directly from fairy tales and that is not the case at all. Eileen Davidson is so beautiful and Voight does his best. Normal is a co-producer and screenwriter of this movie. The movie was launched directly on video so I discovered it on a video store. This is a pity, because I know that Voight was seriously involved in spirituality and the film is not as deep about it.
