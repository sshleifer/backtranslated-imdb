Troma Founder, Lloyd Kaufman, is the Crapkeeper in this anthology film consisting of two films that were such celluloid stools, which Llyod tried to save them by combining the two into one anthology film and throwing in as much nudity as possible . Does it work? no, it's still crap that I have to scrap my shoes when I go into it. Want someone like this mess? Sure, young teenage Mongolians with the combined IQ of a Vienna sausage must laugh, I think. For those with a brain that is even semi-functioning, it seems clear and look something less insulting to your intelligence, even "Dude, Where's my car" would do. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F
