In a sense, this film did not even compare to the novel. However, it was good to have a visual of what the Congo looked like and also the Natives if you're not good at visualizing as you read. I would never recommend watching the movie rather than reading the book. I don't even suggest watching this movie, let alone other films based on this literary work. This movie; and many others did not fulfill this book. One important part missing in the movie is MArlow's sense of how the government of lack there in Africa was an early genocide. Also in the movie, MArlow and his companions did not stop and got the note and wood. Likewise, Kurtz's black mistress Marlow goes out to the end of the story, which has a major influence in the story, but was not in the book. In the novel Kurtz died on the ship, but he died in his hut in the film. The fiance's reaction to Marlow's interpretation of Kurtz's last words also differed. This movie is only effective if you want to visualize the novel more clearly.
