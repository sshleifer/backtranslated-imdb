This movie can best be described as a very long episode of a very bad sitcom. How many vague humorous misunderstandings can you fit into just one movie? Notes are misplaced, bags are switched, conversations are wrong, people are mixed, situations are misinterpreted, and somewhere people have to laugh about something. The writers really struggle to let go of everything, which really makes the dialogue felt. If someone in this movie acted like a real person, it would be resolved in about two minutes or so and everyone could return to their lives, but they should keep the misunderstandings. Sometimes this movie also tries for a few youths, but everyone who does, remembers how funny 'American Pie' was. The scene with the nerd telling the hooker (which he thinks is a foreign exchange student) to eat his sausage goes on forever, not one second of it is funny. I still have to give this movie credit: because of the subplot of stolen money, it's not as boring as it could have been. It also has a laugh here and there, but then it goes sad back to yet another character misunderstanding things. Overall, this movie is not lame.
