It will be a blue Christmas if you are subject to your family. I loved the original movie, and this one was not worthy of being his successor. Actually, it's not his successor for all purposes. Only one character from the original thrown back. Granted, the character was the hilarious cousin Eddie, but he is simply not hilary as the lead role of a movie. His niche is that of the wacky family member, who undertakes a whole series of antics - along with Chevy Chase. Chevy Chase was needed in this movie because it was a success and he was definitely not there. As far as I'm concerned, a movie is not a "Vacation" movie unless good ole Clark Griswold is driving.
