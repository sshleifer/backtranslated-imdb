This movie has bad writing and bad editing. It's hard to follow what's going on because nothing of the characters makes much sense. Some major disasters occur every 30 seconds. As a result, none of the "action" ranges is not interesting at all. The movie is two-hour "throw" scenes that are simply linked to the fact that they share common actors. This movie doesn't even have a sense of humor to be a good "bad" movie.
