The acting is uncomfortable and creepy, and not in a good way. The writing, the dialogue and the chemistry between the actors are terrible. Nothing makes sense and every close-up of an actor's expression or reaction lasts 3 or 4 seconds, which looks like a Mexican Soap Opera (telenovela). Everything about writing is unrealistic, and all the actors involved make it much worse with their campus interpretations of writing. Am I the only one to see it? Using the word cheese to describe this Canadian disaster would be the suppression of the century. Did the director even watch the final cut before being put on the air?
