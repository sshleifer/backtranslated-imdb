I'd say it's a background movie. Play it as the wallpaper as your tendency to work (washing, email checking, etc.). I thought it was a movie that was done before Amy Adams became Enchanted. Wrong! It was done in 2009! The script / script is very terrible. I love musical, but the song is just average and doesn't move the plot together. Ughh. It almost seems like a movie based on cinematography. Do I watch a TV program? <br /> <br /> Even the secretary breaks out in songs. What is the f @ # $ in progress?! She actually had the best voice. Amy Adams was so big in Enchanted. Lead actor is average. Disappointed for sure. This movie would have been good for the lifetime, but it's about it. :(
