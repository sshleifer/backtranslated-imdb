I got it from usenet, so I wasn't prepared for the heavy (and I mean extremely heavy) religious theme. Not that I was one of Satan's disciples or anything, but it was heavily handed over. <br /> <br /> In addition, the play stinks. It could be because they had to get good little boys to play bad boys, but it didn't work. <br /> <br /> There was some cool movie processing involved, so a direct-style fan might want to watch. off, but be ready with the fast forward buttons. <br /> <br /> There was some sloppiness for editing. In particular, a black Mustang (probably a representation of Satan?) Squared against a white 240Z. Wheels spin, camera changes, and whattya knows that the white 240Z is being transferred into a white Civic. <br /> <br /> I got up early so I can't accept the moral impact. But I would like to point out that this kind of film is utterly on the chorus. As the director / writer / manufacturer tried to bring religion to the unwashed street racing masses, they went wrong. I think I would rather look at a mature diaper commercially than listening to a sturdy Bible story about Jesus' death for us. Yawn. <br /> <br />
