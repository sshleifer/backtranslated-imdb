Agustus and Call really did nothing? Why is their hero, they have done nothing else, then they get to the bad guys where they are dead. What was the point of this show? I was very disappointed. I expected to see more action, more story, and the birth of Heros and Great Deeds. Instead, I saw very little, it looked like Agustus and Call where only his story is for the great Indian Head. <br /> <br /> I'm not even sure that history is even very close. They did very little to show why the Texans and Comanche fought each other. <br /> <br /> The only good part of this movie was Zhan who played Gus very well and is a good actor. Very good story that could disappear. It was sad and I wish I hadn't looked at it.
