It was actually a nice dull movie. I think the problem with a French horror movie is that the French should be frightened or something, because this movie was not just as scary. The special effects with the mummy's ghost seemed to have not even been in the movie, as if someone had placed them during the production to give them up because the actors barely responded to them. <br /> <br /> The plot is just a kind of twist, which is the opposite of the actual storytelling. I think it was based on a French TV series, where they had to distill it after a two-hour movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is that a mummy is brought from the store in the Louvre, which apparently has such a poor security that this girl and her boyfriend can break into it several times. (That's how people keep stealing the Mona Lisa!) The 1960's version of this film and the police officer come together and try to drive the devil out. <br /> <br /> So, I'm not sure if this Mama was supposed to be a bad guy or not. He killed two guards in the course of the film, but he just wanted to come to the aftermath.
