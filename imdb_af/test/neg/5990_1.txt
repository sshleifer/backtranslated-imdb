I don't think I've seen a horror movie, bad since ... hell, I don't think I've ever seen a horror movie so bad. The action alone was enough to make one curl. The bad play went much further than horror movie cheesy. It was just terrible. And did you find that god terrible special effects? When the devil (who looked more like a cheaply bought doll) came out of the wall, I couldn't tell if I should be scared or my ass laughed. As a big fan of the horror genre, this movie was more than slightly disappointing. I can't help but notice the director comes from Portland, OR, which is just my own home town. I must say I'm deeply ashamed. If I could, I would give this movie a negative 500.
