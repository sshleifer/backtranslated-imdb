I doubt who wrote this script, ever read Mansfield Park ... or if they did, it wasn't very good. None of the characters are what they should be: Fanny is alive and aware of her abuse, while Sir Thomas, who treated her very well, accidentally fell into Tann Norris's personality. In addition, a first-person story of Fanny is highly inappropriate for both the story and her character. Fanny is not an entertaining heroine, and I would say she was not meant to be. In addition, in the movie version, Fanny flashes shamelessly with Edmund from the beginning when she was raised as a brother and sister! Austen's Fanny would have shrunk of any kind of flirt, and the novel paints the Fanny / Edmund mating as highly uncomfortable ... as it should be. Unlike other Jane Austen novels (P & P, Emma), Mansfield Park does not rest on the strength of its female protagonist. This is a very different kind of novel than the other; It is not meant to be a love story. I watched this movie because I just read Mansfield Park, and I'm absolutely shocked at what I see. Miss. Austen rolls into her grave.
