Indigenous Chief's son is unfairly accused of killing his father. The evil Witch Doctor orders him to run. He then comes back as a murder tree (!), Tabanga. Well, what can you say about such a "movie"? Of course, if it were meant to be a horror movie, there was some bad judgment involved. And for a comedy it's not funny enough yet. I don't know why people make movies like this. I think you really should be stupid to see it. Or you might want to see the amazing "monstrous" tree, giving a slow death a new dimension. Or maybe you want to check out the great acting skills of all involved. (Mrs. Kilgore!) Whether the dialogue and script that was weirdly ignored at the Academy Awards that year. <br /> <br /> "We shouldn't try psychoanalysis on the tree? Maybe his mother is afraid of oak trees."
