My friend and I rented this movie for 3.99 at blockbuster. If I knew how utterly horrible this movie would be, I wouldn't have paid a cent. I had no warning for these bs. The acting can't even be mentioned, the inevitable sex scene is uncomfortable and you can say that both girls feel completely uncomfortable doing this, and the male villain ... God, who can't tell he is going to attack Emily. And the musical cues ... my lord. This movie makes me want to cry. Never rent it. In fact, if you think about it, measure your eyeballs out. This movie is not from God - it is from hell. I'm just going to take the last few lines to write blah blah shiz, because I really don't want to continue with this review.
