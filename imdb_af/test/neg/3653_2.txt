I look out for this movie, it looks like someone who saw it loved it. I was totally disappointed. The acting was so exaggerated. The author seemed to have collected 25 different scripts from different movies and randomly selected a dialogue and nailed them to form one plagarized script. <br /> <br /> Spoilers: Was there any click in this movie? There was a mobstyle hit, homosexuality, prostitution, a serial killer, a fire, numerous Peter Wannabees, the main character in the love of the prostitute, cross-banding, police torture, Hannibal Lechter-style mutilation, I could continue. <br /> <br /> Line's like (the godfather going to the prostitute) <br /> <br /> - "Ben senin arik calismani istemiyorum" (I don't want you to work any more) <br /> - "Is calismasam kirayi kim odeyecek?" (Who would pay the rent if I didn't work) <br /> <br /> Unrealistic scenes: We never saw a single policeman during the ceremony scenes, but when the main character disappeared, his dad was through police picked up and tortured for weeks. <br /> <br /> The only way I can make sense of this whole movie is if the version I had was badly changed from the original. I definitely do not recommend it, and would love to discuss it with anyone who would like to do so. <br /> <br />
