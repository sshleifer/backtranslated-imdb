Mild spoilers below. <br /> <br /> The prospect of war was clearly on the horizon when TFW was filmed. From the opening show of European refugees to the final prediction that Nazi deaths will be millions of Germans, this movie is as much a propaganda movie as the films made to Pearl Harbor. There is not much entertainment here, although the fabric of the dustbin is interesting for those of us who are not old enough to remember. The rest of the plot is pretty forgotten with Herr Docktor Coburn - with a pretty bad accent - and daughter who assimilates with Wayne's help in America. Unlike the dustbin screens, the only memorable aspect of the movie is one that is best viewed. Coburn's speech comparing Naziism to a worse than cancer and describing the (then current) successes as an instantaneous burst of energy from a patient before death was eerily accurate and Varno's Dr. Scherer played accurately to justify the war news rule of unimportant Nazis. <br /> <br /> If viewed from a historical perspective, some aspects of TFW are interesting. If you see it for entertainment beyond World War II perspective, you should say it's one of Wayne's less successful attempts.
