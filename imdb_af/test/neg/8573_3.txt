I thought this movie is quite different from just another teenage skater. Well, I was completely wrong. There is a liquid nun that comes from the toilet seat and something really strange. I know Spanish culture is a bit different and their movies, but I didn't expect to see a fake Hollywood movie. They certainly did well. Why do they make a movie without any new aspects? It's just boring and it's done without any imagination. <br /> <br /> I thought a nun like the bad guy in the movie is something really original. It seems to be a teenage treasure. If it was done ten years ago, it would have been something new. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie to anyone, but it certainly has a comedy value! It's like a horror parody in some points.
