Shortly after the release of this film, Salman Khan was handed a 6-year jail sentence. (Read on to know why I call it.) <br /> <br /> And I had a sigh of relief. Not that I was happy. that he got jail for something because he was a celebration, but I was happy, it no longer means Salman Khan movies, no longer his histrionics and no more about hyped Acting (Read Overacting). <br /> <br /> This movie makes no sense. <br /> <br /> The scene where the child belonging to one of the families makes a rocket-activated rocket. According to the film script it would chase someone. But eventually it only finds Salman Khan Bare Chested. Well, that's what happened. <br /> <br /> The Rocked is activated in a different foolish way and you need a .001 IQ to believe it. Then it drives Salman Khan, who was on his water scooter and the chase continues, unless he has finished all the possible stunts he can show to foolish audiences. (In my opinion, all the people who gave this movie 5 or higher, unless they are paid.) <br /> <br /> Another awesome, amazing scene was all the marriage arrangements at the end. is made and Salman Khan comes in disguise with Govinda and beats the marriage through one of those highly unwanted songs. Later, though, everything is ready and ready to make a mere confession of govinda and Katrina Kaif to Katrina's Father and Bingo. Everything is good and Govinda marries Kartina. <br /> <br /> It made me wonder whether it was so easy to convince, why didn't they do it and we tortured us so much and wasted my money. <br /> <br /> This movie has to be avoided and doesn't even think it has any scene worth watching. The plot is also disconnected with characters that have not disappeared from where and finally. For the parents, Choota, who ... a waste of characters. <br /> <br /> After this movie I made a promise I wouldn't see Salman Khan Movies for the rest of my life unless it won an Oskar ... (hahahah ... which means I never look)
