Dear Mr. Seitzman, or who I may be responsible for. Seitzman does not meet his rightful fate to be eaten by Rabid Wolverines. <br /> <br /> I don't know you and can't comment on your character; For everything I know, you give to charity and help little old ladies across the street. Yet I have to insist that you never write another script as long as you live. Attach the pin, step away from the laptop! <br /> <br /> If you refuse to consider the pleas of brain injury, I have watched a movie or two in my life and I believe you will find my advice useful: <br /> <br /> 1. Do not include love scenes in which overthrown teenage boys call the body parts of their girls to American states. If you need to pin such a scene, don't call the breasts "New York" and "New Jersey". This causes unnecessary speculation about which cities are occupying the nipples. It's also almost incomprehensible, stupid and annoying. <br /> <br /> 2. Don't just rely on John Hughes movies to strengthen class differences. <br /> <br /> 3. Do not overhear the audience with exhausted clich√©s. Yes, yes, Kelley and Sam stand out in the rain, and it cleans them of caring. We'll get it. Yes, the roses bloom in Kelley's dead mother's greenhouse, even though every other plant has rotated. It is a symbol of their love. It is also very painful when administered by stump trauma to the back of our heads. For the love of God, Mr Seitzman, we get it. We all get it all over the country. Amish people, the hard of hearing, unborn babies - we all get it. <br /> <br /> 4. Don't require the actors to run mime rows. Ever. No, never. <br /> <br /> 5. Did I mention that you should relieve the trite symbolism? Because the audience can draw parallel between rebuilding the restaurant and building the relationship between Kelley and Sam without any help. Really. We'll get it. <br /> <br /> 6. Go through your script and make the following lines, and any lines that look like they are: "I don't know what we are." "I don't want to lose you." "He's just like the rest of them!" (And she followed, "Daddy, you don't even know him!") <br /> <br /> 7. Yes, yes, she's in heaven and running around in a field. We'll get it. <br /> <br /> 8. And in other news, we get it. <br /> <br /> For decades I've seen terrible movies in my life; I never expected to suffer for your art, and I would have just left the theater, but an elephant with the words "DOOMED LOVE" painted on his side fell off the air and drove me to my seat nailed. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, your writing bites, you owe me ten dollars and I hate you.
