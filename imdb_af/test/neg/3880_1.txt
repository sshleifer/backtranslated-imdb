Rs.30 / - is everything I paid for rent for the DVD of the movie and believe me it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Bollywood directors think the fool is funny? Well, it's not. Please grow. <br /> <br /> Here's a dialogue of the movie -'AGAR TUM LADKEE KOJJAT DOGE TO LADKEE TUMHE APNI IJJAT DEGI '. <br /> <br /> Plot is useless, criminals and police run to fools. This is it. BHAGAM BHAG. <br /> <br /> Well it did live the title, I had to run away from it. :) I switched to Star Movies and watch Home Alone 2 rather, and had a good laugh.
