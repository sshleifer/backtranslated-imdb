There are so many things wrong with this movie, I don't even know where to start. The story is not coherent at all. I guarantee that five minutes in the movie will scratch his / her head in confusion. <br /> <br /> Here's what I remember about the movie before I was bored in unconsciousness: A quasi-abused father chases some For teenage sisters through a home, but doesn't seem to be so abusive . In the next scene, the girls are about 15. They ride with their parents and hit a deer. The deer must have been explosive because the car inflates, one sister is dragging the other from the burning wreck. Then the girls float in a boat on a lake and make a big plan to go to Kentucky (?) And start a new life. In the next scene, the girls go to a military base. And what a military base it is. In fact, it is more like a pig farm to look like a military base, with many confused extras playing "soldiers". The basic commander's office is extremely nice, because there are random things like an AK-47 hanging on the wall and a chest sergeant mounted on a plaque (????) so the audience is sure it is a military man's office is. Then there are a few random dude driving a motorcycle and the commander instructs him to go into town to buy some porn mags, and to make sure the soldiers don't think he's on the "pink team" . " So our character takes a bakkie to look like a lower truck "to the village" and loads a box from an indescribable "bookshop" with a blower at the front door. The girls hide in the guy's truck when he stops gasing, and looks through the porn rush to find items like the "anal intruder." I think it's enough of the plot to scare away most people. Plot aside is the sound quality terrible and the movie is full of cocky attempts to be symbolic, like a radio preacher talking about forbidden fruit at the scene where the "Slutty" sister meets the main character for the first time, or how the camera lingers too long on certain shots to try to convey a "message". <br /> <br /> If you ever see buying or renting or whatever, stay away. It's not worth the money anyway.
