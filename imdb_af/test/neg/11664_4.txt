Everything you do in this world must at least make a little sense. Unfortunately, very little of "Delusion" makes sense. Jennifer Rubin is adept in her role as the lead of the hit, Kyle Secor. Secor on the other hand overworked to the point of annoyance. Jim Metzler, the eclipse yuppie, is very incredible like the beginner, revenge seeking, opponent. When Jennifer Rubin returns the money she has carefully concealed, all credibility flies out of the window, and the rifles that show the final jump between Secor and Metzler are impossible. Avoid "Delusion" unless you are disgusting enough to believe the wrong positive reviews here. - NOTE
