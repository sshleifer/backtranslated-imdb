This movie should be in the history of bad movies as the worst I have ever seen. It wasn't even a bad b movie. I would have appreciated it as a z. The special effects were ridiculous ... wrong if you could even call them special effects. I think the reviewer had previously hit the nail on the head ... it was the box that sold the movie, while the cover art was big and the synopsis intriguing (which both why I rented it) wasn't just wasting time but also applies. I didn't last long. I took it back to the store and eliminated it for another movie. I believe my local video store took it off the shelf because they had SOOOO many complaints about this terrible movie. My 6 year old could have done a better job filing / writing the script!
