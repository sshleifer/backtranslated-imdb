I really tried to keep "Saw". The story was good, and I admire the breakneck pass of the movie's shot. However, there were too many clich√©s and elements that, while watching "cool," they really had no sense. <br /> <br /> First, what I liked about the movie was the overall tone of the story, and I thought the point of departure was fantastic. The character of The Jigsaw Killer was intriguing and reminds me of the vintage Dario Argento. Danny Glover was excellent in his role as an obsessed detective, and Monica Potter was well in an ungrateful role as a doctor's abducted wife. Shawnee Smith's scene was incredible and both Wan and Whannell should be commended for using the scene as a demo to get the movie backdrop. The whole idea that the Jigsaw killer finds a way for his victims to kill himself is an excellent idea, but as soon as the film was underway, the logic started to get away. After showing that Zap was the one holding Gordon's wife and daughter hostage, it was clear he was not the Jigsaw killer, and part of it. The scene where he places a stethoscope at the heart of the terrible Princess, while Allison screams at him through her gag, was one of the most free scenes I've ever seen. It was supposed to cool, but nothing to create. Also, as the Jigsaw killer finds a way for victims to kill themselves, he has no problem cutting the throat of a police officer. I think it's a way of showing that he doesn't want to be caught and will go to any help needed to make sure it doesn't, but for me it just made no logic, especially if he didn't do not repent. The death of another detective (which I did so well would have been better if it was given to someone who actually deserved it.) <br /> <br /> I felt Leigh Whannell was good as Adam . It wasn't really a beautiful role, and he has a lot of potential as a character. However, I was not so fond of James Wan's direction. The story might have been original, but the direction was certainly not. I think I'm tired of fast, MTV-style tracks in favor of the old approach to directing, but many scenes involving the Jigsaw killer reminded me of "Se7en" too much. As the film progressed, it began to become a series of demo roles like "Hey, see what I can do." Instead of being intrigued, it became very distracting. But hey, it worked. He now manages "Final Destination 3" so that he is on the road to a successful career and I think he will be a top director in the coming year. <br /> <br /> What has it really done for me? the end. As I said, I knew the Jigsaw was not Zap, and I liked that Adam discovered the mini-band player after killing him. It would have had a tremendous end, except for one fatal error: I felt they should have left it where you didn't know who the murderer was. The way it was done was just done for one reason: boy, are we smart? Uh, no. It just didn't make sense to me. <br /> <br /> Some of the better horror movies are made for a reason, where there's a reason for the violence we see in the story. While "Saw" started very well, it started undone by the filmmakers' insatiable need to be "cool" and detract from the winning story they had. Perhaps, if they were not too urgent to make the films themselves, and relied on a more experienced terrorist director to stir them, I would think the classic horror would have been undeserved over the past four months. If this and "Cabin Fever" are the future of horror, I'm very scared.
