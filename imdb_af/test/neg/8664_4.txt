Mansfield Park, in its second half, is my favorite of Austen's novels, and Fanny Price, my favorite of her heroines, is so grieved by the unfortunate fate she suffered in her grand and small screen performances. The only good reading of the character I heard was done for the radio by Amanda Root, who gave it the same quality as she did the character Anne in the movie of "Persuasion": a strict, sure, cordial moral center. If the actress was younger, she would also be good visual decisions; but the Fannys who have so far reached our eyes have distinguished themselves respectively: Mary Crawford; Ruby the shoe girl girl; and (in this incarnation) a jovial ministry screen, or possibly a tart, with its high moral principles cut off a pen. <br /> <br /> Well, I was hoping for better, but feared worse. The series had a sturdy Edmund, in an actor who was the best in similar juice, and the perfect, ie perfectly horrible, wife. Norris; otherwise it was dull. The film, which was apparently intended as a deconstruction or another bad theater image, came out as a mixed burlesque. After such disappointments, and the more recent disappointments of the sisterhoods of this production (the new "Persuasion" and "Northanger Abbey"), I couldn't help but had mixed expectations for this one; and generally it made me feel a little better than not. It has condensed the novel intelligently, and at the same time I felt the same feeling, like a cartoon version possible. On the other hand, it had to rework most characters, except the Crawfords, and reduced or eliminated most or all of the most memorable things in the book, including the best-known character and what should be. This is not the best known scene. <br /> <br /> The character is the exuberant Tann Norris, always ready to lead other people in what to do, but always manage to prevent it from doing itself; here one doesn't make sense at all. And with her is very different: her comment cut by Fanny, "... considering who and what you are"; Mr. Thomas's discovery that she had banned Fanny a fire in her room all the years, and apologized to her; Fanny's honesty to visit at home during a visit to Tannie Norris, for all her mistakes, can better manage the household than one of her sisters. But then, the whole trip is missing from the story, and so most of what is going on at the theater rehearsals and most of what is Mr. Sir Thomas on his return. and in fact Sir Thomas and his wife are different from what they were. Above all, the scene in which Crawford proposes Fanny, one of Austen's most complex, is simplified into a bare narrative; Missing it, Fanny's sincere enforcement of what she knows is right, and what she probably knows is true, against all the distractions Crawford and anyone else can throw. To a male reader, now no less than when it is written, it is revealed with unprecedented clarity - unmatched, anyway, as far as I know - what a woman is going by trying to justly and firmly go with a man . has reason to distrust. It's a brilliant scene, in the novel; On TV, it's just a scene. <br /> <br /> And, Fanny, oh Fanny: when will we see you?
