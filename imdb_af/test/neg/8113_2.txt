A travel couple (Horton and Hamilton) stumble upon the village of Gatlin, where children have slaughtered the adults and are always willing to kill more, under the way they are divorced, and Peter Horton must of course save his wife from these tiring. terribly thick in this very bad adaptation of one of King's best short stories. In the original story, King managed to create excitement and characterize his characters, but it has already shed off production and everything left over is a repetitive drill that is too predictable to be all the tension. Also, the effective ending used in the story is dumped in favor of a happy ending that makes the overall impact mute. There is a little atmosphere and stylish directing, but no plot to make any of it. The children are also undeniably convincing. <br /> <br /> 1/5 Matt Bronson
