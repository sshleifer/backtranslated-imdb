For a while I was on shows like Ghost Hunters and Destination Truth and things, although I thought they were full of shit, I found them interesting and entertaining. That's why we look at entertainment TV. It is nice to switch off your brain and believe that every shade captured on camera is not just a shadow, but an insane asylum related painful spirit or something, as long as you can later go to the real world return. <br /> <br /> To say this, enjoy the paranormal state more than just closing your brain. It requires you to regularly consume lead in large doses at high doses, then have repeated head trauma, and then take up huffing in your teens. Then you have to get drunk and drunk. <br /> <br /> Paranormal state is beyond the pseudoscience (which I can enjoy with some critical thinking) that you will find on Ghost Hunters (which I still find to be reasonably interesting and entertaining program) this pseudo ... everything. <br /> <br /> The show follows the adventures of a group of students from Penn State University (not confused with the University of Pennsylvania) Ryan Buell when practicing it to exert demons and spirits with using ceremonies of what religion looks the most dramatic (from Catholic outbursts performed by fellow college students to Wiccan game thrown by socially uncomfortable goths, to Native American cleansing rituals credit, it is run by native Americans) If you believe in Wicca whether you are a Catholic or a follower of a traditional Native American religion, I think you would like to have their rituals that are free from someone who ... is not a malicious university student. I do not remember the scene in the exorcist where the priests threw their hands and said "it was not used! Call a state school after school. This one is too much for us. They probably read the Wikipedia article. about exorcisms. "The show is frankly insulting to the viewer's intelligence. Ryan talks about PRS (the Paranormal Research Association) and says that when he comes to Penn State (note that you don't see shows where the host says the same thing, but instead of Penn State, he says he "Then I at MIT come "or" After I got my theoretical physics degree ... ") he found other people with the same interest in the paranormal. He says they are sometimes "warriors". I remember when I pretended to be a fighter and I fought spirits. I was six. Then the emotional Ryan brings out the flamboyant and unpleasant Chip Coffey, who pretends to be in trance and owned by cussing at the cast. Awesome. I thought people had a sense of how ridiculous the idea of ​​psychic and medium was after "Crossing Over" went out of the way. The show takes itself too seriously, as this small group of common misfits pretends to be struggling with an old, cosmic evil. Production values ​​are low, stories are boring, and unlike Ghost Hunters, who will occasionally have something deviant (although likely to be clarifying but interesting) on ​​their equipment, PS must believe that the sounds and cracks they hear provide evidence of demons, ghouls, and possibly leprechauns. The only thing scary about this show is that there are people who take it seriously. The only thing that is paranormal about this is that people can make every episode on it while keeping straight face. <br /> <br /> Call me, but I feel like the great secrets of the universe and the afterlife is too big to be solved in a half-hour TV program by a journalism undergraduate at a state school. <br /> <br /> All that is said, I strongly recommend that everyone at least watch this show, if for no other reason than the mere entertainment that is viewed from a truly horrible movie or TV show. Or you can make it a drinking match. I think the second would be preferable.
