This is the biggest example I can think of to prove the theory that when Hollywood comes out of good ideas, they make a terrible successor and destroy the first one. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the first Beastmaster; I even liked the third, but this movie is horrible. I am a great fantasy / sword and wizard movie fan and I hated to see such a terrible successor of such a classic as the first Beastmaster. So why do I hate this movie so much? Well, where do I start? First of all, the whole idea of ​​the movie is ridiculous. Dar and his evil older brother, Arklon (who was not mentioned in the first film anywhere)? Crossing into our world via a handy dimensional time gate. You see, Earth just happens at the same parallel interdisciplinary level as Dar's world. While you were leading the first movie, you think the movie just happened in the past, but with this one you showed it was quite a different world ... it's just one of the many things I hated about it . successor. It didn't work with "Masters of the Universe" and it doesn't work here either! Movies like this should happen and stay in their own timeline and their usual environment. To Christ's will, what's next? Hercules in New York ... there, uncle .. example! To continue ... <br /> <br /> Arklon called a device a neutron detonator to use as a threat to his enemies to rule his own kingdom. So, it is for Dar, his ferrets, his eagle and his tiger (not a spray paint this time) to go down and save the world ... but on the way they have the help of a young, cool, And the hip Senator's daughter caught up in this mess and showing Dar on LA, shows him for a while in her BMW and helps him out of difficult situations. How convenient right? And if appropriate, I found it very convenient and easy for Arklon to sneak into a highly guarded military base and get away with a stolen, highly destructive nuclear weapon ... even with half of the American army and LAPD behind him .... waaaaay easy even for an evil barbarian wizard of another world. There are so many potholes in this I don't know where to start; as why did Arklon go to the L.A. Zoo for the end of the movie?! He has absolutely no reason to go there; And wouldn't it be like the last place you will lure your greatest enemy, which just so happens that you have the convenient ability to control animals? <br /> <br /> And you don't just like these movies where the police are portrayed as total idiots and even with a half-dozen police shooting at one man, they still fail to beat him? Police in this movie are in the series "Police Academy"! They are about as useful in this movie as reading glasses are for the blind! Even the title of the movie doesn't make sense: "Beastmaster 2: Through the Portal of Time" ... they never actually went through a "time" portal because the movie is not in the future of Dar's world not fixed. a parallel world next to us in the astral plane, so that they never actually go through time, just a dimensional world beside theirs; so NO real time trip is not at all! This movie is trying to come out so funny and doesn't ... not because of the humor, but because it's just as bad ... and it's soft. The acting, dialogue, plot, characters and ending are all so cute, it's hilarious. What else can I expect from the man who brought us "Return of the Swampthing" (another bad successor)? Gone miss here is Don Coscarelli's wonderful direction and serious feeling of the first one !! Avoid this stinky piece of garbage like the bubonic plague and keep the first and maybe the third as there is nothing better on T.V. is not.
