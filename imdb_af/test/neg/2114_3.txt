Just look at the first one and it's very stupid. I first watched an episode of Bones and then the eleventh hour. The 11th hour must be ashamed. <br /> <br /> It's so weak. Stewart introduces himself as a state scientist. No mention of what kind of scientific just general sciency things. In a cloning program they bring a caretaker who has been paid to sell unsuccessful embryos to a church and kneels before the image of Jesus on the cross and asks for forgiveness ... and also tells them where the bad man is like they can move the plot. Now it's science at work :( <br /> <br /> There's a stupid, not good stupid, where Picard rages on a TV advertising the screaming scream that makes you look younger and screams: "This is a lie ", like its Random female assistant grabbed by the local hot bobbie next door. <br /> <br /> The end of the first episode is like a bad cartoon where the bad old lady named Pinnochios Daddy to move the concise plot., waves at Picard out of the street as she comes in a taxi. Picard is one floor and looks out of a window that is capricious ... she's gone. or maybe the police call or maybe get the taxi's number and call if it has anything other than ... I venture and now get into a taxi and there's nothing you can do about it until next week ends. .. mahhahahahah. </ br /> <br /> Sorry this is so stupid. At one stage a sad father is convinced by Picard that even if a replica clone is born, it will never be his son if his son had a soul. hat's real people. The general scientist argues against cloning on the basis that each soul is unique and why you want to clone otherwise. <br /> <br /> Although the general scientist Picard finds that he clones a little thirsty, he is all for stem cell research and goes so far as to say that the disaster will overtake humanity if it is not allowed. He has a spicy rant on how important it is. Of course, he does not call a single example. This kind of sum up the show. Buzz words and tawdriness.
