I found Shuttle an amazingly frustrating movie to watch. It starts pretty well and moves faster to the first 'injury' (which is a yolk). Then it becomes very lazy and endorsed as a story. This was the case of the plot that managed the characters and not the characters managing the plot. If you hate a movie where you can't understand why characters do what they do, you will release Shuttle. In particular, the last act is strange and resembles a world without common sense. Also at the end, one of the characters confessed a previous crime to her friend, rather than generating sympathy for the audience, most people started giggling. This was probably because the 'heroines' of the story were complete idiots. Ultimately, there is an end that just seems "shocking" and comes from the horrible cop-out school of "people is bad, heard, just accept it without any explanation". <br /> <br /> Shuttle isn't good or bad, but mediocre. And irritating.
