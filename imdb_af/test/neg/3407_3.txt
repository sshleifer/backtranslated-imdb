I like to watch a good gory giallo. Unfortunately, SOLANGE is definitely not one of them. It's long. Very long. The story is tough and makes very little sense, though very clear. The writing spends so much time on the murders and girls, but it spends almost no time on the murderer. It leaves a big hole in the story: we may see a lot of young women hanging out, but we get zero characterization of why the killer decided to kill those girls. Yes, what happened to Solange is terrible, but we still have a lot left in the dark when, why did the [boring] murderer decide it was worth it to tackle the cute naughty girls. It's all so confronted that I couldn't find one thing. <br /> <br /> Regarding the movie, it's boring again. Nothing memorable about it. The actors? Boring. The script? Laughably boring. The whole "cruel" love affair between the teacher, the blonde and the student was really embarrassing. On which planet do they live? The music? Boring. Skip it.
