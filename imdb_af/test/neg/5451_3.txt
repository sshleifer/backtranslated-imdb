I wish it was "Last Dumb Thriller". But exciters are like that. They are like children: numerous, illogical, and often annoying. They want to be taken so desperately seriously, but what is there to act seriously about a child's behavior or a vibrator's plot? After seeing this particular child, I mean ... thriller - I understand why judges call it a "hitchcockian thriller"; they can also call it "idiot" because that is what "hitchcockian" means in the movie dictionary (see if you don't believe me). Even the soundtrack is old-school Hollywood, which is a mistake: it doesn't fit a late 70's movie and makes it ugly. Besides, how dare they steal De Palma's idea of ​​stealing Hitchcock? The story is absurd. Scheider's wife is dead, and her murderers are never a problem. Instead, his former employers first followed him and decided to kill him later. Why do they decide to kill him? No explanation. Maybe because the FBI is a dark, dark organization ("X-Files") that is much happier to beat its former pension fund employees. Or maybe because it's fashionable to kill Scheider in this movie; everyone looks at him. And while the poor, unsuspecting viewer is trying to figure out the mystery by assuming logically that there is a great conspiracy, the murderer is actually ... Janet Margolin! Yes, the woman who occupies the residence of Scheider; The one who briefly indicated she was "depraved". Why does she go to Scheider at exactly a time when his wife was murdered and does he feel paranoid - and followed by his own former employers - and not a few years earlier or years after the woman's murder? A pure hitchcockian (look it again in the dictionary, if you forget what it means). And how about that brilliant motive of her ...! Her grandmother was forced into prostitution when she was a 15-year-old virgin in NY, then filmed by a bunch of horny Jewish men, one of whom - tah-dah! - is Scheider's grandfather. As a result, Margolin, under her spare time, played a hooker to kill all the descendants of the men who had so cruelly identified her one-time grandmother. How hitchcockian (look up) is it? The final then slides off the Mount Rushmore scene from "North By Northwest", except that the love interest is a killer and she is not saved. <br /> <br /> The movie also offers some dubious-chatter dialogue and some not-so-great acting. Look at the stupid and obvious way Napier Scheider follows the cemetery. Let's not forget Napier's moronic plot device that has reached his jacket and kept his hand very suspicious - but it wasn't a gun! How brilliant! Napier in the tower: now there are some illogical behavior patterns. J. Demme was, and will always be, a director without style, without flair, and the man who directed "Philadelphia". Let's give him another Oscar!
