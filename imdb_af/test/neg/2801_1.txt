It may be the worst of the worst. I'm a big fan of the horror movie industry and I believe this movie is allowed to be made. The acting was young and the story completely idiotic. The camera work was also young. One scene that comes up is outside a store. It's night and you can see the moon, but the characters all have shadows that throw on the wall. There was no street light to be seen. One character is guted at one point, but later manages to resurrect after removing her from a post. Come on !!! It felt like I was playing a middle school. I kept waiting for the characters to go to their relatives from the camera and mouth "hi ma". I can only give it two positive comments ... it ended and it was good for a laugh. Please do not rent this movie !!
