I am an animator myself and a whole buff of the medium, so when I saw this movie in a $ 5 bin, I thought it was a shot I wanted to add to my collection. While I never regret having a new addition to my animation library, this movie was definitely disappointing. <br /> <br /> The premise has enough potential. A penguin named Hubie finds the perfect stone to give to the girl he loves than the penguin that is similar to an engagement ring, but before he can give it, he is thrown out by an evil rival and on lost sea. He also touches another penguin that helps him get his way home. The setup is not good, but it's enough to set up a fun adventure. Unfortunately, the duo's exploitation never really has much and it gets pretty repetitive. Most of the situations in which they find themselves are really uninspired and lacking in creativity ... and the commitment of the two among them is bare and forced. <br /> <br /> Animation is good, but not to Don Bluth's usual standards. This is the man who gave us the secret of Nimh, country ahead of time and an American story, all of which had attention to detail that Disney often, the grandfather of feature animation, often surpassed. The music is good, but beautifully forgotten and the voice players are all wasted talent ... Martin Short is especially wasted here as the main character. Speaking in spite of a bumbler, is almost a straight man throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> In short, the movie is likely to appeal to very small children, but a good family movie should act at all ages and unfortunately it doesn't have what it needs.
