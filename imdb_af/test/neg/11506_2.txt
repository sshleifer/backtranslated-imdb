When this show came to Disney for the first time, I love it all the time. It soon became one of my favorite Disney programs, but this show somehow turned into something that is disturbing and disappointing. <br /> <br /> Now I find one of the second and third season fun, they look like a re-look at some teen shows. I got that garbage. The first season was very unique because it showed Sadie who loved science and animals and creatures. The first season was very entertaining. I don't usually like the second season because of Ben. He irritates me and makes me mad. The plot in the second season also sucks and is just awful
