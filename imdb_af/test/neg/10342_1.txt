Far from the combination of the best pieces of Pontypool and 28 days, they managed to ignore it. While they are scandalously copying. (If that makes sense?) Pontypool was different and gradually increased, it didn't stink. The Radio DJ, "we must stay on the air", spends no time on the air. He sits on his bottom and watches the TV for news. This is by far the worst excuse for a zombie movie ever. Is there a single person in the US or indeed the world who doesn't know what a zombie is? Or ever heard of the word "zombie"? Well, by the 50th minute, this group of misfits still calls the zombies, the infected people or those with "rabies". The word "Zombie" can later make a guest look, I can take less care. Maybe there is a copyright where you have to pay to use certain words? As the Bluetooth tab, called the "over-thing", you don't kid yourself! To finish, no plot + no acting = no one cares. A waste of time, a shameless, poorly executed rip-off.
