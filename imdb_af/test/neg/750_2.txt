My first very disappointing BBC / Jane Austen movie. The sound is off, the costumes are off, the hair is off, the music is from outer space and Robert Hardy, blessing him, seems to be really annoyed to be in such a stinker. Even the casting is off. No, I take it back, a good director can make such a soft purse out of a sigh. The performances in this thing are so over and melodramatic that it is almost a row of a Jane Austen story, which is ironic since Northanger Abbey is a kind of tribute to the early Gothic novel. I wanted to blow the female lead after a while; who made the decision that she would be such a neck? I had to see Pride & Prejudice ('95) immediately to get the bad taste out of my mouth. Wow!
