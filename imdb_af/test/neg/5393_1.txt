Like many, this thick hop caught my eye while I was channel navigation. It's a horror movie, which is in the bush, it has a stupid title, but hey "Michael Rooker" is in it, and he was part of some big horror movies, I know he won't send me wrong. .. Ugh! The most offensive part of this is that I actually watched it. I see director Johnny Martin is a stuntman. Well, this stunt is just struggling and how he got the actors to do this watery gut movement is the greatest secret of all. I can understand Casper Van Dien, but be ashamed of your Rooker. Your good name in the horror community is stunned forever, and your agent must be fired immediately. I'm sure this neck tide of faecal matter is available on DVD, but if you enjoy the .99 cent menu at McDonalds, you'll get more for your money there.
