I will leave it to my bettors, and I am better off gape and gawk at this wonderful wonderful movie, and just say I thought it was beating. The big aspect of this site is that you always get a variety of views and look at them anyway. No telling what you will get out of the movie. For me, those who have seen through the simplicity and the kind of it have my money. There was one, perfectly dead, when he pointed out the two great moments of the thing belonging to Pacino. The meeting and the airport. Other than that, well, that wastes time. All in all. Pacino just does the same thing over and over and over, he would have been better served by picking up the show about five heels at about the level of his protégé. Everyone always says, but this movie could have been so much better. Sure they could all have been. But most of them just never had to be made. Including this one.
