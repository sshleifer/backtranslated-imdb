My wife and I both remember this movie is much better than it is. When we rented it last weekend, we wondered if we watched the same movie we saw 22 years or so ago. We both agreed that we probably remembered the TV series, which in its one-hour segments was forced to actually collect plot lines. This movie leaves many loose threads, as mentioned by others here ... basically every main character's story line is unresolved. <br /> <br /> Gotta like the title song, though.
