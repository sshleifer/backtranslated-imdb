In its core, it is a fairly typical revenge West, heavy on the spaghetti, and if you follow it as such, the protagonist comes by successfully defeating the biggest villain. However, there is so much going on, it doesn't affect the story that you have to wonder about what the filmmakers are thinking about. I'm referring to things like the way Miss Rosie's song number just appears from the box and the boxing game in the middle of the town. OK, they have a loose connection with the influence of villain Mash Flanagan, but why does he suddenly come up with an alias - Mr Donovan. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I thought it was quite innovative how the camera that showed the wounded Wallach's view of the trail could be filmed by someone with a real bullet in his shoulder. And was it not as good as Donovan's girl used the old headache routine when he was a little fresh? Don't let me forget the big stunt work by the gravel pitcher, as Wallach drops them as part of the final. <br /> <br /> There was one thing, though, and I had the whole movie for it. What happened to the trio of hats that Flanagan / Donovan rent near the start of the picture? You know, the old Martel wants to hire a funeral company for his gun movement, the devil's henchman Mitchell with the gun, and the meswinger Lincoln Tate. Each one had a five thousand dollar head on, and they had to protect Donovan from the man who survived the opening scene of the massacre. They have never been heard again! I like to think that maybe Donovan just killed them and kept the 15K all to himself.
