The movie made no sense to me. Good actors (SergioCastellittoaparticular favorite; he was wonderful in "Uomo DelleStelle" / "TheStarmaker", but it was made by Giuseppe Tornatore, an Italian director as opposed to the mediocre one who made this effort), but terribly frightening writing, horrible editing, and a director who seems to have no idea what he is trying to say and finally says nothing. Incredible rubbish, but the kind of movie that some Italian pseudo-intellectuals, who were my misfortune to know in the dull and distant past, would have loved it, and unfortunately Italy has no monopoly on this. They can be found anywhere and probably. recognize it as a great masterpiece. I never thought of Bellochio as a director. I remember seeing his first film "PugniNella Tasca" / "Fist in the Bag" (or a similar title) in Rome when it was first shown 50 years ago (I have the time). All the usual pseudos talked about it, but it blew me cold. I didn't think he was much of a director, and still not. Age certainly did not improve him and this film should be considered one of his worst.
