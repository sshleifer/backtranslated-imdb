Good old Jess Franco! The always trustworthy choice of director in case you are looking for careless sleaze, shameless exploitation and 200% gratuitousness. Jess once again outdone himself with this completely trashy piece of jungle "adventure". Let's watch it, this movie is basically just an excuse to have the surprisingly hot (and minor) actress Katja Bienert. It's actually a bit of a disturbing thought that an innocent 16-year-old girl needs a movie show before a whole crew and especially before Franco's apparent eyes! And it wasn't even the first time, because the duo had previously made Linda together. Anyway, just wondering: YES, "Kilimanjaro diamonds" have a plot, even though it is a very incredible one. During the opening round, an airplane flying aboard a wealthy Scottish man and a girl aboard an African tribe of vegetarian cannibals. I say vegetarian because they never try so much to use human flesh at one stage in the film. The trivial shot declares himself the Great White Leader and the girl grows into the beautiful and scarcely dressed White Goddess. A few years later, an expedition reached the middle of the jungle to get the girl back to civilization and ?? More importantly - stealing some of the legendary diamonds of the tribe. It could be a compelling and action-packed adventure movie, but Jess Franco can't be bothered. Why shoot jungle pursuits or bloody cannibalistic rituals when you can easily strive for a hot young chick sitting naked in a tree? Most of the jungle institutions simply look in someone's garden and there's a massive amount of awkward National Geographic Wildlife stuff to fill the gaps in continuity. The back of the DVD describes "Kilimanjaro Diamonds" as an inventive, feminist and mature-oriented version of Tarzan. Yeah right, they just put that sense there because Katja Bienert's character swings from one tree to another with a few times.
