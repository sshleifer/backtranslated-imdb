OK this movie was much worse than the first one and the first one sucked! The zombie makeup was extremely fake! The acting is very poor! And it doesn't follow the first one! Looking at it, I thought wow, the first one is a masterpiece compared to this one. I'll say it's caught on TV, don't spend your money on it! It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's on the list. I started watching last night and fell asleep, and I watched it today and almost fell asleep again! The plot was useless. I think I get the fact that a small military group is being sent on a mission to get the blood of the main bomb and bring it back so they can use it to save lives and stop zombies, but they made it where you wanted to kill everyone. They made many bad guys who were really just annoying. If you ask me, it is a deterrent to residents' evil and not a good coaching. The plot could have made it if the acting was good and if they actually scared you to see behind the corner. With these zombies my grandmother could have gone in that building and survived! from a 1-10 I give it a 2.
