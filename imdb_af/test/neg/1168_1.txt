My reasoning to view this movie (despite being free) was more or less out of curiosity ... a little curiosity. I was not all familiar with this straight-to-biographical "biographical" account of Mr. Gein and discovered during the opening credit that it featured horror icon Kane Hodder in the lead. My emotions have not just turned curiosity, but now a glamor of gentle anticipation of how his portrayal of Gein would come out. Also in the credits (among some grim photos of Ed's crimes) were Michael Berryman and Priscilla Barns. "Okay," I thought to myself ... "It can be soft." As the movie begins and progresses (slowly), my microscopic confidence (or as I call it, "micro-hope") for this movie has completely disappeared and I was stuck with an overwhelming sense of humiliation, because I had died ill. Well-known and respected for his previous work as an unstoppable serial killer, Hodder puts it uncomfortable in the game - turning Eddie Gein from a light way into a jack-up, full-blown murder machine. He sneaked into the night and buried burial guards, his big-robbed girlfriend and teenage girls. Plainfield is in a panic, because the local sheriff's department seems to be doing nothing to adjust the dangerous situation to the least. The deputy and his mother had a warm, small relationship that gave me a vague feeling (or it could just be the cyanide pill I caught halfway through this turkey). I'm not sure what the point of this movie was and of course the director didn't know anything about the subject he was working on. There are already so many movies about Gein's story that, unless the "Ed Gein Snuff Footage" is discovered, I don't want to see these on the shelves anymore. If you want a more authentic movie of this nature than to see 2001's Ed Gein (aka In the Light of the Moon), "he said.
