I was entertained to see that some of the reviews were attended here by ** SPOILERS ** the joke in my family is that the only part of this movie not given on the back of the box is in the title. Maybe I'm just a dense American 17 year old who wouldn't know art if it bitten me in the leg, but I prefer movies that contain at least a few words. This movie makes the second half of 2001: A Space Odyssey spoken right. This movie is just as slow, it's not even art, it's just boring. We follow this creepy man who follows this boy around Venice. The end was incomprehensible until I read the end of the book. A movie should not refer you back to the book, but should stand alone. This movie can't stand. It doesn't even have the legs of a plot to lean on.
