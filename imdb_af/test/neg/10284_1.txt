I'm not bothered by the messy armies, nor am I bothered by the cynical, self-righteous attitude of the makers of this crap. <br /> <br /> What I'm bothering about is that the vast majority of episodes are fake. I won't even be surprised if ALL the episodes are staged. So it's not a reality show, but something worse than Oprah: garbage television with zero comma zero appeal. Like daily TV soap opera, but with more action and fighting and less plot. <br /> <br /> The premise would have been great - if only executed without cheating the viewer. If this idea was just free of all the legal complications / bumps that would definitely arise as a result of what would happen to real people and eventually broadcast. Therefore, the only way to create this "" reality show is to make some "" desperate actors and improvise them (and what a pitiful and unconvincing improvisation it is most of the time!). Most obvious to anyone who has graduated from school? Most of the reviews I read here do not even say that any of these are fake, let alone that it may be all. Desiring thinking or just unlimited naivety? > <br /> The actors hired in this pathetic show are the kind of unemployed actors who don't wait for tables, eagerly waiting for a call from a talk show (or this crap). got a chance to make a few hundred bucks, I even recognized one actress (in the role of a cheater) who I saw years earlier in the Jerry Springer Show, and I only have 6-7 episodes of "Cheaters "How many more of these loser actors are there in Springer and Cheaters that I am." not even know? <br /> <br /> To compare, however, "Cheaters" with Springer is not fair to the latter. The Springer show is not all fake; Much of the episodes are indefinite - often highly entertaining. There is no value in "Cheaters" unless you are a struggling actor and want to get tips on not working at the camera. <br /> <br /> The producers use several (very cheap, transparent) tricks to create the illusion of reality, to give their material the feelings of the elusive documentary. But that's all in the year. In the end, the more intelligent train-wreck-looking viewer has been left with absolutely squats. "Professional wrestling" has more credibility than this.
