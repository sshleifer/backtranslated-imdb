In view of the subject, I thought this movie would be at least enjoyable if it were a bit short of a masterpiece. I was wrong. I've still been waiting for something to happen and it's done. I thought the final was the bit that happened before it became exciting. The only reason I gave it 2 instead of 1 is because the stockholders deserve a degree of recognition.
