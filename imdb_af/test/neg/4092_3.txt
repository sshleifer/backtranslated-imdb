The biggest problem with this movie is that it is nothing like Bruce Allmighty. The first movie played on every daydreamer's fantasy to control the environment as it seems good. However, Evan's experience is completely different. He has none of the control with which Jim Carrey wanders and instead is the story of the power of faith. Now it would have been good, as the first movie preached the same message. The problem is that the successor preaches at the expense of comic relief. And adding insulting to injuries also throws the politics in the plot. You get the clear sense that there is a clear message with this movie, and it's the main goal not to make you laugh. To sum it up, this movie failed mix of Eddie Murhphy's "The Distinguished Gentleman" and Charlton Heston's "The Ten Commandments". I'm not sure if Steve Carrell is guilty of this, but you get the feeling that it's his character that limits his ability as a comedian. Former news anchor Evan Baxter is not supposed to be funny, he is basically an antagonist made in a protagonist. which in this case only causes the confusion of what this movie message is supposed to be about.
