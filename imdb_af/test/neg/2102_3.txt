Snakes on a train start with the Mexican couple Brujo (A.J. Castro) and Alma (Julia Ruiz) cross the border into the US. They then illegally drive a seventeen hour train to Los Angeles. Alma's family, however, did not approve of her and Brujo's relationship and placed an old black magical curse on her that turned all her inside into snakes, isn't it a life? As the snakes go out of Alma's mouth and move away to other parts of the train, they begin to infect the other passengers with the same unusual ailment. <br /> <br /> Edited and directed by the Mallachi Brothers (although the IMDb claims it's just one man using a pseudonym, Peter Mervis). One has to say that I thought snakes were on a train, it's as simple as it really is. It seems as if the entire movie was drafted and made to cash on the Samuel L. Jackson cult fly Snakes on a Plane (2006) by every horror fans least favorite production company the Asylum specializing in rounding off big budget Hollywood flicks & that style of Money and movie making is no longer clear as here with Snakes on a Train, and makes a movie just because the title rhythms with a more successful movie are not a good starting point. Eric Forsberg's script is rubbish, for a start snakes on a plane were very nice, while snakes on a train are much more serious and if you actually break it down and look at it, it should be much lighter. In fact, it would probably have worked better than a Scary Movie (2000) type spoof. You know something, I'm struggling to find one positive thing about snakes on a train, it's so bad. For a start, the character is a garbage and it is impossible to emulate anyone. The story is terribly horrible and doesn't make sense (if people are rinsing those little snakes, where are the adults coming from? Why did Alma get into the giant snake Why did Bujo kill the train driver? How will he stop the train as soon as it goes Los Angeles came? Where did the typhoon come from?), It's too serious, the first seventy minutes are so boring and unpleasant I'm surprised I woke up and it's just a very, very poor movie on about every level. <br /> <br /> Director Mervis has just a few train vehicle models that all look so good the movie gets very repetitive and dull to look at. There are scarce blood or gore, there are a few snakes that lend under a few people's skin, someone is shot and it's about. The special effects are also garbage, the huge CGI snake at the end is really awful and least said about the better. It's not scary, there's zero atmosphere and it's a bit of a drill from start to finish. The real living snakes are also a problem, they are just as dirty and non-threatening. Looking at a scene with a real snake and an actor, the snakes never make a move to them or act aggressively and seem to always move in the opposite direction. <br /> <br /> Shooting in California technically the film is of course low budget and it shows, basically it looks cheap because it is. The acting is not good, not that the actor gets any material to work with. <br /> <br /> Snakes on a train are rubbish, it's a pity, but that's how I feel and I don't quite know. how to describe it differently. I really can't see what anyone would get to see Snakes on a Train, it's really that bad.
