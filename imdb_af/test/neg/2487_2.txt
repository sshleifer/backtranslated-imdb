Propagated documentary trying to sci-fi films of the 1950s and how they touched (and reflected) America. Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Ridley Scott and James Cameron are being led and Mark Hamill told. <br /> <br /> Very terrible. The "insights" given are nothing new - for example - the Cold War and the threat of nuclear war have affected a whole generation of children. Good duh! They are trying to cover all the different sub-genres of sci-fi films of the 1950s - the big movie films, space movie invaders, etc. It's good, but they choose the most obvious movies and they were killed. already. It was cool to see clips of the "Rocketship XM", "Destination Moon", "Forbidden Planet", "The Thing" and "The Day the Earth Stold Still", but everything the directors said was so incredibly clear For any viewer it is offensive. Even though it was less than an hour, I was bored for 30 minutes. It gets a 2 for some of the clips, but nothing else.
