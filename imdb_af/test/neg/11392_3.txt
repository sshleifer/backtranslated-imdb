This strange little movie begins with the story of Bruno (Alex Linz) in a Catholic school that has no friends and knocks every day. He likes to wear dresses and his obese mother Angela, who is a dressmaker, doesn't think they're wrong with what her son likes. Angela complains to Mother Superior (Kathy Bates), but is ignored and if the two of them return to their car, they are harassed by the other children and peeled with eggs. Bruno's father, Dino (Gary Sinise), is divorced from Angela and is completely disgusting because his son is a villain and virtually denies him. Bruno meets a new student at the school called Shawniqua (Kiami Davael) who is a free spirit and dresses like Annie Oakley with petrol guns. Angela has a heart attack and Bruno's grandmother intervenes to care for him when Dino refuses. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a very hard and unsympathetic look at all the characters involved. Angela has a lot to do with Bruno wearing dresses, as she encourages him practically. Dino was told when he was with his mother a boy that he was a sissy because he liked opera and he refused to help Bruno when he needed it. The Catholic school attending Bruno is very unwavering and all the kids run and even Shawniqua calls the N word. As soon as Shirley MacLaine steps in the movie increases and becomes more family-oriented (to speak). **** SPOILER ALERT **** The end to spelling bees is incredibly confronted and "feels good". Hugs and shouts for Bruno as reporters follow him and take his photo for their papers. All the time Shirley MacLaine has acted like the "tough old broad" who snaps at all. There is one thing about MacLaine's character in the movie that no one in this comment has and relates to the masculine nature of her. I think Helen's character can be a lesbian! She is very strong and strong and at one point in the film she shares a whiskey whistle with Bruno and smokes a cigar at the same time. I don't remember anyone in the movie she mentioned who was her husband or if she was ever married! That's why I think her character can be gay. Many other good actors also appear in the film. Joey Lauren Adams, Jennifer Tilly, Brett Butler, Gwen Verdon and Lainie Kazan all had a better look at the screenplay before signing. I think when they heard that MacLaine was claiming it was an honor to be part of it. Very difficult to feel any remorse or understanding for any of the characters and the subject is probably impossible for most to know. The actors are not bad, but what was MacLaine purposeful for? Tolerance to a young boy who wants to wear dresses and freedom of expression? We get it in the first 10 minutes, the rest of the time I tried not to ring.
