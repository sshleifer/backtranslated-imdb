I read several reviews asking the question, "Why was this movie made?" I found myself asking the question in my mind, because the hour and twenty minutes seemed to be near the middle of just giving the feeling that it was picking up steam at the end, when it was in fact nothing of the kind . So, "Why was this movie made?" I think it's a wonderful question for those who look at Heftig and are thrilled to ask themselves. This judge is proud of director Knut Erik Jensen to give us this powerful image of hope, brotherhood and inspiration with this male choir, but I don't think Jensen did enough to bring a pleasant story to the table. Let me ask you this question, "Do members of the audience need more in a documentary than just a direct story to keep interest?" My answer is yes, and that is where Jensen failed. Vigorous and enthusiastic was a good documentary, but it was far from great. Jensen did a terrible job with the story and dedication of the subjects. It was great to hear the songs, but over time, those songs were boring, overwhelming, and a bit transient. From the opening scene where our husbands sing their hearts into a blinding snow, I knew I was addicted, but as the film evolved, I lost interest. Why? Jensen never took us, the audience members, to the next level. He kept the playing field level and eventually hurt the overall tone of the movie. Was it a movie about the music or about the men in the choir? The world may never know. <br /> <br /> Again, I want to say that Jensen has done a phenomenal job of finding an interesting story about this group of men who have certainly seen difficult times and how they handled music, but it was as if whole male choir was a bunch of the most boring men ever created. Jensen gave us the music excellently, but it was the characters, the subjects, that I didn't know at the end of the film. In the mix we had a 97-year-old man who still had his driver's license. We had a great man in a bath singing classic American songs. We had old men who were earlier in their youth. We had tension between the youth of the choir and the veteran singers, and we even had a former drug addict who had been clean for eleven years. Did Jensen develop these interesting stories? No, he left them on the table. It was clear that these singers were willing to talk about it further (see the political man who missed his political days), but Jensen apparently hid from those warm moments and straight back to interesting places he could sing the choir. For me, the music was defined at the beginning of the movie, I wanted to be introduced and heard the stories of these individual men. They were all fascinating, but Jensen totally ignored it. <br /> <br /> By ignoring the majors of this documentary, Jensen has failed to create any tension at the end. Without making the end, I felt Jensen was in the line. Instead of being out of line, he decided not to create a moment of sympathy, emotion, nervousness or sadness. Jensen took our subjects from point A to point B to point C without asking us to form or form in any way. I can see how the national sentiment made this film a great success in Norway, but for everyone who looks (ie ME) is more necessary. I wanted to feel these guys. I wanted to know if they were going to do well while traveling or just loved themselves in their own city. There was no story, mostly partial to no development of the subjects. If you look at modern documentaries (strange, this movie was made in 2001), you want to play it like any Hollywood movie. You want tension, realism and drama, unfortunately, with Heftig and excited you get nothing of the kind. <br /> <br /> Overall, I have to ask the question again, "Why was this movie made?" My last reply, Alex, is that Jensen wanted to show how difficult times and a changing economy can still bring happiness in even the coldest places on Earth. I think Jensen wanted to show human commitment and how something as simple as singing can unite a population. Having said that, Jensen demonstrated that perfectly in this movie, but he did not have a good documentary. If you make a film of this nature, I feel that you have to look within the group, investigate the co-workers and hear each of them stories to end what will grab your heart. The only thing gripping this movie was my attention as it tried to leave the room against rocket. Again, I don't want to sound negative about this movie, because the music was excellent and the men sang a sense of honesty, but I needed more. With documentaries becoming a bigger staple of the movie community, we expect a little more than what heftly and enthusiastically handed over to us. I want to see reality and people, not just another song and dance routine! <br /> <br /> Degree: ** from *****
