Because I loved Stephen King's novels and short stories for years, like most reviewers, I was consistently disappointed with the adaptations to film from his printed works. Some notable exceptions are "Stand by Me" by "The Body", "Carrie" of the same-name novel, and "The Shawshank Redemption" of "Rita Heyworth and Shawshank Redemption". This movie is by far the worst thing ever associated with Stephen King's name in any way. It is no surprise that Mr. King has virtually no connection with it. I feel the thing that most annoyed me about this poorly acted, cheaply filmed, rubbish-directed piece of garbage is that they had the audacity to completely change the end. Don't waste your time or money on this amazing movie of a movie! !
