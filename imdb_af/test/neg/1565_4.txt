This adaptation includes two parts: <br /> <br /> 1. The "now" time, when Gulliver is at home in England and soon in a spiritual asylum by the evil dr. Assets <br /> 2 are placed. The "describe" time, in which Gulliver describes his travels. <br /> <br /> The times are jumping with a very sounding tempo that makes willing tension of unbelief much harder than it would have been if the movie were simply thrown away that part and followed the book as written. In the book there is no Dr. Assets, no asylum, and Mrs. Gulliver gets very little mention. The trips - in plural - are portrayed as one in the movie. There are several movies that are the subject of healthy people being dumped by awesome people in the asylum, watching them if you want those things. The "now" time slot adds absolutely nothing to the value of the story, is a complete invention by the movie adapters and takes precious time out of the real story. All the time when it was going on, I longed for the next little trip to show. <br /> <br /> So much for the disadvantages. The parts that are actually part of the real story are well done, and the CGI is really well done for its time. Very small (and a few medium-sized) parts of real trips are simply cut out, but it does not silence the story. This is AFAIK's only version depicting all four journeys, and the movie needs special mention for that. <br /> <br /> The two interspersed parts get about equal time. I rate the first part 0 out of 10, and the actual travel cover as 8/10. Averaging, I give it a 4/10. If they'd just clipped the garbage and concentrated 99% on real trips, that cut would have taken a lot of time, much better spent filling the details of the voyages. <br /> <br /> Why some adapter thinks he's enough gifted to improve Swift's work, I don't know. My best guess is that CGI was so expensive in 1996, so the movie company had a need to use many fillers that didn't require extended sets, GCI, etc. to keep the total cost below, while the same time that produced a mini-series that clocked a certain number of minutes.
