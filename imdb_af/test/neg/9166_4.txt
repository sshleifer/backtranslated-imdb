Something of a disappointment. Lee J. Cobb is the anti-union head of Roxton Clothing in New York. His partner in the business is killed when a lift is released and twenty-seven storeys in the slash. <br /> <br /> Cobb doesn't know or don't let him realize this, but the man behind the murder is Richard Boone, who protects the business of union organizers. <br /> <br /> When Cobb's son Kerwin Mathews comes back from Europe, it's determined to learn and join the business. his dad ran a clean shop. He's shocked - shocked! - To learn that Boone has closed the union's members and killed some who have become irreparably annoying. <br /> <br /> Robert Loggia is one of the organizers killed by a few Boone's goons, led by Wesley Addy. Loggia leaves behind a widow, Gia Scala, with whom Mathews understands and decorates. <br /> <br /> In the end, Cobb pays for his self-deception, Addy and Boone just get desserts, and Mathews winds up with the succulent Scala, to which an opera house is named. <br /> <br /> There is no sparkle in any line of dialogue. A few lines are properly stolen from "On the Waterfront" - "pistoleros", "you speak right in the grave." The plot is schematic and has absolutely no surprises. Vincent Sherman's direction is pedestrian. Photography is flat, uninspired, but there are some nice shots from the New York streets. <br /> <br /> Lee J. Cobb can act. In this case it should have been easy for him to repeat Johnny Friendly of "On the Waterfront", only this time with a soft heart. Richard Boone can also act. Joseph Wiseman, in a small part, does a good job. Gia Scala hits her points, says what the writing demands, and does what the director tells her. A beautiful woman, her life is sour. The director and photographer are doing a good job at Wesley Addy. He has white hair, a bleached face, the color of a glacier lake, and is sometimes shot by a wide-angle lens as his surprisingly fleshy lips become like that of a parasitic fish. However, I don't see him as a low-muscle muscular. He and Boone had to change roles. Harold J. Stone is his trustworthy self, though he is forced to be more "Italian", like Tony, if it comes naturally to him. No one else in something that looks like a big part is more than mediocre, and some artists don't even make that beam out. Kerwin Mathews can be a good guy in real life, but he is barely sterile and belongs to local dramas on afternoon television. <br /> <br /> Great title, which is indicative of plot and shadows. Some good people in the throw. A potentially explosive expose of a business doesn't know much about anyone, but deals with megabytes. <br /> <br /> And all this comes as follows.
