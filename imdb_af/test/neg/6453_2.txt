I tried to keep this movie. I love Kevin Spacey and I knew the other guy from his role as "Big Brain on" Brad in Pulp Fiction. But I didn't just care about the characters. Kevin Spacey is a spike through the whole movie and even to some terrible things that happened to him I didn't like him. Especially the end --- it made me hate to hate him even more. It was like a bad car wreck. Spacey played a lot well (he does it all well), but unlike that, I don't recommend it.
