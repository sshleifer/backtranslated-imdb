Kudos went to Baxley's DP to make it look like a real movie, the first time that happened in this series (with the notable exception of the F / X scenes). However, if it moves closer to film production values, it loses most of the entertainment value of the first two. They were much in the 'so bad they are good' category of horrible movie entertainment. Can an argument be made even though the 'believers' are just trying to make a generic action movie with praying? There are so many times in the movie that they reject their own convictions as if they were annoying. If everything that happens, according to God's will and they are just his instruments, if the people who are infected with the virus, do it as part of his plan, right? Apply it to every situation where someone of faith does not submit to God's will, and you get a pretty hypocritical little movie from the director of 'Action Jackson'.
