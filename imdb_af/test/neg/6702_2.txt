I suppose the filmmaker's heart was in the right place, but frankly, this movie is truly indecisive. I was insulted by the tone and the total policeman ended. You can't see it so lightly! Without knowing the final reservation of the movie ... we see as a man attacking his 9 month pregnant wife and two boys and having to follow him for the next 2+ hours while trying to make a new life create? You can't sympathize with a character who does it. Can not! Not to mention, we give nothing until the last say 1/2 hour of this unnecessarily long movie, why this man suffers so much. No flashbacks, no sudden reactions to noise or movement - things that genuine veterinarians suffer from. All we know is that he has a pain in the donkey and can't afford her and his 3 children financially. There was really no research on what the current Iraq veterinarians are about. <br /> <br /> In addition, the movie suffers from a heavily handed and totally inappropriate score. It's a disaster. It's really damaging to some really good actors of the male head and sometimes Joe Morton. It shadows EVERYTHING you are supposed to feel, and sometimes gives you the wrong clues altogether! Again, this was a brutal thing this man did, and seeing him find a new job, meeting a new blonde, making a fight behind the counter is not appropriate! And really, the end? What a freakin cop out! How dare you. <br /> <br /> There are many richer films dealing with the influence of war on the return of soldiers. Please do not save with this one.
