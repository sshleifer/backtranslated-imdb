This completely UNfunny movie is so top and pathetic and unrealistic that I watched my watch all over 90 minutes of extreme torture! Lucy Bell is so much higher than this shit and for her to sink these layers, it's pretty depressed. I have to admit that the whole audience I was in was hysterically laughing, but the majority were Greek or Italian, so I guess this humor will make them laugh, but not me. All this movie, make you sick of watching all these slackers, make excuses for their stupid acts for 90 minutes. God, and I can never get it back 90 minutes!
