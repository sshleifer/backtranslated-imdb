The only thing of interest about this movie is its subject. Looking at the Manson "family" from the point of view of the relatives themselves is a good idea. However, trying to make the incomprehensible sense is something that can only be achieved in a masterpiece. And it is not. <br /> <br /> Presumably because there was so much information to print in a screenplay, this movie was done in a faux documentary style, with reenactments. Trouble is that writing and directing make it impossible to create those things that make a movie look, like character, story, theme and so on. Worse, there's an incredibly poor subplot being thrown, following a small group of the latter Mansonites as they go to a reporter working on a story about the commemoration of the murder. It's stupid and useless, and a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is one big wasting opportunity. The one ray of sunshine is the acting of Marc Pitman, who plays Tex, who did most of the real murder in real life. While the female characters come out in the 60s flashbacks as giggly heads, Pitman can really give a feel. <br /> <br /> In short, don't wrestle with this movie.
