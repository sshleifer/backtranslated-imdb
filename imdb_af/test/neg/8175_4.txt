In a year in which "Singin in the Rain" and "High Noon" were released, this crowded turkey won the Oscar for the best picture. Half of the movie is nothing more than circus performances. The other half is soap opera and melodrama. Heston and Wilde both outperform, although their models of restraint are compared to the annoying Hutton. Hutton plays a self-centered trapezoid artist and acts as a surviving high school student in a poorly crafted school game. Grahame is the only cast member to set up a decent performance. DeMille has no interest in telling a good story, just to create an elongated spectacle, no matter how boring.
