Normally, I don't waste my time wasting my time writing comments for the mess like what I almost forgot as soon as I see it, but since I just watched this movie on one of the comcast Showtime channels (346 I think) I decided to make an exception. <br /> <br /> Apart from watching Carol Alt, I can't give a rational reason why I watched this movie to the end. I'm always surprised that good women are so fond of appearing in horrible movies, but I think she thinks this movie will lead to something better. I hope she is right for her. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's an all-too-typical straight-to-video laugh-riot, or just a piece of garbage, depending on your point of view. While there are some decent moments of action in this movie, they don't really fit in well with the story, as it is. <br /> <br /> The setup, as I recall, involved Carol Alt as a depressed. Housewife who believes her husband, a police spokesperson, is cheating on her. There was also something about which their child died in an accident, and she blamed it, but previously the storyline went everywhere and she shot him dead. <br /> <br /> On the same fateful night, a wounded stranger comes to her door and she tends to be, and almost immediately her house is under siege by government and mercenaries intending to capture the stranger. which has almost superhuman fighting skills. <br /> <br /> This kind of material has often previously provided proper entertainment, especially in Matt Damon's The Bourne Identity, and could have done so this time too, but this particular movie has been dropped by poor production values and a lousy script. <br /> <br /> This movie really falls apart when the mysterious alien seems to be a cyborg (!) programmed to be a policeman. After discovering that Carol had killed Alt her husband, he tried to kill her! The movie wasn't very good at this point, but the end really ruined it by making a modest action thriller in a lot of Terminator / Robocop wannabe. <br /> <br /> I also thought the violence in The movie was a bit outrageous at the end, with the demented cyborg throwing out poor Carol Alt's eye before it finally became a bit bitter. What was the point? For that matter, what was the point of anything in this movie? It kept my attention and entertained me for about an hour until it reminded me that I didn't watch a first-rate movie. It wasn't even a two-day movie. <br /> <br /> The final scenes look forward to a sequel, which I have never thought of, although I did not carefully check the web for it. Needless to say I'm not in a hurry to see any sequel to this movie.
