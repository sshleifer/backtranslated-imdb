A group of friends received a word from a friend who found gold in an old thought shaft near an old abandoned western village of Suttersville. Despite warnings by local sheriff Murphy (John Phillip Law), Old Man Prichard (Richard Lynch), a fraudulent hick that makes tourists with supposed collectible popular posters, and the excited aunt Nelly (Karen Black) out of the mine because of it is infamous legend (.. that an evil coal miner who sold his soul to devil and murdered a priest's (Jeff Conaway) daughter, will return from the dead to those who removed the gold from his shaft , to kill, people just see the green, not the scarlet that could possibly harvest from their fallen bodies, to get the gold of Jeremiah Stone intact, stroking their pockets and carrying things, preparing for the bright future that emerges But if you do not see the warnings of those you are considering, the obvious result will be the horrible death, as we see, Jeremiah Stone is just a skeleton near an altar containing skulls next to each other. like the candles on top The light, the peak paw under the expectation of the master, with dust particles that bring him back to a grotesque corpse with demonic exposition, his eyes angry with anger. The intrepid group, hoping to have fun getting the campfire with gold, offering their prospects for life, will face revenge and his mean pickax. Another victim will meet the nasty end of a shovel thrown by the windshield of her vehicle and straighten the road in her neck. Another failed attempt to retreat, Stone caused a scared victim to drive his car into a tree, his body swollen in flames, failing to escape without damage. Another, a local girl looking for her new friends, worried about their welfare, receives the pickax buried in her stomach. Aunt Nelly raises those who still live over the Forty Niner and curse those who beat his eternal stash. And pay the price to relate such information. Will anyone survive? Or is the whole group satisfied to perish in the hands of the zoo? <br /> <br /> Makeup effects artist and monster creator, John Carl Buechler directing this supernatural slasher without worrying about logic or strong storytelling, rather choose to allow his zombie miner to anyone and everyone who is in his way to destroy. He just gives back enough storytelling, and it is at best poor, because the killer explains special guest star, Karen Black (oh, how she sank her career in the abyss) to the viewer over him. The story we gave threatened the miner holding a priest's daughter hostage, as Suttersville authorities warned of such action. Suffice it, Stone plants picking upright in her back, with the opposition loosing their guns with little effect, because he sold his soul to Satan. Returning to his domain, Stone records a warning against anyone who even tries to take what he is, the booty. Typically, most of the slashers in general, this group of thirty-two is your victims of garden variety, with little development, unlike a bitter, and the exchange of words as a stuffing until the unprecedented maniac appears on the scene to kill them. They are the ordinary group, of the city, which violates unknown territory, which arouses evil that must remain dormant. Like many of the later 80's, much of the violence is out of the screen. What is on the screen is the minimal gore, rather presented orally and happens rather quickly. The ghoul make-up for the killer is only occasionally shown, he is mostly shrouded in the dark, the victims' horrible faces while being pursued or pursued become more credible than the method of destruction. One thing is for sure, stuntmen are often on fire. At least three times a character is burned alive by either a lantern or a flame vehicle. Martin Cove has a minor cameo as Black's former husband, Caleb, who now lives with a much younger and dense honey. Vernon Wells (.. of The Road Warrior and Commando Fame) has the background story of Jeremiah Stone as a human, still occupying the same kind of threat. He specializes in John Phillip Law. He seems to be quite polite and hospitable. sheriff welcomes the outsiders to his neck of the forest. Buechler has quite an attractive movie of actresses, all with tight pants and dressy shirts. They show their sleek and athletic figures, especially Elina Madison as easy-going Roxann, who is always willing to remove her clothing for greedy jerk, Hayden (Rick Majeske). Stephen Wastell (The Ghosts of Edendale) is Axl, a rather clumsy foil, used as a bunch of jokes, including his "dump in the woods" scene and current unemployment status.
