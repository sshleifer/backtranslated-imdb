I talked between this movie and 2012, but opted for Inglourious Basterds because of the incredibly high IMDb rating. I must say now, what a disappointment. I expected some free violence, but I also expected a lot of dialogue. I have a large dose of the former, but not nearly enough of the latter. I was disappointed. The relationship between violence and plot is very important and I think this movie gets it completely wrong. And the plot? It's that credible or really all that entertainment. Save your time and money. I can't believe what this rating says for the greedy and violent taste of the modern masses.
