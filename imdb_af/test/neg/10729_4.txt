Dick and Jane Harper (Jim Carrey, Téa Leoni) put an end to the unemployment squad when the corporation to which Dick works is trapped in a corruption scandal. After trying desperately and unsuccessfully to find a job, the duo is changing crime to get them. out of poverty. <br /> <br /> I've always been a fan of Jim Carrey. It's been a while since he made a straight comedy. The last one was Bruce Almighty who was pretty good. He proved that he could do serious drama, but comedy is his true element. Fun with Dick and Jane proving he still has it. Although the movie was funny, it was still disappointing. It wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. It's worth looking at once, but unlike most of Carrey's movies, it doesn't have a good repetition value. Part of the problem is the writing. I was surprised that the writing was poor as it was the same man who made The Forty Year Old Virgin. Some of the jokes just fall flat and other times they seem to be trying too hard. If Jim Carrey wasn't in it, the movie would have been much worse. <br /> <br /> Next to Jim Carrey is Téa Leoni. She is a good actress, but she is not very funny. She didn't fit well with Carrey and she seemed to call her show. They had to go with someone else. The supporting film includes Alec Baldwin, Richard Jenkins and Aaron Michael Jenkins. The latter plays Billy Harper and he actually gives a decent performance. He wasn't as annoying as most child stars. Alec Baldwin was okay and Richard Jenkins tried too hard to be funny. To be honest, I'm here a little bias. The movie was quite average, but I enjoyed it more because of Jim Carrey's performance. Jim Carrey fans should enjoy it, but it's about it. In the end, Fun with Dick and Jane is a fun way to spend 90 minutes, but it's not very memorable. Rating 6/10
