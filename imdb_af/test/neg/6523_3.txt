I didn't like this movie. I hired it hoping it would be something like the 10th Kingdom. I was disappointed when I discovered it was not. I also found that it was just down-tracking. The acting was bad, the characters where incredible and the time was crazy. I only recommend this movie if you are in the mood to see a crazy man running around, but I'm sure there are better movies with the same thing. I can't believe I wasted my time on this one.
