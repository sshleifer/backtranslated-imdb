Mel Welles, you might remember him as Mr. Mushnick in Roger Corman's small horror store, leads this little interesting but totally twisted story of Dr. Frankenstein's daughter who continues after her father's death and creates a creature that does not have its intellectual ability. its likely to do well, but rather for its sexual appeal. You see, Tania Frankenstein, although a doctor and scientist in her own right, is claiming nothing more than reconciling her primary desires for the stable boy and making a super sex slave by using his body with the excellent brain of a man she does not love. The story here is thin, and one gets what you can expect: lots of learning and suggestive comments (surprisingly most of the female head), special effects that aren't so special, acting shortcomings, and not much action or stress. And while this film is almost barren with regard to a good storytelling, Lady Frankenstein has not watched remarkable aspects that make it visible - yet observable. Italian actress Rosalba Neri AKA Sara Bay / Bey plays the Baron's daughter with a few aplombs and many and many sex appeal. She desires desire and seduction very well. Her performance is fairly one-dimensional, but she is very beautiful and plays a little too well. She is also very open with her performance when you catch my drive. Poor Josef Cotten, now regulated on European horror movies for money, plays the father in a short but capable performance. He is the star attraction, but gone before the movie really kicked in a gear. Regarding the rest of the cast, Paul Muller is somewhat effective as Dr. Charles Marshall, the baron assistant and an admirer of the daughter. As crimes and missing people in the town began to unfold, policeman (I didn't buy it) Mickey Hargitay started pumping Tania for answers - despite what you might not think to her satisfaction. Where the movie really loses credibility is in the final third of the movie where the suspicious script, poor performances, and shining direction all go further. The creature is revealed and looks pretty ridiculous. The film ends a bit with one of the hasty decisions that occurred quite commonly in the 1970s. While it's not nearly as bad and offensive as some might want you to think, Lady Frankenstein is indeed a very flawed movie with some perverse though intriguing overtones.
