I don't see the sense of making so much trouble making such a movie, and then throwing the history book out of the window. There wasn't a single exact detail in that movie except the fact that Richtofen died, which I was finally grateful for, so I didn't have to look anymore. Movies like this are an insult to anyone who knows anything about WWI aviation history. <br /> <br /> I will skip the obvious, that they flew Fokker DVIIs in 1916, because the Blue Max also did it 209 squadrons flew SE-5s, and would attack other parts. For one thing they call the Pfalz D-III an 'old Albatross' at the beginning. For others, they have Voss, Goring and Wolff all in Jasta Boelcke. The only one in that Jasta was Voss, and he joined after Boelcke died. Richtofen was not found guilty of Boelcke's death. Erwin Boehme, who collided with Boelcke, swung to avoid a British plane that was driving Richtofen. When Richtofen received his head wound, it attacked a FE-2d two-seater and he did not crash into the trenches and soldiers fought over him and NO. Winner Voss didn't die that day. He died on September 28 in one of the most epic battles in World War II. <br /> <br /> Manfred was short, not like the actor who rolled over everyone. His brother Lothar was never in Jasta Boelcke, he joined the squadron when Manfred was in control of Jasta 11. <br /> <br /> There are so many other obvious mistakes in the historical fact that I let them go , except perhaps the worst one, the death image. In the film, Manfred is exhausted by Brown and then shot down and made a perfect landing. Brown got an outburst at Richtofen, while Richtofen hit May and the facts gathered over the years show overwhelmingly that Richtofen was killed by ground fire, not by Brown. <br /> <br /> The only value in this movie was the chance to see the flying screens themselves, which were as good as 'The Blue Max', except I wouldn't see it again and I paid $ 30 for the band!
