There are other reviews here that express similar views, but I still feel compelled to add my comments. The film is generally made up from a technical point of view, apart from possibly too long. The acting is mostly very good, although Kevin Spacey does not have much space to explain his character's motivation (seemingly ambition rather than racism), and Sandra Bullock's only function seems to be eye candy, which she does well. /> <br /> On a fundamental level, the heart of the film is the right place to stand against racism and I get the impression that it is trying to be a kind of definition of racism, perhaps why so much well-known names have agreed to be in it. However, the authors seem to be far more chewy than they could chew (I didn't read the book, so I don't know how much of it is to Grisham). The biggest problem, as many others have said, is that it ultimately advocates vigilant justice. Apart from the fact that I disagree with it, I do not think such a view actually helps the anti-racist cause - it is more likely to apply for white defendants who kill black victims. Eventually, the prosecutor requests the jury (and the audience) to imagine that the raped girl was white - but follow it and imagine the defendant to be a white man who killed black rapists. In the end, the message seems to be that it is good to kill someone as long as you hate them enough. It is also convenient that the man being killed was completely angry and his guilt has no doubt, which probably removes any of the moral ambiguities in real cases. <br /> <br /> Samuel L Jackson gives an excellent performance, but unfortunately it also undermines the plot - he comes across as someone with a lot of integrity, but it's hard to believe he's willing to hide behind an insanity (and indeed, he does not do when pushing). We are supposed to think this is because he is facing the death penalty, but in reality he was offered a culpable homicide at one stage. Although you shine, you can miss it. Why don't you accept it, as it must know its chances of acquittal are powerful? Or if he wants to make a stand in court, why is madness pleading? <br /> <br /> There are also less serious defects. The medical experts, on whose evidence the case is presumably based, are jokes. Both are discredited for highly impeccable reasons, and neither offer a real psychiatric diagnosis. The message shows that expert witnesses will say what they are asked to say and should not be believed. The fact that the injured policeman Jackson supports is moderately acceptable, but still a little convenient (and what if he died?) I find it hard to believe that the KKK will mark the day in the street the day. Other seemingly serious crimes (riot, arson, kidnapping, attempted murder) go without any visible attempt to trace or prosecute it. And the scene where the dog returns is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> My last reaction is to feel dirty - as if I have to be racist because I disagree with the resolution. It may be that the film is meant to explore different points of view and to make the audience decide, but if it seems that they have forgotten it by the time they come to an end. The film made me think about my views, read what other people thought here and add my own opinion, so at some level it has succeeded - but I'm worried that in some people it may have highly illegal views. is the opposite of what it meant. <br /> <br /> Final thought - try to watch Law and Order, it covers issues like this with much more depth in about 38 minutes of screen time!
