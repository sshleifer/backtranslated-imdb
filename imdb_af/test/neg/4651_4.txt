Certainly not a good movie, but nowhere as bad as some will paint. Nightmare in Wax tells the story of a man who has deceived his face in a typical play-back scene, giving revenge to those who are directly responsible and those who are indirect to the losses in his life - especially the love and company of a beautiful young actress. Cameron Mitchell plays the artist with his typical flair, though limited flair. Actually, I thought he'd given one of his better performances. What exactly does that mean? Mitchell wears an eyepiece, melts cigarettes endlessly, wears a motley tunic and talks to his creations. They are not your regular washing mummies, but people still living are controlled by some serum that lose control of all neurological functions. They become zombies in effect. I thought the prospect here was inventive as nothing else. It has some ridiculous explanation, but serves the plot. It's a 60's movie to be sure of some psychedelic camera work by Bud Townsend and the company. The acting is mediocre, but Mitchell, Scott Brady, and Barry Kroeger take on interesting innings. The wax figures of Hollywood's outdated era are done very effectively and most of the location shooting was very credible. The end of the film dissipates into something that is not quite real - either another example of the 60-year-old cultural theater or the end of the scriptwriter's creativity. I bank on the latter. Despite his many mistakes, I enjoyed the movie. The opening scene in which an actor was forced to do so was done effectively, as was a waterfront police hunt.
