The only reason I watched it was because of his stars, CASPAR Van Dien, Micheal Pare and Eric Roberts & Catherine Oxenburg * & Jeniffer Rubin, All Skilled Actors and had good performances in the past. NOT THIS TIME, a poor series of killer stories, You can guess who the killer is in the first scene. Many faced in all aspects, nothing is recommended in this disaster, my rating is * 1/2 funny
