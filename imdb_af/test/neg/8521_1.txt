You're dead is an indescribably terrible attempt on a British gangster movie. It doesn't have a single original idea in it, a horrible copy of various elements of Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, The Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction. The play and dialogue are absolutely rude, the plot is ridiculous and completely predictable, despite constant attempts to make plots, and contains nothing but one-dimensional stock characters and cliches. It has some good actors in it, but they are out of shape and can't do much with the awful stuff they work with. It is absolute torture to sit through this drift.
