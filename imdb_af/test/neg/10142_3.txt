From the beginning I loved every character at this exhibition, except Reba herself. She comes out as a saint than you type and honestly a big bully. And it stinks because she is in every scene and every episode. In the later seasons, From also become unknowable, like a spoof of his former self. and Kyra walks around and grinds. The first 3 to 4 seasons are pretty good if you overlook Reba. By the end, it's pretty dark. In basically every episode, Barbara jean, walks around to be stupid, Reba is meant for her, but poor Ole Barbara jean wants Reba to find her, resulting in Barabara jean Reba telling how great she is every episode. I think it's pretty clear that Reba has self-respecting issues and wants to be seen as this all forgiving saint. It's also a pity, because otherwise she had the potential.
