The screen is a very low budget horror movie shot on video. It features marketable acting, poor lighting, a bad story, and some of the worst monster effects I've ever seen. The plot has a college student who is pressured to join a cult at his attractive landlord. The cult is a parody of Scientology with a book similar to Dianetics. It would have been a funny shot to that group if it wasn't for a silly script and the cheapness of the production. The sample effects look terrible and the picture quality makes you feel like you're watching a home video or a public service announcement. I think anyone who sees it will agree that movies should be shot on film.
