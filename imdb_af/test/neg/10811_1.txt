That's how I was when I walked out of this "movie". I couldn't go away because it was at a movie festival and the cinema was full of people. I was stuck in the middle. Trapped. <br /> <br /> The tiny fragment of original footage trying to tie this movie together contains some of the worst acting values ​​to grab the big screen. The girl was a striking show. Stand out in the bad sense. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was ominous, consisting of diverse frameworks and the strangest lighting I've seen. <br /> <br /> As for the inventory ... well at the first one ... <br /> <br /> Wait. <br /> <br /> Why am I reviewing this movie? Why do I recognize his existence? Please, don't look at it. Do something useful with two hours of your life and see how paint is dry.
