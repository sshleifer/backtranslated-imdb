The contemporary chapter of the US Navy's elite underwater demolition team is called to do .... what they want, apparently. <br /> <br /> Charlie Sheen is an officer. Already the storyline is incredible. Michael Biehn is his immediate C.O., but he keeps Charlie on a fairly leash and one of the guys pay it early by being killed by Charlie's patented stupidity. The rest of the team spends their free time committing court murders. Mostly a practice in random gunfire and paper-dying ethics, this particular Seals can be better suited to serve as crash test dummies. <br /> <br /> Some good action scenes fight the goofy proceedings.
