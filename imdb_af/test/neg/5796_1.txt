Unfortunately, this movie had potential with such a willing cast, but everything was thought so badly and poorly done. I don't think I've ever seen a movie where every scene just goes flat with a hard branch like it did here. Also, I don't think I've ever seen a "stoner" sex comedy that didn't give at least one laugh, but this vortex of pain had nothing but groaning and misery. The last time I was, it was astonished at how uncomfortable a comedy might be, with the terrible "Big Momma's House." Scene after stage, these movies will change your brain into jelly. Dumb and silly can sometimes be funny, but here is stupid and stupid as a torture device against the viewer. An absolute, rock-bottom dud.
