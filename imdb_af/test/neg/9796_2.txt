... and I bought a vampire motorcycle that stretches across the line like a drunk with his shoelaces tied. Some 'bad' movies are pretty nice (like Norman J. Warren's Inseminoid), some 'bad' movies are just bad (like Kent Bateman's Headless Eyes), but 'bad' movies trying to make the postmodernist thing consciously bad always approached with extreme caution. Many people think, for example, that Troma's Terror Firmer is a masterpiece of bad taste, but I suspect anyone over the age of nineteen will turn it off as a worthless drink. Then there's John Carpenter's Dark Star. Yes, it's beautiful, and definitely a product of his time, but as a movie it's just two notches above worthless. This no-budget British black comedy horror outing is trying to achieve a satirical tone, with its endless references to fellow fellow aircraft (including Psychomania, Horror Hospital and pretty much anything by Pete Walker), but due to dim appearances by the second TV actor (the front lady looks like Amy Winehouse), a screenplay written on the back of a peeled beef by two "lads" without understanding how film comedy works, Dean Friedman (deliberate?) dire lift-sound soundtrack and never-before-mediocre production values, the net result is a movie that can only be laughed at AT, rather than MET. If your idea of ​​whoopee is anthropomorphic towns, Chinese commitments are called Fu King and references to long-forgotten TV ads. You'll enjoy this one, but don't expect too much.
