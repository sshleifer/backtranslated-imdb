The film, Heaven's Gate, was a good view, though it was boring for more than 4 hours. But the movie had a great license - as usual with Hollywood. James Averill (Chris Christopherson), and "Elle" were actually married in real life. Their main contribution to the Johnson County War was to start by hanging up. Well, by starting it, I mean it came at the beginning, not the end. Here's the real scenario: James Averill and Ellen Watson were secretly married because one home could be given to each family. By submitting as single individuals, they can get two home homes. They chose homes at Crazy Woman Creek that actually controlled the water above the land held by a powerful member of the Cattleman's Association. He offered to buy them out repeatedly, which they refused. <br /> <br /> Although it is characterized in real life as the owner of a brothel (Bees Kate) and a prostitute himself (and also in the film), there is no real evidence that was true. It is known that she has bought many head sick cattle, made them alive again and was later accused by the Cattleman's Association of receiving cattle for "ominous acts". In the end, they were accused of agitating - an act almost certainly false. So much for this part of the myth of the "American West", which is a throw-out of myths stretching over a hundred years. <br /> <br /> In real life, she and Jim Averill are surprised one day by several members of the Cattleman's Association, and it is immediately suspended. Those who commit injustice are never heard. But it was the first link that led to Nate Champion's murder and the start of the Johnson County war. <br /> <br /> Quite different from the Hollywood version showing her lap at the end. <br /> <br /> Unlike this, I think the biggest problem with the movie was the editor, which made the action faster by more skillful editing.
