Robert Downey Jr. in a 17th century wig and dress was enough to make me stir, but I couldn't believe a great actor like Sam Neill actually participated in this movie. The whole thing was incredible. I especially like Merivel's "cure" for the crazies. They dance ... and hey presto! everyone is happy and they are all better! I don't think I liked the character Merivel too much. Therefore, look at a whole movie about his alleged transition from a whore buffoon to a good doctor. <br /> <br /> Also, I'm not quite sure, but I didn't think the plague as well as the well-known London fire occurred simultaneously.
