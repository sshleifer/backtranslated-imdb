If you want to see how to destroy a movie, study this one very closely. In fact, it's so bad that people have to buy it alone. Pay particular attention to how most screens appear to be beaten in about 5 minutes. Realism escapes this movie on every level. The overall impression is that someone has given a below average script, wannabe actors, an average director and absolutely no budget at all. With such a formula it had to be doomed. <br /> <br /> I rented it once, and I swear I got it dumb. If you're a humanitarian, buy this horrible, horrible movie and burn it unexpectedly - as a favor to the world. It has no noticeable plot, bad acting, and then throws in something about evil ugly women, just to put on the whole thing really. I would recommend watching paint dry before this stupid waste of a band! Seriously. The paint will be better. I wish I could give these negative 10 stars.
