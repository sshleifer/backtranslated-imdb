Words can hardly describe this movie. Posted with ridiculous stereotypes, a foolish plot and poor music, this movie lacks almost every category. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the IMDB credits. It's not a Michael Dorn movie. He is a secondary character in the grand scheme. <br /> <br /> Also mentioned in the Credit is an actor called "Prince" - which makes me wonder if it is the same artist who was previously known. I'm not sure this movie is just worth watching. <br /> <br /> Big summary ... a lot of teams ... one has kidneys ... one has $ 35,000 .... one has a "illegal substance" .... and one has $ 350,000. Add some confusion and mixups about who should meet who is being revenge, and so on, and you end up with this mess of a movie. <br /> <br /> Given a choice, I'd give it a movie.
