In the 1930s, Hal Roach Studios was on top of the comedy world with such stars as Laurel and Hardy, Charley Chase and the Little Rascals. Most of these films are exceptional and have resisted over time. A lesser-known Roach product, however, was the combination of Thelma Todd and Zasu Pitts (later, Todd was paired with the equally undisputed Patsy Kelly). Try as I please, I can't stand these photos - they're just not funny. Plus, unlike Laurel and Hardy, there was no our chemistry between Todd and her two co-stars. Before you just think I'm a crank, I understand that I've seen and reviewed a few hundred Roach movies as well as many other early comedies. So I am well versed in the genre and in the genre this team is one of the worst. Part of the reason I think I'm right about the team is that as a lower-team team at Roach, they were given all the scripts that no one else wanted. If Stan or Ollie hated a given plot idea, it was often given to Todd and Pitts / Kelly - and it usually showed. <br /> <br /> In this movie, however, the team is at their absolute lowest. It is difficult to imagine a comedy with less laughter and a more complicated plot. The film starts with Zasu in the jury and Thelma as defense lawyer. As for Zasu, she's a totally annoying moron. NOT the lovely type of moron (such as Stan Laurel or Lou Costello), but just a totally annoying and rosy person who is intrusive and unpleasant. As for Thelma, she is like the ordinary blind "straight man" and as such little to do, but responds to Zasu's drilling behavior. <br /> <br /> The plot involves Thelma who defends a client accused of exploding diet pills. Since the pills are highly dangerous, when the lawyer asks that Zasu try to swallow one, it just seems stupid. And while they were called "pills", they were more like giant black blobs that were bigger than golf balls. Swallowing them just turned out and made no sense - even for a low-brow comedy. When they find out, she has swallowed the pill and it's actually explosive, everyone is panicking and running over like idiots until the movie ends. <br /> <br /> As I said, I'm not a fan of this team. But even for those who want the movie, there is not one legal laugh in the whole brief! When I talked about this review with my wife (who also saw the movie with me), she thought my score of 2 was too generous!
