"Beowulf" is like a very bad game: no characters, no story, no real dialogues, bad fights ... This is probably the worst movie in the history of the theater. It's deadly boring, a lost time. I'm really sorry about Christophe Lambert, who doesn't know how to choose a role. If someone suggests seeing "Beowulf", believe me: run like evil.
