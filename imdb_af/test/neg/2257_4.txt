A lot of un-tom and jerry short. Jerry tells this story about Tom to fall in love with the cat and lose her to his rival, Butch. Tom is best friends with Jerry here who irritated me a bit. The cartoon is also presented in Cinemascope. Overall, I found this Tom and Jerry cartoon sad and depressed. It just had to put "Puss get the boot" on the DVD and I would have been happy. This experimental animated card can be found on Warner Brother's 2-DVD Spotlight Collection set 2. This is the last one on the set and I hope Warner Brothers chooses to release a second volume soon. <br /> <br /> My Degree: C-
