When "Deranged" was made, the filmmakers were able to turn Ed Gein into Ezra Cobb, although the resulting film was actually very close to the facts of the infamous case. I suspect that enough is fiksionalized that they thought they should change names and so. <br /> <br /> "Ed Gein - Plainfield's butcher" conquered as a true storytelling of the Gein affair, but actually has very little resemblance to history. As a biopic type of film, it's a transvesty. If ever a movie needs to change, it is this one, much more like "deviant". It is so close to the true crime story as "Dirty Harry" was after the true story of the Zodiac murders. <br /> <br /> Okay, so, that annoyance, how's a horror movie? Well, as a horror movie, well, as a movie in general, it's very awful. One of the worst movies I've put in months. Problems therefore run: 1) Kane Hodder is rather surprisingly missed than Ed Gein. Completely unsuitable in the part, Hodder just glows by glowing glowing. Very bad. <br /> <br /> 2) Kane Hodder is the best actor in the movie! Rather, the rest of the movie is "amateur drama" and totally unrelenting. It is painful to see that some ranks are delivered. <br /> <br /> 3) The occasional efforts of attractive films appear from the "Big Book of Moody Cinematography Clich√©". You've seen it before, performed better. Aside from the style efforts, the rest of the movie recording is largely inactive: cameras shake, frames are bad, there are long timeless shots that keep pace ... leading me ... <br /> <br /> 4) It seems to go on forever. It is less than 90 minutes long, but it is a trial. You'd swear it had run for two and a half hours. <br /> <br /> 5) Ed Gein looks almost secondary. Mostly, the film is concerned with the family affairs of a new deputy sheriff. This deputy is played by a deadly actor on whose shoulders no movie rests. <br /> <br /> Is there anything good about it? Well, the Gore FX is very good. Some convincing wounds are in display and the makeup is generally excellent. However, none of them make the massive failures of the film. <br /> <br /> It doesn't even have a kitsch value, it's just bad. not bad, not bad, it's good, just really bad. A movie to prevent and despise.
