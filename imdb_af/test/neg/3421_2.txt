This movie, like no other, illustrates the state of the Australian film industry and everything that has held it back. <br /> <br /> Excellent talent, outstanding performances (especially by Victoria Hill), but a decrease in virtually every other way. <br /> <br /> An "adaptation" of kinds, it has brought nothing to Macbeth (no, it does not make enough in Australia today), and in essence it is completely unsuccessful to justify its existence , apart from (let's face it completely unnecessarily) with tribute to the original work. If there is one job done (and finished), it's Shakespeare. Such an adjustment, if it is not a self-sufficient and useless exercise, should at least bring a new interpretation to the work. <br /> <br /> And that's what this Macbeth fails to do. As it has been done, this film has no contemporary relevance. It's the same piece we've seen many (too much!) Before. Except for the gun and in various outfits. <br /> <br /> Apart from the fundamental blunder (no other way to put it) to retain the original Shakespearian dialogue, one of the more cringeful moments of the movie is shooting the long and incredibly boring slow motion close to the end, during which I set up completely, although I looked at the screen. I never thought I had a short attention span, but there you go. <br /> <br /> I suppose the movie succeeds on its own, very limited terms. But as Australia continues to produce world-class acting talent, its filmmakers have to stop being proud of, and set high enough standards to show they respect the kind of acting they are working on. /> <br /> A shame. An absolute disgrace.
