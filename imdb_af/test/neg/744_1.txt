Northanger Abbey is not my favorite Jane Austen novel, but it has charmed her. This movie doesn't. It has some of the same characters as the book, but the story has changed dramatically, and the dearest man in the whole Austen canon (unless Emma's Knightley is proud) is a heartless and mercenary creep. One or two totally strange characters are introduced, and a tangible air of crushed perversion hangs over it all. I was so disappointed when I first saw it in 1986; Even today, it is high on the list of films that are embarrassing the books on which they are based. Even Robert Hardy fans need to give this one a wide cab. It has nothing, and I mean N-O-T-H-I-N-G to recommend it.
