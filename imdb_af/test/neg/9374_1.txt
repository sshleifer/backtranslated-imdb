After some good OK, Dutch action movie, like Lek and Van God Los, Gerrard Verhage wants to make a film about the life of a Dutch mobster. Well, mobster is a big word for Klaas Bruinsma. He is not a true international big man like George Jung (Blow) or Pablo Escobar. He is just a lower life in Amsterdam that made money by selling soft drugs. Things are often inflated in the Netherlands, and this movie is just another example. But even then, the movie can be great if the story is told well. Now there are big leaps in time: one day KLaas is just an ordinary drug boy, the next shot he looks like a big player in the drug scene. No one knows how this is possible (except for those reading the book). The acting is really bad, the non-Dutch filmmakers get one of the worst actresses in the Netherlands: Chantal Janzen. If you think she gets naked, then you look at a stand in the model. So: bad acting + poor montage + crap story = The Pastor. <br /> <br /> Please do not look, even if other people say it is good, because it is not. I warned you.
