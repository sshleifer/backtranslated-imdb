Let me get rid of it before I fall into this movie. I like Park Chan-Wook's work as director. While I disagree with the masses who say he is the best director in our time, I cannot deny that he understands how to use a camera very effectively. I really like one of his other films, sympathy for Mr. Revenge, held. Also, Min-sik Choi's play was the only thing that allowed me to take this movie seriously. . . For 1/5 of the runtime, that is. <br /> <br /> Now the bad: The plot is simply the oldest cliché used in cinema / literature. I will never understand how critics get a Hollywood blocker dirty for cliché, then get movies like Oldboy, who are just as original and clicked if it is no longer so. Regardless, Oldboy is one of the most generic, original movies ever invented. * Spoilers * The man is being held, the man seeks revenge, the man finds out he had sex with a relative, man's life is over. * End spoilers * Simply put, this plot line was used in everything from Greek plays to modern melodramatic soap operas and numerous movies / books in between. It's so melodramatic and inexorable when the big revelation happens, I laughed out loud. Does this mean that I am an irreconcilable freak without emotions, as some reviews of this movie say about people like me? No. What this means is that exaggerated plots make people laugh. The Scary Movie franchise has proven this, and Oldboy has proven it as well. Why can't people think of something that is really disturbing rather than just expressing clichés masked by fine camera work and classical music? This raises the problem of blood / gore. Simply put, it's not there. The director is too scary to even show the camera on the screen when something "gory" happens, as if we were watching a children's movie or something. Maybe we were. Anyway, I heard Oldboy call the "most brutal movie of all time" and "the most disturbing movie ever", but when I looked at it, I saw nothing to even see or disturb. All the gore is on the screen, and even the level of violence is nothing you haven't seen in PG-13 movies like The Dark Knight or Casino Royale. Why it even has an R score, confuses me, far less "the most brutal movie of all time". Seriously, I saw movies that only Oldboy looks cute at every level when it comes to violence / gore. <br /> <br /> The other big, scary, cute mistake is the main villain. The majority of his screen time shows his naked butter for the audience in comic American Pie style, but I have to think he's o-so-angry? Wearing clothes, his hair is slammed like a bad Asian mix of the cutest James Bond villain mixed with something from Austin Powers. He talks like a brain-like teenager who is recovering from an acid overdose, and his dialogue is so bad that it laughs me again. Seriously, Oldboy laughed me more than any comedy this year. . . <br /> <br /> Finally, Oldboy is for those who drink good wine, have no sense of humor, and talk about how boring your life is at dinner. It is for the people who are so stuck in their own ego, they have forgotten how inextricable they are and so have forgotten how inexperienced and dull the "movies" (never "movies") they enjoy. <br /> <br /> To The people I can say is this: I like "movies" and also like "movies". I like thoughtful dramas that actually say something about the human condition, and I also like sensible action movies that thrill me in a coma. But the thing is, because I love both "movies" and "movies", they must be original. They have to be something I haven't seen so many times, I lost the count of times the plot used. If something is not original, it is unusable. If it does exactly what everyone else does, it is forgetful and boring. Before you give Oldboy another perfect rating because it touched you, maybe you should think about something: will a movie not just go on like that, but at the same time make the original think more about you? I just wish someone else I would understand. <br /> <br /> Overall: Oldboy is forgetful and cheesy. <br /> <br /> 1/10
