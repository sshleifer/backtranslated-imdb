My dear. And here I thought there were no directors worse than Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> Imagine the number of decisions needed to make a movie. Conceptual approval. Screenplay. Dialogue editing. Decisive. Set and plug design. Location selection. Acting. Timing. Cinematography. Lighting. Music. Sound and video editing. Direction. <br /> <br /> Imagine now that each of those decisions was made wrong. <br /> <br /> Result: Dracula 3000. <br /> For a movie suspected of In the 2900's, this movie looks surprisingly like a cheap gangsta movie of the 1970s. The set is ridiculous for the period. The dialogue is horrible. The timing of each scene is ridiculous. The acting is over. Everything stinks. <br /> <br /> Let's just take props, for example. If you have a movie plane built in 2900, how likely is it to be exposed to the pipe and hydraulic doors of a 1960s era oil tanker? What technology hasn't changed in 900 years? The 'Professor' uses a standard dental keyboard and Radio-Shack flipswitches to "reprogram" the computer. What, they haven't found voting control yet? Of course, the prof is attached to a wheelchair. With wheels. Though, you know, they have intergalactic hyperdrive ... but apparently not even a motorized wheelchair, much less a floating one or bionic bones or something. And apparently, this truck had an intergalactic shipment of rosewood cabinets. How convenient. Then there are the weapons - the crew usually carry 20th-century firearms. In a ship. In the vacuum of space, where one bulletool would kill them all. Nice planning there, prop department. <br /> <br /> Oh, why continue.
