--------- SPOILER ALERT ---------------------------- <br /> <br /> That was the one Worst of the series, it's horrible as political satire, and it's as subtle as a sledge hammer, not very scary and not very informative. Does Micheal Moore have anything to do with this piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> I'm really sick of Hollywood and use entertainment as a political campaign against George Bush and repeat the same and the same talks again. This movie wants to be DeathDream, but unlike the movie that has tackled the troubles that soldiers who came back from Vietnam from Vietnam have taken, the main character is returning as a zombie that longs for blood and slowly builds on this theme. It was a real horror movie that was also good social commentary, because it didn't become fair, use and minister. <br /> <br /> I think Joe Dante, thought it was trying to make a horror movie to scare Republicans, conservatives and Libertarians and I was The last in the list found that this movie was completely ridiculous, manipulative and used at the same time and I don't mean the good kind of exploitation you often find in the drive-in type movies, I mean exploitation in the most sick and dirty way: using the deaths of our soldiers as a manipulative political statement disguised as a horror movie. <br /> <br /> This movie presupposes that all the soldiers who died in Iraq would vote against a conservative president if they were to come back as zombies, which is a flawed point of view, because as I recall and go most by George Romero's rules; Zombies are senseless, carnivores, working on pure impulse and although the zombie Andy could speak to DeathDream, he couldn't really talk and he was driven by his addiction to human blood. Okay, zombies are sensible creatures driven by impulse and not intellect and of course they're dead, so why would dead people be allowed to vote in the first place? My interpretation of this film is that the only war that can win a liberal democrat is by voting for him incessant, dead people. I think they said the people who vote for presidents such as George Bush are the indifferent zombies, while the real mindless zombies are actually the one who makes the intellectual sounds decisions. Yes, whatever. Dawn of the Dead has tackled this idea much better, but the idea of ​​relentless consumers is the user. This film is not Dawn of the Dead by the imagination of the imagination. <br /> <br /> The movie addresses the issue while the soldiers live, a majority of them have elected a Bush president, but after their death they will vote for a liberal anti-war Democratic party after being zombies, usually regarded as brainwashed, and laughingly destroyed after they voted. <br /> <br /> If you are a zombie film Dante will make and call George Romero's name in it, you have better mindless zombies that rip people like a man and eat their intestines, not zombies that vote. I also like how the zombies are just going to malicious conservatives who support the war. <br /> <br /> If you want a good movie with social commentary, save this poorly-crafted piece of junk and look at DeathDream. /> <br /> The worst of the Horror Series Master is down.
