Here in Australia, Nights in Rodanthe are being promoted in the same class as the Notebook. Very honest, what a lot of mess. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a recipe. On paper we have all the right ingredients ... Richard Gere is usually perfect in this genre, Diane Lane, an old favorite of "Under Tuscan Sun" and "Unfaithful", eastern location, loneliness and yet sucks the movie. At the session we slept a woman next to my wife yesterday afternoon and got up halfway through the movie! The biggest problem is that there is no build-up or credibility for the relationship. And maybe there are too many long faces and downbeat if you like history that brings Gere and Lane's characters to the movie. There are hours of those who are balancing with maybe 5 minutes of what we can see ... romance! There is no warmth of Gere's character, Lane looks terrible at the beginning of the movie and everyone has washed out. So, like the viewer, we can't really connect with the characters. <br /> <br /> Others say the book is wonderful. Well, this is the script, direction or production that someone here made a real mess of this movie. It's like the screens and the build up is a deck of cards, except instead of being in the correct order, they are just thrown across the spot. Very disappointing ... save your money for when it saves the video stores and even waits for a good deal when it comes to the weekly rate.
