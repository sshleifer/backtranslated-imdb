This movie is a waste of time. Although it has actors who have the potential to do something decent, the play is subparent in the movie and has a clich√© point. "You never know what is going to happen tomorrow, so live your life to the full and do what makes you happy." That sentence saves you wasting hours of your life on this movie. People who like this movie are the same people who would like to sit for two hours before they find that the whole movie was a dream sequence. If the main part of the movie does not even happen, it is at least enjoyable to watch and captivate. There is a reason why this project did not make a theater release, and although some of the films can come out very well, it doesn't even come close.
