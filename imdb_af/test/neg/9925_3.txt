As much as I like Ellen Barkin (which is really underestimated) I must boo this movie. If you don't know who did this and why didn't you ever see a psychotic thriller in the first half hour or never watch 20/20? It is as if the filmmakers and actors don't care that they have the way they shot and the way they play the characters will give away a dead one. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie serves to turn on the dirt. perverts who like to mix violence and sex. Not a fun movie to go through, but if you like Ellen Barkin, it's nice to see that she is a hard woman.
