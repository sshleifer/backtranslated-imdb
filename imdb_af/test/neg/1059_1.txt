Well, this movie shows us that Mark Griffiths and producers think we're all idiots. If not, how do we understand it: <br /> <br /> US pilots take off at Mig-29s. Suddenly, all planes move to F-16s. Ha, a magic! After an action ... Migs land. The magic again! <br /> <br /> Did I mention that the F-16's had Israeli marks? <br /> <br /> Another magic: of course, unconscious L-39 trainers are the attacks of enemies. <br /> <br /> And more magic: while all movies are located in Europe, we can see a desert in almost any fly. scene. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the director has wasted all of his magic on things above, because action scenes are incredibly chaotic and explosions also look like pilots bombarded with molotovs. OK, OK, it's a movie. I have to write about his story ... wait. A story? Yes, there is some story in this movie. And it's terrible too.
