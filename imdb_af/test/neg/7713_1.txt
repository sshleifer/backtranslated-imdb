I'm furious! It's been a while since the last zombie movie I've watched, so I'm really looking forward to a great cute zombie movie. HoTD2 was a big disappointment. A fair story, but terrible acting, filming, dialogue and deceptive click and punch lines. I didn't even see the first one worse than this one. Now I'm curious about how bad it can be! The movie is full of bugs and goofs. Who on earth analyzes DNA using a blood sample? Why are these "special forces" who have been "in hell and back" fighting like spoiled 6 year old girls? We see angry zombies that will get a bite when they get them, hundreds of them moving their arms at our two "heroes", dropping them to the ground and leaving them without a scratch. I can go on about this, but life is too short and I've been messing around for a few hours to see this pathetic movie being an insult to the movie industry.
