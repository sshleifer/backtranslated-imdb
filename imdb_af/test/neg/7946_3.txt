It's New Year's Eve, a cop killer (in the form of Laurence Fishburne) ending in an area that causes snow. When the people are invested, police have to work with cons to survive. This repetition of the John Carpenter classic just had to add some stupid plot twists, take out all the tension and add a terrible John Lequizamo to the movie, didn't it? The first movie was exciting, eager and a joy to watch. This one is more Hollywood, clich√©d, and painful to watch. The only thing I took from this movie was OCD, it can be very annoying ... LOT. The end song is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad. <br /> <br /> My Degree: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Comment by Richet, Demonaco and Jeffrey Silver; Delete screens with optional comments; 5 minutes "Armed and Dangerous" featurette on the weapons expert; 7 and a half minute "behind Precinct Walls"; "Plan of attack"; "The Assault Team"; 12 and a half minutes behind the scenes featurette; Trailers for "Unleashed", "White Noise",: Ched Seed "<br /> <br /> Ominous: I got it at Best Buy and it came with a bonus chip including the first 2 minutes of" Cry Wolf " , a 10 minute first look at "Unleashed", the trailer for the movie, and a Fuzion interview with John Leguizamo
