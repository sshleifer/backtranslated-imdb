It's a fine draft and Brando's acting is a good piece of work. Dean Martin is not bad and Montgomery Clift is also very good. Unfortunately, it is a very diverse, very long piece that really had to be finished to something closer to 2 hours (this is almost 3 hours). <br /> <br /> We follow the lives of 3 men from 1938 until the end of World War II and see how they discover who they are and what they can become, as they discover the world over them and what they are made of. For some it is the women in their lives that bring this realization to others, these are the broader general circumstances. Too often, however, I asked myself what just happened or what the import of a particular scene was.
