Well, I fell for that. I saw the box for this at the video store, and it looked "Girlfight", what I heard was wonderful. In my own defense, the titles are similar, and they have done the cover art for the box again so that it looks almost identical. Anyway, to sum it up, they apparently reflected the whole cover packing / promo to capitalize on the "Girlfight" buzz / success. I plucked it and had a bad feeling when they started seeing low-budget trailers straight-to-video movies, and even worse, a music video of the movie's lead song, which sounded like elevator music preceded the main function. When I saw the first few minutes and Maria Conchita Alonso arrived, I knew I fell for it. (Don't get me wrong, she's a talented actress, but I knew she wasn't in "Girlfight", the movie I was under the false impression I had hired). So, apart from my sense of fraud and evil for myself because I didn't look closer, the movie was good. The plot involves Belle, a young Latino woman who is the daughter of a former champion boxer. One of her good friends is a female boxer, who - and I could see it all coming so far, it was really a mourning - is seriously injured during a match with an average champion, the terminator, which looks like a female version of a larger, more pumped Ike Turner. Of course, Belle decides that the only thing to do is to become a boxer herself and avenge her friend. She lives with her caring, supportive but protective father (her mother died of cancer when she was younger), who is just a policeman. Her love interest, also caring and supportive, yet protective, is also a cop working with her father. Hmmm, they both have jobs that endanger their lives in the line of service ... wonder what is going to happen? She starts practicing and meets a sloppy driver who obviously pretends to care for her, but just wants to exploit her. The actor who hired them looks like a very low tenant Cary Eweles and is so young he barely succeeds in getting a mustache. His acting was also really bad. I'm not even going further in the plot, because anyone who saw Rocky or almost someone knows exactly where this movie goes and how it will end. <br /> <br /> It wasn't quite a horrible movie. Most of the acting was OK, and the main actress was very good. There were good, strong female Latino role models. The final battle scene was so interested in me, even though I knew everything that had happened long ago. The actress who played "The Terminator" had a wonderful job of being impossible that I really wanted Belle to kick her and root for Belle, though there were absolutely no surprises. My favorite moment (maybe I'm the only moment I didn't criticize the movie for accidentally renting the movie) was when Belle hit her messy driver after showing his true colors, screaming at him and then turning away suddenly. a punch and watch him turn in fear and show that she really is in control. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was really bad, my complaint. One of their attempts to be meaningful was someone who discussed boxing and said "size doesn't matter" and the female response frayed, "now where did I hear it before?" Other lines that are supposed to have dramatic impact are: "The doctors said I should never walk again!" "Come on, you know you can trust me!" and "Your mother would have been so proud of you." I can go on and off. Nothing you haven't heard a million times before in bad soaps or movies of the week. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I'm mean - the filmmakers have made an effort, and I volunteered through the whole thing ... just because there was nothing else to look at while working out. You can do worse (especially if you're looking for a movie with strong female characters), but you can do a lot, much better.
