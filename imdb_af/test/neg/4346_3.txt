Not "confusing" in the sense that, "Give, this movie is really complex, and so hard to follow!" But confusing in the sense that "Give, this movie really has no idea what it does!" <br /> <br /> DREAM OF A WINNER is a Hong Kong / South Korean collaboration, but it is all very nonsense. A movie about parallel universe mixed with time travel mixed with love story mixed with folly. <br /> <br /> The movie has the kind of concept that gets the mind up. Again, do not spell the mind, because it is so large and complex, but it is so ridiculous that it does not think anyone will ever have such a terrible prospect. <br /> <br /> Nothing in DREAM OF A WARRIOR makes sense, and that's because the whole movie never had to be made. It's pretty awful. The only saving grace is the actress who plays the female fighter (not the female head). <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
