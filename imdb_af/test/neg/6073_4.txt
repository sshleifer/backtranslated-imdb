Yes, I realize that half a dozen other reviewers mentioned this movie "Amadeus Copy," but that can't be said enough. Screens lifted directly from Milos Forman's writing with only superficial changes. You can expect to see: <br /> <br /> -The maestro's arrogant scene ("I'm the voice of God. Everything else is meaningless!") <br /> <br /> The maestro makes fun of the mediocre composer's work (complete with raspberries and simulated flatulence, just like in Amadeus) <br /> <br /> - The mediocre composer's dialogue with God ("Why make me music but deny me the ability to composing? ") <br /> <br /> -The musical dictation of the deathbed scene (" Ordinary time. Start with the violets ... hoesief ") <br /> <br /> - and the list goes on ... <br /> <br /> The problem is even worse. Not only were these screens copied scamily, they were not even well done. Jeepers, if you finish off an original, at least try to improve it in your own creative way. <br /> <br /> No waiting, there's something worse than that. This is the fact that the director tried to defeat Mozart's story in Beethoven's story. People, Beethoven was not a scary, vulgar slob like this movie depicts him. Beethoven was also not a rumbling idiot who used attempts by his cop, a 23-year-old music student. Unfortunately, movies like this are responsible for the victims of history. <br /> <br /> And another thing, Beethoven (in real life) never calls it the "Moonlight Sonata" as he does in the movie. That name was given years ago by a confused critic after being killed, and unfortunately it is fixed. But Beethoven's original title was "Quasi una Fantasia". <br /> <br /> AND OTHER THINGS, when Beethoven (in the movie) "B-flat! B-flat! B-flat!" Shout. and hit the note on the piano, hitting a white key! <br /> <br /> OTHER THINGS !!! Beethoven (in real life) was completely deaf for a few years before compiling his 9th Symphony. This movie shows him that he has barely a minor disability (say? What?) Every other line, just enough to be annoying. <br /> <br /> AAAND !! ANNNOTHER !!! THINGGGG ... !! The American accent ...! Oh what to do. Just ... never mind. I've already wasted enough time on this. Go look again "Amadeus". If you then want to see an interesting biography on Beethoven's life, see "Immortal Beloved" who enjoys poetic freedoms, but they are at least interesting ideas. Lastly, if you want to see something on the lighter side, see 'Impromptu', a movie about Chopin. But apart from the three, I have never seen a good tribute to a classic composer.
