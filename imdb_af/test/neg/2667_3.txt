OK, exactly what the HELL is, is it supposed to mean ??? Halloween 6 (let's just name it, OK?) Is without a doubt the most CONFUSING movie in the series (and from what I've heard, see the original "producer cut" doesn't sound like it makes things no less confusing than the " official "release". What a mess. <br /> <br /> It's not a very bad movie, as some have said. It has terrifying scenes and some intense moments - it doesn't just matter! Don't tell me that Michael was manipulated from the beginning to be angry and kill and destroy, and blah blah blah. It was bad enough when they became Michael in Jamie Lee Curtis's brother (just as they had an excuse to keep her in the second movie). This is too much. <br /> <br /> It seems to be a different case. The creators of the film are trying to be "too clever" by coming up with a new premise that we will all shock and impress. Bad move, guys. We're not looking for an explanation of why Michael is killing, so please don't feed us this crap. Show me, Michael, killing and threatening a lot of people. Show me Dr. Loomis tries to find him and, as always, just get up. Don't waste (which seems to be) the last performance of Donald Pleasance by telling me (in the most confusing way possible) that Michael was created by a cult from hell and that his "seed" would be transferred to another and ... o brother. Halloween 6 has its moments, don't get me wrong, and we all know there are NO worse sequels than this (Hellraiser, anyone?) So get what you can get out (the scene after the movie with Michael who deep red corridors are particularly effective) and try to ignore the screwball plot. Hopefully one day we will all be able to see the "producer cut" and maybe get the chance to make more sense. Until then, this will have to do ... <br /> <br /> -FTM
