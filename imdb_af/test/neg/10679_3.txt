Just like the whole role and crew, *** knows everything about making movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is about the adventures and sermons of a contemporary cockney vampire killer, and spits an age with her seemingly torn vampire lover. It is in itself a series of clicks and promises of boredom when it's as small as a movie, and that's exactly what you get. <br /> <br /> First, let me say that I never reject movies because they are B movies, indeed, some of my favorite movies are B-movies like Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter, but this one misses the point per miles. Anyone with any knowledge of small budget movies will know that the play is rarely gripping and emotional, but Razor Blade Smile creates a whole new dimension to capture it on the screen. Some of the so-called plays are simply indescribably bad, with characters pounding one flat falling flat, and expressing discourse on so much emotion and belief as the terminator to some horsemen. <br /> <br /> A big part of the movie is also knocked unnecessarily in the mouth by the vampire characters, especially the lead actor. They show off their ridiculously large vampire teeth and exhale very hard. It should literally happen in almost every scene at least once, and quickly get annoying and useless, as if it looks like a bad jaw that was supposedly scary vampire faces, just to fill up a little time and the rest of the thirst roll sticking out of a movie. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what some of the other reviewers believe here, I feel this movie (especially the director) is trying to take this movie very seriously in many parts. The sheer number of excessive dramatic actions and extreme close-ups seems to me that the director really wanted people to feel this movie and justify it on his genre and not spoof it, and he failed. The attempts at so-called tasteful sex scenes come out as comic and stupid and the action series are sometimes stupid. <br /> <br /> The end of this movie was also one of the worst and most pathetic conclusions I saw. a movie, B movie or not. If movies like it force you to sit by themselves for hours to just be rewarded with an "oh it was all a game", it's actually sick. The conclusion of the "plot" feels like a memory of the director he figured out on the last day of shooting, because they ended up in the end of their shocking budget. <br /> <br /> But I didn't rate this movie as one star despite the overwhelming crappiness, and that's because of the only plus I can really give this movie. Intentionally or not, it was funny. I'm pretty sure the portions I found were humorous, not meant, and I have made most of the efforts on real gags fruitless, but if it's looked after with friends, it's good movie to take out the microphone.
