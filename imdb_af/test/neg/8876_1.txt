This movie is just another waste of time. The plot was ridiculous, US drama forced. The characters were all very poor, especially the uncharismatic Goya and the bad interpretation of Bardem, which was only good in his classical interpretation, as a French ally. <br /> <br /> Just another chance to spend the money in a good movie. I don't think it was a low budget movie. Definitely not recommended. Perhaps the director should think a little if the movie does not have meaning before he wastes the money. Maybe they don't bother if they have profits before they start in the theater. <br /> <br /> No more hope in the theater.
