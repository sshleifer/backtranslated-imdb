If I didn't know better, I would have thought the resurrection was made in the late 80's / early 90's, when crap was sold as a movie in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why people like Christopher Lambert. He speaks as he reads the cards and becomes a fountain when he has to emulate. He was easily the movie's worst aspect. The other actors were OK, nothing terrible. <br /> <br /> It is easy to see where the majority of the budget went: the special effects. The murders look pretty professional, but do not matter for the film's dull. <br /> <br /> I will not go so far as to say that Resurrection is not a carbon copy of Se7, but it certainly has a certain agreement with him. . The detectives investigating his work must rely on Bible walks and Christian history to put together the murderer's puzzle. Resurrection, however, has been robbed of Se7en's clever narrative, cinematography, acting ... everything that makes it good. Instead, the resurrection lies on the audience and uses the Scooby Doo method of mysteries to surprise them. In conclusion, the resurrection was about as bad as I expected. I almost feel bad for criticizing this movie because I knew it was going to go bad, but ... suing me.
