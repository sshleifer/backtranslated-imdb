A British teenage movie that centers around a girl (Justine) accidentally makes her dreamman (Jake) by using a virtual reality machine. There is only one problem (well? Not just one?) She gets trapped inside his body with a neck as the only person who knows the truth and the only person she can trust. It sounds much worse than it is. I followed it more because Laura Fraser played more than the movie content in it. Indeed, she looks great especially when she is wearing a red lycra dress to impress Jake, WOW !!, If I only had a virtual reality machine ??????
