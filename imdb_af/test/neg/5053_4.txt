I made it halfway through this movie, and at that stage I realized that I absolutely didn't care how it ended. It's basically a mere teenage comedy I just watched, because I love Helen Mirren, who is actually very good as an impossible cruel teacher. <br /> <br /> The basic idea of ​​the movie (or we say the first half of the movie, since I don't know - or care - how the second half goes) was previously done, especially in 9 to 5, and a comparison between the two shows how thoroughly Tingle misunderstands it. You have to feel that things are out of control, so you feel that events are inevitable, and you need well-defined, interesting characters you care about, and you don't. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it never grabbed me for a moment.
