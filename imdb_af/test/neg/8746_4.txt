As a child, this movie made me green. As an adult I couldn't stop laughing. <br /> <br /> I didn't have the pleasure of watching this movie via MST3K. I caught it in the late Saturday afternoon, when there was absolutely nothing in the theaters, and there was nothing left to do outside but some autumn leaves rake. I thought it should be better. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The movie has some very good elements; a water-distributing mystic, a Beatnik painter, a few idiot hands, an elderly history buffer and an "evil wind." Um ... I mean ... evil head. An evil head that, once the systematic hypnotism of each one's presence is completed, is looking for his evil body. <br /> <br /> The whole story takes place on an evil "ranch" that does not seem to grow crops or increase crops either. <br /> <br /> As everything is explained by their resident mystic as "evil," you roll your eyes terribly or laugh at your sides, depending on your mood. Me? I laughed until I had tears on my face. <br /> <br /> I remember this movie fondly as one of those who really hit me as a child. But some kids are scared of Santa Claus too? Anyway ... if you're in the 50-year-old horror camp, it's definitely a movie you shouldn't miss. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good story line, this movie has it. This is the top dramatic and direct innocence of the time that makes it so terrible. The acting was just BAD, but it still has good elements. Maybe it's a remake ...? <br /> <br /> It's a 4.3 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy:
