Young Michael Dudikoff as young Lord Greystoke was left as a baby in the jungle on a Pacific Ocean. But instead of being raised through the monkeys, he falls into the hands of a Japanese soldier who still lived there for not hearing the war was over. And like young Luke Skywalker, he seems to have fallen and learned the fighting skills of a ninja. <br /> <br /> Good thing because they were divorced and the young child came off with amnesia, but those fighting skills didn't go away. The orphan, now called Joe Armstrong, enters the army and finds himself in the Philippines. Meanwhile, she has played Obi Wan Kenobe by John Fujioka himself and goes to work as a gardener on the estate of planter and terrorist, between Don Stewart and a cheesy accent that varies between French and Spanish. <br /> <br /> As these things happen, everyone gets together and Dudikoff both unlocks a part of his past and saves the commander's daughter from the bad guys in this Golan Globus production. Charles Bronson was now a bit in the tooth and Golan-Globus needed a new star for their action movie. Michael Dudikoff duly filled the account and made several movies for them, including several US Ninja sequels. <br /> <br /> This movie is all action and Dudikoff sends bad guys at a record pace. What he does not do, Steve James does his best Rambo imitation and shows his considerable martial arts. <br /> <br /> The movie has enough holes in the plot to drive one of those army vehicles by seeing in the story. But that's what the ticket is buying, don't mind. Dudikoff really looks great stripped of his fighting clothes. No wonder so many prosecutions have been made.
