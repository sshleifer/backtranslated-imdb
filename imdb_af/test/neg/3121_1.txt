It's hard to figure out how bad this movie is. Even in the 1950s, intellectual searching for the meaning of life was fashionable and Beatnik's rejection of physical facilities, clean clothes, hairstyles, etc., a common reaction to the middle-class moraine of both the US and Western Europe would this movie was a stinker. The plot is a mishmash of several dei ex machina (if it is the correct Latin grammar); the act consists of death teams who are broken by occasional hysteria (by the male head as well as the females); the free view of Catherine Deneuve (or anyone's) breasts is a Budweiser commercial worthy; The repeated cacophonic orchestral rehearsal in the abandoned building is probably heavy with meaning in the director's mind, but to me just one simpler symbol thrown into this meaningless movie. I rant because my time was wasted to see this scam. excuse for an art movie. The landscape is beautiful and the sex scene is warm - but under his clothes, this king has no substance.
