I didn't like to watch DS9 compared to other Star Treks even Enterprise, but I didn't like Babel 5, and now I know why. They are the same show. I just read the old news that Paramount stole the idea of ​​the creator of Babylon 5, but they chose not to beg for a reason I didn't know or care about, but because a Star Trek series is based , another self-animal program is just too much to blame, now I will condemn someone who even calls the DS9 when talking about the series. Original, TNG and Voyager are my favorites in that order. Before I understand why everyone thinks DS9 is good and I have, but I know I know. This is also because the captain has a real rage problem, and I hate people who look cool but apart, out of nowhere; and he looks at every episode.
