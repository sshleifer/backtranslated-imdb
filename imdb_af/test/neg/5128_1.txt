I was a company in college when this movie came out and I never saw it last night. I finally decided to watch it, because I like good dance and because the movie had such cultural impact. After watching the movie, I was completely amazed at how it had any effect, other than letting people sleep. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty annoying when you think about it. Does anyone actually sell the idea that the beer joint full of gnarly old steelworkers and teammates can keep their clients up to the high concept dances that those girls do? They would be faster than Zanzibar than you could say "performance art". Can you imagine the response of the actual versions of that audience to the bizarre TV look that no theater dance thing she did? Please. <br /> <br /> It seems likely that there could be a woman who worked in a steel yard and was also a dancer - both are physically claiming jobs. But I didn't buy for a moment that THIS girl worked in a steel yard. And I didn't buy for a moment looking at a real steel yard. Steelwork is dangerous. You don't keep your workplace out like a junkyard and don't end up with a limb. I love some of the shameless shots, like when two welders sit in the big corrugated iron sheets. What the hell are they doing there? Or if she cuts six inches from a rusty steel rod with a cut torch. She was of course advisable and just started to cut random things. <br /> <br /> However, gigantic gates like this can be overlooked if the movie is somehow fun or at least stimulating. However, Flashdance offers nothing to balance it. <br /> <br /> The dancer is terrible. This is the spastic snatch-and-sit style that American musicals destroy to ... Well, are we really still about it? The sensuality the movie is trying to destroy is destroyed by Jennifer Beal's total lack of personality. I mean I'm a 42-year-old man and when she was supposed to eat lobster, my only reaction was to think she had to get a lobster. <br /> <br /> You can't really touch Alex and her. dreams because her character is so stupid and level. The dog did more than she did. <br /> <br /> The love affair is flat. It seems to be nothing more than a boss with the hots for one of his workers. Zero passion. <br /> <br /> Even the last scene where she dances for Orville Redenbacher and other stiffs is unsatisfactory because the panel response is so incredible. What serious dancers won't roll their eyes on Alex's lame cheerleader routine? In short, the movie had nothing but leg heaters and big sweatshirts. Oh yes, there is a good piece of nudity when Alex saved her friend to be a useless erotic dancer (a ridiculous little hypocrisy). Otherwise, the movie is a waste of time. I wish the MST3K team was still in business. It will make good food for them.
