Yes, it's an SBIF (it's so funny) classic. With a budget running in the dozens of dollars, some of the most deadly plays you've ever seen, and absolutely NO scary moments - not even a nanosecond! Camera work was at primary school level - one still shot outside a house was apparently hand-held and pinched. Blood looked like limed cherry Koolaid, someone made a trip to the local butcher's shop for "human" legs, and Mrs. Witch has the cheapest mask that Wal-Mart could offer. <br /> <br /> Did anyone involved look at the final cut and realize what a mess it was? Most of the names in the credits should be pseudonymous, it will be suicide to have it on your resume. Do yourself a favor and watch Ebert's video of his colonoscopy instead!
