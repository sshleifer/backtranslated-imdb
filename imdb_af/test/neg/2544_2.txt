This catastrophe is a remake of a 1973 movie with the same title, based on a novel by Sakyo Komatsu. Japan is right next to the Pacific Ring of Fire (active volcanoes) and also along the edges of plate tectonics, the shift of which will cause earthquakes and tsunamis (a Japanese term by itself for tidal wave). Of course, this is a natural starting point for a disaster photo, featuring Hollywood with a field day with films such as Armageddon, Deep Impact, and more recently, The Day After Tomorrow, which tackles global warming as the natural disaster catalyst. <br /> <br /> But I'll have to say it: The Sinking of Japan makes all the movies mentioned earlier look like classic. This disaster movie is a disaster, and a massive one on it. Watching my watch every 10-15 minutes is a signal that does not involve the movie and feels like it was his runtime. <br /> <br /> The special effects are beautiful to look at. From satellite-styled outer spatial images, to the lively recreation of every imaginable natural disaster that can hit the country of the rising sun, the effect is the star of the show. However, if you have a spectacular computer-generated graphics, it does not make a movie taste in itself, because too much of a good thing, just ordinary drills. <br /> <br /> If you saw the trailer where you are obstructed by the effects and specific scenes of chaos and chaos, then yes, actually those scenes are the same. There is no detail, and everything is seen from afar, in a Godly mode. Things happen on the screen just like that, with Nary trying to deepen the depths to test the issues. It is similar to Godzilla knocking over buildings, and it is as if there are no people or loss of life through the single act. Morbid as it may sound, we show the victims! A populous nation like Japan not only suffers from a catastrophic disaster with a very low mortality rate, but when the filmmakers unleash such an epic scale. <br /> <br /> Trying to weave a romance into the movie is like a sore thumb. There are many characters in the movie, but each one has real features, or humanity, and looks like wandering zombies, without expression, without emotion, and certainly very stiff and unconvincing. Heroes are trapped in generic control rooms that issue statements, instructions, and form policies, and respond to incidents, as it was a computer game, with a push of the button. These are characters you don't have to talk about. <br /> <br /> If I use the comparison day as a comparison, while there are tremendous effects, there is at least an attempt at a microscopic view of the whole disaster from different individuals' standpoints. And inside there are many action ranges, big ones like the disasters themselves, and little ones focusing on the triumph of the human spirit, making it relatively compelling. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for The Sinking or Japan, this movie should preferably be one to sink and tank, and hopefully undergo a short and quick death at the local counter to make room for better things.
