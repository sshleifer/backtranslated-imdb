Wow, it was a real stinker. This early sci-fi movie has nothing for it as pure camp. There is so much scientific mambo jumbo in the dialogue, it's laughing. The female character played by Osa Massen is just a plot device for the male characters to serve sexist remarks throughout the length of the movie. Look at this one with your girlfriend. I guarantee it will make her blood cook. The only good thing is the musical score that empowers the moods of the movie. The special effects are quite rough, but not badly considering the vintage of the movie. With some good B starring stars, the play isn't bad. But the lines they gave had to be quite challenging. The challenge of not laughing at their heads.
