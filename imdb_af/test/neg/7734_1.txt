It's impossible to prevent Zhang Yimou's "Hero" from being compared to Ang Lee's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." They were both big-budget Chinese kung-fu movies with amazing cinematography of Chinese landscapes and a great superstars. But apart from the obvious, there is really nothing else to compare. "Hero" fails to deliver at virtually every level that really matters, that stars of great names, beautiful scenery and action effects are not a replacement for directors' artworks and vision. <br /> <br /> All the marketing hype ahead of 'Hero' did nothing more than make its failure a spectacular one. Many were expecting 'Hero' filmmakers to go trumpeting when it first opened at theaters in China and Hong Kong. Although the authors were proper government sensors, Chinese audiences went to new highlights of biting criticism and sarcastic minds to express their contempt. On-line critics, both professional and amateur, have declared the film "ideologically disturbing" from the point of view of deep servitude "written" by an amateur historian or someone with a background. "One article is simply titled," Hero, you make me sick! " <br /> <br /> The deepest failure of the film is in its plot, which is not only morally reprehensible, and based on unforgiving historical deception but worst of all for a movie - is boring! All blockbuster epic films are known to take liberty with the facts of history, but "Hero" goes beyond artistic license in unpardonable ignorance as it attempts to glorify an emperor as brutal as Stalin or Hitler. `Hero 'does not matter to this lack of moral compass by entertainment or fun. Instead, it makes an angry poor attempt to be 'deep' and just drives it pretentious and preaching. <br /> <br /> While historians agree that the First Emperor of China was mercilessly violent, Mao Zedong was known to admire this ruler - no surprise, given Mao's own tyrannical rule. Similarly, the Communist government in Beijing sees the allegory that can easily be struck between the First Emperor and his own iron-fist methods. They were especially concerned with this latest work by Zhang Yimou. Tony Leung, one of the stars of `Hero ', said during an interview that the film that the Beijing government did in 1989 was promoting by smashing student demonstrations because it needed to be stable. 'maintain in China. For these remarks, Tony Leung found shocked criticism in his hometown of Hong Kong, but he just declared the underlying message of the movie aloud. <br /> <br /> Director Zhang Yimou said his goal was to reveal the values ​​of loyalty and revenge traditionally in kung-fu novels and movies, to reveal a higher wisdom. Unfortunately, his version of "wisdom" seems to be: THE PRESSOR IS REG. In China, where thousands of years of historical reality have penetrated this message, art was the last sanctuary where the individual could actually find freedom from such a tyranny. The great popularity of the kung-fu novel can be explained by the ability to provide an escape into an alternative world: one where kung-fu warriors drove the country around to seek adventure and to fight justice, free from fear and win against all chances with their superhuman skills. Only in the novel did the individual ever win institutionalized power in China, and only in the novel did the oppressors get their champions. Against this tradition of the kung-fu hero, Zhang Yimou did not go up to a higher truth, as he had hoped, but down to the level of government propaganda. No wonder the government was so happy. <br /> <br /> Some film lovers may wonder: "Aside from all the moral statements, is it at least entertaining?" Fortunately, the answer is a resounding no! Because the same story is over and over with only slight variations, it becomes boring to watch. In addition, the three conflicting versions of the same story only serve to confuse the character development, as it leaves little time for the viewer to receive any sympathy for any of them as soon as the "right" version emerges. <br /> <br /> The movie is not without its beautiful images. However, all the screens fall flat because they do not connect or improve the storyline. The use of different colors to distinguish, separate and simplify the separate versions of the story, and cinematography appears to be self-conscious rather than truly beautiful. Great for a trailer, but a disappointment once you are there to watch the whole movie. <br /> <br /> For those in China who showed contempt for Croising Tiger's unrealistic kung fu, much was expected from Hero. "Jet Li, who plays the title role, is a true kung-fu artist who had national titles before starting his career as an actor. His previous movies revealed limited acting capabilities, but many hoped that Zhang Yimou Li's light body movements could be used to the fullest while he properly sat in a role that would not gain his acting abilities. But it wasn't to be. "Held" is trying to go beyond the kung-fu genre, so there aren't many fighting scenes. Jet Li is expected to perform a difficult play: an inner transformation that leads to profound wisdom and self-sacrifice. As the deciding director would have had to expect, Li failed unhappy. Meanwhile, the only fight that reveals any true kung-fu skill is the first one of the movie, between Li and Donnie Yen. All the screens that follow are a disappointment, so "Hero" fails to satisfy even on that level. <br /> <br /> While most audiences outside of China are unlikely to be aware of the historical lack of the story of the cruel First Emperor, they seem unlikely to accept Zhang's "Chinese wisdom" version, which is nothing else. Perhaps the only time an audience came out of a 'Hero' show was seen smiling - rather than swiftly or frowning - at the special show for Chinese government officials. <br /> <br />
