Well, for a start I must say that here in Russia a saga of Geralt van Rivia is known and loved. Andrzej Sapkowski - a gifted writer, or even genius of some kind, created one of the most realistic, honest, cynical and God, and well-written fantasy worlds in a literary history. And when such wonderful stuff comes in handy, see RPG game "Witcher" and you'll understand what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> "Vedmak Wiedzmin" is an excellent example of the opposite outcome. <br /> <br /> Lack of budget. Lack of directing. Lack of good writing. <br /> <br /> These three whales of Disgusting Movie Making sank this movie, ate it alive. Acting is good, sometimes even more than good, but for the sake of God it cannot save this project. <br /> <br /> However, I still have some faith. I still hope that one day a new Vedmak movie will be created and the whole world will see the magnitude and breathtaking beauty of Sapkowski's books. P.S. But before, a yours boll should be eliminated. Just in case, you know
