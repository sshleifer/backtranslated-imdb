This seventh (yes you read right - the seventh) Poppestudel movie shows how the demented group of dolls came; by a French puppetist who uses them to take revenge on a group of ancient mummies that are after him, as soon as they learn that he is keeping the secret alive. It was taught to him by a wizard, also in progress, before he died. He used this power to bring normal dolls to life. This sequel is basically nonsense, sprinkling on even more nonsense like most of the Puppet Master sequels. Because of the PG13 rating, we don't even get an entertaining puppet kill. Think about it, there are no damn puppet killings. If there was one franchise that had to be cut off, it would be this one. No more .... God, please no more ...
