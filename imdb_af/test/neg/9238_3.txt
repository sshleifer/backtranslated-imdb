**** Probably spoilers will be ****. <br /> <br /> After a successful effort to get attention (I won't call to make sure you get help before you die for a "failed suicide attempt"), Joey finds out she's pregnant and begin to see images of spirits. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was a bit slow, but enough to see the whole thing. For a horror movie, there were only a few small creeps and excitement. Halfway through, however, was a very nice scary scene (I won't throw it away) :) I watched this movie because I loved the previous movie, The Eye. <br /> <br /> I was a little confused, but to determine that, besides being a "supernatural suspense" movie of the same creators, The Eye 2 had no connection with the Eye, * whatsoever *; different cast, different story. The Eye2 has nothing to do with eyes. The movie has some dubious scenes: Joey tries to commit suicide 3 times (4 times when you count the time when witnesses say they tried Joey to jump in front of the train), she is associated with an attacker who defy brutally, she mock a restaurant and witnesses say she is "attacks" people and yet she may freely go over her business, without as much as a psychological evaluation or in hospital (for reasons other than her pregnancy). <br /> <br /> The movie was not the biggest horror movie, the story was far-fetched (even for a fiction movie: P), the talk was either little or nothing we hadn't seen before. However, it was an "interesting" story and as soon as you know the "truth" behind the spit, it was an interesting twist on the ghost story. <br /> <br /> I rate the movie 3 out of 10.
