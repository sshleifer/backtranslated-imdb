If you like weak SE, (some) bad acting and a total lack of credibility, it's a movie for you. Such a very cheap search movie, but I kept it anyway. Why? Because I love that kind of movies. I can't help but smile when I see this kind of movie ....... What were the producers, actors, directors and SE people thinking about making this movie? Don't expect an "Abyss" or "Alien", just a (very) low-budget horror / adventure movie. <br /> <br /> There is one nice "splatter" moment when a man's head is shot down, but for the most part the horror is quite tame. The final monster is also very cool. <br /> <br /> It's just 73 minutes, so you can't go wrong there. Maybe you can add it to your local video store or watch it on TV. I'm sure you'll have a good time viewing it. <br /> <br /> Don't say you're not warned .............
