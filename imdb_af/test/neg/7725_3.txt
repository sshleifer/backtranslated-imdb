I saw the first House of the Dead and expect a root canal to attend. When it wasn't that bad, I was surprised. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I hope my second will be good ... and I went wrong. <br /> <br /> Apparently, I'm one of the few people who have seen this movie think it's bad. <br /> <br /> I don't know if I should see it again and force myself to see what all the people who gave it saw good reviews, or wonder if I saw the wrong movie. <br /> <br /> Ed Quinn as Ellis and Emmanuelle Vaugier as Alexandra 'Nightingale' Morgan did a good job in roles that were among them. They deserve better movies. <br /> <br /> The special effects were okay and some of the characters were hateful and made for a tolerable watch, but for the most part this movie was just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I have to ask, because I've already asked myself aloud through the movie ... didn't anyone know how to close doors behind themselves, so zombies won't just slip into the rooms? Only once did this happen (zombies run in) and I found that a little comfortable ... soldiers in a room, opening the door wide, paying little or paying attention to the same door, so the zombies only can go in if they feel like it (with the incessant "living" reversed without escaping) and once again zombies have followed them. <br /> <br /> Nitpicky? Perhaps honestly ... if I fight for my life, the last thing I want to do is go into a room and open the door so that zombies can swim and eat me. <br /> <br /> This is actually the only thing I've saved all over the movie, and just the movie was for the most part a bad follow-up to a not-so-horrible original.
