Anyone remember the docudrama thresholds? It's a dramaturgy that shocked Britain in September 1984. While not being totally entertained by Mick Jackson's core holocaust horror movie, I can respect it. Unfortunately, 20 years later, I cannot respect this docudrama broadcast dealing with terrorists who release a radioactive dirty bomb into central London. <br /> <br /> The problem I have with that is that the director Daniel Percival's production values ​​are far too good if it actually benefited from rather cheap production values. The cinematography is wonderful, but in this kind of speculative drama do we need excellent and well-hidden Oscar standard kinematics? What we definitely don't need is a musical score as the survivors of the explosion slowly emerge from the smoke. We also don't need vaguely familiar rollers. Did someone else sit there and ask themselves, "Hey, what was he in? I know that face" several times? I know I did and it is very distracting. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest production error with DIRTY WAR is that someone has decided to make it a docudrama with too much stylistic emphasis on the drama. In DREADS, the action cuts away from the action in Sheffield at seventeen times and becomes an issue of HORIZON on the effects of the nuclear war before being returned to the fictitious protagonists and DREADS is very effective as a result. Here, the information suffocates the drama that drowns in an expositional and totally unconvincing dialogue. The characters in the phone call are not really characters, they are just cyphers there to tell the audience what happens when radioactive material explodes. It would have been better for the action to cut captions to convey this type of information ala DREADS. The worst thing is that director Daniel Percival used the same technique as he did a few years ago in DREADS with his docudrama on smallpox. He had to use the same style with FIRE WAR. <br /> <br /> I should also put my cards on the table and say that while I am not considering that most Muslims are terrorists, I get a bit of patience on TV productions such as THE HAMBURG CELL, THE GRID and DIRTY WAR needs to point out this fact to me by dropping me over the head, and it is sometimes typical to protect PC attitudes in TV companies. <br /> <br /> I managed to get the studio debate Bob mentioned here, but I also heard it was discussed elsewhere and I can't help thinking it makes better viewing if DIRTY WAR itself is heated arguments between different factions of the political spectrum. If WOMAN WAR is remembered twenty years from now (highly unlikely to know), it can be well remembered for the discussion that caused it more than anything
