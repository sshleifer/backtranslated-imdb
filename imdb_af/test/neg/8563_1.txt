I can't believe they even released such a movie. The only good play came from the water in the movie. It must be one of the worst (if not the worst) movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only terrible part of the movie is the bad play, I give this movie a 1, I'm too friendly, this movie deserves 0. <br /> <br /> The storyline , and if you can call it the plot of the movie, it looks like a high school child has written. Ofcaurse, you have to ask yourself if it was better with better actors in it. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, wait for it to show on TV. <br /> <br /> AND ALSO WHAT IT WILL BE AN EXPRESSION.
