Started to look at it, but didn't believe in any of the characters. In particular, the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me. The screens between the baker owner and the assistant were nice, but the rest was just very slow. It was a very superficial movie and it made me feel like I'd rather watch a movie. The characters were many 'stages' and the storyline was much like a stage substitute. By the time the assistant was over, I was bored and didn't mind what happened and so I turned off. Glad I didn't pay to see it. Didn't even laugh or laugh. There seems to be a strange tendency for Americans to classify their films as "comedy" if they are funny, rather than funny. I finally learned to prevent what Americans call dark comedies, which seem to be horribly weird and rude. Now, it seems like I should be a little more critical when they call a movie-romantic comedy. Perhaps comedy comes in different ways when applied to a movie rather than a series in America. I don't understand why America can produce incredibly funny comedies like two and a half men, Will and Grace, King of Queens, but can't really produce funny movies without using toilet humor. This movie wasn't gross or anything. But it wasn't just one big yawn ...
