One of the first things I've noticed made it possible to put this culture under the rest while Sole's place was awake. An air shot is used to show that Sole is flowered by a sea of ​​women with leaves. I believed it was a comment on the closeness that women had for each other of these cultures that had come together over the generations, divorces, and misunderstandings, and were still able to commit and trust each other. Also, the movie seems to glorify women as almost flawless individuals. What I think improperly is that they did not experience the consequences for their actions and were treated as if they had imperfections. An example of this is shortly after Paula accidentally killed her father. Her mother immediately came to her rescue and took full responsibility for the act while Paula was almost unrepentant for what she had done. Another example is when every daughter (or granddaughter) had an opportunity to reunite with their alleged "dead" mother (grandmother). Knowing the tensions it probably caused in their family, each of them is still embraced by the mother without caring for what she did. It's to kill her husband and his lover. In this light, women are portrayed as people who not only love one another, but also those who are not least disturbed by the actions of their friends / family members. <br /> <br /> Another idea I thought was of interest to this culture regarding their supernatural idea. With the death of Raimunda and Sole's mother and her inexplicable return, the director builds the audience's emotions to believe this film embodies the supernatural. The people portrayed in this culture look very supernatural, that is, very eager to believe that life is beyond the grave. Their aunt, long-time friend Augustina, the prostitute and other people living in the city of La Mancha all believe that the rumors of the dead are returning to relatives to complete the "unfinished business". I believed it was a mixed reflection of the culture's religious belief (predominantly Catholic) as well as their need to make compensation with those who had no chance of being forgiven during the deaths. The belief they held about "living" death was also to give hope to the fatalities they had suffered in the deaths. When the viewer is exposed to the fact that this film is not supernatural, it is interesting to see the role of the mother. She is treated as if she is still a ghost (ie hiding in small slits (under the bed or in a car tree)). I believe the director has portrayed the mother so as to increase the already supernatural beliefs that the city has adopted. The mother's character was a metaphor for the city's long-standing faith in life after death.
