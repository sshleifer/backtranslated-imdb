Normally, BBC Austen's productions are pretty good, but Northanger Abbey is just strange. What do they think? This film has little of Austen's charm and, ironically, mimics the Gothic novels that mocked Austen. Not only that, the "gothic" rows are tough, over, and honestly stupid. The actress does me. Morland plays poorly cast with no clear appeal to attract the attention of a qualifying bachelor. Although I prefer the creepy Peter Firth like Mr. Keeping Tilney up, he's not a bit like the novel, even if the dialogue comes out straight. of the book. Robert Hardy as General Tilney worked in one of his little horrible ham appearances. This movie was so bizarre and strange that I actually looked at it again just to enjoy how terribly wrong it was.
