I know it sounds, but yes, I'm a big fan of House Party 1 and 2 (and proud of it !!). I hated part 3 and then come here part 4. I was as if you were estimating me with this thing? Kid's Play is nowhere to be found in this movie, and it would have been good if they were not foolishly entitled to the House House 4 movie, as if it were in any way, form, form or fashion related to its predecessors. Every time this movie comes to the US late at night, I shoot my television with a gun. Frankly, it's really just that horrible thing. * hurling * <br /> <br /> As the only remaining fan of Kid a Play who will actually admit that he is a fan (tea he has), I was terrified. Remember that stupid little boy group Immature? They sank their way to Home Party 3. Good, good, but how can Part 4 be just about them and nothing else and they also don't seem to be the same children of Part 3. * Confused !! * Home party fans: Do yourself a favor and stick to House Party 1 and 2 and Class law. In addition, everything else is ridiculous.
