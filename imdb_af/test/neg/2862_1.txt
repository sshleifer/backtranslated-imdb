When I first heard of this movie, I eagerly went out to rent it, believing it was one of those bad-fun movies and that I was a surprise. I went wrong. <br /> <br /> For the beginning, the pace is painful, annoyingly slow. The pass does not even begin to pick up until the last 15-20 minutes of the movie! The plot was boring, and the end was stupid and confusing. For those looking for a cheesy horror movie with cheap excitement, look elsewhere. This movie offers the stocking in spades, but is much lacking in "excitement," cheap or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Rather try "Child's Play".
