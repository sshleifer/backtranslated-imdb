Rollerskating vampires?! I'm sorry, but even for the 80's, it's just too cheesy to be horrified. You can excuse the original the odd kitsch moment because it parodies old movies and TV shows, but it was done once so the successor needed. to be a little less camp, not even more strange! In addition, the first film had the presence of Chris Sarandon - a man who can even make staggering discotheques in casual knitwear, looks tempting! - that this one is badly lacking, so there was nothing 'danger' in anything that happened. It was just stupid. <br /> <br /> Although I saw this time only when I was 7, I was already a big fan of the original I remember being disgusting. For me, there is no successor to Fright Night, just a tough spoof that doesn't deserve any valuation.
