I had high expectations in this movie, but unfortunately, I feel lowered. I bought it for $ 5 at a used VHS site, and the version I bought was the English version. The dubbing is terrible, be careful. "Lola" just wasn't as good in this movie as in "Run Lola Run", and the bad guy just came out of nowhere. And "Lola" is starting to catch up on the second she gets at university. Seems unrealistic to me. I also wondered if in the original version American songs were in the soundtrack ... they were extremely extreme. Too bad for this movie, I really thought it was going to rock.
