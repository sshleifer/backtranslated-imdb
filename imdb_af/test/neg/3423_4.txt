Macbeth is one of the most well-known stories in the cinema and has often been translated into numerous theater and celluloid institutions. Originally written by William Shakespeare in the early 1600s, Macbeth tells the story of betrayal among royalty and one man's search for power. Director Geoffrey Wright (Romper Stomper) is trying to update Macbeth by placing it in today's Melbourne underworld. Macbeth (Sam Worthington) is working for a movie, where characters replace swords for guns (ala Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet) and royal vengeance for gangsters, Macbeth is a sharp, violent but critically flawed film. <br /> <br /> King Duncan (Gary Sweet). After Macbeth was elevated to The Thane or Glamis by The King (as prophesied by Macbeth by three witches), he began to set his eyes on the throne. One night the king arrives in Macbeth's house and Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hill) speaks to kill the king for power. Macbeth kills his master and then assumes his crown. But success has this downside, as Macbeth soon finds out when he has to deal with horrible lengths to protect his murderous secret. <br /> <br /> OK, first things first. The movie's biggest mistake is Sam Worthington. His portrayal of Macbeth is in a word ... boring. I honestly didn't mind Macbeth watching the movie. I had more sympathy for Victoria Hill's Lady Macbeth because she at least saved it. Worthington puts sullen and wood throughout the film. I felt he did his best impression of Johnny Deep's George Jung character from Blow ... but without the charisma. I have never seen Worthington in a movie, so I don't know if it's the fault of the Director, but the glue that has to tie in one cohesive unit is weak. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is good, but if it matches Geoffrey Wright's Australian Gangster motif, it looks a bit out of place. Frantic-paced action series mixed with long Shaksperian musings create pacing conflict within the movie. I understand that it is Macbeth and that the director wants to use the original dialogue intact. But hard, fast action scenes that follow a three-minute soliloquy tend to be annoying if not a little pretentious. <br /> <br /> The camera work is very stylized, and for the most part it works well. One thing I found annoying was how slowly and slowly the camera was pushing. I don't mind shots as it's just exaggerated. It is beyond the kingdom of cool and stylish and becomes rather annoying. Other than that, the art and cinematography is fairly well done. <br /> <br /> For all the good features, Macbeth possesses; stylish direction, Shakespearian dialogue, strong soundtrack, supernatural nude witches (the strange sisters), and good help from brutal bloody violence. All these strengths are forgotten if you consider Sam Worthington's uninspired Macbeth depiction. The role of Macbeth was essential to tie it all together and in this respect, Geoffrey Wright and Sam Worthington failed, making Macbeth a forgettable foray in Shakespeare.
