This movie was really stupid and I thought it wasn't that bad and I can tolerate a movie about a bed that people eat. Then the part near the end where the man has skeleton teeth, eventually the cherry on top of a bad movie. I could see the screws in the plastic skeleton's hands for goodness. The brother was still alive and moving when his hands were bare bones. The funny thing was that he could still move his hands that just wasn't right. Without muscles you can't really move your hands, but he did. The brother had to have killed even before he moved his hands. The movie wasn't nice, but it was good to the scene. I laughed so loudly that I didn't really remember how it ended. It had something to do with foam or something.
