Before I go further, I have to admit that I've only seen the first episode of this show. If I had the time, I could have considered it every week, just to see how the season was playing. However, it was clear to me from the beginning that Martha Stewart's version of "The Apprentice" just didn't fit. Martha Stewart has made a career of a happy homemaker, a household diva of likes like Oprah Winfrey and Julia Child. It was only since her scandalous legal problems and subsequent imprisonment that her public image began to reflect the true roughness of her character. Certainly, she has been forced for a while and this whole series poses the interesting question of what it means to be a woman in business. Should she come down so cold and tough? Wouldn't that happen? <br /> <br /> But the truth was, when Stewart got out of jail, never attempting to grab the interest of viewers for a long time, though justified. Maybe a real return would have been if she had come back quietly and waited a year or so after she often had a single arm band, was removed. Instead, she instantly plunges with two series into the fair, and the other is her syndicated Martha series, like her old show, but more mainstream, with well-known guests such as Bette Midler. Of course, even at her peak, Stewart was never mainstream, so it's too much to ask American audiences to immediately accept her decline in reality TV. Perhaps America wants to return to Stewart, rather than be the basis for it. <br /> <br /> The show was basically a tired review of Trump's "Apprentice", which still keeps my interest depending on the tasks. , the throw, and Trump's fire decisions (often controversial - probably for that reason). The letter bit was definitely not clich√©, but at least unpleasant. The fact that Stewart never says, "You're fired!" - mentioned in the message board on this site - is particularly upsetting. Producer Mark Burnett must be admired to honestly deal with Stewart's jail time, while trying to make her a hero, but the truth is, anyone who looks can tell that she is basically trying to show this good businesswoman. make. Stewart never had the mainstream again, but lacks the acceptability and identifiability of Oprah Winfrey and the admirable, charismatic "toughness" of Donald Trump. Yes, it can be a gender prejudice of her character, but I think it's more about the nature of her business. <br /> <br /> It's been a shock that Stewart was fired, but I wonder if they really meant to keep it for just one season?
