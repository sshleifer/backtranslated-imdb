It's a poor, poor movie. Full claws, unrealistic moments: bumping the air into the celebration after you put out a fire, no matter if someone has lost their home and belongings !!, announce a pregnancy in a bar with all your friends before they tell your private first. the roof of a burning building, for no reason, the stereotypical funerals and tense relationships, the very dodgy, cheesy music at the end, the unrealistic treatment of the girl who was saved from her apartment, the very unrealistic explosion from the same apartment! ! Did they have some oxygen tanks on the attic or something !!? Anyone with a gram of white can see that this movie was a joke. It's a pity, because firefighters are doing a wonderful job, and they deserve a good movie about what they do, but not at the expense of common sense.
