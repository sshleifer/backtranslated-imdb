I was pretty enthusiastic about seeing this movie when it came out. Commercial advertising made it look and I mostly like Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, and the combination of the two looks like an interesting idea. Unfortunately, I was terribly disappointed with Nurse Betty. Personally, I usually found that graphic violence and comedy didn't go so well together, and the only directors who combined the two successfully. , in my opinion, Tarantino and the Coens are. There is not so much violence in Nurse Betty, but what the violence in it has made me feel so strange when I was supposed to laugh. Of course, to me, was also part of the problem that there aren't many places I was asked for. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't work much like a drama either. Ren√© Zellweger's Betty, the story's main character, is clinically insane and impossible to relate in any real way. I will say that Zellweger is doing pretty well, and Freeman, Rock and Greg Kinnear are also doing good work. The problem is in writing; Freeman is the only person who gets an interesting character to play. It's really bad. 10/03
