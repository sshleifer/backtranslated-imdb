From acting, direction, screenplay and art, this movie is only completely pregnant and the money would be better spent on shoes for landmine victims. When have we become so sad that they have to fill in a children's movie with sexual innuendo to pay attention to the parents. <br /> <br /> Dr Suess now rolls into his grave, which with the "dirty hoarse" and false erection scenes etc. etc. It is disgraceful how they act on the name of Suess to get parents to Bring their children, to throw in the profanities to try for the teens and some sad parents who will not watch a movie if their T & A greed greed and greed. > <br /> Compare it to the classic children's movies and we can touch a disturbing view of the world.These guys have to watch MTV videos, how on earth this movie has> 400 votes as a perfect 10, is beyond me (unless it's the directors)
