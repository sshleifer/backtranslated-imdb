The fact that a movie is on DVD does not guarantee its quality is very good. The fact that a film's quality is thin does not mean you shouldn't buy it. This review is actually applicable to 2 movies that accompany a single DVD. <br /> <br /> The plots of these movies are of little consequence. They are only of interest to people who collect Holmes films ?? Anyone just wanting some of the better deals will do well to buy Jeremy Brett? Or, in a pinch, Basil Rathbone. There are some other very good Holmes movies with good actors on one lap base? such as "Seven Per Cent Solution" or "Private Life of Sherlock Holmes". Anyway, these movies are much less treasured. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the best actors Holmes films, even though the results are likely to be disappointing. It seems to be the only slide with these movies (although "Deadly Necklace") appears in the same version on other discs. <br /> <br /> "(Sherlock Holmes and) the Deadly Necklace" dates from 1962, although it doesn't seem to sound like that. Some who have seen it may be surprised to learn that it was manufactured by Hammer Studios. Not that Hammer didn't have some real stuff, but where Christopher Lee was worried, they usually did a better job. It prints a direct transfer of a fairly worn 1: 1.33 black-and-white copy. The quality of the color suggests that the original was possibly in color, and the shredded ends of the film's aspect suggest that it was originally 1: 1.66 or more. <br /> <br /> The movie is in the early 20th Century ?? Not unlikely, as Holmes still works (and didn't actually die until 1957). However, the script has not been adapted to any actual Doyle story. It includes an Egyptian chain, and Professor Moriarty appears as a world-renowned archaeologist as well as the Prince of Crime. The plot is melodramatic and banal. <br /> <br /> The biggest lack of this movie is it ?? for what incomprehensible reason? Hammer filmed it in Germany. However, it was filmed in English. It was then baptized in German and then baptized in English again. So what you hear is not Lee or any of the other original actors, but a lot of unknowns ?? Not that, beyond Lee, I doubt anyone of the other actors will know. It's too bad, as Lee (see his "Hound of the Baskervilles") makes a pretty decent Holmes. As it is, his voice is double condescending and simple as bread pudding with no raisins or cinnamon. <br /> <br /> The music for this movie is mainly jazzy, in a possible attempt to be a period. Bad nobody thought about ragtime. As it is, the music does not relate to what is happening on the screen and is often contrary to the action. <br /> <br /> The other movie is "Sherlock Holmes and the Spotted Band" of 1931, featuring a young Raymond Massey. The quality of the picture and sound is far higher than that of the 1962 effort, and in fact a little better. Massey makes a very respected Holmes, though he certainly does not have the role of Rathbone and Brett. The other thespians participating in this production will be unlikely for modern readers. The acting? As is the case with many films of this period? It is very important for the post-Victorian stage and for silent movies. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that while "The Deadly Necklace" on DVD is in itself available, "The Speckled Band" is available only from the former movie. <br /> <br /> There is very little to say about this movie. The institutions seem to be a strange combination of the 1890s (horse carts) and the 1920s (electronic devices such as a primitive phonophone). Altogether, this is an interesting curio and an incentive to buy the DVD with the mating rather than a DVD with "Deadly Necklace".
