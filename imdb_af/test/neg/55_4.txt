I thought maybe ... maybe it might be good. An early appearance by the Re-Animator (Jeffery Combs); much tribute to old horror movies; The Troma label in front ?? this movie can be a jewel! I thought wrong. <br /> <br /> Scarecrow is a boring, surviving, half-tribute to the horror films of the yore. The story is an old one, young people who break into a home, get drunk, make love and tamper with things that shouldn't be tampered with. The often ?? recycled slasher movie formula is used here, this time with a thought that death actor named Conrad Radzoff is doing the murder. In fact, the performance by Radzoff's actor Ferdy Mayne is the only redeeming quality of this film. He does the Snooty Dracula style very well. But for the kids, it's not that good, with Combinations having only a minimal part. <br /> <br /> The movie does not have entertainment value and only has one cool character and one or two scenes that can keep your attention. I don't recommend this movie unless you're desperate to see something, and it's the only movie left at Blockbuster.
