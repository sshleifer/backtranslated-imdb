Short marriage evasion comes back to the loving woman, Grace Needham (depicted by the always sexy Nastasia Kinski). <br /> <br /> She left town, and her depressed husband, to begin a journey to sunny Miami, where she was pursued and finally given by Julian Grant, a very bad and manipulative business executive, portrayed very well by William Baldwin (why do all Baldwin brothers play evil people so well?) <br /> <br /> Grace's temptation occurred when the two champagne drank on a deserted beach, they reached privately by sailboat. Grace admitted that she had been drinking too much for her own good and revealed the many problems in her marriage. Julian gained her confidence by claiming that he would never allow such problems if he had a relationship with Grace. Julian's manipulation continued as he described a "lost sea" - fantasy that included the now-undisturbed grace that is close, listening to every word and becoming more and more involved in his romantic dream. <br /> <br /> His manipulation pays off as a few subtle hugs led to Grace's soft kiss, she paused for a moment by pulling her back, as if suddenly thinking of her: "What am I doing? I am a woman, I am a mother, I have a real life, true responsibilities, certainly, the two of us talked about the fact that we were together, lost at sea, but that is just a fantasy "See what we're doing here. The consequences are real. We're really alone on a secluded beach. I'm really going to make this fantasy happen?" <br /> <br /> She gives the dream, because her kiss is more The once-guarded Grace, who responded to men's suggestions by saying, "I'm married," enjoyed watching Julian cut her shirt, leading to more kissing, body colors and climbing up Julian's shot! She smiles, kisses, moans, laughs and often looks at the sun, which unfortunately was a short love scene where everyone was wearing most of their clothes. <br /> <br /> While watching the illegal passion on Grace's face as the once-off dedicated woman is met by having sex with a man who clearly enjoys manipulating others. I would say that the scene generally did not achieve the film's R-rating. /> <br /> Julian returned home to find her husband rejuvenated for his high pay remuneration and she is excited about returning to a normal life where she can be a loving wife and caring mother again . br /> <br /> But the evil Julian Grant rainers the picture and is not willing to give up on Grace so quickly. Grace has a plan to get rid of Julian's life, but will it work? <br /> <br /> Of course, I don't want to destroy the remaining storyline for you. However, I would say that I always enjoy movies of sexual originations by a woman (especially when she shows unhindered attraction and behavior usually reserved for her husband), but in fact revenge is against the antagonist. This movie would have been much better if the movie included more of it in the story line. My feelings are when the movie picks it up, then the movie must complete it. And this movie definitely got it. Unfortunately, certain limitations in the story line prevented it from being significantly pursued. There are many other movies available to pass at the right time, and I will include their titles in the "recommendations" section of this section. I am also open to receiving e-mail suggestions from other movies that contain a good story line that includes sexual appearances on the part of an apparently dedicated woman. <br /> <br /> Overall, Nastassja Kinski and William Baldwin are both very good. The movie is not.
