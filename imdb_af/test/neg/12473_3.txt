At least for me. I've been following Mr Almdovar's career since the beginning and I didn't love this movie. I think Penelope Cruz was displeased, the type of woman she portrays doesn't look so good, she makes the character incredible. The song scene was just strange as well. I didn't get the point and the lip sync was terrible. <br /> <br /> If Spaniard is another thing that drove my nuts, the accents. Why do people who come from the same place have such a different accent? The difference between the two sisters is remarkable and does not make sense. And the town? are we in 2007 or 1950? I tried to explain to my American husband that many of the things in the movie are "old school", things are not so. <br /> <br /> I expected more, but this time Mr. Almodovar Don't save, at least for me. I'm not saying Miss Cruz does a bad job, I say she doesn't belong there and doesn't portray the character.
