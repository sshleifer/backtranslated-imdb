I noticed that this movie was on Cinemax lately, so this morning I decided to see it. I just finished the Infiltrator, which is a good movie, and I thought it looked good too. From the description, the cable had the least. This movie was terrible. It's slow, the pacing is terrible, it feels like it is 4 hours. There is no real plot to speak of ...! How can anyone say something good about this movie. Rickman is good ... but he's always ... the other two characters work well, but there's no real story to support any of them. After 2 hours, and you sit and wonder what is going on on earth, where on earth is the plot - it ends with a surprise that frankly just made me sick. Don't save with this one.
