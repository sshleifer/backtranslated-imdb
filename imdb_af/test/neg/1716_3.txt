It's definitely a direct-to-video, but the story isn't as bad as most other reviewers think. I like the fact that the hero does the wrong thing most of the time. <br /> <br /> The hero's reactions and the reaction of the rebels are only human. The Hopper character actually plays god. It may be the right thing to do, but you shouldn't. <br /> <br /> In the end, the goddess was killed and the hero who would have spent his own life could live. Completely moral. :-) <br /> <br /> The most unrealistic thing I've seen is that Earth does so well with no moon that stabilizes its rotation.
