I expected much more from this movie than I actually got. The acting was just horrible from everyone and the story was far from impressive. It took me a lot to not even follow what was going on because it was so jumping. An example of the play is when Paxton's character, Vann, is upset by the South Vietnamese colonel, for he throws off the sand from the sand card. It was impossible to get any idea of ​​what he felt and his actions were robotic. To make matters worse, I have no idea how to feel about Vann. He is, of course, regarded as the lead, but as soon as he comes to Vietnam, he begins a relationship with a Vietnamese English teacher. The only thing the movie is about is that it wasn't very boring. I give it 4 stars out of 10.
