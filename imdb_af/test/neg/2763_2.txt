If this movie is an accurate display of the performances of J. Smits, I think he made a big mistake leaving television. Didn't he watch a movie with David Caruso, especially "Cold Around the Heart"? Along the lines of acting ability, that of Mary-Louise, she did a lot, much better. Yes, it is a terrible writing, improperly edited, and completely unfinished, but skilled actors can and can overcome similar obstacles. A very big disappointment.
