One of those movies in which there are no big turns and you can pretty much predict what will happen. Matt Dillon was another great thing, but the rest didn't play a bigger role as they should. <br /> <br /> It was exciting in the beginning, but in the end it was slow and predictable. It's one of those flicks in which the good guy wins, doesn't matter. If you have absolutely nothing, you can try it. Personally, I don't have a good look at it. The story could have been more interesting and the director could have made it less of a B-movie by making a happy ending.
