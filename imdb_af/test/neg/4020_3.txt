This movie earns her 3 for lousy writing, poor technical merit and continuity issues. Some people gave this movie a 10 - and maybe it's good if you just move it for its fun factor. Technically, however, it is an inactive movie series from start to finish - produced by 3-class writers, actors and crew. It was really true of almost all the series, as they were meant to be a low-brow entertainment that was especially aimed at the children. And there is nothing wrong with that, but "high art" it is not !! Spy Smasher deserves a lower than average score compared to other series because it is of even lower quality and BUT has continuity problems - even for a series. It was common for a series to have a "stone hanger" - that is, a moment at the end of the episode that looks like the good guy is dying but survives wonderfully when the next episode begins. BUT, in this movie it is very hokier and ridiculous. You'd literally see the hero in the last episode, but in the next they shot the scene again and showed that he didn't actually kill (although they clearly showed him he was buying the farm in the last one)! Again and again in SPY SMASHER he seems to be dying, but in the next episode they show it from a different angle and he avoided death in a way - even if he falls 1500 feet into a river a bending saw or whatever. <Br /> <br /> Watch this movie for its quality, but also for a good laugh or to learn how to go to the movies on Saturday morning.
