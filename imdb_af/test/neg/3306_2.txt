Warning: This may contain SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> First, I watch a lot of Life movies and realize they're just that .... Age movies. Some are big (really), some are good and some are bad. Unfortunately, this movie falls into the latter category. It actually started with a few potential .... single, separated hard-working mother (who comes out of work at 02:00) cuts a man down while driving home from work and just let's say he takes it not too good. The stalking immediately begins with call hangings and rises to her house and is broken into. So she went to her mother and the next morning her mother's car blew up. It seems like it's just a pain in the butt for our heroine who deals with it, by shopping for underwear and jewelry !!! So the police put her and her son in a local motel for safe keeping and what does Ma do? She goes to work to leave the child alone in the night in a strange motel room and tells him to order a PIZZA !!! I could not believe it! Then it really gets stupid! And the end just made me angry because it was so ridiculous and typical. Too bad because it had possibilities.
