How can things like this be made? The Seinfeld, Arrested Development, The Office, etc., etc. Not killing this cute, immature crap? Apparently not ... <br /> <br /> I'm actually a fan of Michael Rappaport and enjoyed his various comos and supporting roles (Copland, Friends), but he sucks, but anyone will struggle with this script . <br /> <br /> My wife enjoys it. But she's Brazilian. And if you've ever seen a typical Brazilian sit-com, you'll understand why she'd think so funny. <br /> <br /> Just to demonstrate how predictable the show is and to prove a point with her, I guess what the next 3 or 4 plot developments / lines will be while watching it for a while and was correct almost word for word! I felt very nice. It irritated my wife because she hates it when I do it (can understand why, but I felt good screwing it!)
