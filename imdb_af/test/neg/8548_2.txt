YOU INTEREST TO ME (1941) is an example of the "ScrewBall Comedy" that started in the mid-1930s and ended after World War II. Some of these movies retained their status. Others have earned undeserved praise when they were originally critical and safe. Like BABY (1938) or MR. & MRS. SMITH (1941). Then there is the one who just keeps the value, sinks. <br /> <br /> Why be rooted in the script / story. It goes beyond credibility, betraying a superior cast. BARBARA STANWYCK is married to millionaire HENRY FONDA, who is insanely jealous. He will be happy to sit back with his million dollars and love her, she wants to keep her profession as a doctor. She wants him to be in what her eyes are a useful member of society. This conflict is supposed to entertain us. It cannot be cast by principals or the supporting role. <br /> <br /> The errors in this scenario can clearly be put at the feet of DALTON TRUMBO. HENRY FONDA's character is written in such broad strokes that any viewer immediately finds him uncomfortable. BARBARA STANWYCK has nothing to do, but responds to every idiotic situation of jealousy. TRUMBO has spent a lot of time outside the studio to be a "useful idiot" and then to be at work. Of course, COLUMBIA didn't value their money, maybe ROBERT RISKIN should be taken over.
