How can you go wrong with a movie that mixes Peter Cushing's sophistication, Donald Pleasence's determination and Luan Peters's bust? Easy, you give them a terrible script to work with. <br /> <br /> Peter Cushing leads an evil role a Satanic cult who has captured some of Donald Pleasence's friends. Donald plays a determined but separate priest who wants to find his friends, but needs the help of Scooby-Doo to find them. He is suing the help of a New York blood dog who, just like the hero of the cartoon, is in his job. Meanwhile, the girl of one of the missing people, Luan Peters, joins the search. If it all looks interesting, you, like me, are deceived. <br /> <br /> It doesn't take long for the trio to sniff the bad things, but their methods of bringing the bad guys to justice are foolish. Women also find it a crapfest. Each time they come to the bad guys track, we tell two male heroes Luan to stay at the hotel, although she can handle her better than the bad priest played by Pleasence. <br /> <br /> STORY: $ (The script really doesn't let us down. No tension is built. No valuable dialogue is given to the stars and you'll need both hands to count the number of times. Luan Peters is told to stay behind and men let men work, if you are interested in watching a minotaur on film, we get a statue of a minotaur splashing flames.) <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$ (There are some attacks and some sacrifices, but those of you who shoot for gore will lapse). <br /> <br /> WARNING: $$ (Although there are three of my favorite actors in this movie, there's nothing to buy here. Peter Cushing doesn't have much screen time, Donald Pleasence is aware that he on the set of a stinker and Luan Peters is sick, it had gone much better given the talent, but then the Ya necks lost here and there a game.) <br /> <br /> NEWS: $ (Luan Peters takes a bath, but you see nothing. She's not as obliged here as she was in The Flesh and Blood Show).
