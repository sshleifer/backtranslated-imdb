It's a poor caricature of Lonesome Dove - and Larry McMurtry. <br /> <br /> I love your books, with 'Lonesome Dove' among the top three. I admired how you perceive yourself through your characters, with such unfair honesty, balanced by never taking it too seriously. So I'm spoiled. <br /> <br /> Why did you come here? <br /> <br /> "Comanche Moon" doesn't meet your standards. I see you're credited with the screenwriter, but it's so different from you. I prefer to think it was written by someone else. <br /> <br /> The dialogue makes me claustrophobic and wishing someone would break with a natural mind. The part about 'genius' was malicious. McCrae was unrecognizable - mainly because of the wrong words coming from his mouth. <br /> <br /> Well, I also miss Call. <br /> <br /> The most important missing factors are Gus and Call and The men they are: courage; the underlying ear consists of ethics and honesty; their lack of self-confusion. Hard men lead difficult lives with a certain undeniable grace. <br /> <br /> Some blinds should be hung here and there throughout. All the roles needed for dialect and dialogue. <br /> <br /> While trying to propose Robert Duvall when McCrae talks to the same dialogue, it gets better, but not much. It tries to shame cowboy-of-few words, sly-gritty, but doesn't get half ... <br /> <br /> How could it be so different from "Lone Dove"? Can the author forget his characters? You have some of the people, Mr. McMurtry, deceived - but not this one.
