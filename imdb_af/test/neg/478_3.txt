I am 35. Bruce was the guy in Evil Dead, and I still love ED1 and ED2. It was also cool to see him two or three years ago as The King in Bubba Ho Tep, showing versatility and great acting talent. But this Screaming Brain adventure is definitely not for Bruce's early fans. Or I'm getting too old for this sh17, or I'm no longer part of Bruce's target audience. I am positive children between the ages of 9 and 13 will love this movie. But this over extended matinee sci-fi comedy contains about 5 minutes of totally interesting moments, and the rest is cheap kids slapstick humor. Campbell talks better with Sam Raimi and gets their brains together for a final evil dead reunion image to get my interest back. There will at least be a good director behind the camera. Sorry Bruce, it just doesn't cut it for me. Look carefully at yourself.
