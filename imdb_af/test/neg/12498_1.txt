Oh, dear! It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is incredibly repetitive; every scene seems to consist of people being shot down, running screaming, or being kicked in the face, which quickly becomes very boring. I will not mind if the fight was even good, but it is not; The main character Phillips squeezes the various goons with ridiculous ease, and no matter how often he stands in the full view of the Tracker. He never gets hit, although extras and minor characters are blown everywhere on him. I rarely saw any worse actors (especially Don Wilson, if you could even call him an "actor"), but it's not really surprising, given the dialogue they have to work on (sample line: "Computers have me brother killed! "). The plot is a sub-par ripoff of the excellent Terminator; The special effects are laughing. Overall, this movie is just terrifying. And why does everything explode?
