Save this Hollywood version, a real piece of garbage. A cheap insult to the brilliant original "Railless", or by the English title, also called the "Vanishing". It misses the point in typical grand Hollywood fashion, usually due to a lot of talented corporate bean counters that don't have the faintest idea of ​​anything artistic. They are just looking for the "successful formula" and want it to be applied to produce a profit. Much like the horrific "The Scarlet Letter" made in 1995, which turned the original story so much to fit the MacDonaldsland crowd, it became a deviation, not even a bastardization, but a lot of luck kind of like but doesn't look, feel or even look remotely like the spirit of the original. Except for that movie, Gary Oldman at least had an interesting look at anything he did. This dog has nothing to do with it, even the usually talented Jeff Bridges is embarrassing. Great tragedy is not a good movie of the year, but should never be one or more of the unfortunately far too many tragic events in life and make the reader / viewer make sense and insight into the human condition. br /> <br /> Do yourself a great favor if you are looking for a rental and save this grotesque rubbish and get the original in a Dutch / French collaboration in 1988. It's a good movie. It's a terrible mess.
