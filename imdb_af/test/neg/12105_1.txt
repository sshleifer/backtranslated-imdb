Almost a master class in how not to direct a movie. From the injudicious, often incomprehensible script, dr. Rey on a series of poor decisions that make the movie a terrible viewing experience. Unfortunately, the movie never rises beyond an old-fashioned, almost misogynistic, gay camp in which women are excessive, OTT and middle-aged and the men are young, empty and forever looking for sex. The director could not show the tone of the film or the level of the performances. <br /> <br /> There is definitely a huge amount of "scene". Dianne Wiest slips into a light pre-personality of her Bullets on Broadway show and poor old Jane Birkin flounders in her bid to give a comic show. Although you should be ashamed, there is very little real comedy here. The whole thing feels like a very low rental version of the merchant Ivory's Le Divorce who, to be honest, was not very good either.
