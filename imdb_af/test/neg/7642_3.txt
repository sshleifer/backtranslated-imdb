I'm surprised at the number of people who rated this entry as their favorite "Chan" (haven't they ever seen the Opera? Or "at Treasure Island?" --- the last ironic written by John Larkin, that dropped the ball here). This plot is a train wreck and overloaded with useless characters. First, viewers must recall the bad details of Steve McBirney's (played by reverent rogue and HUAC squeaker Marc Lawrence) in 1929's murder book. Let's not forget that he escaped a capital murder at the court building with a lone policeman on his tail. There is also a victim captured from a river 11 years ago, after which nobody is ever worried. Then there is the suspension of unbelief needed when all the characters seem to be trapped in the laundry museum (although Inspector O'Matthews manages to turn his fat wet back inside through a window). Why is Joan Valerie (as Cream Assistant) in this movie? She can't even handle the pliers properly - I realize Chan has the same boo-boo, but yes, he is 66 - (and has less than 10 lines --- and her character's motivation is too weak to ever To be sufficient "spotty (excuse me if I write on a rant, I write like Ricky Ricardo). The character of Mary Bolton (Marguerite Chapman) is written as an avid widespread moron that seems to exist only for the rapid romantic interest from horndog lawyer Tom Agnew (played by Ted Osborne) Why is Willie Fern a character? Why couldn't McBirney's henchman pull the switch at 8:20? (Not a spoiler, okay?). He succeeds in dressing himself up or why he did not walk before a bus years ago, while Toler himself gets a bit more acting rope than usual (a plus) and the real kudos goes designer Thomas Little and kinematographer Virgil Miller has created a truly ghostly atmosphere ... but this entry has less logic a as a Ritz Brothers movie. to eclipse by how a toothpick can be used as a rifle.
