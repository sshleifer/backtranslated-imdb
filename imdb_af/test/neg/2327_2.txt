If you don't like bad acting, poor editing, ridiculous dialogue and incredible characters, you'll hate this movie. If you like all of the above, that is, if you are a Lynch fan, then you will like Mulholland Drive. This is probably the worst movie rated above 7.0 on IMDB. <br /> <br /> Outside Naomi Watts's work you will be hard pressed to find any competent action in Mulholland. The other female head has to "hide your face with your hands when you don't have the chops" school of acting. Given the script they had to work on, it's a wonder that all the actors don't hold their heads in their hands. <br /> <br /> Characters wander in and out of the movie that does nothing to promote the storyline. You have a hitman, a mysterious cowboy, an adulterous wife and her Clich√© poolman lover, a mafioso-type figure sitting in a darkened room talking through an external vocalist and a lot of others too much and boring to mention. It's enough to say that they can't do much more than fill up screen time. <br /> <br /> It's not that bad, however, as it distracts the viewer from the fact that the movie has no observable plot. You will wait and wait for all the loose threads to come together and eventually you will be disappointed. The hardest thing for a writer to do is to put everything in a credible way at the end of a movie that fulfills everyone's feelings. The easiest thing for a writer to do is to create lots of strange characters and put them in scenes that aren't linked to the movie as a whole and then take what few coherent threads are and cut them up for the end for surprise. Guess which way Lynch is going. WAR !! <br /> <br /> You know you have a bad writing when you have to redo dream series to make sense. After all, a dream series covers all sins. Dreams do not have to make sense. Anything can happen in a dream. <br /> <br /> Editing is also incompatible. Let's just say good editing doesn't call attention to itself. Much of the way this movie is edited seems to be for the sole purpose of paying attention to editing. "Look at me ... You can see my editing ... Am I not a genius?" Uh, well ... NO! This movie has all the judgments of the worst and most in love French films. <br /> <br /> So why is this movie so popular? My theory is that this is just another sign of the decline of our culture. Melodies are hard to compose so we listen to rap. Plots are difficult to follow, so let us fail. Pictures are hard to paint, so let's plug in and hold a crucifix in it. These are the symptoms of our time and Mulholland Drive is just another part of the misery.
