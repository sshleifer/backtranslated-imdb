I saw it because of snipes / statham, but honestly, Chaos is terrible. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with it. It should not be made. <br /> <br /> Do not read this review if you do not want to read spoilers, because I have a lot of plotgate here. <br /> <br /> First of all - the opening scene. It's the big big event that made the two semi-main characters (Statham and Snipes) crooked. But it's boring and commonplace. Only at the end do we see what really happened and by now you will not care anymore. Also this whole event, where one bad man and his hostage are murdered, is barely big enough to fill hundreds of newspaper articles, as mentioned in the film. <br /> <br /> Then the bank is working - it doesn't "get rid of any second. The bank robber makes unnecessary references to the chaos theory (which has nothing to do with the whole story). The way Statham is called is a lot of 'Die Hard With a Vengeance', but more boring. Then the things happening in the bank are strange and useless. -What's at the safe. There seems to be a plot unfolding there, but then it's not. - Why go through the trouble of attracting two people when it does not lead to anything? It involves a lot of preparation and it is nothing at all! Why doesn't the SWAT leader listen to the officer in charge if he says they have to stand still? <br /> <br /> And it's just the first 10 minutes. It gets worse and worse. <br /> <br /> The whole romantic / love story (with the "he wasn't just a better policeman, he was a better man's remark to finish it) is painful to watch. It's just useless - why would Statham's character show the change in camera position in the footage reviewed by the bank. This mainly results in finding the 'virus' that will get him the money. - Why go through the trouble of forging and killing some men's, but DO NOT murder the man who can identify you. <br /> <br /> I can work for centuries, but it's like this movie is ... useless. The whole writing is a mess. The "smart" references to the chaos theory are really laughable and pretty pathetic. The plot 'turn' can be seen from miles away and the main characters always make mistakes. It is really painful to watch a movie like this, where the audience is obviously cut into dull popcorn, the director hoping they will not see all the plot holes and the uncomfortable writing. The 'explanation scene' at the end just adds to insult. It's really not really a good movie. In any way. <br /> <br /> People who come to see an action movie do not get what they come for. People who come to see a cop-buddy movie don't get it. People who come to see a smart thriller don't get it. In essence, everyone becomes the same: a great disappointment and a waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor and save this one.
