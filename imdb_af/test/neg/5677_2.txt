This show was a wonderful, fresh and innovative idea in the 70's when it was first broadcast. The first 7 or 8 years were brilliant, but things then settled down. By 1990, the performance was no longer really funny, and it fell further to the total waste of time it is today. <br /> <br /> It's really shameful how far this show fell. The writing is painfully bad, the performances are almost as bad - if not for the generously entertaining break from the hosts, this show will probably not be on the air yet. I find it so hard to believe that the same creator who chose the original cast also opted for the band of hacks that followed. How can one recognize such brilliance and then apply it to replace it with such mediocrity? I felt that I should give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this presentation such a great success. As it is now, the show is just awful. I can't believe it's still on the air.
