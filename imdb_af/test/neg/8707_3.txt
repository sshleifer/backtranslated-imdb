If you are a Christian or a Jew who hopes to see an accurate Biblical (or Torah) depiction of the events in Exodus, you will be disappointed by this movie. In typical Hollywood fashion, people who are not even in the Bible are created to support characters and play a major role in the film. Jethro's role is completely changed and he becomes nothing more than an unreliable father-in-law instead of a Shepherd priest who gave Moses excellent advice. God is largely removed from the movie, and viewers get the impression that Moses has to work things out for himself. Nothing can be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> This movie is a typical humanist turn on biblical things and seeks to place most of the responsibility on Moses to try to understand what God wants and what he needs to do. Those who know the book of Exodus well will not only see inconsistencies in the movie, but also striking changes in events. Most importantly, they will see an almost total absence of God's dialogue with Moses, which determines everything Moses does to the burning bush. Moses is not far from alone as depicted in the film. He is led by God with detailed and direct communication. <br /> <br /> Even Hallmark can't believe God's direct role and without many words to Moses many events make no sense. To compensate, Hallmark actually changed some things. For example, after the golden calf, God plagues the people and they have to look at a symbol of a snake to live. Rather, Hallmark creates a civil war and the Israelites choose sides and beat each other. Of course Moses' side wins. <br /> <br /> There may be minimal value in this movie for unbelievers, as it can help them find answers, but believers must stay away. The distorted events and changes make it a danger to anyone who does not know their Bible. Read Exodus for yourself, there is no substitute.
