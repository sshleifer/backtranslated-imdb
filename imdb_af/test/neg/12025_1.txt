How in the world does something like this come into my DVD player? How can it even be packaged and distributed? Is there absolutely zero screening a movie (and I use the term loosely) before it is placed on a video store shelf? I'm all making DIY movie, but come on! It doesn't give me the right to get a group of my friends and family together, a crappy camcorder, a horrible story and put it all together to create a heap of curls and call them a movie. And I wish people would stop saying the words "Indie" and "Campy" to describe these types of movies. They are not. No other occupation would be considered acceptable. If someone tried to sell your car that was as bad as this movie, you will take it back and say it's a lemon. If it was a surgical procedure, you would sue the doctor. I wish I could get my time and money back after watching it. Scan the video stores that feature movies like this. They are a rip-off for the public. You want "campy"? Go any of the Friday's 13th movies (even the LATER kids) or Dead-Alive. At least, it doesn't mean you want to kill yourself. This is because of movies like these that automatically compare people with garbage.
