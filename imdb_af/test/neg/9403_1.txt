This is by far the worst movie Al Pacino can die in. The movie had no real plot. It provides 24 different directions. It seems the target audience for this movie is the anonymous gambler. Matte Mcconaughey's character is not credible enough to be Pacino's protégé. So he won some bets for some degenerate clients as a sideline for a brilliant record on a 900 service. Should it automatically convince an audience of its skills? It was just silly to think. The trailer promised to show us how he picked up his shotgun, but after I went through the whole movie, I didn't even see what skill he had ever had. If you want skill, check out Robert de Niro's character in Casino, which is now showmanship. At some point in the movie, Mat's character picks his winning matches against a coin. Anyone can do it. All Pacino seems to talk a lot and I mean blabber mouth in your face dialogue. I think the style started with the Fragrance of a Woman and worked for him because he eventually won an Oscar, but now I think it's just annoying. He always seems to be preaching. He does a mean act to a man who has unstable angina (this is an imminent heart attack), reminiscent of his performances in Godather part 3, in which he plays the aging, diabetic mafia don corleone, but other than that Pacino his talent is wasted on this. film. Rene Russo is just a look at this movie. She is kept in shape and shows it in the tight clothes she wears throughout. This movie is ordinary crap. Don't waste your money on it. It is much worse than the mats of Mats's character in the movie.
