Pilot Mitch MacAfee (Jeff Morrow) sees a UFO while testing a plane - but nothing is displayed on radar. Then aircraft and ships start disappearing and reports of a UFO increase. It appears to be a giant monster bird that attacks and kills. But what is it and why is it here? <br /> <br /> It has all the right elements for a classic. It has a pretty entertaining script - I was never really bored. The acting is good (for a 1950's monster movie). Tomorrow the macho hero does not persuade him and Mara Corday is pretty good as the required female love interest. She is also strong and cares for herself - even though she is obviously in the movie food and coffee for everyone. The problem here is the monster. Dear God - It's awful! It looks like a stray turkey! It has a long neck, a hilarious stupid BEAK, a few teeth, a few strings of hair on its head and claws. And - oh yes, this squawks! Not roaring - squawking! The actors had no idea how it looked - it was added to production. Actors Morrow and Corday were terrified when they finally saw it in a theater. Morrow said his audience burst out and he quickly left the theater before the movie ended! Producer Sam Katzman was responsible for this. He wanted to save money and ever gave the world the stupid monster. And you can see that the wires are moving too! It only gets 4 stars, because Morrow and Corday are so good and the writing is well done. It does not get stars for the pathetic monster - wait until you see it attack which is of course a toy! Look to see if you're a horror fan to see what the stupid monster ever needs to be.
