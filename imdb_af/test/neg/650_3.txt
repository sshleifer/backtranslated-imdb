I wanted to keep this movie, but the pacing was just too slow. <br /> <br /> It was a nice story, but it was really like a snail race. <br /> <br /> The movie would have been better served if it had more action. I mean nothing great, but at least something in the background. <br /> <br /> It could also be helped by songs that show the mood of the longer periods that were absent from dialogue, <br /> <br /> It's been about 10 years since I saw it, so I have to give it another chance. <br /> <br /> 3/10 or * 1/2 (out of four)
