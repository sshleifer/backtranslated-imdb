Tediously long dreary cinematic waffle. I couldn't believe how bad this movie was. I just watched it because of the many people bumping into it on this site. Was I watching the same movie? The whole episode is one-dimensional. Nothing that happened in Garps's past influenced her (or anyone else's) future and no one was touched by their past. I think it was Socrates who said of plays that if a scene could be removed from a play without any effect, it shouldn't be there. Obviously the director did not know this rule and therefore filled his work with one urgent scene to the other. Even the plane crashing into the house was unexpected, it wasn't a surprise, but it was unexpected! <br /> <br /> It is worth mentioning that at the time of writing this (December 1, 2002), although many say it's one of their favorite movies, no one bothered about a memorable quote. not to add. The reason is that there is simply nothing. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time watching it, rather watch a board warp.
