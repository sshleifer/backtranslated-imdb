Lethal Panther 2 is a very early 90-year-old martial arts movie in the Philippines that sees a reckless policeman behind the nasty criminals who killed his wife. A particularly inexpensive production with almost no artistic merit makes this movie dependent on the quality and quantity of the action. But while there is no shortage of fiber food, gun fighting and explosions, the quality is just not there. The endless fights are desperately lacking in originality or excitement, with poor editing and everyday direction that makes this movie a real task to go through. <br /> <br /> The usually impressive Yukari Oshima is totally wasted, with her natural athletic ability shading through some ominously bad wires. The ballistic action scenes are a relentless mix of 'slow-motion' by the air-while-shooting hero, crazy vehicle stunts and endless bad guys being shot. <br /> <br /> With so much better examples of the 'girls and guns' genre now available on DVD, suggest that you leave this one alone (unless you, like me, will endure many old waste full time to be).
