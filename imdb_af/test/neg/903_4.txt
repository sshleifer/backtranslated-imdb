This strangeness contains Bunuel-like touches, but does not support the importance of you. A 10-year-old boasts a bizarre America in a stolen Mustang, while ordinary cult film suspects (Dick Miller, Mary Woronov, Susie Tyrell) commit malicious acts in the name of comedy. Like his AFTER HOURS and VAMPIRE'S KISS, the writer is scary to let you squirm. I stayed untouched because of the broad acting. You know you are there when Meatloaf and Vloe gives the most pleasant perfume. (And what did this child's screen test look like? He is unbearable.) Recommended for the dozen or so supporters of SONNY BOY ('87).
