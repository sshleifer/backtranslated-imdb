"Shuttle" is an indie thriller about four young adults traveling one night to a shuttle from the airport to find out that the driver is a sadistic psychopath. <br /> <br /> Although some of the rows of scare and it is unconventionally interesting plot work, some aspects just don't. The bad dialogue and incredible characters give a good reason not to care for them. But often the tension works and asks the question of "What would you do?" and usually what you want to do is not do these idiots on the shuttle. <br /> <br /> If you expect a sensible, bloody horror movie, you'll be wrong. This is a movie that causes you to use your mind, but unfortunately not until the end. <br /> <br /> Four out of ten.
