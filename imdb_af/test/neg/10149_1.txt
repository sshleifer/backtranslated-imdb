I thought Godzilla 2000 was the worst movie ever until I saw this monstrosity. My friends and I went to our local destruction and spent about an hour and a half looking for a movie. We couldn't find one, as we saw almost every movie created. We decided to look in the low budget horror section. We looked at the most beautiful cover with slim-dressed women. We finally decided on Last Slumber Party, THE. Whatever, we made a mistake. This movie seems to have been filmed with the cheapest camera found in K-Mart. The actors were picked up by a rescue army, and Steven Tyler. We'll just leave it to the imagination. The plot of this movie was ridiculous. SPOILER ALERT When you watch the movie, there is absolutely no closure. Then come to find out all the events were just a dream. This movie should also be about 30 minutes. If all the camera was zooming at silent shots, and scans of walls were taken out, it would have been much shorter. All I can say is I'm glad there wasn't a successor.
