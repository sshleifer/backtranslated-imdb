OK, nobody will confuse it with Citizen Kane, but you should love a movie where the women are always topless. There are also some catfights and some kinky sex. On the other hand, I hope they haven't paid too much for the man who wrote the dialogue. Here's a good example. After one of the prisoners died, <br /> <br /> "It's terrible. It reminds me that Zenobia is dead" "a family member?" "No, my favorite cow." I think they saved a bit of money on the script and blew it on great special effects like this plastic crocodile. I will say that it took me three sittings to make it through this fine artwork, never a good sign. I think that's what happens after a while when everything looks the same. I hope the people waiting to rent it do not become too impatient. Don't worry, it's that way.
