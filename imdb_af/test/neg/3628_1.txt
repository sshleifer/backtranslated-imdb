This show sucks. It was on rollercoaster on Friday night, and although it undoubtedly destroyed the current theme of Friday programming, I will judge it rationally ... still, I think it sucks. It's really super lame. Zoey and her stupid friends are poor characters and the pot sucks and is really lame. <br /> <br /> The lame continuity and pot suck and I think the dialogue and joes are weak. The poor humor and lame sucky characters suck, and the whole show is frankly a disappointment not worth watching. It sucks and is really really lame. It really should be one of the most fun shows on TV, it's really not worth watching. I mean how lame, weak and sucky can get a show before it gets together?
