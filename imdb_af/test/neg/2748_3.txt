Before I saw this movie, I heard some negative comments about it. But when I looked at it, I thought, "Okay, it's a bit slow, but it's quite interesting." Building on the end, it has created a complex moral dilemma that leads to a shocking film context, a perfectly credible decision with extremely powerful dramatic consequences. If that followed, it would have been a tremendously powerful end and would have given me a very good impression of the movie. <br /> <br /> But because of an end that not only emotionally protrudes, on an unnecessary happy ending without true emotional credibility, but also within the context of the movie, absolutely no sense to you. Obviously, one of the characters takes action that must end her life, but inexplicably. By the way, please tell me if I miss something here and there is a reason she survives, because I couldn't just how logical she could and it ruined the whole movie for me. <br /> <br /> That said, all three lead in powerful performances, although Kevin McKidd's characters' transformation at the end goes a bit further than it is quite convincing and creates a very powerful ethical triangle. <br /> <br /> This movie is recommended if you are preparing to walk out when the mother and sister are lying on the bed. But look no further than this, unless you just have a pinch, but several mountains, salt.
