Big Fat Slob 'Uncle Buck', played by John (eat-a-lot-of) Candy, visits the healthy members of his family for a week to baby two pretty kids (Gaby Hoffman and MacCauley Culkin) teenager (Jean Louisa Kelly). The shenanigans start when Buck makes breakfast and then in a bed tries to make two sizes too small for his blimp of a body. <br /> <br /> Mostly boring, but with two or three funny scenes, including Buck, trying to get a word in the edge of the phone with his angry friend (Amy Madigan) and his encounter with a very disgusting fool. <br /> <br /> Looks like he weighs 600 pounds.
