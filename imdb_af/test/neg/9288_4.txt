It's not uncommon for a celebrity to be confronted with the proverbial wake-up call. And if they survive this event, they come to a deeper understanding and appreciation for their particular happiness. However, in the case of a comedian, they are rarely as funny to their epiphany as they were. So is the case with Martin Lawrence. Honestly, I pay little attention to celebrities, because I have much better things to do with my life than to monitor others. So, I wasn't aware of the majority of what Lawrence had previously gone. It was interesting, but unfortunately, everything in general. I left the greater impression that this man's actions were not only very funny. Save the big life messages for a book, just be funny on stage. If you want to see a funny Martin Lawrence, rent out the old Def Jam he offered. Don't rent Runteldat.
