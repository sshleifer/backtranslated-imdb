Again, I am subdued by seemingly intelligent reviews that seem to make intelligent remarks about a clear cartoon. I actually lit my shoes, burned in my car, burned expensive petrol, and drove to the nearest rental site after reading reviews and paying $ 4 and changing it to rent this thing. I tell you, this is not worth spending the minimum kilo calories to lift your finger to switch channels on a TV remote. <br /> <br /> I even gave it a few minutes after seeing all the narratives of a pedigree box. It is presented as clinical symptoms of a director who. go senile or b. is only marginally interested in the film he / she is obliged to create. Over the past few years I have seen similar deterioration with John Carpenter's cord of ridiculous caricature. <br /> <br /> Here are some scenes as incriminating evidence. The priest has a disturbing dream ... presumably a wizard of grace to come, as he seems to be bent on opening the archaeological feature of the devil. The dream is a throwing collage of deviant images right out of the Twilight Zone's stock image. A ticking watch takes care of the dream sheep's blackness which implies what? The unwavering mystery of Time? .... big deal! A disembodied head, painted in demo features with the quality of the Halloween makeup, flicker back and forth in a convulsive madness. Every time I see this effect, it's a big fat secretion from Jacob's Ladder, it makes me down. It is immediately a film in itself. <br /> <br /> The whole building of the archaeological digs itself is ridiculous. Everything is so obvious ... so tired and excessive ... the only possible reaction is boredom. At one point in the digs, the priest commented on finding statues of angels around a sarcophagus ... they're all pointing down to the tomb with their weapons. He asks, "Look at these surrounding images .... It's as if they love something ... off!" It's supposed to build tension ... critical mass. But it doesn't even come close! How can there be tension if you treat the audience like a lot of morons that have to EXPLAIN the tension as you go. The imagery is in the first place excessive, but the additional comment just adds insult to injury in my opinion. Shortly thereafter, the grave is decorated with the remains of the soldiers placed there to protect the main atrium (another shameless rip-off from The Keep, VAT). Who cried out loud, made the makeup effects for this movie? The blood actually has that pink quality that one could see in the 70's Tromaville movie. At this point, I was almost convinced that they just forgot the make-up and had to go to Wal-Mart in the interest of time and money. <br /> <br /> Don't listen to glowing comments on this one! I will also keep a suspicious eye on Schrader. It looks like it's time to hang his gloves. Perhaps a good friend will give a gentle admonition to stop while there is still dignity in the memory of past films.
