On the pure theater side, Last Tribune was awesome, as the reenactments and soundtrack are very entertaining, but there are better accounts of this struggle found elsewhere, which, although not so long or exaggerated, are far more historically comprehensive. <br /> <br /> Some small details, such as the abuse of the word "hoplon" for the Greek hoplite shield and the wrong pronouncements of different names and words, really did eat at me. <br /> <br /> My guess would be that the history channel only played the last time of the movie's hype because the "Last Stand of the 300" was broadcast on the eve of the "300" scene release. <br /> <br /> If you look, For a depiction that is historically accurate in all respects, you can have better luck elsewhere.
