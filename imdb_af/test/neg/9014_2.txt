Another gray, horrible little scab of the Corman family. The first spacecraft in the outer spacecraft falls back on Earth (with some of the worst special effects ever), and the pilot seems to be dead. But appearances can be deceived. He is more alive than the rest of the cast, including a patronizing, misogynistic old doctor (who was also really VERY boring), a greasy guy who seems to have cut the market on hair oil, another guy so boring he does not even make an impression, a female scientist who is never hurt or angry about the old man's accusation, and a female photographer with a Farah Fawcett hairstyle (pre-Farah of course) and about as much liveliness as a dead duck. <br /> <br /> What are some of these people's names? I think it was Steve. Apparently, everyone in the role, including the women, was called Steve. Anyway, the dead pilot, Steve not only seems to be alive, but to incubate baby strangers (or seahorses, or shrimps, or whatever) in his upper body. The Mama animal that implanted these little insects looks like a giant bald parrot with claws. Again, I was impressed with the laughter ability factor of the monsters created by the House of Corman. The Space Root of Venus in This Conquer the World is still officially the worst, most laudable monster I've ever seen the screen grace, but the Cormans are always delivering when it comes to bad, oriental monsters. <br /> <br /> They also managed to deliver their other brands; ie a boring, confusing plot, long gray shots (thank God Corman did most of his films in black and white, as his dyes still look gray) two or three locations, stupid and dull props and special effects, and many dull dialogue. There are only two deaths in the movie (if you didn't count the fried parrot). Only blood cure is saved at the end of the film. Shout ran out of the country, I'm sure when the stranger shrinks the old doctor's head and (apparently) eats it. Now it can speak in English and have the doctor's memories. It can also move the pregnant astronaut as if he were Pinnochio. <br /> <br /> The monster's apparent intention is to rebuild his race by using people as food and giant wombs. There is a confusing bit to the end (though more confusing than usual, anyway) in which the creature tries to explain why it does, but it makes no sense. Something about how humanity will follow the steps of its race and destroy itself through something they will soon create. It never really said what it was. It can have been anything from toaster ovens to digital watches, who knows that. His baby less sticks himself rather than crawling the alien shrimp out of his body, and the oily guy (and the other man) burns the parrot alien with a Molotov cocktail. Ahh, the scent of lattice. End of the story, deviating the rest of the characters and rotting their dead comrade on the ground. Oh, hell, why not save yourself the cost of a funeral? I'm sure it was what Corman thought when trying to cut corners and make his scenes as cheap as possible.
