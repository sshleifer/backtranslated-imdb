I saw Hurlyburly on Broadway and liked it. I don't know what happened to the movie version because it was terrible. Perhaps a stage-based dialogue is just incoherent on the screen. Anyway, I couldn't wait for this movie to be over. The acting is universal over the top. Just Kevin Spacey put it together, and he seems to know he's in a bad movie and can't wait to get out.
