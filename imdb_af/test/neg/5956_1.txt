Where do I start? The box had to be enough to keep me away from this effort, but I was well-timed not to judge a book (or movie) at its cover, so I ignored the horrific graphic quality of the box and in each rented. But common sense should tell you that if they can't do a single still picture properly, how will it be so impressed that the moving people are later? Yes. They were pretty terrible. <br /> <br /> The actors in this movie are completely unaware that they are being filmed because only an expression looks good, regardless of the situation in which the characters were in or what they responded to. <br /> <br /> However, a good story can offset the downfall of low budget productions. A good dialogue can sometimes be a poorly funded effort. Unfortunately, this was not one of those times, because the story was as poor and non-existent as the other required elements of good theater. <br /> <br /> There are simply no words for how bad it was. <br /> <br /> Perhaps you can get the idea of ​​my -2.3 / 10 score from ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy :.
