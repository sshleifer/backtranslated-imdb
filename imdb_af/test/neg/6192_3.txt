It is a movie that sheds light on the Palestinian struggle against the Israeli occupation of Palestine, but it does not reveal the real feelings of the people and how they were attracted to believing that they could soon come to their home return, It does not call the masses the Jews like Der Yassine committed and how they tortured and destroyed the family of any Palestinian freedom fighter. They did not have the credibility of the actual Palestinian struggle and about Palestinian things, but it ended up with something about the suffering of Palestinian citizens as refugees in nearby Arab countries, the film focusing on the story of the man in the coma he now in the present time and through his story we see the film. The movie only tells the life of one person and has a few neck cards that are irrelevant to the story.
