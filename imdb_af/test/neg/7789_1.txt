This was only the second version of the classic story by Charles Dickens I saw, and unfortunately it was one of the worst. The film starts with a quick live action piece where Simon Callow as Charles Dickens begins the story of a Carol Carol, and then of course it goes to animated story itself. You probably already know, Ebenezer Scrooge is the grossly cold-blooded businessman who refuses to go for charity and hate Christmas. He is visited by Jacob Marley (Nicolas Cage) who warns him of the visits of the other three ghosts of Christmas past (Jane Horrocks), Present (Sir Michael Gambon) and the quiet future / yet to come. After all, of course he realizes the true magic of Christmas, and promises to be more beautiful in the future. The only changes I noticed were that Scrooge had mice as friends (a stupid idea), Scrooge's ex-love Belle (Kate Winslet) who needed him at the orphanage, the Ghost of Christmas Present which the two kids show, want "and" ignorance ", Scrooge still gets haunted after he got pretty, and he worries that he can't keep his promise to stay nice, also the lead role of Rhys Ifans as Bob Cratchit, Juliet Stevenson as Cratchit, Iain Jones as Scrooge's cousin Fred and Colin McFarlane as Fezziwig, the animation is not good quality, the actors have wasted their voices for a worthless piece of garbage. come, is the good voice of Kate Winslet, the closure of the "What If" closing rod, and the rest is just terribly awful.
