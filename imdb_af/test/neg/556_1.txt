Hillary Swank is an unattractive piece of work in this unattractive film work. Pat Morita, desperate for work, any kind of work, agreed to portray his role as the Karate teacher and bring his Karate karate back to the silver screen, except this time, Hillary "skank" Swank is the student. br /> <br /> I can only see how the Hollywood writers get excited about the idea of ​​a "painful, spoiled brat" woman, take the role of Ralph. The film doesn't work at any level and it's boring on every level. There is nothing interesting here and not even a lesson for someone to hold on to. The film was made without thinking of earning money because it is just as bad. <br /> <br /> I would like to spit all the actors in this movie because I was involved and the authors had blacklisted them. miserable and abusive efforts.
