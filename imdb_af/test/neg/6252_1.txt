Ok. I will admit it. I'm a big fan of b-movies. Back when Michelle Bauer, Linnea Quigley and Brinke Stevens managed the refuge. And then even the bad movies were still good. Unfortunately, it's a bad movie that's just bad. Even a small cameo by Brinke Stevens (which depicts her role as Linda of "Slumber Party Massacre" 21 years before) does not help this one. A group of cheerleaders escaping into a luxury cabin after breaking off the car. A psycho shows them one by one, gets them in different states of clearance. Bad writing, bad direction and horrible play make this one bad! Skip this turkey and go hire "Slumber Party Massacre." 01/01 *
