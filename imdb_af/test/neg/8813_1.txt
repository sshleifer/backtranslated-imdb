It was the most unrealistic movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can't believe the writer and director didn't see almost all the movies as an SF one. <br /> <br /> For example: <br /> <br /> 1. It is impossible for the killer to stay on cold luster and after 10 hours to get up so fast. <br /> <br /> 2. You cannot electrolyze through a water pipe, as in the movie. (Believe me, this is my domain) <br /> <br /> 3. With a saw you can cut 10 pipes in 10 hours very easily. Let's say the chain is made of steel, but the water pipe was rusty and it was made of iron. <br /> <br /> 4. If you are trying to cut your foot with a saw that is weak (at best, it is more likely to die because your heart fails) before getting to the bone ( shin). <br /> <br /> And there are other examples.
