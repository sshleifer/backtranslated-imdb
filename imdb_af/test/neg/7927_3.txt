Where do I start? The plot of the movie, which deals with the love between two high school students in wartime, while one is a living weapon, and their struggle to maintain that love, is a very good plot. It is based on a manga by Shin Takahashi that also changed into anime in 2002. Both I still have to read or see. <br /> <br /> This review, however, is about this lively action adjustment. Unfortunately, this honesty was a terrible movie. It is not as if one can put certain aspects, and say, for example, the budget is at fault or the actor has to blame. Unfortunately, this is a series of intriguing and ineffective elements that make this movie fall. <br /> <br /> The play is poor. Not to mention Aki Maeda and Shunsuke Kubozuka are bad actors, but they didn't have much to work with, and were overlooked. The physical series also did not have the physical series to draw the viewer into the story, and that it was too old for their parts to be distracting. <br /> <br /> The writing was poor, the behavior behaved unrealistically and behavior was irrational. The movie also plays for the heartbeats, but ends predictably, although it is not compelling and underplays the characters. There are also pacing issues. <br /> <br /> Visually, it is imperceptible. The movie uses the green screen heavily and unnecessarily in too many scenes. The other special effects are also inexpensive, especially where minimalist practical special effects could be used. There is also no visual flair, as if there was no movie or art designer to make the plays look consistent and stimulating. <br /> <br /> The music and sound effects were good, but imperceptible. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is not without pleasure, and fans of the series should not be discouraged to see it at least once for the sake of completion. People who are unfamiliar with Saikano are probably not the place to jump in because it's not a very good movie or melodrama. It's not the movie or the cast and the teams are wrong, it's just not inspired, and that's what kills it.
