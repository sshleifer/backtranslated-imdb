Dillon, Fish Bourne, Reno, had to work together for a much smarter effort, as this one moves in the B category and could be done with no-name actors and a much smaller budget, since at least 2 armored vehicles and A wasted warehouse could not have crossed too much. Since the authors couldn't come up with a smart plan, they targeted the dramatic aspects of the situation, but there wasn't much to exploit there. Fishbourne and Reno bring nothing to this movie except the media interest, they are just expensive advertising. Dillon is OK, but it was a step in the park. The choice of the main character, Ty Hackett, is quite uninspired and the final, with the "reward", is quite childish. Flush time, money, actors and so on.
