This movie was so stupid and slow it was slow. The only good part of the movie was the girl in the tight shinny gold pants. There were no gore over and what's an 80's horror movie without a bit of gore. Plus the killer was not scary at all, nor the murders. But if you want to see the world's worst horror movie, it's for you. Don't waste your time as I watched it.
