Jack Frost 2 is out of the question, I'm actually surprised, people are allowed to make these kind of movies. <br /> <br /> If Sam and his wife go to the Tropicana for a relaxing Christmas, Jack returns to kill. Don't make a swing in this movie, most people say it's a laugh with your friends, but frankly it's a waste of time. If the people who made this movie can get a job by doing what they do, they can at least take the time and effort to write a better story, especially the cheesy characters.
