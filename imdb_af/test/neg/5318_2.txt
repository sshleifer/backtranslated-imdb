It was painful! Recently given as a free DVD with a British newspaper, this British-Belgian co-production of 1977 (could have deceived me, it looks at least ten years older than that) is pretty worthless and if you pass half-mark, mark yourself as a wedding. The combination of animation and live action is at best brisk and straightforward frightening. It makes you wonder why it was decided to even make the movie as soon as technology was not there. Harris is just a human strut and the animation is one of the most flat and lifeless I have seen, with the mandatory trippy moments (especially where the animation of the Brainiac-type Subtracto character is involved) which has many cartoons. delivered. characteristics of the late sixties immediately dated. The Don Black script gives a convincing argument to the usually resilient lyric to hold on to what he does best, and the pace is so slow that even the very young will be bored. As for adults, stick to Jonathan Swift's original novel.
