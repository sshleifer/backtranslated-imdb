I thought of this movie when I looked at a pluto naked ... why both movies have a bit of a delayed robot, made this movie years earlier, but probably written by a screenwriter who does the same biotoxic coffee drunk or something like that. .. Who ... avoiding at all costs, even paying tribute to late Andy Andy Kaufman, is hard to do here ... find another movie or just watch taxi reruns on latent TV ... his Latka Grave character is so much more lovely ... THANK YOU BERRY MUCH
