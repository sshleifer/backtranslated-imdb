As usual, another masterpiece in the Visacademie series (HaHaHa). I don't know why they even bothered to make this trash. Just another series of policemen who are active. An important part was when Ginger Lynn Allen's character (Holly Wells) and Elizabeth Kaitan's character (Candy) deceived the scientist by wearing nothing but their bra and underwear under their labcoats. Just a wonderful scene (Ha). A person I didn't like was the Commissioner. He was very annoying and ignorant. They had to arrest him. Mrs. Devonshire was also very irritating. They had to stop this series after this movie.
