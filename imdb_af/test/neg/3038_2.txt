The original WASC is not a movie in the genre at all. In fact, if it wasn't the first 25 minutes, there wouldn't be a logical reason to look at it. The redesign takes the 25 minutes and turns it into a mediocre 85 minute teen Horror movie. <br /> <br /> Now, I have nothing against PG-13 Horror movies, but the tendency around them gets paralyzed. If you see the PG-13 rating, you expect a movie to be filled with fake scares, teenager t.v. or music stars, and a plot that has been used several times. Don't even ask for gore or violence. <br /> <br /> I know it's not right to compare both the original WASC and the remake, but I think it's necessary to do this because the whole idea of ​​the new one is based on the beginning of the original. The tension felt by the first movie is not at all present in the remake. Not even with the incredible settings or huge use of lightning. No voltage, voltage, excitement ... nothing. The movie goes too slow before it touches a bit "interesting", and that is when the stranger appears. The sequel is probably the best part of the movie, because at least there is a sense of "what will happen next?". But that's it. The situations set for the climax are predictable, boring, and lack of tension. The original has the merit to have the most important scenes, and also a cool climax for the main scene of the movie. <br /> <br /> Now I understand it's a PG-13 Horror movie, but if you pay respect for the original. Why does this change the most important situation? The kids are not supposed to survive! After the end, I felt that this movie was useless. So the baby sitter played cat and mouse with a wacko ... that's it? Then the order at the hospital was simply stupid. And worst of all, it means a sequel may be on the way. <br /> <br /> Camila Belle is the best part of the movie. She delivers a cute, credible performance. She must choose better projects, although this role will earn her thousands of teenage fans. <br /> <br /> Please, don't see this movie. Some people say that supporting the Horror genre is supposed to support any movie that comes out. I don't even need it. If we ignore movies like WASC, Horror movie producers will understand that we will not accept CRAP. We want good horror movies, not faint flicks full of fake horror stories. <br /> <br /> Look at the original "When a Stranger Calls" rather, as these are the first 25 minutes that WAY BETTER than the whole (useless) remake.
