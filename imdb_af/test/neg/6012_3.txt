Terrible adaptation of Heminway's low key love story. An American soldier (Rock Hudson) falls in love with a British nurse (Jennifer Jones) in Italy during the First World War. What's wrong with that? Almost everything. Hudson is WAY from his depth here. He can be a good actor, but not in this movie. Jones is too old for her role (she is 21 in the book - here she is 38 ... and watch it!). Also her acting varied between exaggerated and subdued! They took a simple low-key love story and blasted it all out of proportion. The movie is deadly (a little over 150 minutes), self-sufficient and filled to a ridiculous degree. Producer David O. Selznick seems to have thought he has done "Gone With the Wind" again. Some of the scenery is really amazing (even on a small TV screen), but there isn't enough of a story to customize the images. <br /> <br /> SPOILER !!! The end where Jones dies is supposed to be tragic, but the bad acting and overblown theatrics fought me not to laugh! <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, worse actor Vittorio De Sica persuades to a real embarrassment. Leaves, self-sufficient, badly thrown and slow. Very terrible. It was (understandably) a financial and critical bomb and ended Selznick's career as a producer. You might be looking for the end of the landscape, but it's really not worth it. I give it a 3.
