I don't understand why some of you (or many) gave this movie upwards of 8 stars out of 10. Do you understand that there are lower ratings for a reason? Sure, this could be a zombie flick with a few splatter, but that's it. I'm not a hater on zombie movies, but it was terrible. Really, actually, I have to call it more like a zombie soap, because that's how the play is. Production is ... well, okay. Hardly an attempt to make plot development, terrible acting, stupid effects, clich√© and a sudden end. Go ahead and love zombie movies, but never give it over a 5.0. Honestly, the only reason you want to see this movie is to laugh. Seriously.
