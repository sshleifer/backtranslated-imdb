First of all, Katherine Hepburn is bad mishap as Clara. She cannot be convincing as the devoted, selfless but caring woman the writers have created. <br /> <br /> But the real weakness of the movie is its flatness in the face of a potentially large piece of drama. . Schumann's bipolar (manic depressive) disease comes down to "Oh, I have a headache" and sometimes an evil word. Suicide? The word is used, but there is no sign of it in domestic scenes and when we see it in the mental hospital, it is calm and muted and smiles and optimistic. A superficial treatment. And Brahms is so upright and bourgeois - no sign of his rogue humor, his love of changing the nose of the settlement, no sign of his tortured attitude towards sex and women because of spending his youth piano in brothels. And was Clara's long concert career entirely about promoting Robert's music, or was she actually a remarkable pianist who wanted a career for her, a female pianist who worked out a place for herself in a male world? Any kind of treatment of the life of great artists is better than nothing, but it is a standard Hollywood middle road approach, especially disappointing because the true story is so much more dramatic, so much more interesting, so much more human.
