I sat here on the TV and hoping for the names that it would be worth the time ... but dear Gussie, who thought it was worth producing? The basic idea is excellent, but the performance is terribly bad, with a constantly illogical sequence of scenes, an end that is almost melodramatic, and poor Rock Hudson wanders through with a clear tangled look at his slightly face. Looks like a bad B-movie from the 40's ...
