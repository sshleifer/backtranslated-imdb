This movie could have been much better if it was, if it wasn't a Disney movie. I thought the young girl playing Shirley was right, you could say she was really trying to do the job. The teenage Shirley temple was not right at all. I think they should have spent the last time on her childhood, the first hour about the young Shirley, then the last hour had to be over the older Shirley. It was a boring movie, not a good Shirley Temple story.
