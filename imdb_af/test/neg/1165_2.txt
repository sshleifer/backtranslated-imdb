I just saw this movie and it just seems to be nice, as mentioned by other user reviews, and the one thing that bother me most was the southern accent that some characters had. It happened in Wisconsin and not in the south. As mentioned from other reviews, Ed Geine was not a big man, so why did the guy Jason and Leatherface play it? <br /> <br /> I jump most of it fast because there are very slow parts. <br /> <br /> Hopefully someone will do their homework on Ed Geine and the town and make a more accurate movie
