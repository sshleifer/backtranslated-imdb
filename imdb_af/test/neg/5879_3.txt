I recorded this movie because it got my eye as a movie with a Jewish comedy focus - something I haven't seen before. <br /> <br /> I approached this movie with an open mind, and was interested in the way it started. The opening is good together, and the first half of the film gave me lots of reasons to laugh, and that's good. <br /> <br /> However, the humor soon became repetitive, the plot became confused and tense. I realized I no longer enjoyed the movie. I tried to avoid it, but the movie was rather "cheap" - not a bad thing for a comedy when humor stops, but it doesn't. I confess that I might have missed the humor, not being Jewish myself and having little experience with Jewish culture. However, if we have the bulk of the humor in the movie, I'm unlikely to have missed much. <br /> <br /> The idea is a good one, and perhaps if there is a little more thought in the movie, there would have been constant vigilance. I wish I could give the movie a higher rating, but strictly it would have been better than a TV series or as a series of sketches. There just wasn't enough fresh material for a full-length movie. <br /> <br /> One thing to say about the casting - the lead seems to be designed with Ben Stiller, but I don't think the movie would have been worth it anymore if it was in it.
