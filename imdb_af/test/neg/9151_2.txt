I just saw a horrible movie called The Sleeping Dictionary. One reviewer at Four Word Film Review (www.fwfr.com) was right when he wrote, "From A to Zzzzzzzzz." The story is about an English colonial jerk coming to Malaysia to shame the wilderness to speak like that and eventually fall in love with his sleeping dictionary. A sleeping dictionary is a native Malaysian prostitute who flows in English who offers Englishmen colonialists and teaches her mother tongue in exchange for ... Well, the movie never really makes it clear, but I can only assume that he has her money or something give. Needless to say, the movie focuses much more on the "sleep" section than on the "dictionary" part of the job description. Things get complicated for our young hero when the forbidden love affair through her culture, his soap opera household situation and his own unlimited stupidity in every major decision he makes through the film is so exacerbated. So yes, the movie has some big mistakes, but on the other hand it has exactly the two things I rented for the first time: a beautifully photographed exotic place and an even more beautifully photographed and exotic woman who sleeps , Jessica, play. alba. My friend told me that this crappy movie was her most beautiful and it was right. She is not a great actress, and does not go completely for Malaysia, and it is quite clear that they use a body double for the nudity, but who cares? Jessica Alba has that rare face and figure that is more than just sexy, but also beautiful in the way a Vivaldi violin concert or a Rembrandt painting is. <br /> <br /> (PS Sorry for all your feminists out there who discourage objecting women, the "male look", etc., but I hope you can understand that I don't mean a lack of respect .)
