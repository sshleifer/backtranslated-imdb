I wanted to see this movie because I had with Vladimir Mashkov "Kavkazsky Plennik" and "Brat" ("Brother") with Sergey Bodrov, Jr. and "Vor" ("The Thief"). Well, unlike the other movies, "The Quickie" was a total waste of time. The story that makes little sense, very unequal acting (Lesley Ann Warren was particularly bad), very terrible dialogues, poor cinematography, what else can go wrong? I find it amusing that in virtually every American movie, when the same language-speaking aliens (Russians in this case) are left alone, they prefer to communicate with each other mostly in broken English (and when they speak Russian, for some reason Feel translators compelled to add many "f ** ks" to the sentences, which contain no profanity, literally or non-literally). At the same time, native English-speaking actors choose to speak in broken Russian. Why is it? To return to the story, make the most of the subplots of the movie (eg, the betting of the home, Latin American paramilitaries, etc.) Nor does it make sense or confuse the viewers. It is too bad that Bodrov, Mashkov and Leigh (all good actors in my humble opinion) became involved in this disaster.
