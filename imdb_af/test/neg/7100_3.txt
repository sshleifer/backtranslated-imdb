It is as if the editor and scriptwriter only had 40 minutes of real time. It is supposed to be a remake of a Chinese film, which is of course much better than that of the trash. It is clear that a mindless Hollywood suit or writer has decided that this movie mano mano man will be against man, instead of just playing the story with the characters of the characters who built in the first 40 minutes is. At this point in the film, the characters not only play regular people, not their own personalities. It makes little sense. It's pretty clear why this movie flop. It's just not credible and it's too bad - it started with promise. Don't be deceived.
