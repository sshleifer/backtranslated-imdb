It's one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. This is also my first review so you can tell that I must hate this movie a lot. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I love my serious movies. I don't like Hollywood too much, but I tend to be French, Italian, American or cute, or something that tries to communicate wisely. <br /> <br /> But it was terrible. Why? 1. The plot (as it was) was totally incredible, even though the director looked all at a sense of realism. <br /> <br /> 2. The main character has nothing to recommend him. Does he smoke for shade or show us his anxiety? For the sake of well-being, this man is meant to be an ex-dodgy mafia lawyer. Are we meant to care more, because it is also one of the commonest unfriendly people you could ever meet? And he smokes ... so he must have deep personal problems. Poppy Psychology is at its best. In the last few moments I almost shouted when he was buried in the cement. Best place for him. And I thought it was about the only good scene. Or maybe it was because it was the final credits so close. <br /> <br /> 3. The totally tired and incredible interest in the main character of the beautiful girl. She was there just because beautiful girls always have strange sexual relationships with old, old men with deep and meaningful personality (as shown by smoking). Sometimes it happens all the time. In really bad movies it is. <br /> <br /> 4. The pass was so loaded. I like slow, I like caution. But it was just death. <br /> <br /> A lot of other things I really don't bother. <br /> <br /> Awful.
