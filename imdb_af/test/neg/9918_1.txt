Without a doubt, one of the worst movies ever made. Slow and without structure, tension or story, the movie coast on the thin representation of a show gather. Conflicts are resolved within two or three seconds of their origin and dialogue is arbitrary and coincidental. Everything is put together in a slapdash order and often 'Stepping Out' feels more like a scrapped scene than a real movie. The movie just seems to be a showcase for gaudy and totally random Liza musical numbers. Shelly Winters can be seen in the much better octo-epic "Tentacles", and the REAL Liza can be found in the Showtime edition of "Queer Duck: The Movie".
