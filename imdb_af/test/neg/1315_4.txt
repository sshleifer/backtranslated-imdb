What remains is a tired formal effort on the disaster movie genre that will disappear with the ebb. <br /> <br /> A good throw is either thrown away or can't be bothered. The beautiful Joanne Whalley cannot bring a gravity to the role of police commissioner Nash, who wears the most annoying custom mid-gland above her dress. <br /> <br /> Jessalyn Gilseg plays the heavyweight part of the director of the Thames Barrier with all the beliefs of a fairground flare. Her Canadian nationality and accent are thought to have been set up to address a transatlantic audience. This and she failed. Her initial appearance in a sturdy fit pink jogging suit while at work is possible. <br /> <br /> The part of the siren old git that was right is played by Tom Courtenay as if he was acting in his sleep, and the various plot twists designed to play his son, played by Robert Carlyle. have difficulty getting any response from him. <br /> <br /> Nigel Planner seems determined to commit rituals to Hari Kari for his failures as Met office director, or for his acting, or both, and only David Suchet appears with some credit for his role. as Deputy PM. <br /> <br /> There was plenty in the story and the throw and the effects made a decent effort. Oh, that didn't happen.
