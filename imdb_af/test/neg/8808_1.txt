There are bad movies and then there are movies that are even the worst. Saw is just that. <br /> <br /> The movie is just bad at all points. The plot, the acting, the camera work, the music and all the others are absolutely horrible and I can't understand how such a trash made it on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The simple fact is that Saw is riddled with plotgate. That beginning is tempting and much to be expected, but it does not stop and the plot becomes absolutely ridiculous and absurd. The film is not creative and will not leave you with any credibility. People who claim that this movie is stingy, violent, sadistic and scary are sissy girls who have nightmares after watching CSI because it's far from that. <br /> <br /> So I warn you, don't try to look at it if you have any kind of intellect, because you'll be disappointed. A real bore and a mediocre movie as it can be.
