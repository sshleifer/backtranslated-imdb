BOOOOOOOORRRRINNGGGGGGGG and STOOOOOOOPIDDDDD. Stay asleep. If you want to turn Miles O'Keefe into a hairy Speedo, you should rent this movie anyway. If not, please do not bother ... Level with anachronisms. Was it supposed to be in the ice age, the ice age, the steel age or the age of reason? What was the reason for the black nylon wig on the man dressed as Genghis Khan? Was it really supposed to be Genghis Khan? If Ator had access to so much advanced technology and science, why did we wait another 1000 years for Leonardo? It's never clear where Ator comes from or if he's supposed to be a better kind. You wonder if this is all explained in the first movie, but after you have seen this one, you know you will never bother.
