This movie is USE, RENTAL, USE, USE, AND USE! It's not the worse movie I've ever seen, on the contrary, but ....... how am I going ....... IT'S BREAK! There is a very nice landscape and a smart, dry white, but it's about it. If it is advertised as a travel report, I would consider it a 7, but it is supposed to be a plot with a plot, a drama and a point or a satisfactory conclusion. <br /> <br /> I read some of the comments on this board about these movies and I wondered if they were watching the same movie I did. <br /> <br /> See this movie (yawn) at your own risk ....... one thing for sure - it's really rated = G RATING! (Which stands for GOD WHO IS MOST!)
