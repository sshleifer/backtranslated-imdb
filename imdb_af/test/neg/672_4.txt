The CinemaScope color scheme of Leon Shamroy is remarkable here, including his use of colored filters for <br /> <br /> different scenes. The Alfred Newmann score must be the most sensual and seductive score Hollywood ever made. It is a pity that it is no longer available on CD. However, the actors never rise to the occasion. The accent is so diverse, from the subdued Britons of Ustinov and Purdom to the Hollywood of Baxter and Volwasse that it seems a true hodgepodge with no central vision. Tommy Rettig is jarringly American. Acting styles offset the series of zombie-like. Only Ustinov as a friendly one-eyed servant steals the show - what is there to steal. The premise - the story of a young Egyptian doctor, seduced and abandoned by the rich - and the parallel theme of the single God cult, Ra - persecuted by the authorities, has its interesting points. But when the movie's plot fades, it's the haunting music and visual values.
