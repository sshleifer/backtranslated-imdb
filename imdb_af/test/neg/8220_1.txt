For those who might send me bad emails, move it. There is a trend in Hollywood where those who create exaggerated snooping videos are immediately impervious to criticism. Garden states tend to be one of those movies. <br /> <br /> Certainly, Zach Braff, star of a fairly over-rated sitcom, surprised people with some talent behind the camera, but it doesn't justify the kind of praise that a movie like this has received. The story is often too thin and level to give any real insight. People compared this movie to The Graduate, but those types are the types that are trying to sell independent cinema. Indian films are subject to the same hits and abuse, which usually hit studio movies, but people have forgotten that there are far more bad indie movies than good. Garden states are not horrific, but it is not good. <br /> <br /> First, the movie is too fast, leading to a fairly rapid revival of Large in its previous life. After ten years, people tend to act like he never left. Where's the discomfort? Of course, the situation is always solved by a fast-paced drug-tasting scene (which I would say is quite accurately depicted). The film seems to present many emotional inequalities, giving us the idea that emotion will appear in a deeper and more thorough way later. However, it fails to deliver on those fronts and let us wonder why the trip to some of its decisions and moments was quickly resolved (as Peter Saarsgard's digs robbed tendencies). It wasn't quite uncomfortable, but maybe we should stop praising the movie as something it isn't.
