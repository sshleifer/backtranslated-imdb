To summarize this movie, it is LaBute that surrenders its sadism into the kingdom of the comic farce. The predictable consequence is that he is constantly jogging on all the jokes by insisting on surrounding them with blood-shattering violence and extremely hateful characters. There is also evidence of his constant efforts to insult and mock everything in sight, but to apologize for it with poor gestures to the computer. The movie actually doesn't work, the plot is over, the characters are one-dimensional cliché, there is no consistency or development of anything, and the comedy (where it's not quite out of place) is the worst kind Morgan Freeman and René Zellweger are totally wasted on characters that look like parody of studio-driven hearing bandage - no matter what makes them enjoyable, neutral (and neutered) and full of moral platitudes. Crispin Glover is here long enough to convince you that he no longer belongs in movies. Chris Rock actually has negative chemistry with fellow hitman Freeman - it's like acting in different rooms, even when they are two inches apart. In effect, Chris Rock looks like a digital insert. At least he is not as annoying as Jar-Jar. <br /> <br /> LaBute's 15 minutes might be good. It already looks as if he is welcome.
