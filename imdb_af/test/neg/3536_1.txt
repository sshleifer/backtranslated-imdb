SPOILER !!!! Mind Ripper hmmmm .... I just watched the nightmare on Elm Street movies and just found out about Giovanni Ribisi. I thought Giovanni Ribisi didn't do any horrors, so I checked it out. I saw "the outpost" There was an air date on Sci Fi. So I was determined. I found my popcorn, came and sat on the couch and what is hell? A Freakin fat man in blue sweat pants running around shouting! Nothing is scary about this movie! If it's something funny! Funny how low the budget is, funny how predictable it is, funny, how bad is the acting and funny how much money it makes DIDNT. Ok Giovanni Ribisi is a good actor, but this movie is stupid. It's so stupid. They killed him at the end and then they went on this plane and the "monster" was on it. They shoot him in the head with a shotgun and it falls a long way to the ground. And <br /> <br /> -GASP- The killer ends, She's still alive! WOOHHH! Frightening! woooohhhh! Struggle fat bag of 2 hour shit waste. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: You have to go somewhere and you have to kill time. Mind Ripper is not the proposal. I'd rather sit naked in the snow than watch this movie a second time. <br /> <br /> GENERAL DEGREE: F- - - - - - - - - - (ENTERNAL)
