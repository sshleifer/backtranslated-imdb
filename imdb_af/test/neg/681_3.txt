This documentary is full of problems. <br /> <br /> How arrogant is to make a documentary about your own family? I understand you think the topic is interesting. I was bored with that. It's not a fascinating story for me, and I don't know why you'd think it was. <br /> <br /> I don't want to get that far from me, but I have to say: Most of the people in this movie are just not attractive. And it is good, not everyone is beautiful. But your camera technique to keep the lens in their face so you can't help but be overwhelmed by their unpleasant appearance because it fills your 47 "TV is not nice. I had to raise my hand half the time to Protect myself from warts, wrinkles, bags under the eyes and yellow teeth. I really don't try to sound inhumane, but pull the camera back so it doesn't breathe like the total strangers in my face. <br /> <br / > The camera work in this movie is a rank amateur level, this is the kind of camera work you see from everyone with a camcorder at a family picnic. Uninteresting framework, unstable, even static shots are indifferent. a little bit of trouble in doing so for a life. <br /> <br /> I honestly can't see the big problem about this thing.
