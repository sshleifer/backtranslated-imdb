I remember remembering this mini-series the first time in 1984 with a growing sense of anger and indignation. After reading the comments on this title, I have to agree with those of the people in Greece. It was produced to coincide with the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games and to me it was nothing more than an exercise in the jingoistic, flag-waving American nationalism in which American athletes were glorified at each one's expense. Some other nationalities will have every right to feel deeply insulted in the way they are portrayed in this series. However, it could help the way many American spectators performed during the Los Angeles Olympic Games in 1984 and TV coverage, which is only interested in events that Americans would probably win.
