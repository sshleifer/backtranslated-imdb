I bought it on VHS as "Terror Hospital", and when I got home, I checked IMDb and was like OMG this is the legendary "Nurse Sherri" !!! So here's another one from Al Adamson, who since the "Blood of Dracula's Castle" days has learned a few minuscule about the movies. Where that earlier effort is a more or less completely sclerotic clot, it mixes it up a bit, adding a definite element of variety and surprise amid incompetence. Probably half of the movie is a blind post-soccer player who shoots the breeze with his stacked nurse, but at any moment we can cut off the tinkering disrupted head of the satanic mastermind, or nurse Sherri who is a farmer with " run a lift truck, or cut a small piece of abstract student film quickly to cope with the pulsating blob effects in the possession scene, or the cheapest half-hearted topless bit ever, or God knows what else (I forget to be honest). As dumb bits move, this one goes to the high point. Congratulations, Al.
