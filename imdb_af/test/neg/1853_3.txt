We saw it in a shopping basket at the local Asda: £ 1.50 for the DVD. read all the hype plastered over the cover and say how "hillarious" it is, and it also has a very good, established role, we thought it should be a good movie. <br /> <br /> So we bought it, taken it home, moved it into the DVD player, sat down and waited for the funnies to start ....... and wait ..... .. and wait ..... and wait a little more. <br /> <br /> About 90 minutes later, though it felt more than 3 hours, the credits rolled, and that was the end of it. <br /> <br /> What a countdown - even paying £ 1.50 looked like God knows what Caine, Richardson and Gambon thought when they said "yes" to this tosh. And as for Moran: Well, as I enjoy Black Books, Shaun of the Dead, and his comedy shows, I felt he was in his depth in this movie. He tried too hard to laugh, probably thinking that if the attributes of his Black Books character would be preserved, it would work here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was fired back. The gags fell flat after a while and then he just became an irritation. It's a pity, because I believe he gave the right part, he can be a very good movie / character actor. <br /> <br /> Anyway, to sum it up: The actors in The Actors didn't do it! <br /> <br /> ** / *****
