At the end of the day, well start, Arnie plays a down and out cop (a very similar character to Riggs in Lethal weapon) and the story looks like a kind of serial killer action thriller that will be good entertainment. <br /> Unfortunately, failing to deliver, Arnie is as good as we expected, but like Gabriel Byrne, I expect that he prefers his roles more carefully than these. throw like the devil; this is probably the worst portrayal of the lord of darkness ever. <br /> <br /> This movie becomes a bit too brave for me, and the end series, apart from very poor, is visually one of the worst CGI's since the early nineties better than that. <br /> <br /> Quite simply not good enough. 4/10 (See it if you have, but don't expect too much, because it won't deliver)
