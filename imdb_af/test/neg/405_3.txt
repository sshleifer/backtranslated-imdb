36/100. It should not be confused with the decent Arachnophobia. This movie is a very low budget and cheap cut-off from that movie. This one is so bad, it actually has some entertainment value on that level. There are many unintended (I think) loud screens. I didn't expect much from the movie, and it was actually worse than I thought it would be. <br /> <br /> It is a clich√© that is ridden and predictable, right after video junk. Fortunately, it doesn't take too much. The acting, as expected, is not quite Oscar-caliber. The special effects are poor, worse than I thought they would be. Badly edited and the score is intrusive.
