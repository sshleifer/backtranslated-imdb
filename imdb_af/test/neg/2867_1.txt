I couldn't stand looking at this crap much. It's your standard junk that some annoying women love-old English era drama with lots of costumes and cliché characters that seem to be picked up either directly from oliver twist or another dick's novel. It uses the usual clichés from the Victorian era. Some idiotic people really think that the whole emotional torture of that culture is so bloody suppressed, somehow fascinating and romantic. It is juice, pure and mature litter and sowing like seeing grass grow. As such, it is perfect for women who want a kind of English rural snoozer-romantic drama in a Victorian setting, but for this man this movie is nothing but torture and cruel and unusual punishment to see a bunch of deadly scenes with inexpressible characters speaking in it. miserable and false English accent.
