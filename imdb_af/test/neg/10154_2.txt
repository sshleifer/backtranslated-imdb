my friend and I rented this one a few nights. And I have to say, this is the best movie I've ever seen. I mean, woah! "Sir, we'll better brew before this joint closes" and "men, Linda's don't wear a bra again." what poetry! Woah! And it's also such a wonderful original movie. I mean, you don't usually find a slasher movie where every murder is exactly the same. I mean, exactly! now it's originality. And almost all the transitions between scenes are these great close-ups of the psycho in the ER scrubs. how cool! the acting is so wonderful. the father was just brilliant. REAL DADS must have studied before filming. and how many movies do you not just feel? not much. but this is one of those jewels. I mean, how cool is it that one old man waited for six hours to pull a prank while his friends were both inside? It's really cool. Overall, I want to say this is the single biggest movie of the genre, no, in the world! *****
