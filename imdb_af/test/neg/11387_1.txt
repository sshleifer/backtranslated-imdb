First of all, the look stops ... little boy likes to dress in girl clothes. It reminded me of Norman Bates in PSYCHO or Ed Wood in ED WOOD. The jokes are lame and old. You saw it in a dozen of 50's and 60's. The whole throw is messed up. I bet people have signed up to just be in a Shirley MacLaine vehicle. Please, Will someone tell Shirley she did her best comedy in TWO MUSICS FOR SISTER SARA. See it ... if there isn't Andy Griffith again.
