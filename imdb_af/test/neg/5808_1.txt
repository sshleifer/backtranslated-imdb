Creating a comedy is like running a nice thin rope. It also works or not. Grandma's son is one of those movies that doesn't work. It may have some very funny parts, but for the majority it's just a terribly indecent comedy of the usual supporting characters in Adam Sandler films (Sandler himself, he's just a producer). <br /> <br /> Alex Allen Covert) is a game tester. He is 35, and is the best tester and game player at his otherwise child-filled workplace. He ends up picking up his apartment and his belongings from him because he hasn't paid the bills (as it turns out, his roommate only spent the rent on Philippine hookers and didn't pay the landlord). Desperately he moved with his grandmother, Lilly (Doris Roberts of Almal Liefde Raymond) and her two roommates. <br /> <br /> This is the basic plot of the movie, cast with subplots about a hot new girl named Samantha (Linda Cardelli, unrecognizable from her days as Velma in Scooby Doo), trying to get the testers to complete a new game as fast as possible, a robotic game that creates wonderful artist JP (Joel Moore) who works with Alex, and many wear the same clothes as Neo in The Matrix, and of course all sorts of sex and drug-related jokes. That's the problem. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film, besides the fact that the real conflict in the movie is resolved and resolved within the last fifteen minutes of the film, is that it is just not funny. It is quite annoyingly boring, and just barely funny. Nothing really happens. No emotion, no real sense of direction, and a whole ton of intense curse. You may find yourself on some funny clips that the actors say, but otherwise sit in absolute boredom, because you didn't even bother with the movie. How this movie was green and how Fox thought it could make money would always be a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> There is no entertainment value to come from. Neither of the actors actually performs well, they just like idiots for the camera and hope for the best. Stoner's comedy has been done several times, and sometimes it actually works (Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle and Dazed and Confused come to mind). Here it just makes the movie even less funny than it is. The random inclusion of a monkey and a few bare breasts does not make the film any better. <br /> <br /> Unlike some funny one-liners, this movie should be completely missed. It's not very funny, the whole plot is stupid, it's boring, and it just makes a horrible movie. Avoid it like the pest. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10.
