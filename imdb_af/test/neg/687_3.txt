I have so much testosterone as the next look, and Raquel Welch at her best is definitely worth a look; but the fact is that a cardboard cutout can perform better, and an hour and a half of mrs. W showing some of her substantial assets doesn't make a movie. <br /> <br /> Considering the cast, it's amazing that it's as bad as it is. I've never been a big fan of Wagner, and his tough old Harry is about as convincing as a 9-dollar bill. Godfrey Cambridge and Vittorio de Sica, both of whom I usually enjoy, seem to sleep through their lines; and for Edward G. Well, I can only assume he was there for the salary. <br /> <br /> This movie is a mess: from a non-existent plot, through a stop action and unfunny script to puerile slapstick and annoying 60's 'caper' music. If it wasn't for Miss Welch, I'd give it a 0. <br /> <br /> It was said, she's a surprise to the eyes - even better than her nice cameo in "Bedazzled" - and for that reason alone I gave it a 3.
