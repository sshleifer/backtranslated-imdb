You would have thought how much this residual waste would cost, that the budget would have been a decent writer. Instead, they looked at a standard of Hollywood Paint by Numbers, a disaster movie and dialogue. The only clich√© they missed was the Cute Child. But everybody else is there. There is the naughty hero who has been taken along with his former wife and estranged father. There is the dead father and the rebellious teenager. There was the professor who thought everyone was wrong until it appeared that he wasn't.

The cast, as shown, is incredible. But within minutes it became clear how bad it would be. Stuff this useless should come with a warning.
