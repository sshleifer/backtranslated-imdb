I saw worse, which is a backhanded way to say how crummy this movie was. The plot is ridiculous: A student shoots a police officer and five others take him hostage? In a dull, smoky New York school - and somehow, does this hostage hostage take 24 hours to solve? Are you serious? A day-long hostage situation - with a wounded NYPD officer no less, taking it all day? I realize this movie was made before 9/11, but still. I watched the watch and wondered how they could possibly drag this exaggerated plot for another hour and 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> The acting was almost mediocre, and the characters seemed to be thought of by the 7th graders. The child abuse child, the pregnant scared girl, the violent gangwoman, a confused unhappy victim, the wise man who crashed. Please. <br /> <br /> Try to make this hostage situation in a "more textbooks" and better school conditions mission? Please - this is a poor attempt to justify writing a movie about a child shooting a policeman. They are confused, ignorant idiots engaging in a stupid - obsessed situation. Don't try to paint them suddenly. The most delicious is Ziggy, who lives in the school's attic and admires Michaelangelo so much that he paints these striking scenes on the walls. You gotta joke me. <br /> <br /> The "no racism" signs in the protesting crowd? A black child shoots a black policeman and a black negotiator tries to fix it all. This is a random message. <br /> <br /> I understand the overall message, which was poorly portrayed, though by some actors who went on respectful careers. <br /> <br /> However, it was a joke. The red sniper lasers on the roof? The worst scene was the child, false snow falling, dying in the arms of his buddy on the roof, "promising me" etc. How original. <br /> <br /> The epilogue of "I went to prison, but now I am a preschool at XYZ University" ... an appropriate way to end a joke of a movie.
