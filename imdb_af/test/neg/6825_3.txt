When repeating these events many years ago, I thought, well, there is a basis for an interesting story here. Many secrets have never been uncovered, the horse never found, the main companions were never caught. <br /> <br /> However, this film seems to be distracted by character study and very little attention to the plot. However, some other questions are raised, as why on earth will Mickey Rourke be in this movie? It is good to see the rourke career, but he must turn off again. If the topic interests you, do an internet search on the subject, you will be more. educated and dare I say more entertainment. Avoid it.
