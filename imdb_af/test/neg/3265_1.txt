This movie is so God-fearing that it was literally a task to watch. I wanted to throw it out of my house and throw it over the room, but thought (foolishly) that it would eventually be funny and then everything would be right. "You lose, we win, yay!" This movie needs to be watched for anyone who even thought Jackie Mason was funny. Then, knock it over the head with this movie up to the cracks. And if you even consider renting this dream (or worse!)! I have one thing to ask you: didn't you even look at the cover? I mean, with such a shit you can say with just one glance how bad it is! "Oy vey!" This movie sucked.
