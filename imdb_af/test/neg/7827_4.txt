Asia Argento is a sexy beautiful woman who likes to run naked, which is not a bad thing in herself, but when her character talks about all the guys she has served, and to see her with Michael Madsen and An Asian guy in the presence of the movie, it made me feel that I needed a condom over my eyes to watch this movie, like a disease on me or something. <br /> <br /> The movie felt it was going for a love triangle / drama / action / ??? plot, it just seems to go everywhere and nowhere at the same time. The acting was wonderful, the plot, not so great. The director must at least choose a genre and practice, practice, practice, before attempting to do something as complicated as that, because of course it is not very good.
