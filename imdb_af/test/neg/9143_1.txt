If any movie that Italians ever made look bad, this is it. <br /> <br /> Duke Mitchell - what an A - HOLE. Duke Mitchell, I'm on your grave. Since virtually every person found in the movie of the cowardly Mimi is either black or another racial or ethnic minority, it is difficult not to be convinced that the man eventually commits his commitment to the Ku Klux Klan or skinhead do not blame. Awww, but he doesn't shoot the little black child in the elevator in the opening order, so that means he can't be bad, right? WRONG. Typical soft-head sentimental oppression. <br /> <br /> While I understand why some people might be hit and even admire the movie's presumptuous, totally un-PC boredom (it is certainly ashamed of its own hatred and feelings self-involvement), but it does not change the fact that the main characters, Mimi (and, by extension, Duke Mitchell), are thoroughly inhumane people who do not deserve one thing of empathy or importance, especially as Duke Mitchell is such a COMPLETE BREAD as an exporter. But what do you expect from a man whose main claim to celebrity (apart from the dog's t-d of a movie) was a second dean Dean Martin imitator?
