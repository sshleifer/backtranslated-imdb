I usually give the benefit of the doubt and follow it easily. But it is very poor. Exactly what happened in the first movie, happens again. Exactly the same. Only they wanted younger kids to be able to see it (this is the account for the repeated presence of Bugs Bunny, but why did they throw a 'f * ck') outside of me. <br /> <br /> They didn't even bother. to change Jackie Mason's character from Dangerfield's. Let me explain, in CADDYSHACK, Rodney Dangerfield played a real estate owner who enchanted the pushy members of the Bushwood country club. In this movie, Jackie Mason plays a drilling real estate owner who captivates the pushy members of Bushwood Country Club. A big effort they made to change the content of the script? No, I do not think so. A very indifferent Dan Aykroyd is scandalizing Bill Murray's character. He even goes to the gopher (now more like a Gremlin) in the same way Murray did. <br /> <br /> There is no laughter to be. An example of the 'comedy' in this movie: Jackie Mason gets ready for a hot date with Dyan Cannon. He is in the bathroom is his cloak. He moves to the door to put on his bedroom when the door handle breaks down. Wow!?! That's the best they can do. Eight years to think of a completely new successor and that's all we get !? I could have drawn a better script from my ass. <br /> <br /> See it only if you are the hard-fan of the original. This is the only way you can find any kind of laugh in it. Everyone else remains clear.
