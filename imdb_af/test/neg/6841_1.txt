Roll it out! Roll it out! This is Big Gay Bruce and his Big Gay Death Cannon! Plausible plot? Unnecessary! Good behavior? Unnecessary! Respect shown to his mighty ancestor? Unnecessary! Yes, it's another fake turkey in the Butch Bruce cannon. <br /> <br /> I mean where do you start with this movie? Okay, let's start with the unfortunate misunderstanding people may have somehow related to the book or the original movie, The Day of the Jackal. It's not. In fact, it's so different (and so bad) that Fredrick Forsyth asked to take his name from it. Now I'm not necessarily a stuffy Briton who can't hack Hollywood British British movies. Well, okay, maybe I'm so, but fortunately this is an excess point in this case. This film is so different from the original that the name and the strange reference are the only things that survive. <br /> <br /> Now let's move on to the premise. Cheesy Russian gangster is killed in a police raid in Moscow (somehow with the FBI, though no one makes it difficult to explain). In revenge brother of gangster decides to take revenge by killing the US president's wife (although no one explains why this is a good move, although it is right, it was 9-11, so he wasn't) t knowing it would have led to the US Air Force carpet bombardment Eastern Europe). Gangster rents "nasty" killer (Willis). Police hire "cuddly" killer (Gere), "cuddly" killer tracks "nasty" killer. The police are around and are regularly killed. "Crispy" killer kills "nasty" killer First lady was saved and we all realize that the IRA is just these bunch of real sweet guys, just happening to kill innocent people. We put the dishonest Hollywood habit into the trouble of Northern Ireland because it was a sand pit in a theme park. (I deal more with this point on the message boards.) As Hollywood directors, the Belfast butchers If hookers want to throw gold with hearts, it is up to them, of course I have the right to despise them. It's a free country. <br /> <br /> More egregious is the fact that the movie in it succeed in protecting and insulting the Irish while trying to support them, it is not politically contemptuous, it is much worse: it is incompetent, it is no wonder that Gere looks so good, because he slept Throughout the six months it took to make this piece of crazie, the fact that Gere's emphasis was never It's just the South Irish, but a frightening parody of Southern Irish shows that filmmakers don't look much more than America to make money from this movie. Then there is a beautiful scene at the end where Sidney Poitier (a complete waste of space in this movie) says he is going to drink coffee, we offer a "hug" IRA man one, then say casually: "Oh, but you drink Guinness, not you ". Yes, that's right, Sidney; The Irish live on Guinness and potatoes. <br /> <br /> While we are on the subject of Poitier: why? In the original movie, the detective is the tracker. In Jackal, Gere is the tracker. So, what does Poitier do? Well, he just hangs around and looks like twins. He has absolutely nothing to do, except to call in the marines at the end, and he does it just because the good IRA man tells him. <br /> <br /> While on the subject of Gere: why? I think it's just a matter of time before Hollywood remake Gandhi plays with Vin Diesel, ex-Mujahideen Command Mahatma Gandhi who hides his way throughout the 1940s and 50's India (after all, he is a bit dark of color and therefore most likely) a Muslim fundamentalist). Let's not forget that Gere's character is a killer and therefore a nasty piece of work. And if he isn't, why does he know The Jackal? If he is not, why does he know all his movements? And if he is, why is he such a nice cookie and such a lovely person? <br /> <br /> All this shows that the creators of this movie cannot be bothered to (a) think about the plot (b) make the characters decisions that are in line with their character (c) avoid cheesy stereotypes like killing the big boss his own friend ?? I honestly thought it was in a Bond movie. (D) gives the "central" characters something to do. (E) Attribute the audience with a kind of intelligence. <br /> <br /> This film is an insult to the British and Irish murdered in the hands of terrorists, this is an insult to the Irish people, it is an insult to not big but a nice good movie, and it is an insult to intelligence. But most of all ?? and most unforgivable ?? It's an insult to my business because I had to spend the past two hours running. Honestly, you think with no plot, no characters and no dialogue, it will be over in time. But they didn't even have the decency to stop early.
