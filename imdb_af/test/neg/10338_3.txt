This further movie in the Angel Guts saga, which is just a few minutes above an hour (it just feels much longer), is also the shortest, which might as well be, and it is also the bulk of the series . Nami, a shopping mall clerk, is interested in another part-time job. Her co-worker at the department store proposes to model for a porn power called "red porn". But when her other employers found out about her naughty photos, they decided to dismiss her. And she gets some unwanted admirers. Oh yes and she likes to masturbate .. ALOT. Use various household items. The wall-to-wall sexcapades masks lack a perceptible plot and push this one too much into the mining area, not surprisingly, as the director of this one is Toshiharu Ikeda ("Evil Dead Trap", "Beautiful Prey"). Perhaps his feelings were just not suitable for an Angel Guts movie. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Comment by Jasper Sharp; Bio / Filmographies; A 36 minute interview with Toshiharu Ikeda; Original sleeve art; and Trailers for this and 4 other Angel Guts Movies (High School Co Ed, Red Classroom, Red Vertigo, and Red Porn) are all available in Artsmagik's Box set, but for some reason the 6th movie is "Angel Guts : Red Flash "not set
