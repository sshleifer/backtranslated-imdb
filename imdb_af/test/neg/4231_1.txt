The main character, Pharaon, suffered a loss of his wife and child in the pre-film past. He handles it by closing emotionally. Too long a movie, spending too much time on Pharaon's unspeakable face, too much "road time" (one of the banks of TV: stuffing with moving cars, trains, etc.). Long scenes of him do trivial - sometimes completely inexplicable. subconsciously trivial actions with no reason or emotion. His best friends Joseph and Domino are not much more, their relationship based on sex (this film may give new meaning to the phrase "free sex"); Domino and Pharaon's mother are the two characters who show a little emotion, but not much. It's hard to tell with all the characters in this movie: it is carelessly acting, indifferent writing or simply careless characters portrayed by good writing and good acting. Characters in this movie speak very little to anyone; It is little wonder their emotionally isolated, which is increasingly bizarre, because it is clear that they live in a neighborhood where people are friendly and know each other.
