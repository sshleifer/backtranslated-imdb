When I watched this movie, I wonder why was Universal such a movie? They had a wonderful series of movies with all the classic horror movies. The explosion of the atomic age brought on an onslaught of giant creatures. Spiders, ants, bidmantis'. With the deadly mantis, we have a huge praying mantis flying in the north pole, frightening eskimos and being beaten by the armed forces. The bug reaches a tunnel in New York where the soldiers eventually destroy it. Of course, all this becomes much more transparent by viewing it on MST. Who thought it was a good idea to start the movie by showing a huge card?
