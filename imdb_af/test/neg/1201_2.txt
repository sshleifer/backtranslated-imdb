Without actually giving my age, I saw it for the first time more than 20 years ago when it was first on video (maybe it was a beta band?) And I was old enough to drink (hardly ) and maybe I had a few because I remember thinking how good this movie was! I saw it soberly and must admit it is a nice movie. As mentioned in other posts, the plot is absolutely ridiculous and the poor who trade only make it worse. It is a poor attempt to fantasize those teens, may be "Mavericks" (although I am surprised to find out that it had to be released at the same time as "Top Gun" and was not actually a poor imitation But for everything it is worth it - I find myself watching it when it is and I have the time. This is one of those movies that you watch because it's just as ridiculous and so desperate to take it seriously. Like that other "big" movie - "Moment by Moment" with John Travolta and Lily Tomlin .... don't get me started!
