It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I can't really believe people a) write scripts like this b) have a budget to make a movie c) actually expect it to be successful. Words can't even describe how horrible this movie is. I enjoy my fair share of teenage movies, but it didn't even get close to being funny. In fact, it was funny the only reason it was so terrible. I can probably count one (maybe two) parts in the movie, where I even managed to express a bell (other than the laugh at how bad it was.) <br /> <br /> It was one of the biggest mistakes. I've ever made. It was a day since I saw the movie, and I'm still in shock at how terrible it was. Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br /> 2/10
