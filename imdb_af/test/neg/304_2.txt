I wasted enough time, actually seeing this movie from a movie, I don't want to waste any more, write a great review. Not once did I tear as much as a smile. All the jokes were boring, forced and had no kind of white. I said, "where's the punchline?" Almost every character was an unpleasant stereotype and all the situations were clich√© and half the time there wasn't even a kind of solution. Things just happened to come to the next scene. For my life, I can't understand how it has so many good reviews as it did. If you love clunky acting and making badly composed movie, Fat Girls is the movie for you.
