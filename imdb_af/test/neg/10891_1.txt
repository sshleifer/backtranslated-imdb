There are movies that are so bad they are good. Then there are movies like Rest Stop that just never had to be made because they are just terrible. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, unlikely characters, predictable plot and a so-called supernatural twist that add nothing to the story are all key failures. Some half decent special effects are about the only worthy note. <br /> <br /> I can't even write myself a plot sketch because everything I really want to do here is that you shouldn't waste your time and money on this movie. Do yourself a favor and don't even bother with this movie. It is 1.5 hours of your life that you will never return. <br /> <br /> 1/10
