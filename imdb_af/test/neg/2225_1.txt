What irritates me with so-called 'science' programs like this is that it is presented as being a fact that dinosaurs live for millions of years. First, no one can even carry out a scientific experiment to prove that the earth is millions of billions of years old. It is a plain theory based on inaccurate radiometric dating with huge assumptions being thrown into the evolutionary pot. <br /> <br /> Second, no one can prove that evolution ever happened. All Darwin's missing links are still missing! Looking at all the fossils everywhere or on earth, they are complete animals of a certain kind, eg. A dog or a cat. No one ever found the skeleton of a dog in a cat or in the example presented in this series, a dinosaur that changes into a bird. <br /> <br /> It is adult pig wash. There is more evidence that Santa Claus exists than any animal that changes into another kind of animal. <br /> <br /> All the ideas presented in this series are an attempt to eliminate the idea that the universe and everything created in it. <br /> <br /> This series is NOT SCIENCE. It is a religious worldview that falls under the auspices of science. Science is something we can observe and repeat. What you see here is SCIENCE Fiction. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a science fiction program that has the ability to admit it is a science fiction program, look at Star Trek or Star Wars.
