It was a miserable and arduous mess. I need a shower when it was over. It goes as follows - some social people are murdered and a woman killer is assigned to the case. She discovers that the victims belong to an underground lesbian society, and she is friends with a group employee who can have relevant information. Of course, as the detective is an attractive woman, she is horny and intrigued (which tells a lot about Hollywood and his psychosis about women). What is surprising is that it is not very sexy or interesting, just depressed and yucky. Ellen Barkin performs well as the chief detective, and Julian Sands offers unintentional laughter as a cross-care psychiatrist. Therefore, it escapes a one-star rating.
