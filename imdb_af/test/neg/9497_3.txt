I love Ustinov's distinctive, literate narrative. And that photography is quiet, nice. We set the film for our 3.5 year old who drove in and out of the room. So for our first viewing, we only saw about 1/3 of the movie and were quite charming. When we looked again, we were sitting for family time, we were all killed by the violence and life-threatening situations that poor otter had entered. About halfway through the movie, there is a stretch of death, bloody furry animals. Lots of blood, not just a little. Then at the end, there is a wild battle with a dog, then the blood bleeds the water. You will think, given the G rating, that's all you will see ... that they will die ONE of the animals, will IMPLY. Nope. They drag the carcass out of the water and show it clearly for several traumatizing seconds. Personally, as an adult, I love horror movies and it is good with violent movies like Scorsese, Cronenberg, Tarantino. Heck, I love the ultra violent Battle Royale. But they are not children's films and do not advertise themselves as such. If you deliberately raise your youth to see the difficult lifestyle for cute animals, then this is the movie for you. However, if you are my wife and I, you can save your child nightmares and avoid this one.
