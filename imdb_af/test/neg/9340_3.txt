I found the movie a little predictable and boring, but I'm 14. <br /> <br /> I was really annoyed with my little cousin because she was very hyper that day, so I have a movie on the Disney Channel and watched it. and she told her. <br /> <br /> She's 6 and she loved the movie, she didn't get some pieces like the end, but neither did I get it Eddie was the star of the video I thought it was Jordan's video?! but she enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> I noticed the mistakes, as at the end. Jordan wasn't really the guitar, but she never did. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a movie for if you're seriously bored, or 10 and under. <br /> <br /> It calmed my cousin well. <br /> <br /> Though she was already This was the rest of the day.
