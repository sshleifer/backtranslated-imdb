I wish I could tell you that this film is as exciting as the theories it takes. But I can't. Another species could have come and mutated while waiting for some action. For such a controversial man, Darwin lived the most conventional life. If you didn't know about the crazy theories, you could almost miss him for a stamp collector. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers threw Darwin as a maze that made him an unserviceable service. Even when he briefly lost his mind because of his tireless theorisation, it was not interesting to look at. Maybe good thinkers are dull people? I don't know what I expected: a forehead bend eccentric with wild hair and eyes that simulate his love for all things, the luster of madness stretching from a folded forehead? A long-haired hermit struggling with animals? A heady woman who is mad with eyes, lights as beacons of truth? All of the above would have been good. It's the movies for Scorsese. <br /> <br /> But there was nothing about it. No lightning, no thunder, no wonder, no awe. Just Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly fresh from the Subtile acting Method of Respiration. I think someone with Darwin's ideas had a brain like a speed train, so why did this movie just throw - chug chug chug - like a slow winter? The disappointment is immeasurable.
