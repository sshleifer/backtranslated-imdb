How terrible is that? Let me count the ways: 1) It's a bait and link movie that begins with a UFO investigation, then it becomes a high-pressure sales for Christianity. C'mon! If the makers of this movie feel so strong about their message, why disguise it? It irritates non-believers and pushes fence harps in the opposite direction. 2) It's not even a good selling point! If the characters in this movie asked me to go to church with them, I would run like hell in the opposite direction. They're scary! 3) The acting is terrible. They all behaved as if they were in an educational film about labeling in the workplace. 4) The cinematography is bad at home. Wait, actually it's not even that good. 5) Writing bad, bad, bad. All dialogue, no action. Like a tennis match, they jump back and forth between the "talking head" close-ups. 6) direction ... what direction? Oh, there had to be a director somewhere. I challenge you to find out where. <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, I have some positive comments on this movie. The editing was professional but couldn't make a difference. A good change of bad material is still a bad movie. The opening theme music was really good! Lots of scary and UFO ish. Too bad was the movie not about UFOs. <br /> <br /> If you can't tell it, here's the bottom line. I wasted my money to see this movie, and it made me angry. If they didn't disguise what this movie really is about, I can say it's my fault.
