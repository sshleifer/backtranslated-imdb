What is this !! it's so bad. The animation looks so horrible, it looks like a ps1-type game. The actors are terrible, they just can't act to save their lives. I sat through all this movie and then I was very annoyed when I realized I had wasted 3 hours of my life. I didn't hear about this movie, did it actually come out of the cinema or went straight to DVD? A girl shot? That was just a silly movie. They copied completely 'The Day After Tomorrow'. It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I would definitely recommend that people don't waste their time with it. You can spend your time on 'The Day After Tomorrow', it's much better. Well that's what I think of the movie. Actually why did I waste my time writing it, ah dam !! It's really annoying to me, it's now 3 hours and 10 minutes mess.
