Just finished watching 2FTM. The trailers prompted me so much that I actually started it on the weekend, something I never do. Needless to say I was very disappointed. The story has so much potential and it is frustrating to see it broken up. I really felt the problem with the movie was the director and Matthew McConaughey. First, I'm not an MM hater, I thought he was great in both Reign of Fire and Lone Star. I enjoyed his performance in that movie without seeing him 3-4 times with his shirt. Yes, we all get him a good guy with a nice body, but I think most people knew it 10 years ago when he came to the scene in A Time to Kill. He showed him with his shirt from the pump of iron like a sweaty man. 3-4 times in the movie is completely unnecessary. I think once would have been enough. It won't surprise me if they throw those unnecessary scenes in such a girlfriend and women would be willing to be with their significant other, no woman wants to see a movie about sports gambling unless ...... Enough About that, let's go in his role. I felt his acting was very forced and he didn't look very comfortable. I know his character was supposed to be these charming southern, but his lines were corny and cheesy. It was almost as if he were referring to Times and Confused lines a few times! In short, I didn't have his character, although I was supposed to do it. The accent, its shirt off, corny pick up lines, poor sales pitches. His character was just too much of an instrument, such as Brandon or Jonathan. Pacino and Assante were wonderful, but this is no surprise. Piven is fun to watch as Arie .... oooops I mean Jerry. I just felt this movie was very commercial and poorly constructed. It is insulting that they can take a wonderful story and throw in the crap ingredients to make it a success in the cash register. 1. Cool story that attracts the male profession 2. Hunky Hollywood actor for female women (make sure he has lots of scenes with shirt to lift weights) 3. Al Pacino with 4 big speech tonal and 25 big one linen 3. Each character will be dressed in a thousand dollar suites and has a very dark brown 4. Jeremy Piven to play the same character he did in Entourage and Old School. 4. Throw Armand Assante to seal the deal 5. Plot, good writing, character development and intelligent decisions are unnecessary <br /> <br /> It will be good enough for most people but not me! Anyone who doesn't disagree with me asks you. Will this movie be much better than: A. Directed by Sodeberg B. DeCaprio or Ed Norton as Brandon instead of MM <br /> <br /> I will probably be part of the minority if I think this movie sucks. I realized when the woman next to me was crying during the ridiculous end scene of Pacino giving off a fake tear while embracing Russo. The financial success of this movie will ensure one thing. The movie is going to get public that the movie will want public, big budget cookie.
