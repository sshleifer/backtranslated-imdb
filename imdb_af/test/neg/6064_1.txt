The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece. John Garfield, Ann Revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee ... and filmed by one of the greatest filmmakers to ever enjoy the screen. James Wong Howe. These remakes are horrible. Despite the presence of Rod Steiger, Joe Mantegna and Jennifer Beals, there is nothing of value here and it is a pity that this product has the same title as the brilliant original. Just the main character's name, Charlie Davis, is the same in both films. I don't think there are redeeming features in this remake. I'm surprised Rod Steiger participated. It could be the only bad movie he ever made. Maybe he needed the salary.
