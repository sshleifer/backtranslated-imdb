Yes, that's what I felt after I followed the movie. The acting is below average and the special effects are terrible. In fact, the worst I've ever seen. This is a very low budget movie. There is no way this movie can scare you, it has no creepy or scary moments. Mr. Beeneter was a funny creature to me. It could have been much better, but oh, they didn't have a big budget. The movie fails to convince you that you're watching a horror movie, lol. I will call this movie The Time Eater (waster). I'm sure you'll have much better movies / etc to watch. Still watch it as: 1. You have nothing else to look at. 2. You get it for free. Not worth the rent.
