National Lampoon's Christmas Holiday 2: Nous Eddie's Island Adventure (2003). Randy Quaid, Miriam Flynn, Dana Barron, Jake Thomas, Sung Hi Lee, Eric Idle, Fred Willard, Ed Asner, D: Nick Marck. The embarrassment of direct-to-video flop left Cousin Eddie and his family out of his boss on an expense-paid vacation. He hopes the dunce will not sue his company after being bitten by a smarter laboratory monkey! Idiotic spin off may not meet any of the holiday movies (even European holidays!), With a question whether the filmmakers thought the writing was actually funny. Not even Quaid, Willard or Asner can remotely monitor it. 83 min., Not appreciated. *
