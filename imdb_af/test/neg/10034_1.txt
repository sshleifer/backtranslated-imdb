I saw this movie with my girlfriend. It was a total disaster. You can really see it's made cheap. Badly written and with very bad acting. I have read several versions of the book by various authors and also listened to one version on audiobook. We couldn't take the movie seriously because of the lack of elements it had to contain. The experience of it was like The Blair Witch visiting Green Acres. Then there were vulgar parts. They show this little boy with a bedpan and they actually show their contents. The witch laughs at its contents on the boy and the whole family. I thought it was nasty and very strange. I really can't understand why anyone would think it would be entertaining. It shows another scene where dr. Mize arrives and Betsy Bell blows in her dress on the steps of their home in front of her mother and brothers. Instead of the mother leading her, it's the brother. How sick? The little boy in the first scene of the many scenes about how your body has waste, asks for toilet paper and goes to the house and makes these sickly faces of joy with sound effects. I think they had to leave it all. The make-up on dominee James Johnston as an older man didn't really assume he was older. It made you think he was baptized in fishing gear. The blood on Joshua Gardner when he falls off the ladder is even worse. The John Bell death scene seems to have come out of their meal and is trying to do something to make him look like a serious sick man. For me too much sickly comedy with bathroom problems and inexperienced people involved, the downfall of this photo was. These people will do better than their movie ads for local TV stations for bathroom products. They chose a good subject and couldn't produce it properly. I rate this movie Capital F minus.
