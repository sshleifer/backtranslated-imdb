If you want to preview how to make a movie, you should see it. I myself, with no movie making experience could do better. The writing is ridiculous with a poor plot and there is no effort to be seen for any intelligent structure. To make this mistake, would you think the action would be decent, wouldn't you? <br /> <br /> Since the acting, editing and overall finishing of the movie are frightening, the only saving grace is the terrible performance of the main actor. The reason why he is the saving grace is because he is so bad at acting, that he must win an Oscar for it. At least some recognition to make me laugh so much about him. <br /> <br /> Toss in a dead woman's body after a male shootout (where does she come from?), pull the semi-automatic trigger dozens of times while the soundman is taking off two shooting effects, the camera's crew in Kool Mo Dee's shades, one and only movie for the whole film, an original script that has no logic; is a perfect recipe for a really bad movie. It's actually more fun to spot the mistakes than trying to find something positive. Avoid at all costs.
