OK, I read the director's comments on this movie (appear as the "leading comment"), and I have to admit that I can identify with his position. <br /> <br /> Micheal, I hope your career will be restored. specific setback and you went further with other, better things. I saw this movie in the MST3K form. Even with all the choppy continuity and snotty remarks thrown out by the robots, I saw a potential movie with an ambitious set of ideas trying to fight out of the limited budget and limited actors. And that's one of those movies ('Mitchell' is another) where the MST3K team took very cheap shots at the main character, even when she actually got better. You know they had unfair fun on the actor's cost because it made for a live episode. <br /> <br /> IMO, the fact that the movie actually tried to be something, and had some decent, effective moments here and there, should keep it out of the 'Bottom 100' ('Tangents / Time Chasers' is another movie with a plot and a heart that doesn't deserve it. <br /> <br /> But it's still not a very good movie. I do not blame the author / chief actress for whom she is. It's just that her performance and writing skills still need a few more years to mature before she can draw such a delicacy project like this or carry a feature film. The writing and characterization is amateurish and slapdash, and the dialogue is often rare for ABC Afterschool Special Standards. The governor gives it their best efforts, and the play in general is definitely head and shoulders above abortions such as "Future War" or "Space Mine", but there aren't really professional level achievements here, except for "Big Joe" Estevez, who is hammy but quite intense. I have never seen the full original track, but MST's "Soultaker" sampling was representative enough to make these facts clear. <br /> <br /> Oh, and that movie has Robert Z'Dar in it. That is, IMO, a true 'Kiss of Death' for any movie that hopes to be taken seriously. Yes, he is big and scary in his role, but I just hate the man as an actor. (In real life I wish him well and hope he is financially comfortable). <br /> <br /> There were little things I liked about the movie. For example, the camaraderie between the male head and his dead buddy added warmth and humor to the movie and made it much more viewable. The idea of ​​a hospital lift that opened its doors to the aftermath was an inspired way to call up some ghostly vibes without having special effects, and I have those who worked it , respected to keep the budget manageable. It doesn't really work, but it might tweak a little more. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Mr. Rissi, better luck with your other projects. Your involvement in this burning fire would not keep me. to see something else you did when the buzz was good. A wife. Miller has nothing to be ashamed of - she was young and ambitious, and the movie wasn't that bad.
