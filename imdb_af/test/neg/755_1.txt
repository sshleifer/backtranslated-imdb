In my opinion, the film was fake - bad dialogue. Whoever wrote the script - please keep your daily work. This is definitely NOT Godfather or Goodfellas. It's good to be on the other side of the table - poor choice of words. Some of the characters were clowns. But what do you expect from a low budget movie without name actors.
