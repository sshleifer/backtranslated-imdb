If you've ever worked at Wal-Mart, you probably know about the $ 5 DVD bin sitting at the electronics department. Well, that's where I got this movie. However, I was lucky! You see, the cover of this DVD had a big picture of Sandy Bullock on it and even called her name a "leader". I picked up to think, "Wow, I didn't know Sandra Bullock did this movie !!!!" So I'm pumped to go home and watch a cool Sandra Bullock movie. To my surprise, Miss. Bullock had a small role ..... very small role. She plays the girl of the CIA agent's son. Talk about supporting actress. She may not have more than 2 lines in the movie. Apart from being deceived by the fact that it is a Bullock movie, I looked past and I continued to watch an action-packed movie. Negative! At one point, for special effects, a gun is pasted onto the camera. You should see it laughing at what is really real.
