First of all, let me underline that I'm not a big fan of political correctness. In fact, I like satire or dark humor, even though it makes jokes out of minorities. The reason I am not sure that this racist work is not worth it is that it does not make minorities to show their state of life, their social circumstances or the way they are treated by society. In addition, it uses every stupid stereotype and bias to enhance xenophobic feelings and discussions. It's really a pity, but not a surprise, that the other comments didn't get the point, because we all had a cheap laugh. Congratulations.
