I watched the first two nights before looking at IMDb and looking for information about the actor. I saw the 9+ rating that surprised me because I wasn't so impressed with what I saw. (As a reference, I believe that Lonesome Dove was the best TV western ever. I grew up in the Culver City next to the MGM in the 50's and have some respect for the Western genre.) <br /> <br /> So I saw the glowing first review and decided to read "more". There I found several reviews with 1 or 2 stars that summed up my feelings about the lack of character development, poor editing, feeling shot in the universal background (MGMs have long gone) and overall impression it was not going come close to changing my feelings about LD. My impression is that the overwhelming voice of those who chose to write was "less than a 4.0". <br /> <br /> It has prompted me to wonder about the process of achieving a 9+ rating. If the people who give the 10's and 9's don't take the time to justify their vote, are the polls filled by people with a monetary motivation? I have used IMDb for a long time as one instrument to screen movies and have the best available. Now I'm not so sure.
