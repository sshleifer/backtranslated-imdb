I found this movie to be extremely homophobic ... the main character does not know he is gay until he realizes that he likes Barbra Streisand and has a slack joint !!! I was so offensive that I went up to the Toronto Film Festival and wrote to the author to complain about this movie. This is the kind of movie that GLAAD has to work to ban.
