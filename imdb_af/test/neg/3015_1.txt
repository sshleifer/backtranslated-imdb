Lord, from here, it's a fast-paced lineage of your own real version of a night at Roxbury. <br /> <br /> 2) Say "The V.I.P." The term "V.I.P." in itself is not bad, but when preceded by "the" it immediately becomes part of the Douchebag Dictionary. It's double for white people. <br /> <br /> 3) People who make TV shows based on things they don't know are not cool and then position on IMDb as "fans" (... right ... ) One of the United States's (hey too!) bitterly offended members of their potential audience for the inevitable thinking their show sucks. Minus 1 additional demerit point if they apply any variation to the oh-snap-nice-one-bro justification that "If you don't like the show, of course you can't be laid." <br /> <br /> 4) Canadian Hip-Hop / R & B sensation Massari ... a random addition to the list at first glance, but at the end of the day Massari gets the gas face for the simple reason that its particular brand of low-rent American-aping uncool and general Aqua Velva douchebaggery leopards with the overall sensitivity of "Keys to the VIP" <br /> <br /> 5) Last but not least, "Keys to the VIP " ... for all the above reasons and more.
