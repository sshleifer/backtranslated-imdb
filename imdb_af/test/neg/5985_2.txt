If it is the author and director's idea of ​​a part of life, they are clinically manic depressive. A sad, moody movie at its best, with ubiquitous aimless and unhappy characters working together with disastrous results. This movie is being charged as a comedy. What was so funny about the loss of your home after an alleged premeditated arson or the drug-forced rape of one of the main characters. Is this art imitating life? Jack Black was generously amusing like the mountain man, weed farmer. However, even this segment of the film was full of pathos. What was the center of life in the middle of nowhere with an entourage? If Black's character was so paranoid, why did he become sour with a group of people right out of Woodstock? There is no end to mortgage relationships, a plot less script, and scene transitions lacking any coherence or logical chronology.
