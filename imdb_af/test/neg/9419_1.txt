I had the dubious opportunity to watch this movie on TV. This is the perfect example of how to take a terrible script and change it into one of the worst movies ever made. Not only is the dramatic bad and the consequences terrible, but the film has more logical holes than ten pounds of imported Swiss cheese. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie as an example of how not to make a movie and which director you shouldn't use in one of yours. <br /> <br /> I switched off the TV during the last ten minutes of the show. To call it 'pathetic' is a gross understatement.
