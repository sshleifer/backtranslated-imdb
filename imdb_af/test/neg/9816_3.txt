A piggy Linnea Quigley drinks milk, syrup and kills her sister and her boyfriend's boyfriend after having sex. She goes to an asylum, makes a best friend from Amy (Karen Russell) and the two extortionists go away from a spiritual institution by sleeping with their psychologists (one is played by a regular Lyle Wagoner "Carol Burnett Show "). On the outside, these two man-hate mafia princes (!) Keep taking their medication and inviting six workshop ex-boyfriends to their large country home for a feast where they are systematically slaughtered in a greedy way. by a gloves, dressed mystery killer. <br /> <br /> The awful David Barton FX is so bloody but so unrealistic that it takes a kind of surrealistic quality. The same goes for the movie. The dialogue is so strange and stylized, the movie has been so indifferently edited and edited and the play is so global, you will begin to doubt your own common sense. This movie actually tries to get a plot and three-dimensional characters, but it is so poorly handled. It's almost like what happens if Ed Wood wrote an Ingmar Bergman script! And like any good Bergman movie, it has a mature morale to adhere to - Any good party must have a good old / girl relationship, "so there will be enough chicks to tickle your lizard. See it for yourself. .. or not! <br /> <br /> Linnea (the only reason I'm even interested in seeing it to start with) is very amusing in this one, has much more dialogue than usual and has several obvious naaktonel. Unfortunately, she also disappears completely from the last third of this film and the movie suffers. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
