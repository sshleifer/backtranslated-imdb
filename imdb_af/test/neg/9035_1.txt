Just finished watching this movie while playing on TV and I had nothing else to do. Went here to watch IMDb on the trivia page too and looked at the users' comments. And what do I find? Every stupid idiot increases this movie to the air! I wouldn't even have written anything, but if nobody else takes the time to spread the word about this sucking ass film, I thought I could. <br /> <br /> The play sucked everyone around. The worst was the man Brian Wilson plays (I think I got the name done) as he persuaded, especially when he was high. The rest was not as bad as he was, but no one was good either. I'm not an expert on beach boys, but can't really complain so much about the story, except it sucked. No motivation for any of the character decisions most of the time, but hey, maybe they were idiots in real life. And what I found the worst was that I thought it would be a movie about the beach boys, but you really just had a few characters left. I hate when they do it in movies, the same thing in the doors, even though I love the movie. No more energy to write more ... it sucked! Don't buy or look!
