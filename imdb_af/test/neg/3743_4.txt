The fact that this movie is basement quality is a real shame, but back in the 1940s it was the only kind of movie made for theaters that boast black audiences due to segregation. So, while MGM, Warner and all the other great studios made extremely polished films, there were small studios with noxious budgets to be amazed at what they had. And if you see this movie, it is clear that there is a lot of energy in making the movie, even though it is a beautiful louse movie aesthetically. Some of the actors were not very good (especially the French man), the sets were minimal and the plot was quite stupid. BUT the movie also had good music - from different styles from Classical to Jazz to Rhythm and Blues. This is due to many talented but many unknown black artists. <br /> <br /> Now, as far as the plot is concerned, it was quite stupid and stupid, but still visible in a fast-paced way. I loved watching Tim Moore ("Kingfish" from the AMOS AN ANDY TV show) because he made the biggest ugliest woman in the history of cinema (including the Frankenstein Bride and many others) - this is likely due to the fact that when he was not in tow he was a pretty ugly but funny man. If the man pretends to be a woman, he actually looked like a woman, I doubt if this movie worked too. To see this ugly and rubbery man with a cheesy wig is still sought after by three suitors. It was quite funny. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie, but from a historical point of view it's fascinating and excellent viewing for young adults to know how America was for blacks in this era. A very interesting and funny time capsule.
