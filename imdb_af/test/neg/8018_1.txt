Thomas Hardy is one of my favorite writers. There are some wonderful films made of his novels ("Far From the Madding Crowd", "Tess of D'Urbervilles," "The Mayor of Casterbridge"), and I had great expectations for this one. The Hallmark-Hall-of-Fame asication of "Return of the native" completely destroyed it. The film was awesome, photography was excellent, but the writing was jealous and the direction was positively devastating. People walked up to people, said lines, walked away. A slight excitement arose when Clive Owen and Catherine Zeta Jones (very young, very nice) exchanged a bit of meat, but even Clive, who is an excellent actor, cannot save it. It was overwhelmed with the usual Hallmark "romantic" strings of background music and featured bumpkins that provide plot outline, and what could have been dynamite was terrible. The wealth of the above three movies was initially absent.
