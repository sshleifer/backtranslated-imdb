This movie doesn't have a very clear picture of what it is or wants to be. There are some good bits when Stewart is on the screen and they give him a few lines to work with. It works early as a romantic comedy, but the story is looking for more dramatic territory and is lost in the process. By the last fifteen minutes or so, plots are just a series of dramatic clicks. <br /> <br /> The part with the plane feels like some remnants of another movie. <br /> <br /> The main reason I can think of is to say you've seen Jimmy Stewart's movies.
