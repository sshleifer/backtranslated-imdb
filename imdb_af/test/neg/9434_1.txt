Could there be a worst movie? Even Ed Wood at his horrible worst couldn't have happened to something so bad. Cheesy, stupid, long lasting, deadly ... and these are the good points. I saw this rubbish in the early 80's when I was very bored to get started and actually sat through the whole thing without blowing my brain out, though it would probably have been a pleasant experience. I actually remembered it because it was so bad. It makes me sad because some of the best directors started making TV movies (that is, Spielberg) and it was a great way to get their first material to the public, but the scratch just made it completely killed. process.
