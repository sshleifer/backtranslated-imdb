What can I say about this? Such a great Prestige production - but in the end? Lost time, wasted money. <br /> <br /> This work has been a disaster historically. Only a few examples: <br /> <br /> * August is often called 'Gaius' - its first name (Pronomen). But the old Romans don't use this name. Correct will be the Van (Nomen Gentile and Cognomen) or the 'Octavian', 'Caesar', 'August'. <br /> <br /> * Livia is shown as a tyrannical woman. But this historically wrong. <br /> <br /> * Iulia was shown as a pretty young woman - but she wasn't one. Adultery and (perhaps?) Prostitution and arrogant behavior were the cause of her exile. <br /> <br /> * She was not at her father's deathbed. She was never allowed to leave her. And she was about 50 years old! Not as young as she was shown. In the same year, August died, she committed suicide because Tiberius stopped giving her a pension. <br /> <br /> * August was much more impeccable than shown in this movie. But writer and director seem to believe August's own 'Res Gestae'. <br /> <br /> What remains? Historically extremely dubious, bad acting, poor building and equipment - 2 points out of 10 - one for Peter O'Toole.
