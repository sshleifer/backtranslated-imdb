This movie is filled with so many idiotic moments that you wonder how it was ever made. For example, they come into the sewers of the Capitol and while in the sewer, you can see signs referring to various government buildings, and then they come in the middle of the street! I doubt many that state buildings will provide public access through the city's sewerage system. Anyway, I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because of its comic value. I laughed all the way at the idiot of everyone involved in this movie.
