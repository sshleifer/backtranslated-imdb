Wow, what exciting visual effects. I also loved the costumes and artwork, the circus and ethereal feel of the film was sublime. It just needed the viewer to worry about the fate of our protagonist. As she is trapped in her imagination, there is never a sense of danger, otherwise David Lynch's ghostly movies say. It also shows which age group this movie is aimed at. Who will involve it? <br /> <br /> Of course, Mirrormask will compare to Labyrinth's teen / fantasy theme, but unfortunately it doesn't really matter to deliver the same Henson essence. The sick mother theme is never fully explained and certainly not something you care about while uploading the eyeball. <br /> <br /> Not terribly terribly a la The Cell, and not as dreamy as Labyrinth - an unforgettable but good-looking fantasy.
