Bad news for anyone who wants to make a full-length episode of a lifetime network movie - the creators of a deadly encounter have already done so, though unintentionally. All the lifelong tropics are there - a divorced mother in danger of a confused stalker, an unreliable ex-husband (who, of course, cheated on her while they were married) and a police department denying her complaints and forcing her to stand for himself. Especially jaw is the scene where the heroine, after keeping a burglary and the attempted murder of her mother by her seemingly ubiquitous stalker, decides to ease the stress by shopping! I saw first hand the harassment of a fellow worker by a few crawls she met in the church. I know stalking is not a joke, but it is definitely in this movie.
