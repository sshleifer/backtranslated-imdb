I'll just praise it in one respect. It was innovative. Innovative does not mean it is a good movie, it means it can give you an idea of ​​what you can take and implement in your own movies. <br /> <br /> The simple plot is .. well .. simple. I came to the point where I didn't care if they destroyed the building or not. If I had to hear the girl's annoying giggle once again, I swear I'd move the DVD out of the window. And there is also the lead. They're trying to love him, but he's a freakin 'pervert! Sniffing the girls bra, sniffing her on her when she's naked, put her bra over his eyes as he sleeps, puts her bra on a sex doll (which she takes off her panties while he sleeps and hits them on his doll. Umm) < br /> What even annoys me is the crazy touch. In the photo gallery on the DVD, you can see what the movie looks like before they turn gray and in a color (also digital). The film looks much better without the effect. So they sacrificed it to be a good thing. movie just to be art ... bah. I can understand that if the film quality was so good. <br /> <br /> I think most people who like this movie just chose it because the chick was naked for a good 5-10 minutes. It doesn't compare to Delicatessen (as so many are tryign). Delicacies have characters that you can enter and keep. These people are just grumpy and giggling. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would also like to point out that this was also the case with a German Impressionist film that was the old silence. One of the problems with most strange, especially artificial films, is the focus on creating an artificial composition and forgetting the 'space' of the scene. This does not really make the audience understand what is going on because they do not get the space. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's junk. The short film on the DVD, Surprise, was a heckuva much better.
