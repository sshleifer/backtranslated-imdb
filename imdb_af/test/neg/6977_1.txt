In a big chair with a big book in his lap, one and only Bela Lugosi is sitting in the camera and in a terrible vocal delivery as if he is mocking a reading of Shakespeare, read: is what comes out of the endless time changes, revealing very surprising things (snicker), frightening? Because they look new (Lugosi's eyes are bowing now, with raised eyebrows, and mouth sneaking, he goes on) but most are not new, the signs of the ages "(see a lightning show, accompanied by the thunder then for"). An astonishing 86 seconds of junk remains. <br /> <br /> And that's what is probably the worst movie ever made, this "movie" almost damaging description, telling in semi-docudrama style with an invisible narrator explaining the plot ... as it is ... the story revolves around the volatility of a man named Glen (Ed Wood, Jr.) wearing cross-dresses, hence the reference to Glenda, the film has no real Instead, it mostly consists of a random variety of vignettes that might ... or perhaps not ... relate to Glen or the cross-band motif, one long line consisting of an unknown woman who a bank wandering, followed by a man who will enter a woman we will attack today as S&M. <br /> <br /> Then n Bela on strange moments, for no apparent reason, and chats more unpleasant dialogue, such as: "When he is wrong because he is doing right, and when he is right because he is doing wrong, pull the rope, dance over it." Huh? About twenty percent of the film's footage consists of stock images, accompanied by a storyline-related VO, but not the footage. That's why we see stock image of: vibrant city streets, highway traffic, a thunderous buffalo battle and a playground full of children. But it gets worse. In a cross-decoration film, we have 58 consecutive seconds of stock from a hot-steel cast iron, and 84 consecutive seconds of World War II combat scenes. <br /> <br /> Even the simplest items are broken. In one scene we see a newspaper headline that reads: "Man Nabbed Dressed as Girl". Under the headline, which is clearly glued or pasted, is the article on ... tax. In one of my favorite scenes, a woman squirts out of the screen: "airplanes, why it's against the creator's will," in a voice that looks like she's only inhaled helium. <br /> <br /> Apart from performing Lyle Talbot, the acting is uniformly horrible. Production design is cheap and looks; (but you must love that sticky wallpaper). The editing is messy. Most of the background music is only suitable for 1950-style elevators. The B&W cinematography has far too much contrast. And the costumes look like something that came from a spare room store. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that it looks like "Plan 9 From Outer Space" like "Citizen Kane" for comparison. I just don't know how to make a movie worse than Ed Wood's "Glen Or Glenda". But thankfully, this has Bela Lugosi in it. Every time he opened his mouth and looked into the camera with the big, bulging eyes, I fell on the floor and laughed.
