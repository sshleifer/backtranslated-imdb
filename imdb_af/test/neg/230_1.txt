Bruce Willis, as usual, does a great job. <br /> <br /> [Warning: May be considered a spoiler] <br /> <br /> While my friend thought it was good, I kept looking at my watch throughout the movie wonder or it would end. After seeing such a big movie as "The Patriot" and "Chicken Run", I was really disappointed at Disney's "The Kid." Willis plays a middle-aged man with a hard and realistic attitude to a positive turn on people's images (he is an image consultant). An unknown child appears. Yes, it's only younger, and even Lily Tomlin can see him. At this point I am reminded of a cross between a poor "Quantum Leap" section and a bad time going flick. <br /> <br /> Kid and Willis are trying to figure out why he is in that period. They find it out. They meet Willis when he is older. Never remember that it never goes into detail, how old Willis teleports them between periods and begins to start, how he started that knowledge, how he came to the realization that he had to do it, and so forth. br /> <br /> Basically, this is a very tired, unincorporated, uninspiring plot that has some good actors in it. The good news is that the actor "The Kid" is not as annoying as he is being offered in the trailers on television.
