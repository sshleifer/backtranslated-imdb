It must be one of the WORST movies I've seen. I tried to keep this movie, but they managed to clean up almost every single aspect related to this movie! Cheap dialogue, no character development, no tension, not enough story to pull you in, no action apart from a VERY cheap scene. They seem to have tried something on the set and said to each other: "Hey, it looks pretty cool, why doesn't it fit in there?" After which the director probably said "Yes .... JEH, this is genius!" and came back to sniff some coke or something. When it comes to acting, I think the only person trying to make the movie work is Daan Schuurmans, but in the end it is nothing for nothing. Because this movie sucks! 10/02
