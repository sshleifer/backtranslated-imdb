A ridiculous movie, a horrible editing work, the worst script, ridiculously acting, a story that's totally incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> If God decides whether movies should continue to do so, judge by this one, the whole world film industry would now be dead ... <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie to show that cinema should not be done by people who "think" they can make movies. <br /> <br /> I still wonder who the two gypsum girls appear in the movie for more than half an hour and are never introduced to us. <br /> <br />
