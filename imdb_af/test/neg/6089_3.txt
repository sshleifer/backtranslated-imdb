"Three" is a seriously faint shipwreck. Masquerading as a psychological thriller, the closest relative is the monumental superior "Dead Calm" (also with Billy Zane). "Dead Calm" provided well-drawn characters to try out Sam Neil and Nicole Kidman's sad parents to define their relationship on an ocean ride. They are executed by Zane's drug killer. It has a sharp, increasing ratcheted suspense, a frightening sense of claustrophobia in open sea, given as the cat and mouse unfolded of life and death. <br /> <br /> "Three" suffer from badly drawn characterization (the audience doesn't care for what happens to any of them), a stupid and unnecessary voodoo plot device, a total lack of tension or excitement and " some furious, hammy performances by the main players. Zane in particular goes annoyingly over the top. In "Dead Calm" he was threatened, wired and ill with scarcely controlled sexual violence. Here he is bombastic, clever, and unraveled. And where does he find his seemingly inexhaustible supply of dry cigarettes and cigars? And how does she stay lighter for about a year full of juice? Ms. Brook is very picturesque, beautifully beautiful, but both her chest and back appear too inflated by a kind of rescue pump. However, they succeed in acting with more skill and belief than the rest of her. Dramatic actress, in the purest sense of the term, she is not. The man playing the voodoo witch Manuel, the third component of this sorry triangle, could be replaced by a bunch of driftwood - no one would notice. In fact, through its total lack of ability to judge dialogue in any meaningful or dynamic way, it is a potential improvement in the decisive game (excuse point). <br /> <br /> Plus sides: the scenery is nice and cinematography (above and below the water) is credible. <br /> <br /> I suspect it had a very limited (if any) theater release or went directly to rental and retail DVD. The reason is that it is not very good. If you want something decent, you get 'Dead Calm'. It was made by people who knew a little about cinema.
