It is the worst Italian movie ever, probably the worst movie of all time! Of course, Joe D'Amato is not a movie, but many of his movies are interesting and viewable. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. Its cheese and boring .... waaiaay boring. If you want a movie on MST3k, get Troll 2, if you want a movie to put someone in a coma, get deep blood!
