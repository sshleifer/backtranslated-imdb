This movie was a total yawnfest that took forever to go, but never really did. It was just boring to look, so much, actually, I could never really get it. This movie is not a horror movie by a piece of imagination, the cover of the videotape made it up as one. Instead, it is a movie of the thriller type, with some elements of horror being thrown in to make the movie more interesting. Of course it doesn't help this movie at all. Mostly everything I remember is that this movie was similar to a movie from the 1970s called "The Deep". Bunch of treasure, competitive groups, what kind of thing. There are also supernatural twists, but in fact, I was so bored when I saw this movie that I had so zoned so I couldn't really tell what the supernatural elements were. I like to remember footprints at the bottom of the sea, so maybe it's some way to die, or it may remind me of Lucio Fulcio's "Zombie" movie instead of one being a horror movie was set in a tropical island. as exuberant as it was, it was much more entertaining than this movie. That day we learned a valuable lesson, never rented a movie based on its cover art.
