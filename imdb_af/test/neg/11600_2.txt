First: a warning. <br /> <br /> I recently watched this movie on DVD in the Universal Hitchcock Collection series. The source print looks in pristine condition, but the picture is slightly soft, suggesting it can be a second generation copy straight from the video. The framework is far too tight, so all the compositions are terrible. Even the title of the movie is cut. I collect from other IMDb reviews that there is a much better version available. <br /> <br /> Mr and Mrs Smith are just a footnote for Hitchcock's career. <br /> <br /> In his long interviews with Francois Truffaut Hitchcock, in the 1960s he gave a comprehensive overview of his entire work, but all he could say about this photo is that he favored it Carole Lombard did and did not understand the characters, but wrote Norman Krasna's script. . <br /> <br /> In fact, there is not much more to be said. <br /> <br /> It's like a night-time screw ball comedy, his girlfriend Friday and Philapdelphia Story. Carole Lombard is a typical festive woman who finds out that her marriage is technically invalid, with her husband falling on the flashiest of pretenses and spending most of the photo unreasonably unreasonable. <br /> <br /> Robert Montgomery does well enough for the man to play, but it's hard to lose patience with him. Long before the end of the movie, the audience says, "Dump the mad cow, it's not worth it." <br /> <br /> Gene Raymond plays the best friend she gets engaged with. He is supposed to be a courteous, 'old' family, although it is not clear from his accent and only becomes clear in the drunken scene (which he otherwise plays very well). He is an honorable, generous, teetotal gentleman, so of course he is handcuffed and touched by Robert Montgomery. He's beaten many of the jokes - though he's not as badly treated as the similar Ralph Bellamy character in his Girl Friday. br /> <br /> This movie feels that it was made by people who only knew of screw-ball comedies, but didn't actually see one. For example, a good screw ball comedy has a strong central idea with a number of continuous strips that continually interfere and overlap. Here, all the comedy elements are just cut out, like beads on a necklace. This is screw-ball comedy by the numbers. <br /> <br /> It's the same with the direction. Typically, these comedies coincide with an increasing rate that comes to almost hysteria at the end. Hitchcock doesn't get it. His direction is somewhat slow and the picture becomes a stately sequence of scenes that all seem slightly over-written (but malnourished) and slightly too long. He was never a particularly good director of actors, so he allowed the cast. They do it well. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock had a good sense of humor, which he often used in his excitement, but he had no sense of comedy as a genre. His later Trouble with Harry was also a burnout, for similar reasons for this movie, but at least he was involved in the photo. Here he is just going through the movements. <br /> <br /> All the people associated with this movie were good solid professionals, so it's not very bad. It just feels a little derivative, over-known, over-long and eventually rather flat. <br /> <br /> Mr and Mrs Smith are one for Carole Lombard fans and Hitchcock finalists.
