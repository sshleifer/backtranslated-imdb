This movie is a gay love story disguised as a story of graffiti and friendship. Not ONE review describes this movie as a gay romance movie, and it's the weight of the plot. I don't know if it would be people who would otherwise be unattractive to put it in, and expect the movie to be as it was marketed. The film is out of touch with graffiti culture, abuse and graffiti culture damage. the acting is uncomfortable. Oh, yes, the graffiti sucks. This movie was a clever way to hide the agenda of portraying young boys to hide gay. Just look at the rest of the movies that the director was involved in, everyone contains the same topic. Drilling like hell, not what I expected.
