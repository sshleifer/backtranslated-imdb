I'm sure some people will enjoy it and find it powerful, or some kind of personal connection with the characters and story, but from an unbiased point of view it's not done very well. The film revolves around atypical terrified teenagers. Each one plays a different stereotype that we believe is how it is to be a teenager. We see a bit of every teen's lifestyle, but the whole project only pretended to be, whether it's the constant low angle shots of tree branches, or the black and white "interviews" with the students, there was nothing new or originally appeared in this movie, and nothing I needed to see. Yes, it's about some strong subject matter, and the dramatic scenes are well played and performed, but the whole project seems unnecessary, especially if it looks like an exact replica of Van Sant's "Elephant" (one left suicide deals, the other with a school shooting). As I said, some people will probably enjoy it, and the director / writer clearly had some inspiration to make this movie based on the death of a nearby person, so it's nice that the movie with a some hearts are made, but I feel it is incredibly ineffective, and if you deal with material that can be so easy, click to do something original with it. I would not recommend this movie.
