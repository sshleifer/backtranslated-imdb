I actually went with these expectations in this movie, not because I thought the movie sounded good, but because I was a fan of Italian exploit slips and with a cast that Franco Nero and Telly Savalas see with Oliver Twist, I thought so. had to be at least interesting. Well ... RedNeck has one or two positive things going on, but for the most part; It's a dull, lifeless movie that's so ridiculous as it is senseless. The plot simply focuses on two criminals (Nero and Savalas) kidnapping a young child (Oliver). The twist in the story is that the child realizes that he will have more fun if he is accepted into the 'gang'. Telly Savalas and Franco Nero are two actors who have shown that they can wear a film on their own several times. They also have some unforgettable moments in this movie - though it's for all the wrong reasons. Especially Savalas gives a stupid portrayal of the 'bad' criminal. The plot does not flow badly, but as nothing interesting happens, it is not really a positive point and it does not save the movie to be mediocre. Overall, I can't recommend this movie; It may appeal to some for its cult value, but it did nothing to me.
