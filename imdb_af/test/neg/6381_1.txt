For some reason I didn't like it at all and I was ashamed of how bad it was since I bought it and watched it with my family. All of us hated it with a passion. It's a nice enough children's movie, maybe in the year it came out. Just think: an outdated child movie? What's the point? Children don't like such old movies anyway, and I don't see what adults need to get from this movie. <br /> <br /> Some children's movies (such as Mary Poppins or Wizard of Oz) can even be enjoyed, but Time Bandits are completely out of date. For your reference, and I think applicable in this case, I also do not have dr. Strangelove or spinal wallpaper kept. So, if you disagree with those similar outdated movies, you might like Time Bandits. <br /> <br /> There is also a horrible case of overcoming as I remember the bad guys. Think of the two dumb 'bad pirates' in the Pirates of the C. movies, except in Time Bandits, they're not just funny. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I warned you, that's all I can do. People who consider this movie high should enjoy it many years ago. If you haven't seen it before, don't see it now.
