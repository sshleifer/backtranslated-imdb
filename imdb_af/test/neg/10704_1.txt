I don't think it can legally qualify as "movie". The plot was so thin, the dialogue so shallow and the lines so dreadful that I couldn't believe someone wrote down the lines. He said, "Holy sh * t! This is a masterpiece" and then it actually has a producer. I, for one, are still amazed and will forever remember the film as the sign of the degeneration of intelligence in America - that and the crossroads, of course.
