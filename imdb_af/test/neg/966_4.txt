This 3-hour-made-for-TV miniseries came home at Blockbuster's last weekend. The production company spent a lot of money on sets, costumes (especially Bridget Fonda), and special effects (including a large Jim Henson polar bear and reindeer). They had to spend a little more money to get a coherent script. The story line was so loose that it never came right. One can overlook the Irish-accented Germans, but not repetitive storytelling. With senseless points that included a special guest appearance of the devil, this one is definitely not a Christmas classic. A shame that they wasted good performances by the two female leaders.
