This movie made me so angry !! Here I think here is a new horror movie, one with a sense of intelligence and then the movie starts. The beauty, the delivery of lines, the costumes, the false gores, should I do? There are porn movies with a better dialogue than this. I understand the concept behind the movies, but my good, it wasn't just that. It was a high school book report shot with a camcorder and the movie is all friends and family. It's a movie that is doomed from the beginning. Perhaps if it was 1982 instead of the new millennium, this movie could fly. But it seems to me that someone hung a rock around this albatross's neck and it sank at a constant rate.
