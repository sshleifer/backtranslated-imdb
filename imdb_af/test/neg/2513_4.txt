Based on a Ray Bradbury story; A professional photographer (Brian Kerwin) returns to his modest home near a small desert town, where most citizens want to stay away. A lonely son (Jonathan Carrasco) grabs him for attention; and the two testify of the landing of an alien vessel in the rocky region of the desert. The strangers change themselves into the images of townspeople. Kerwin must convince the evacuation of the town and fall in love with the young boy's mother (Elizabeth Pena). Acting is fairly level; the story line is no worse than some others; This movie makes you feel that you have come to a decent end shortly. Supporting film includes: Howard Morris, Dean Norris and Mickey Jones.
