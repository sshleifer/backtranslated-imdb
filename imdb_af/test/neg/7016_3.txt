Who had the "bright" (?) Idea to throw Lucille Ball into this movie ??? It must have been Angela Lansbury's baby all the way. At least Lucy had to buy her song. <br /> <br /> There is some compensation in the fact that Jerry Herman's score is properly preserved, except for "That's How Young I Feel", and we get performances from the original Broadway members, Jane Connell and Bea Arthur. . <br /> <br /> I suppose Robert Preston had to get a song, hence the inferior "Loving You". <br /> Overall, I think in this one the wrong redhead was thrown.
