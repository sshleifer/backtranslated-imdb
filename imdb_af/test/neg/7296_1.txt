I watched this movie with a group of Nazis, a French archaeologist and my ex-girlfriend on a small island in the Mediterranian. <br /> <br /> When the band started, my girlfriend and I were tied to a wooden pin. at the end of this cave-like area. I told her to close her eyes and no matter what happened to open them. The Nazis and the archaeologist did not close their eyes and started shouting after a few seconds. The Nazi's faces melted and the archaeologist's head exploded. <br /> <br /> After a few seconds the video tape came out of the video recorder and landed back in the box and closed the top. My friend and I were left unharmed. <br /> <br /> Due to this experience, the video cassettes were placed in a wooden crate and stored in a large warehouse of identical wooden crates. It is never seen again.
