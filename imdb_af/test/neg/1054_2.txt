This is your typical junk comedy. <br /> <br /> There is almost no laugh. No real moments. No memorable lines. No scenes you think of yourself, "it was smart". Nothing. The plot is embarrassingly bad. <br /> <br /> It's ugly to look at hell and be boring! There is no dust here. This movie has nothing. It doesn't matter if Farely was here or not. A crap movie is a crap movie no matter who is involved. <br /> <br /> Also, David Spade is a terribly unfunny comedian who plays the same horrific character in any movie / TV show he enters. <br /> <br /> This movie was dead on arrival. There is no life here. Nothing nice. No intelligence. There are many other "stupid" comedies to enjoy this one. This movie is just pathetic. <br /> <br /> 2/10
