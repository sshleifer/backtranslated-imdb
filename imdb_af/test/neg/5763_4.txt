"Curse of the Forty-Nine" does not really deserve a long and detailed review, so I make just a few random observations about it: <br /> <br /> - Cool opening points. <br /> <br /> - No plot. <br /> <br /> - Is there anyone who has ever seen a horror movie and can't guess what will survive within the first 20 minutes and who will not be stereotyped under this group <br /> < - Hey, the newcomer (Alexandra Ford) is pretty hot! <br /> <br /> - Richard Lynch (made to be about 100 years old) and John Phillip Law have fun Karen Black has a bigger role but she's not nice. She is rather embarrassed. <br /> <br /> Martin Kove is on the screen for about 40 seconds, but still got his name on the video cover. Did they pay him for this look or was it the other way around? <br /> <br /> - I hate cheap computer-generated effects in horror movies. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of 4.
