From 1988, Touch Of Death is probably the most frustrating Fulci movie I've seen so far. It prompted me to join the choir of horror fans who generalized his films to be worse than he did later in his career. In view of the summary of the plot, I was expecting a few bloody bad natural schools, but for all its bizarre flourishes, it even feels like a running time of just 80 minutes, boring, uncomfortable production values ​​and cinema. (or lack thereof). El Story: A gambling addict widows and rich (and strange) women find lonely columns before they horribly find themselves, whether they sometimes eat or feed animals - and steal their money to keep their debtors down. Certainly, it is unlikely that only one man will host so much screwed pathology simultaneously (addict, psychotherapist / sociopath, cannibal), but it is Fulci! <br /> <br /> Touch is actually the cheapest and the ugliest Fulci movie I've seen. There's almost no one in it, even in the background of street shots. A news reader who appears to appear on the film's televisions to warn the non-existent cast about the maniac's latest work, works out the most pathetic TV studio on the planet. He doesn't even get the camera to look, because he has to read all the headings of the wrong sheets of paper. <br /> <br /> Some scenes just go back and forth with the protagonist who's killing himself about what he did or what he's about to do, but the play is nowhere near enough to maintain this kind of thing, thus, the main outcome is stocking boredom. The movie also looks slim and ugly in general. I read that it was meant to be an Italian telemovie (has it ever been screened in that room? With the amount of gore involved, it seems unlikely), and it makes a bit of old telemovie production values. <br /> <br /> It's also Fulci's first decay in absolute black humor, but he's just too greedy for making it work. Sometimes strikingly cheerful or "crazy" music is used to play at a horrible scene, for example, while the hero / villain cuts a dead body into his cellar. The effect is not really cool or funny or, ironically, anything you would like - it is usually just rushed and crazy. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are some redeeming moments of gore (this will keep you waiting for you to stay awake), including the ultimate killing of a woman who just won't end life not even after her face is completely isolated from a bloody big club and a homeless man who gets a car about five times. The most outrageous element of Touch, however, is all the physical distortion of the widows who are adulterated by the mad man. Beards, hairy moles, messy harels - it's not like he's been looking for women with these traits, it's just the way all lonely hearts believe widows. There are many shots of Mr. Crazy, secretly, grimacing while relaxing these women. The black humor of such a crazy misogyny may have some power or resonance if the film is not performed so badly in general. In the end, Touch Of Death looks like a very lazy, insoluble mess.
