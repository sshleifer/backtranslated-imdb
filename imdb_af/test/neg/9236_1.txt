Altioklar's populist approach manifests itself in all its titles, from the worst to the best. He doesn't care (or has any idea) about art. He just gave people thinking they had a kick in the groin by watching his movies. The problem is that the effort is far too clear. And if events unfold with all the senseless exaggeration in them, the effort disappears badly. <br /> <br /> On this Turkish film (who knows where the original or originals were made, as it was very cute to me), Altioklar tried to be a kind of Tarantino. (Mr Tarantino, if you read it, please look at the movie for the best comedy of your life!) He doesn't use subtle moves to do it, all he does is use extreme things and it becomes unbearable absurd and laughing. <br /> <br /> Levent Üzümcü as the forensic guy with the cow-lips hair is just hilarious. I hope to meet him personally and ask how he felt about this movie himself. Because I insulted the role for him. Demet Evgar, who grabs her genealogies, was also unashamed, and did nothing but make everything look like it. Another particular idiotic aspect of this movie was the 100% mismatch. When things need to be taken slowly, scenes suddenly flow. And at other times it makes you sleepy to get the slow cartoon going. <br /> <br /> If Altioklar is so in love with Hollywood superficiality, he should use Michael Sixarrows as his name. Even such a move would not be half as ridiculous as he did on this movie. He must first learn not to imitate directors whose levels he will never approach, then realize he is not in Hollywood, and then take private lessons from Zeki Demirkubuz or Reha Erdem on how to explain the flow ideas in the plot . This useless movie can't even be saved by them, but maybe he can make viewable movies in the future by taking these steps. Incidentally, I've seen some notorious failures like Propaganda and Otostop, and I still can't deduce because I said this one was the worst Turkish movie ever.
