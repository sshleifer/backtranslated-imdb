Yes, it was a terrible movie, but there was a song near the start of the movie, I think, "I have a Woody" or something about it. I would like to find a good example if one is available. I saw this song on MST 3K, and as terrible as it was, it had moments, and the song was one of them. <br /> <br /> If you like babies in bikinis, it's the movie for you, but if you don't, don't bother it. It was good material for MST 3K, but I have to admit it. I would really like to know where to get a copy of the soundtrack. Not just that song, but a few more were really funny, and classic to me.
