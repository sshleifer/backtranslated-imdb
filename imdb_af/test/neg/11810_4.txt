Ken Burns "Baseball" is a decent documentary ... it offers a clear origin of the game, a good portrayal of baseball's early years and heroes. There is plenty in this movie for any baseball fan ... who said, the movie has several rogue errors. <br /> <br /> 18 hours is just too long for the human team. It is clear that Burns stretched out his film to fit his nine innings concept. It's not even a solid 18 hours. The pace on each segment is slow, almost common ... the music is always nostalgic and capricious. Isn't baseball ever exciting and fun? Why is each player and their performance presented in the form of a tragedy? Speaking head-to-head, turning every scene into emotional heartbeat, baseball as a metaphor, baseball as Americana, baseball psychology and theology ... enough! It is syrupy, mawkish drivel. Billy Crystal is here to sell us all the Yankee hokum. He sold us before. Ken Burns uses the National Anthem as the theme song of the series, and manages to play "Take Me To The Ballgame" as many times as you can vomit. We get it, dude. <br /> <br /> Clearly Burns is a neo-Hollywood faux liberal, so he probably spends a third of the film on the Negro League. Not as open as Kenny is today. For shame! He kicks baseball in the thirties and forties, but he didn't realize that America was divorced in those times! Burns falls in love with Buck O'Neil, a former Negro league player, and falls over every piece of footage in which the elderly O'Neil becomes poetic about his playing days. Nonsense ... <br /> <br /> Burns would have been better with an adult helping him to edit his creation. "Baseball" wind up like sweet, gushy, civil rights propaganda disguised as Americana. Obviously Burns is not a baseball fan. Otherwise, he would know we were watching games that were laughing and cheering, not crying and holding soliloquy ... Do you listen, Mr. Burns? There is no crying in baseball.
