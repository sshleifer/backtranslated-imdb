<br /> <br /> Very slow, plodding movie with a confusing story line. The film's only hope of getting the audience interested is the regular nudity thrown in at regular intervals. Ellen Barkin is disappointed and her appearance doesn't stop when she's on the screen with the much younger Peta Wilson. Not sure what this movie is about.
