This movie is strict for fans of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher. <br /> <br /> I am angry at TCM to show this mess more often than baby Mother, the beautiful original. I'm still anxious that some Hollywood boobies thought it would be a good idea to repair the baby mother, with a few lame songs that can only interrupt the flow of a cute comedy. Instead, Hollywood could spend the time, money, energy, and talent wasted on this terrible remake to give us something new and original. Wow, what a concept! <br /> <br /> Baccalaure Mother (the original), with ginger Rogers and David Niven is a spicy stew that slaughtered sexuality. It's a 1930's wink at the Hays office. Bundle of Joy (the remake), with Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher, is strictly milk and cookies. It's a 1950's handshake with Eisenhower. <br /> <br /> What role would you rather watch - Debbie Reynolds, Eddie Fisher and Adolphe Menjou, or Ginger Rogers, David Niven and Charles Coburn? For me, every member of the role in the original version is much better than his / her counterpart in the remake. <br /> <br /> In the original is a beautiful, young Ginger Rogers at its peak. David Niven is perfect as a somewhat spoiled, sophisticated and yet full-bodied spy of a rich supermarket magnet. And I always love Charles Coburn in a movie. In baccalaureus Mother he is invaluable as the desperate grandfather. <br /> <br /> In Bundle of Joy, Debbie Reynolds is her usual, fine self. She is good at this role, though her performance (along with Fisher's) completely changes the scene of the story. As an actor, Eddie Fisher is hopeless. He is completely missing in the screen "presence." Here he is completely too sacred for this story. His acting is completely soft and insignificant. Similarly, his song is so dirty and unbeatable that it is completely forgotten by the world as a whole. The only time he's not quite painful is in Butterfield 8 - where he doesn't sing. Here, Fisher's lame performance alone is enough to destroy this movie. Adolphe Menjou, a favorite character actor, performs well but not one of his best. He is more greasy than commanding. He and Fisher are not convincing as a father and son. <br /> <br /> Do you see a musical for the music, the story just happens? Or watch a musical for a story, with some (hopeless) good music used for flavoring? As the former, you might remake this lame. Otherwise you are much better off looking at the Ginger Rogers non-musical original, baccalaureus Mother.
