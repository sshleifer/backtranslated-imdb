I was hoping to enjoy this movie, going in for a goofy fun night. I love Judy Davis and Juliette Lewis, and the premise was enough to be entertaining. <br /> <br /> I found myself over and over again. Judy Davis achieved good performance but had very little to work with. Juliette Lewis was fantastic as expected, but had very little to do. The plot was full of "dots" that were just foolish, and as so often happens in movies of this kind, no one acted on how a real person would act. And personally, I thought Marcia Gay Harden was completely ignored. <br /> <br /> The movie also looked like it was in the middle of a black comedy, touching the farce into a complete farce with touch of black comedy. One reviewer points out that other reviews seem to have this movie being something else and condemning it. All I can say is that I would have paid for the movie that is * something * and stick to it. This one feels like the director had some great ideas, but couldn't all get rid of them. I give it a 4 out of 10.
