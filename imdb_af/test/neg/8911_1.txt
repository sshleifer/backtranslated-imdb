Stephen Seagal plays the role of a man who is spoken of driving an armored car for a banking match and driving into everything that comes his way. The police, however, look very fast on the scene and Seagal smells a gear that police have advanced. The story turns into many twists and turns and the money out of hold has disappeared and no one knows his new owner. Poor Seagal gets a little estimated in this regard and of course he is looking for the person or people who are trying to push him off for a long time. In this film, Seagal is trying to be a good guy, but the forces of evil are against him. Unfortunately, it's not a good movie and rather boring and too long.
