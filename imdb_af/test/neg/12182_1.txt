I can't believe I was put through this garbage. Palm trees in D.C. (already mentioned), a dummy-as-deadly bodyguard, so naturally artificial that I thought it was a dummy. A dummy was ... until it left a blood stain ... stylized dialogue, ridiculous plot. I think it's a pity that Jill Ireland's final movie before her death was this stinker. Don't waste your time - I wish I didn't. The only saving grace is that it was on the cable, so I didn't waste my money on top of everything.
