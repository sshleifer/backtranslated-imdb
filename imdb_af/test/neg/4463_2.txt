Film started well in 1872 with a violent, bloody battle between Dracula (Christopher Lee) and Van Helsing (Peter Cushing). Dracula is wrapped and dissolved on dust - from Helsing also dies. Someone collects Dracula's ashes and bury them on the ground of a church. Cut until 1972 - here is the film that falls apart. <br /> <br /> Immediately we are hit with the heady, bad 70's of music, FROZEN FASHIONS and stupid dialogue. When that happened, Hammer lost money and decided to try something. Dracula in the 1970s was not a good idea. The fashion, music and dialogue date the movie terribly. We were introduced to a bunch of annoying kids in their 20s who decided to have a Black Mass - "for a giggle". Of course, they revived it at the church (now deserted) and Dracula, of course. It's a good thing a descendant of Van Helsing is ... but Dracula goes to his cousin (Stephanie Beacham) in revenge. <br /> <br /> Lee and Cushing are great as always in their roles and when they are On the screen the movie gets a much needed shot of energy. The openings and finals are the highlights of the movie (although the end is being spoiled by playing bad 70's music). The children's leader is also called Johnny Alucard (Christopher Neame) - a really stupid name dating from the 1940s. The film also features a queen-in-law, Caroline Munro, who looks absolutely good. The movie is well-directed and well-behaved, but the plot is stupid, the constant obstruction of the 70's fashion, dialogue and music becomes very annoying. I was basically bored bored. <br /> <br /> Most Hammer fans agree - this was one of the worst Dracula movies - the sequel (Satantic Rites of Dracula) was the worst - and the last Hammer Dracula movie. It gets a 2 - just for Cushing and Lee.
