I am very happy. I like bad movies. I like movies with attractive young women in small quantities of clothes. <br /> <br /> This movie gives all of the above a bad name. Yes, you know how you go, what you get is not high art or something like that. But even for the kind of movie, Beach Babes From Beyond is not very good. Some people gave it. I can only assume that these are people who have the organs that allow rational thinking to be surgically removed. <br /> <br /> It's not very good. It's simply not very good. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 solely based on a) novelty value for well-known family members and Burt Ward and b) some of the girls are cute. <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, did I tell you it's not very good?
