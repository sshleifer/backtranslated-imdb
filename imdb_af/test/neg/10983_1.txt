This woman is a terrible comedian. She can't crack a joke. She has no real character. This is another example of typical American garbage with which people laugh, because they have no idea how to respond, so they say to themselves: "Well, it's a comedy program," so I will laugh, I think. <Br /> <br /> I can't stand this unhappy woman, and her pi $$ - bad excuse for comedy. She deserves nothing but booing. <br /> <br /> Why can't America dump this kind of turdish pleasure, and go to something that actually contains humor. <br /> <br /> She's not funny. Not at all. Why, why does even ONE person do this idiot?
