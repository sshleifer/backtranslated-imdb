Here's why this film fell short of its potential (I don't read much, so I don't care what the novel was). 1. I think Brendan Frasier copied his Encino man from Lambert's Tarzan. It was stiff, and while his Tarzan call was a little more realistic, he had no humanity. 2. They screwed the story. Perhaps that's how the book goes, but as long as I can remember, Tarzan's first pronouncements were "Me, Tarzan, Jane." Jane is the first human tarzan encounters. Like the natives, I had a little more than the chocolate in the Weymuller version, but those bows and arrows were a bit cheesy. 3. Tarzan is mainly a love story. I'm sorry, but the love interest comes in more than an hour. It qualifies her as a supportive role at best. Supporting roles and leads do not fall apart, not enough screen time, sorry. Not only was Andie McDowell's pseudo-pathetic (probably because her strong southern accent could not be masked) the chemical scale between Tarzan and Jane was a great 0. I never believed they loved each other, which made Belgian dudes voice closed, frankly, stupid. When Tarzan sees Jane for the first time in the jungle, he feels an urge, if you like, a feeling he has never felt before. Jane brings mankind into him, and he brings out the untamed side of her. It is this chemistry that relieves Tarzan's story. Not that Lord Greystoke's dying desire is to keep his country completely and that Johnny Boy will do it for him. Even a good face could not help this movie. It needs massive internal reconstruction. Oh, and maybe we can shoot more in the jungle, or at least use camera angles that do not show the sound stage as the features of the place. Final judgment, 4 out of 10. Sorry Tin man, and incidentally, if you really want to see, leave Lambert and look at Leonardo Dicaprio.
