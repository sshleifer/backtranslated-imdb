You may suspect that the plot of this movie was written in the filming process. It starts out as a punks versus vigilante movie, but in the middle of the movie the plot suddenly changes when the vigilante becomes an honest man with his honest girl and his honest gym and has to fight the corrupt "businessmen" who want the gym turn off at any cost to build a shopping mall or something. Then the plot changes again, and we forget about the corrupt guys. The villain is now the friend of the leading man, who thinks he is a ninja. The man is "madly angry" and wants to win a Martial Arts Contest at any cost. Seeing this movie is like having a nightmare with the television.
