A good idea ... A good idea, but it seems wrong because hypnosis is not allowed as evidence in the courts. So many good actors and they all play so badly! So why did they all pull on this mess. And yes, it has its good points like lighting etc. But eventually I wondered two things. How can so much talent lead to such a bizarre mess? What is the emphasis Nigel Hawthorne is doing? He is / was a good actor and so, what about the emphasis? It is impossible to identify? What did he try to do? Maybe it's his subtle indication of telling us, "I got involved with a turkey, so here's a crazy accent to go with it!"
