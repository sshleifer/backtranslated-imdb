I was insulted and angry about the idea that a sequel to 'Gone with the Wind' had ever been undertaken. Having spoken, I have no problem with the quality of the acting or the actors in this film. The artists are talented people whose talents were messed up on this piece. The hype around this book and movie just happens to be an exercise in futility. I think it's going to be one of Hollywood's misleading movies. I do not believe that the beloved characters created by Margaret Mitchell should be contaminated by the ideas and interpretations of another writer. The film and the book should be on the list of the worst ideas developed in the world of publishing and filmmaking. The sad thing is that people actually made money from these trips.
