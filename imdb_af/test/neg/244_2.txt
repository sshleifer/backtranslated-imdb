Following the pleasing atmospheric original and the amusing stupid second one, this incredible boring, slow and unceasing successor emerges as a great decay. Again, the deadly criminal mastermind tries to steal the Bat (hammy Luis Aceves Castaneda) valuable jewels from the Aztec mummy Popoca. The Bat builds a hilarious clunky lumbering robot with a human brain to achieve this horrific goal. Rearranged by Rafael Portillo, with a talkative and boring script by Alfredo Salazar and Guillermo Calderon, the unfinished continuity (for example, the bat is clearly killed at the end of the previous film, but is miraculously alive and well here!) An ominous sluggish writing, an excessive amount of footage of the first two flashes, a winding story, a crippling lack of action and momentum, largely urgent by the movements that are not understandable, and the poor stages of the mummy and the robot (the movie finally ends with a bad life with the so-called big bash, but although it hardly lasts two bad minutes and it seems too late to relieve the severity of the general overwhelming boredom) This numbingly dry, dripping trick and dull snow festival prices as a complete washout.
