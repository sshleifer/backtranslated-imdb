This is my fault. They all told me I should avoid this movie because I am a big fan of the old TV series. They were right. While production values ​​are good and the actors themselves (including "don't watch now"), Julie Christie is so bad, the whole movie shows a shaky and self-consciousness that is clear without any justification. A comparison between the Karloff "Mummy" and "The Mummy Returns 2000" comes into my mind. In fact, Belphegore 2000 owes much more to the new Mummy movies than to the old series. But then the dissertation is horrible, speed there is no one and sometimes the film is full of unintentional jokes (the first scene in the grave looks silly), with cats being thrown clearly when they have to jump (with their back foot landing). Belphegore moves around like a statue on wheels that aren't impressive or scary and the psychic drama unfolding in the old TV series when the heroine had to learn she's a villain is completely neglected. This movie is so CONTINUED (wasted money, wasted actors, wasted blueprint) that it hurts. It's a little mummy rip that's just good for a few laughs, but has nothing to do with the Greco classics. She also has a small role in this movie - on the cemetery).
