This movie has to be the worse movie I've ever seen. I just watched about half an hour and I just turned it off. The cars in this movie look like two geo-metropolis front ends. This movie is not even good for laughing. The only time I laughed was when Dante said in a funny voice, "Nobody can beat Dante, Muhwa hwaa." I said holy god and shut it down. Bad, bad movie. 10/02
