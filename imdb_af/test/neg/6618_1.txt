Why wasn't it voted for Best Picture of 1998? It must be the best movie. It makes something like Citzen Kane look like a big shit, come on, Citzen Kane wasn't even in color! I love this movie, it must be the best movie I've ever put money into. I'm still shocked that it's not for something! <br /> <br /> If 10 is the highest you can give, I'll give it 20!
