Sometimes I accidentally leave the television to "South Park" and I land on the train wreck of middle school humor that is "Mind of Mencia". It's the only time I wanted to clean my room, because I can find the remote control so much faster. The truth is, Comedy Central needs a replacement "Chappelle's Show", and what they got was a show that appealed to idiots who miss Dave so much that they will cling to any minority diversity show or be content with the usual "Mexicans like tacos jokes Carlos Mencia kicks in every week. However, I must understand that there are a few people who actually find Mencia * shudder * funny. I stand by my words when I say I believe these people only exist in myth. However, if you are there, I just ask that you never go into my housing district and read these great differences between Carlos and "Chappelle's Show": <br /> 1) Dave was funny. You can highlight this one. <br /> <br /> 2) "Chappelle's Show" was FIVE TIMES as tense as Mencia could ever hope. But every time a promo comes out for his little show flight, it's about him, throwing his own horn on how he's nothing we've ever seen. You got it right, Carlos. And not in a good way. Chappelle didn't need to tell people he was edgy and funny. We all just stuck a little to look at the show to find out for ourselves. <br /> <br /> 3) Chappelle actually had racial jokes that plunge into the depths of different cultures - things some people didn't know about. Like its "I know black people" game segment. The big prize was some hair cream that black people use. It is deeper than what Mencia ever dares to dive. So how dare he call himself edgy? If Mencia wrote the sketch, the big prize would be fried chicken and charcoal. And my accusations have some merit. A few days ago I received a promo for his performance (which I called a few days ago "My TV Monitor a moment ago") and that was a stereotypical Olympic sketch, which I for acknowledged myself was a pretty funny concept. Then I saw that the Mexican who won won a green card as a big prize. That's it ?! It's as close to the fire as you want? Who can't think in the 7th grade? For your fans of the show, if you ever watch and you miss one of its punchlines - maybe because you and your friends have discussed how "Duh-De-Durr" never gets old and in no way is part of the joke. where someone would have something funny to say-just remember that there are only five possible choices for punchlines: green card, tacos, border jumpers, lawn mowers, and of course duh-de-dur. Just remember, whatever it was, it was screaming. Enjoy! <br /> <br /> 4 Kind of related to number two. Every time he says something that laughs, he'll break to tell people (while laughing at his own joke) he thinks he's gone too far with the last one. Do not say this for the sake of God. Or let people decide for themselves. He and Comedy Central put this stuff in my throat, that he is this tell-it-like-it-show that is more controversial than the Da Vinci code. You're not. You will never be. <br /> <br /> I've never been offended by the show's content. I'll never give it that much credit. I was offended that Carlos Mencia was given thirty minutes to scream unnecessarily. Yes ... I was literally offended by that fact.
