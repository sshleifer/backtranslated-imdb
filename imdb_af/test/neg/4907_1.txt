It was one of the most busy, boring and cleaved movies I've ever seen ... and yes, I saw Pearl Harbor. Even like Gina McKee couldn't get out of the terrible dialogue. It is described as 'art house', it can only be a euphemism for dull, terrible and, frankly, artless. Why is it that when a movie without plot is uncovered, critics feel it is deserving to be called art? But much more amazing, why did America love it? Without you, this movie would have remained on the shelf where it might belong.
