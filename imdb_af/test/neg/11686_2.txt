I have never written a comment on IMDb, but this movie was so bad that it gave me little choice but to warn you not to waste the two hours of your life. As a zealous World War II historian, I don't even know where to start about how historically inaccurate this movie was. Carbines with Korean war lanes, K98k's missing cleaning rod and tin cans, German non-existent uniforms, the list can last forever. Added to it being loaded with errors, literally has no plot or climax, and acts in accordance with your local high school theater. The symbol of cheese. <br /> <br /> PLEASE ... there are too many good WWII movies out there to waste your time on this litter.
