It has plays from LOTR, Matrix, Star Wars, etc. Lent. The humor is so dry, confronted and wheat-like, that you can't help but to occasionally laugh at his foolishness and the fact that you are watching it. Exactly what you expect from a HK comedy. The average person will enter with an IQ of 100 and leave with less than 80. Stephen Chow is a clear omission of this movie. The humor would have worked better with Stephen. The Mandarin version of this movie is not as good as the Cantonese original. The graphics are poor compared to their Hollywood counterparts. There is overpayment on low quality CG. My biggest complaint is his end. The origin of the white horse is so clearly described in the "Journey to the West" (JW) that this alternative explanation does not work well with story line. Despite his many mistakes, this movie has much more entertainment value than the other film, Nicholas Tse, who was in the promise.
