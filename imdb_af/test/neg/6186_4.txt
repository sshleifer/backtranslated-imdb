Coltrane and Idle are members of a bank robbery who doubled their leader during their robbery. They hide in a children's school and avoid themselves appropriately to prevent the crowd and police detection. Many Catholic humor and slapstick, but the writing is as thin as the laugh. There is a good shower scene ... on a scale of one to ten.
