It's too bad these guys, the so-called judges, are such jerks, even the nominal "sensitive" people. This is the self-congratulatory tone that really makes me sick; these guys have no perspective on their behavior. However, I think the real problem is the quality of the participants. Not a smooth or truly charming one in the lot. They choose the most pathetic girls from the crowd because they are the only ones who have a chance. Let's see some real players trying to get a really inaccessible girl, and maybe you have a show. Otherwise, you have a rebellious half-hour of self-love. And real sexual tension takes two.
