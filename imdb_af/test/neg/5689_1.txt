OK, believe me if I say it's a terrible, terrible, scientific film. It's done so badly that a lot of the movie plays as unintentional surrealism and it's a 100% waste of time. Awful, but somehow deeply unfunny. I saw it as a dual feature with "Recon 2020: The Caprini Massacre" and although "Battlespace" was an incredibly superior movie, it doesn't say much. The plot of "Battlespace" is so complete that it is impossible to follow. The narrative is cryptic, often stupid, seemingly endless and thoroughly exhausting. Literally, half of the movie is double-screened by the female head, which looks like Brian Bosworth, through the desert. The movie actually gets really cool, but then the nostrils are poopown and somehow still worsened, minute by minute. Absolutely terrible and truly an Absurd endurance test. Zero stars. --- | --- Reviews by Flak Magnet
