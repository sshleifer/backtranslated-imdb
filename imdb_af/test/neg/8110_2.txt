I found this movie to be a complete waste of 96 minutes. Jones was a strange child and is very messy! According to my memory, which was wrong, was he not only 16 or 17 years old? ** Spoiler ** why did he leave college and rent an apartment with two crazy girls who had been feeding boys for a birthday? And the cowboy living among the boys also provoked me, how he knew what happened in the apartments, didn't fly me for a moment. I didn't understand his thinking about the girl who took photos and stayed in her room when Mandy Moore was always over and it was clear she wanted to be more than friends with him. I find this movie not funny or artificial or dramatic or anything, I find it stupid and a complete waste of time (D-F +)
