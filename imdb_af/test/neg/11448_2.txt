I saw this movie. N I can say it's really a bad movie. The director's nuts ... of course ... he knows a lot about the army, but then he's definitely a cheap man. There's also a lot of technical flaw in the movies ... <br /> <br /> Well ... here's my doubt - in the end when they save the family (including a girl who's just been raped) ... why do they leave them out of their place? I didn't see an ambulance! There are many aspects in the movie that are actually ... but then I just wish Major had told another good director / helped / helped the movie. <br /> <br /> Mohanlal definitely deserves a better director!
