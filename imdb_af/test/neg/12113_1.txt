I will submit my review stating that I am not a fan of the independent straight to video genre that owes a lot to the grindhouse movies of the 60's. I don't own anybody, I've never hired, so I may miss the appreciation of this tongue-in-cheek, low-budget stinker that many other people have. <br /> <br /> I caught this movie On Cinemax leave one Saturday night with a ladies woman. Please do not ask me why I watch Cinemax with a ladies friend one Saturday night. We were bored with World Championship Poker. Some horrific bad acts of Misty Mundae (and I wish she wouldn't be owned by Illinois, as we actually get very clear thespians come out here) have drawn our attention. Now normally the purpose of some good soft core pornography will be to get you and your partner in the mood. Some good sex, tongue in cheek humor, and who knows what can happen? After about 15 minutes and a scene where the title character hits a victim, my friend said, "If you want to see the rest of this fine, I'll sleep, I don't have to do it. Please turn off the volume. "Here's what I collect from the plot: Misty's character is a sexless nerd bitten by a spider and becomes a super-sex kitten with super-web-twisting powers that don't come out of her wrists. There is" a kind of malicious ominous thing, which does not look very angry or sexy. Spiderbabe saves the day, sex, MJ (male in this movie) is constantly being introduced by stereotypical bad gay bikers, and somehow the evil of an evil building after her death pushed. What was good about this movie? It ended. <br /> <br /> What was bad about it Acting to make a third-degree spectacle looks like Oscar winners a script turned out by people I thought to be drunk, non-sex know what sex is when they teach a class by dr. Ruth, special effects that were about as special as someone jumping a trampoline, humor about as funny as? Well, I have another thing that is slamming. The sex scenes? When we watched a video, the only thing that would turn those scenes on was the quick button. And the action scenes? Some of my old Atari VCS games had better choreography. <br /> <br /> Now I know that this type of movie is supposed to be enjoyable for its inherent badness. Companies like EI are not going to make good movies: they have a niche and they do it. My experience as a marketer tells me that they are entitled to the money to serve their audience. But after my brief exposure to 'Spiderbabe', I can tell that I won't be going back to the world soon. Perhaps the problem with the filmmakers in this kind of genre is that it pays so much attention to making the movies bad, that if they have made an effort to focus on the things they do very well, they will be very pleasing to them. 'Cinema, a La Troma movie in the 80's. Sorry people; The spirit is there, but it is not worth it. <br /> <br /> Although I have to admit that "Alice in Acidland" intrigues me?
