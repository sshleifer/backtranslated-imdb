Steven Seagal made a very dull, bad and boring movie. Steven Seagal plays a doctor !!!!!! ???! This movie has some action screens, but they are poorly targeted and have nothing to do with the rest of the movie. A group of US Nazis spread a deadly virus, which the state of Montana can erase. Wesley (Seagal's character) desperately tries to find a cure, and that's the story of The Patriot. The Patriot is a very boring movie because nothing happens. It's filled with dull dialogue and illogical gaps between events and stupid actors. Steven Seagal has been shot in this movie completely and I would not recommend this guff to my worst enemy. 10/03
