Publicity for this film indicates it's shocking and sensational. Well, our opera lovers see some strange attractions in opera homes, so we were not shocked by the duke of Mantua who urinated during his reprint of La Donna Ã¨ Mobile, and it is also not sensational to sing Gilda singing to Caro Nome in the bath. It's just scary and boring. What stands out on this movie is his lack of imagination. Director Corina Van Eijk puts the duke's palace into a cunning pool. In fact, he's not the Duke, he's just a character called Duka, so it's hard to see why he has many hangers and his own girl, Rigoletto. Rigoletto lives in a boardroom equipped with the orange couch and decorated in the stained wallpaper that is the richest of avant-garde directors. The Duke's, sorry Duka's tough ride on motorcyclists (Yawn). <br /> <br /> Concepts imposed on such an opera can cause unexpected and unintentional humor. What can we do about Gilda having a girl, even if she lives in a boardroom? When the call goes out that Monterone is in jail, we see that he is rushing out of the pool from the pool by two servants in pink shorts. One suggests that he be charged with urinating in a public swimming pool. <br /> <br /> It was common for opera movies to be synchronized 20 years ago, but there is no excuse for it today. A double opera is like soft porn. You don't believe in what's going on, because the artists don't make enough effort. The actress in Gilda's role doesn't seem to have learned her lines properly. She barely moves her lips when she is supposed to sing. If she sings Caro Nome in the bath, she lies back with her legs slightly separated. It is difficult to see which opening is the sound of the so-called origin. The duke later visits it by singing while they are involved with Maddalena in cunnilingus, which gives a new meaning to the phrase that takes place in the canyon. <br /> <br /> The sound of the sound never looks right with the band that sometimes sounds It is played by a transistor radio. A fairly slow pace is preferred, so the overall effect of a karaoke in your local bar is. <br /> <br /> This is a movie of a production by Opera Spanga. Spanga is a town in Friesland in the Netherlands. They usually play in a tent in a field. If I watched this show in a tent in a field in Friesland, I'd have been pretty lenient. Filming this production and giving it a worldwide flair, the residents are also open to global mockery.
