I often wonder how movies like this are even made, and the most shocking part is that people actually pay to see it. <br /> <br /> With Aksar it seems that the director made up the story while he was going, adding turns and turns when he wanted to, no matter how ridiculous they were. The writing did not exist, with a dialogue such as "Jo Sheena Roy Pehenti Hai, Wahee Fashion Hota Hai" and "Yeh Versace Hai Mevrou" (yes right). <br /> <br /> Each one of the characters was level and underdeveloped. Acting was terrible. Tribes (Lycra for Udita and horrible packs for sturdy Emran), venues (the many homes used for interiors didn't even look vague as a Victorian mansion), script etc. Etc., just a word refuse. <br /> <br /> For those who love Hashmi and his movies, watch it. As for me, I never get back two and a half hours. The only redeeming factor was the music that was decent.
