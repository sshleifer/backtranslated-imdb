I can only see how this movie has become: <br /> <br /> "So how can we further advance our careers?" <br /> <br /> "I know! Let's take a very successful movie and make a sequel! <br /> <br />" Perfect! We get B-grade actors who have half the charisma and only want 10% of Carrey's original salary. We will save millions and save in a massive profit, but it doesn't matter, because nobody wants to see a second sequel. Not one of the original actors who made it popular in the first place! We, as CEOs, still believe that a movie is popular by name and story, not the actors who made it first! "<br /> <br />" Brilliant! Let's put in a massive budget and get the cheapest actors we can find! "<br /> <br /> And really, this is what Son Of The Mask can describe. Just a simple B-grade movie trying to suck life out of the original classic. <br /> <br / > However, if the movie does not contain the words, the mask or something that is going to do with the mask is a nice kid's movie, though it is a big mistake and terrible act, it will really appeal to children. This is a good natural movie that really wants to scream "like me!" But only the 8 and younger will really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Jamie Kennedy is the only one in this movie He tries to work the material, plays the desperate dad, but the writing is so poor, the only thing worth it was my drink after I saw it, and the character of Loki also deserves a name because he was the most pleasant character and really one of the only reasons for older adults to watch this movie, which is too bad the character Ter was wasted on this movie, I really liked the character taking the real mask. Instead, we are reduced to fiery jokes and toilet humor near the end. <br /> <br /> The plot is so much through the books, I won't bother to mention it here. It's all so clear that even a Disney exek will be green with envy. <br /> <br /> Save your money, this one goes to the DVD after three months after the DVD. Scan the studios to re-create a decent movie with a terrible sequel. Didn't they learn and learn anything?
