Another horrible movie from Hollywood. This time, a woman is helping the revolution in a central American country. yes yes yes. Hey, we can ONLY make a movie without any realism. I'm so sick of movies like this one. The actors and actresses are common, the effects are cheesy and the dialogue is terrible. And suddenly I see John Rhys-Davies as the evil president. From Gimli to Hugo Louis Ramos. I'm sure he is very proud of it. Well, I didn't expect much from this movie and I didn't. And I'm glad it bigtime battles. I wonder what kind of people like this movie. My advice is younger people between 12 and 16 years old. And I think some people like Kristin Dattilo. Well, I'm not in one of that group and I hate it. Rating: 2
