Making a movie based on a true story, especially the one that is incredible and horrible like the 1972 Andean airplane crash, is difficult for even the best filmmakers. But the Mexicans behind this forgetful and cheap exploitation step don't even try! The real names of both survivors and the plane crash accidents of the Uruguayan Air Force have been ALL changed, the accident itself is, of course, very slippery, and the cannibalism aspect is unnecessary and well played. Shockingly, it made a lot of money on either side of the border. Fortunately, thought, it was graciously forgotten. But the same people behind this will later give us the equally rebellious GUYANA: CULT OF THE DAMNED! <br /> <br /> The cheap horror exploitation step needed ALIVE the fifteen years later. The movie was a masterpiece. PLEASE! To put it mildly, it is not.
