It must be the worst Steven Segal movie I've ever watched (even worse than I-like ones like On Deadly Ground & Fire Down Below). I will start with the good points ... It has stylish direction for a DTV movie and has wonderful scenery. That's it! The story is not quite over, it is just a variety of well-behaved pieces, just like seagal, shooting bad guys (the body composition can easily match Tarantino at his bloodiest!). The plot is unnecessarily complicated and confusing, you forget who the good and the bad guys are. The acting (I use the term loose) is at best mediocre, seagal's usual ONE clogged expression and woodwork I can take, but the other, especially the British, was terribly dreadful. <br /> <br /> What's in the package? Why are bad guys after that? Has the seagal been erected? <br /> <br /> WHO IS AS ***! <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie from my local Blockbuster (As soon as I paid) the assistant laughed at me. and said it was the worst movie in the store I could choose! (I felt like pushing him until my arm stunned) <br /> <br /> In any case, I haven't seen Half Death or Out for a murder, and I'm not going back for more humiliation at me shop, but they can be nothing but this turkey <br /> <br /> The soundtrack should be young and hip. It only gave me half a dose of asprins. <br /> <br /> Everything in all of this is Seagal at its WORST! The man who has won about 100 pounds and looks well past, he is a guy who just doesn't want to stop when he has to stop, he has to retire now! and go behind the camera or become a Martial Arts teacher or something. <br /> <br /> My rating 2/10 (1 point for scenery)
