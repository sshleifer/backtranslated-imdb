Badland is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Most of the time it is good and I can continue with my life, but I feel the need to warn others in this case. As a veteran of the war in Iraq, I feel it is necessary to say that the story, plot, play and portrayal of what soldiers return home was pure refuse. It was as if the director / writer / who had held and ran over the returning soldiers at any click and ran with it. That made me think that there was absolutely no research in this film. The "Marine" uniform looks like it was fresh from a surplus shop shelf and was a pattern not used since the first Iraq war. I'm not going on forever, it's a terrible movie. If you are interested in the stories of returning soldiers, there are much better alternatives. I recommend going to your local library.
