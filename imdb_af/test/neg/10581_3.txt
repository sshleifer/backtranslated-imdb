Here's a spoof that's guaranteed to entertain people in the IQ series Homer Simpson. It's a cheap shot at every major Superhero, especially Spiderman and Batman. But it doesn't end there; It gradually gets worse until it loosens in a pathetic slapstick trolley ensemble through the truck. <br /> <br /> For those interested in the plot, just see Spiderman under the influence of a heavy drug. What you get is Dragonfly Man ?? A boy, wondering what the girl loves next door, suddenly experiences some great superpowers. <br /> <br /> The rest of the writing is as predictable as waking up in the morning and brushing your teeth, but don't "take my word for it! For children, it's a bit amusing; for adults it's a good movie to let the kids away.
