It may be the worst movie I've ever seen. I knew it was a B movie before I watched it (it was actually the reason to watch it), but I never thought it could be that bad. The title promises Dracula in space and render but the story doesn't really make use of the fact that Casper van Dien's character is a descendant of Van Helsing. And watch out for the end of the movie, it comes to you quickly. I have never ceased shouting out "And now we are about the budget!" in a clearer way. Their resolution of the movie, however, was rather slips, but the story painted him so clearly in a corner. If you feel you should see it, watch it with a friend who shares your love for B-movies. If I didn't, I wouldn't have made it to the end.
