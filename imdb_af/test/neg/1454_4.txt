Before he hit international praise with The Silence of the Lambs, director Jonathan Demme cut his teeth making unprecedented comedies. It was one of them, and like a lot of Oscar tips that US artworks could call, it has a good concept, is good, has good performances, a complicated romance. but it's just not very funny. Pfeiffer is a mob widow who moves to the city water swarms after her husband (Baldwin) has been murdered. The crime boss who killed him (Stockwell) likes to take Pfeiffer, his wife (Reuhl) is furious and complicates matters. Pfeiffer also falls for the police who leave her behind. All these things had to laugh a little. Pfeiffer, a solid wig, is excellent like the widow, and the hyperactive Ruehl and Modine are also good as the good policeman. But the writing is simply without one-liners, whites, humor or punch lines of the verbal or physical nature that require this kind of movie. The result is that it produces smiles rather than plaster at its best. This crops charm, but is boring short of humor.
