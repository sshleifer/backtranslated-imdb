The plot for a movie like this is a give away. How can you go wrong with a gay plot line and all the colors and music of India? A story like this writing itself. I will see most of everything, but it was unshakable. The sad thing is, the white people are the most colorful in the film. Vanessa was a riot with a mouth like a sailor, and Jack was a good eyeball, but everyone was so boring. Saeed Jeffrey, who was extraordinary in my beautiful estate, did what he could, but the story was so boring. The saving grace was really the background music, which made it good to laugh at the film, rather than the movie, or not at all. There are many other better gay movies, ethnic movies, just ordinary movies. I pass very low budget films, but it didn't have to be made or made by anyone else.
