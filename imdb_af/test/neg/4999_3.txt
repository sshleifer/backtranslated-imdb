OK - I gave it a "3" just because they obviously had no money to make this movie, but I feel it can earn the "2.3" rating I had when I arrived. I'm actually helping to increase it's rating, despite getting bored for the last hour and a half. I'll save the "1's" and the "2's" for the higher budget crap. At least the makers of "Rise of the Undead" didn't waste much money. They wasted 90 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> The movie is too claustrophobic for me. The whole movie takes place in the same building, in dark rooms and corridors. With such an institution there had to be more action or character development, but there is only a very meaningless talk. I didn't get any of the characters. There is a schoolgirl and a Goth chick, but we never find it again. None of the characters really look nice. <br /> <br /> Terrible movie made at zero budget. No scary special effects. No tension. Actually nothing interesting here, people. I admit I downloaded it from the net. It was free, but I throw it away. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the filmmakers. Good luck next time. This one is more like a soap opera than a zombie movie.
