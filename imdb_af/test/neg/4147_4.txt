I really wanted to keep this movie, because I love Troma and loved the fan and loved "Ghouls", one of Ferrin's films. It had a couple of pretty good moments, like the old ones who love songs about the car accident scene, and a scene near the end where the lead player gets a little close. But overall, it was just boring and slightly unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The "unthinkable" shocks Ferrin turned up were really predictable and exhausted. Villain, murdered prostitutes, incest. Still could have been good but poorly done. Unsecured or trying to insult, entertain or both. Eventually it didn't. <br /> <br /> Finally, we are looking at Troma movies because we want movies with heart. This movie didn't feel like it had a heart. There were some good scenes, but eventually it was boring and unpleasant.
