It's so fake! The plot resembles a generic adaptation of the average blowing film. The general themes of blaxploitation such as racism, oppression and fighting for the integrity of your community are so simplistic / flattened. And the jokes aren't even funny! Dolemite stands up to these monologous comedy routines which are very painful. All the people around him deliver this canned layer. Even the soundtrack sounds like it's the torch. For a much better comedy in a blow, try "Coffy" and "Friday Foster" with Pam Grier. For a more realistic blax experience, try "Black Heat".
