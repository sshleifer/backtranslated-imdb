Anna Christie (Greta Garbo) returns to her father, Chris (George F Marion), after 15 years. He is the skipper of a boat and she continues to travel with him. During this time she meets Matt (Charles Bickford) and they fall in love. Matt and Chris do not see eye to eye and Anna has a secret to confess ..................... <br /> <br /> What a boring story ...... it starts badly with George F Marion and Marie Dressler playing drunk in a bar. The scene goes on forever and they are both terrible. It's also difficult to understand them. In fact, it is difficult to understand the whole role. I missed all of the dialogue between Bickford, Marion and Garbo because it is incomprehensible! Of course, Garbo is something special that you draw on her screen every time and her presence gives this movie the 4 stars I gave it. But nothing really happens - it's a boring story with horrible accent. You will do well to stay awake.
