O boy. Where do I start on this piece of mucus? This is one of the few real high-budget movies on my list that I have actually seen to give a 1-rating, and not for the reasonably high production values. This film has absolutely no respect for the account in the Bible, and treats the whole story as a ridiculous fantasy. I couldn't recommend it to anyone, except to see how low a society has become. <br /> <br /> For the first time, Noah was absolutely not friends with Lot. Anyone who actually read Genesis could tell you that Abram was what they thought. The authors tried to stick the story with the entire Sodom / Gommorah subplot, and it seems unclear because it is. Noah is treated as a prudish goofball ("You were kissing! You were kissing!") But at least it's a step on Voight's hilarious overheating in Anaconda. <br /> <br /> But these transgressions turned out to be compared to the heretical treatment of God in this movie. God is portrayed as a small, incomparable being that changes his mind to the slightest invasion. ("I am one eternal perfect, but I can be wrong") What? Where do they get it from? This kind of God ... no one should ever pay attention to much less worship, praise or love. What the director says in this, I do not demand to know. I just know that a responsible treatment of Noah's Ark shouldn't take such an easy way out. Shame on these people.
