Yes, the video cover of this movie has shown me to see this movie as a kid. It's called "Screamers" on this particular cover with the tagline "Men's inside out!". It even wore this carved skeleton on the front which also made all kinds of cool gory images run through my mind. Maybe a kind of movie about some strange viruses that caused one's flesh to burn down, maybe a movie about malignant zombies that look more bloody than you usually get, a science experiment went awry wrong and now there strange men with the flesh who drip their legs go on the disaster. Yes, all these thoughts ran through my mind, one that was not a fisherman on an island, with virtually no gore, and everyone was born. This movie is really more like the island Dr Moreau than anything else and frankly, that movie is boring me too, it's far too many scientists and not enough dead for my taste. These films are too many figure things out and not enough blood for my taste. Yes, I know, I have strange taste, but I can't help it, I also love my horror movies, or it's really bloody or fast moving and exciting this movie isn't really.
