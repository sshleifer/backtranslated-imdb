If it wasn't for Colin Firth, the movie would be ready for the rubbish bin! So predictable, so stupid and so badly done !! Just Colin Firth shines as always through this mess as simply at the end of the tunnel! <br /> <br /> The worst was Jennifer Rubin's acting! Maybe it was because of this script (did they actually write one or was it just on the road? ???). <br /> <br /> To cut a long long story short: <br /> <br /> It's a MUST only see for Colin Firth Fanatics (like me) as he is incredibly sexy and well-behaved ( struggles hard against this "spiritually challenged" script. These minutes of Colin-Screen-Time make much of this movie. <br /> <br /> Don't spend too much money on it. Try to see or get it as cheap as possible (an auction or something) and then stick to the Colin Firth scenes. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie can be dangerous for someone's mental health.
