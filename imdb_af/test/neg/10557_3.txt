How did these many talented or at least charismatic actors originate in this baloney? Nothing good about this movie, but the worst is probably the script and the direction. <br /> <br /> Apparently, it is the director of Damian Niemans's heart as he both wrote and directed it. He is a card wizard himself and looks like characters named other famous wizards. It was his first feature film as far as I know, and chances are it's his last. <br /> <br /> It is hard to point out exactly what makes it so poor? but i want to say the story and character are not credible (the script) and the direction does not give it a boost (the director). Plus ?? the poker scenes are bad in the worst Hollywood way (super hands, Hollywood rules)! The alleged twists in the movie are either completely predictable or totally unbelievable. They just end up with a knot of a story that can best be described as some decent scenes!
