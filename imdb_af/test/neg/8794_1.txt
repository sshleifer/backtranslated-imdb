Chris Chan Lee attempts to relieve Hollywood's depiction of Asian Americans in his movie debut "Yellow" by leaving the stereotypes usually portrayed in mainstream film. With that, Lee commits a much more horrific crime: he exaggerates the own stereotypes of Asian Americans to the point of unbelief. The result? Terrifying one-dimensional characters and exorbitant writing put the role into a madness of overworking, eventually leading to a movie that is physically painful to watch. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by any of the positive reviews obtained by `Yellow '; each falls into one of two camps. In one corner (eg, here on imdb.com), you'll find Asian Americans so excited that an Asian character on the screen without thick glasses and a math book can be portrayed, putting on the idiot of Lee's final product. somehow neglected. On the other hand, you find movie critics who simply believed it would be uncool to give Yellow the thorough bashing it deserves; This is a noble Asian-American movie made by an independent Asian-American filmmaker ... protected. <br /> <br /> Case study: main character Sin Lee (Michael Chung). Author / director Lee achieves a monumental achievement with Sin, showing 'Yellow' in such a way that Sin never appears on the screen unless he either screams or screams. See Sin that reflects his friends' support. Frown. Watch Sin walk along the beach and hatch. Frown. (Yelling ensues.) See Sin closing his father's shop. Frown. See Sin Urinating. Frown. See Sin Breathing. Scowl. <br /> <br /> Give, I wonder if Sin is full of Asian-American anxiety. Do you think? I'm not sure. Frown. Scowl. <br /> <br /> Just to be thorough, Lee introduces us to Sin's dad, Woon Lee (Soon-tek Oh). Throughout the movie, while Sonde simply screams or shouts, Mr. Lee Lee * and *. In fact, it's Woon's leading role in 'Yellow': shouting and screaming at the same time. <br /> <br /> Give, I wonder if Living an Asian father is having a complex of authority. Do you think? I'm not sure. Frown. Shout. <br /> <br /> If Lee's one-dimensional characters don't annoy you, his story will line up. Meet Mina (Mary Chen) and Joey (John Cho), two characters in this movie, exclusively for the purpose of turning a tangential and completely irrelevant love story into the movie. You see, Lee learned in the film school that every good film should include some kind of love-related subtext, and these two characters allow him to fulfill the obligation. Mina and Joey's impeccable whistling dialogue consists of one-liner insults that culminate in a kiss: "Nerd! '; `Stupidhead '!; (meeting eyes); (meaning smile); <br /> <br /> But be sure, somewhere out there, sin it while it all happens. <br /> <br /> That neither Mina nor Joey in any way contributes to the movie's plot doesn't hide me as much as Lee's insistence on the most hacked movie clips to achieve his non-results. And trust me, the flirtatious sequence is just the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> By the end of the movie we find Residential Lee trying to explain and shout his constant cartoon to Sin's friend, Teri (Mia Suh), in what I'm sure, Lee meant to " be a pleasant moment. What a surprise: as Woon advocates a metaphorical story about the homeland to illustrate his point, he tore straight out of Reader's Digest, his voice bangers on that extraordinary path. The camera pans in a mandatory shot of Teri's trembling hands. We feel compelled to roll our eyes, except we realize that Woon's explanation doesn't make sense at all. But a lack of substance didn't stop Lee from making the movie, so why would he cut this particularly inefficient scene? The world can always use another clich√©. <br /> <br /> Well, you say, the movie can be painful, but at least it should be a technical masterpiece - say, "What Dreams Come". "Sorry, on a technical basis," Yellow "also disappointed. Lee's edits are uncomfortable and disruptive, which has little rhythm in the film, but Lee is sure to look hip. To make matters worse, every frame is either blocked or overblown. Although the light meter was invented in 1932, the new technology did not make one on the `Yellow 'set. <br /> <br /> In light of the film's total deficit, supporting actor Burt Bolos, who performs Sin's best playing friend Alex, performs relatively well. Although Bolos slightly overworked, you can't really blame him, as Lee's writing just consists of screaming and screaming. Bolos's castmates, on the other hand, show no restraint in their persuasive whatsoever. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen a movie as bad as "Yellow" in a very long time. And I really pray that I won't see a movie as bad as 'Yellow' for some time. Please do not waste; life is too short. Thank you.
