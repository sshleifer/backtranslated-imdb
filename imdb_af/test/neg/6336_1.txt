This movie should be one of the all-time layers of Michael J. Fox's overall respectful career. I had to know how horrible this movie was when I rented it and the movie only saw half and was not returned by the previous tenant. Never a good sign! Fox plays a great kid star now an agent for other show business kids. His character is deceptive by still believing that everyone should love Mikey. His big break comes when he meets with Angie Vega, a talented kid. Vega is sloping and not adjustable at all. In fact, the only similar character in the whole movie is Cyndi Lauper as a Brooklyn-acclaimed receptionist for the agency. One of those movies that makes me want to keep a note at the box warns others not to waste their time!
