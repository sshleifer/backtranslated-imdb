My mom, my cousins, and I'm pretty big Jane Austen fans. We know all the words for the Masterpiece of Pride and Bias 1995, and had embarrassed Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma. I've read all the books, and I've even been sitting through Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion a few times. So my mom and I thought it would be nice to watch Northanger Abbey on film. <br /> <br /> Bad idea! It's about the worst movie I've ever seen. It's even worse than the 1998 version of Alice Through the Looking Glass, or the 1939 Nancy Drew movie I bought at Wal-Mart for $ 1 (my previous "worst movies.") The first thing wrong is What you see in the opening scene is that the "heroine," Catherine, has an abominable and strange imagination, inspired by trashy novels that a Jane Austen heroine would never touch. Throughout the novel, his dreams (day and night) in which she was carried away by a rogue man with a greasy wig put a field on her way to God, know-what-all, and suddenly rescued by a brave man on a white horse. <br /> <br /> The second thing that any movie viewer will notice is the high sound and saxophone music that is supposed to be the soundtrack. No classical music or English country dance here! It is also clear, almost at first glance, that the actress (for lack of a better word) has chosen to play Catherine completely. First of all, she is rather unattractive, and is rendered even more by her unstoppable behavior. Her appearance and movements are just funny! Plus, they are completely affected and incredible. <br /> <br /> This sad lack of acting influences pretty much all the actors in the movie. Not even Mr Tilney, the supposed "struggling young man" is decent. <br /> <br /> As more and more characters are introduced, a strange taste in filmmakers' costumes becomes apparent. Large, Marie Antoinette style heads clash with the (mostly) right-winged Rijks. A French woman, apparently a friend of General Tilney, is all in black as a kind of old Goth Nightmare - she has a striking resemblance to Michael Jackson in a black dress. Her appearance is even more sober by a BIG half moon beauty point on her cheek. I also had to wonder about the historical accuracy of the bright red lipstick that almost all the women wore. <br /> <br /> Another anomaly my mother held and I laughed about ten minutes was the "bath" scene. The first thing we noticed was that men and women were in a large bathhouse - probably not very likely in the early 1800s. Then we saw that all the women were wearing large china or plastic plates, turned around their necks with strings. The boards floated horizontally on the water, with some mysterious pieces ... something. We estimated that it was soap, then aromatic herbs, when finally the riddle disappeared between shots, we concluded that it was food. But I'm not sure yet. <br /> <br /> And that's not even half what is wrong with Northanger Abbey. My warning to anyone considering renting this movie: stay your hand. And if anyone is considering buying it, well, I don't even know what to say about it. <br /> <br /> You will think that when the actors and others who make this movie go about 1/4 of the way through, they will realize what a monster is creating and stopping them. Unfortunately, they didn't, and the Northanger Abbey was left out in the world.
