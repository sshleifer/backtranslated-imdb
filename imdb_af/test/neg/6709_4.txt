Sowing a movie is not something I would normally consider to be a valid criticism. However, if a movie is rude of parts from other films that were not so good to start with, and it's slow as molasses with no real payout, I think it's fair to call a spade . And the ghost is a very boring movie. <br /> <br /> A movie that is about original as its name, The Ghost tells the story of a young girl with amnesia chased by a ghost who keeps the secret of her past. Only, it is much more complicated and less interesting than one might think. <br /> <br /> The plot line is almost incomprehensible to most of the photos and the hook, the amnesia element, just makes things worse. It seems that no one, including the screenwriter and director, has any idea of ​​what happens at any moment in hell. Instead, they chose to do what amounts to roughly the cinematic equivalent of a sitcom clip show. There are scenes taken directly from Ringu, Dark Water, Shutter, The Wrudge series, and a slap of Pulse for good measure. To make matters worse, the half-dozen women lead all dresses and read their lines equally, so that they cannot possibly be played apart. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to understand about this movie. The story was not thought so well. The amnesia gimmick is lazy. The mystery element is uninvolved and deals with little grace. The characters never carry anything off, all the information is just handed out by remembering her past when it's convenient for the plot. <br /> <br /> At least the cinematography, full of reflection and shots of water tries to add to the subtext, a thematic link to the amnesia and the final twist (which I won't reveal) is nice, but often overwhelmed. Even the score feels borrowed and cliché. <br /> <br /> The worst of all, the inciting action for the curse is not very interesting and the final turn is predictable and lame. "Wait, you mean that one character who has 15 minutes of screen time, but nothing seems to do with the plot, finally comes back? No!" Audiences are too skilled for this kind of trip. Anyone who has seen any of the films that run it will find little to keep them awake with this feature. I thought Shimizu was the bottom of the run for this kind of crap (revival of his grudge movie no less than 5 times), but even his second course works like Reincarnation, a movie I didn't even bring myself, is miles for this. <br /> <br /> For more reviews please visit www.collider.com
