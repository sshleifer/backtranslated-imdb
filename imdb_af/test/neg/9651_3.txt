I suspect the movie is based on a solid book. Given the number of characters and subplots during Katyn, I thought the filmmakers, perhaps the author or director, were planning to create an epic movie. But really there wasn't enough time to spend properly on character or story development. Terrible there were many unrelated side stories that could be worked out. <br /> <br /> Because of the events that led to the mass murder of all these intellectuals and officials, I don't think the movie has explained. any reasons why murder was needed. Was it politics? Philosophical? Revenge? The interesting part of historical movies sees personal motivation or emotions. Instead, Katyn's murderers looked like automates, which are wholly controlled by Stalin, which sometimes appears as a charcoal. The portrayal of the Russians and Germans was completely one-dimensional. (Are Polish people just as angry with the Russians?) Apart from being badly edited and biased or at least unrealistic, music and cinematographic choices felt irreconcilable with each other and the film itself. I don't think you can really make an epic war film or war event on hand camera. (But if the director went with a character-driven story, perhaps focusing on a single family, the handy camera approach would have worked better.) And if you really use dramatic music, it should be better balanced. made of shots.
