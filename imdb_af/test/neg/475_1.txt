I saw this movie last night at a midnight preview show (I'm working for an independent theater chain in Colorado - that's one of the benefits). It's a pity, but it's one of the WORST movies I've ever seen! I know there are a few Bruce Campbell fanatics who, like the dying ones, will get you out of the nearest tree if you talk badly about their beloved movie icon. Nevertheless, Campbell's tender, this particular work of The Chin is a celluloid black hole. <br /> <br /> Before making any assumptions, I'm a little hay-to-movie movie buff that just watches "real" movies like "Ladies in Lavender" and "Sideways". , think again - I'm a big fan of B movies, and especially Bruce Campbell. His trademark character Ash is one of my favorites, and his portrayal of the obsolete Elvis in Bubba Ho-Tep was phenomenal. <br /> <br /> But hey, B-movies still have the potential to be again, reeeeally bathing and not the "good" camp we all love) ... and that's what this one was like me and my co-workers. With the exception of that one track where Bruce walks through the square and scares the children, there was no laughter to have. Overall, we have the story as a mindless dumb, pacing mole-like, and so-called humor stupid than a hammock bag. (I'm sorry, but Ted Raimi's "Pavel" character was not comical relief. He was simply delayed!) Believe me, we all went to really want it, but felt incredibly disappointed and robbed of two hours . <br /> <br /> If you absolutely loved this movie, plan to see it several times, want to get married and have kids with it, etc. It's fantastic. We all love what we want, so you don't get judged from me But don't question the sense of humor or the loyalty of those who no longer have orgasms about Campbell's latest movie coupe. This movie was a steamy sandwich in my humble opinion ... and as a true Campbell fan, I may say so!
