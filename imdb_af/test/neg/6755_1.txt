I was completely deceived by the commentary on this film, mainly by someone who said they had seen it at a film festival and loved it every minute. If I expected it to be a nice jerk of the American cake style movie, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> First, the camera works awfully, I don't think the director knows cameras can move rather than keep quiet and move the actors away and away. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the scenery! My God, I saw more furniture in a bird's night. The club was totally unconvincing with about 3 extras that danced in the background at any time. The apartments were bare and didn't have personality. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the actors. Wow. The director, of course, set the typical "Reaper" character, a wimpy main character with a gruff. "I don't give a f ** k" character that heads pot shots. Everything that the main character said and did was a task, so much it made me win. <br /> <br /> Overall, the plot, the so-called big revenge theme, lasted for about 30 seconds and had no real motivation. The characters acted irrationally and had no real relationship with anyone else. No character had any depth to them, they can also be cardboard cuttings that run past the static camera. <br /> <br /> A real horrible piece, worse than a first-year student 2 minutes short for youtube. Advice to the director? Change your name and deny any association with the movie that will probably sell one copy at a site in Ohio.
