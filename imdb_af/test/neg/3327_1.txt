My daughter liked it, but I was terrified that a character smokes in this movie. As if it's not awful enough to see "product placement" actors like Bruce Willis smoking in their movies - at least kids movies should be more considerate! I wonder: was it intentional? Did big tobacco sponsor the movie? What does it take to ban smoking from movies? At least movies meant for kids and adolescents.
