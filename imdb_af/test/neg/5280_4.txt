Stupid horror movie about five 20 somethings (3 guys, 2 girls) go to this place in the middle of nowhere. What they don't know is dr. Chopper and his female assistants attack and kill anyone acting in their bush. They use their body parts for some experiments ... or something. Five college girls and two lesbians are also thrown in to kill and show some fuss. <br /> <br /> Beautifully desperate. The story is confusing and boring; The gore is ridiculously false; Dr Chopper and his assistants endangered; There is terrible black humor in it and people are just standing around while their friends are being attacked or just standing there and letting people kill them. <br /> <br /> It was pretty offensive. There are a few pluses. An hour in an hour was pretty good and the five young actors are actually good! Chase Hoyt is wonderful like Reese; Butch Hansen is OK like Jimmy; Ashley McCarthy is also good as Tamara and Robert Adamson has moments as Nicholas. Best of all is Chesley Crisp as Jessica - she was excellent! Of the dramatic scenes between these five were well done and interesting. Unfortunately, the dialogue wasn't really there for them. I give it a 4 for their performances - but nothing else here is worth mentioning. Hopefully these actors will get roles they deserve.
