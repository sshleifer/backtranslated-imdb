Director and FX man John Carl Buechler doesn't have to do much to scare me; The face of his name in the credits alone is enough to bring fear into my heart. <br /> <br /> His sad straight-to-video output in the 80's was sitting on the bottom shelf of the horror section at my local rental. shopping; Twenty years later, his DVDs occupy the same space. The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same. You can rely on old JCB to serve drinks, regardless of format and regardless of progress in filmmaking. <br /> <br /> In this diminutive offer, a lot of friends travel to a remote village where they treasure the secrets of Jeremiah Stone, AKA's forty-one approach? An evil, demand-jumping, cannibalistic miner who caused destruction in the mid-1800s. Before his death, Jeremiah cursed someone who had to find gold, and it was not long before the arrow-wielding killer returned and the impudent treasure hunters collided. <br /> <br /> With its horrible writing, up effects and Scooby-Doo style villain, "The Curse of the Forty-Niner" is par for the Buechler course. Only genre stalwarts Keren Black, Richard Lynch and John Phillip Law give this film any credibility whatsoever, with the rest of the site offering gigs ranging from bad to terrible (though I forgive Alexandra Ford, which is a complete hottie). /> <br /> Even fans of bad-heartedness will be disappointed as most women keep their clothes, and many of the deaths occur on the screen (which is probably not such a bad thing since death on the screen) pathetic). <br /> <br /> "The Curse of the Forty-Niner" is another in a long list of duds for John Carl.
