Anyone who will pay to see, know, and appreciate Troma films, what they will get. Having said that, I didn't think it was possible to make a movie so bad and still compelling. I looked at myself just to see how much worse it could get before the end. First, it is an Indonesian action movie featuring an American main character who looks and acts like the bastard son of "Taxi" Christopher Lloyd and Rambo. He placed posters of himself like Sly's "Cobra" anywhere in the place and even in Jakarta, a custom made fire series (with acts of his greatest enemies) in Jakarta, although he is in the CIA and arrived just days before. There is a lot of action in terms of weaponry (no sniffing flashes on those M-16s, just sound effects), motorcycles (which break through walls), karate (where nobody makes physical contact) and even sex actors are ugly). The main chart of an epic like this should at least be reasonably likely, but not here. This involves the world's most dangerous drug cartel all going to find a "drug detector device". Why would they need it? It's never revealed, why don't you kill drug-sneaking dogs? It doesn't make sense, but it is taken seriously. The actors have to be commended because they really think this movie will make them all known and try hard. Best rule? "Now dance to your grave, you dirty whore!" Best scene? Rambo jumps on flying helicopter, pulls machine gun out of hand, lets go, falls, shoots helicopter as he falls, helicopter blows, mannequin thrown into water. F ** king genius! If you can't appreciate trash, don't see it. If you can, it's great. One last thing did I mention that it was aimed at the three Punjabi brothers?
