If you and your friends find so much humor and fun from horrible acting, jokes, props, and overall movie production like me and my friends, you should rent it. <br /> <br /> Reading the line line and seeing how funny it is, you shouldn't go through funny, poor quality, great, hilarious content. It's a story of a few children who deny every law of physics and reality and fly back in time through a modern big-screen TV to a world of dinosaurs that eventually become their friends. Not to mention a hilariously serious scene where T-Rex becomes a father figure for one of the children. Yes ... <br /> <br /> It should be in the comedy section, but you will find it with children's movies if you don't find it at all. So call your friends over, sit back, relax, get ready to laugh and enjoy. You will get the laughs terrible one liners in this movie for the weeks. "What about all the ruckus?!"
