This movie had an excellent starting point, and could have been a fascinating look at racism, attitudes towards women at work and female female relationships in England early in the last century. However, it just became a sweet love story. But what was worse is that the love story was absolutely incredible. The acting was mostly poor, confused, but most of the script and story didn't exist. The only thing I liked about the movie was how dark it should have been for electric lighting. I really had a feeling of how little light a candle protruded.
