Lonely Dove is my favorite western second just for The Searchers with John Wayne. I look at Lonesome Dove every 6 months and never get tired of it. I've read all the LD books, though I can't remember much about Comanche Moon. I also looked at this mini-series and decided to paste it on our DVR so we could progress through advertising. Unfortunately, I messed up and didn't take the first part, but decided to see and try the other parts. <br /> <br /> There is no one who can ever compete with Robert Duvall or Tommy Lee Jones, and I expected to be disappointed and I was. <br /> <br /> Although there were so many things that weren't true, it was most noticeable to me, when Nellie died the day before and Gus on the series, it switched to Clara writing him a Nebraska's letter tells him how sorry she was to hear about her death. How could she know the next day in Nebraska? In addition, it was supposed to be 7 years later after her departure and her children looked as if they were about 6-7 years old, maybe a little younger, even more time went on before actually moving to Lonesome Dove and in Lonesome Dove they had There were about 10 years or more before leaving for Montana. When they stopped at Clara's in Nebraska, which probably took another six months on the trail, the girls looked at 10-13, as they play in the garden like little children. The math just doesn't add up. <br /> <br /> I agree that the man who played Gus had many of his ways and looked like Gus might have looked like a young man. <br /> <br /> I'm also a little confused about one thing. The captive white girl they brought back - was she the one who had captured them when they attacked Austin? They said she was caught 25 years ago, but if she was the one in Austin, it was only 7 years later when it took place in the movie. Was she caught earlier? I remember seeing a prisoner after they caught the village and didn't know if it was the same. If anyone can explain, because I missed Part 1. If it was 25 years old, she would probably be over 40 years old when they found her because she was watching the ground. The way they conquered her when they had taken her was also hard to believe she would have lived to get married and have Indian children. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that nothing is worse than John Voight Call in the follow-up of Lonesome Dove or the incredible marriage of Lorena to Pea Eye in the McMurty successor to Lonesome Dove, whatever has not been explained. Even so, the way he killed Newt, I heard that they were pursuing John Voight without his approval. <br /> <br /> If anyone can clean up these differences, I'd appreciate it.
