Incomprehensible terrible mishmash of the probably most notorious of all Roman emperors who went mad, left infamous party organs and ruthless murder in its path ... I know there are several versions of this and it is based on the 102 min I watched - but I can't understand how it can make any difference to the rest of this movie! <br /> <br /> I've heard of the alleged "shocking" content of sex / nudity (which is honest, there is not much at all - and boring when there is) and blood, but beware - that's the technical production amateurism shocking here and there. Everything looks simple and just like a junior film school project! Camera work is hopelessly incompetent, full of strange zooming, flawed frames and confusing pans (from what mostly looks like a great theater stage!) Complete with a grainy, inexpensive photo quality. Lighting and color schemes are terrible and uneven - is it day or night? Are they inside or outside? Did they change screens? Who is or is meant to be in the lap? Editing is the final sin here, which makes a confusing mess of everything with random jumping cuts, continuity errors and random transitions that destroy any chance of momentum, storyline, and involvement. There is an interesting dialogue and an equally interesting true historical story ... but these mistakes make so much tragic. <br /> <br /> A story with so many possibilities to be big is just one gargantuan, burned (and Fellini-equal) turkey that's just good for a few gobble laughs and Peter O'Toole, what make an unforgettable Tiberius. Oh yes, that brings us to the big-name actors. I want to arrange them all one by one and just ask: Who had your free access to bonk in the orgies to be part of this? There I have lost enough lines on one of the worst movies of all time! <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 of Ozjeppe
