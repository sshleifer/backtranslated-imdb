If you are a fan of one of the two origin franchises (Aliens & Predator ... duh ... and even if you liked or disapproved of AVP flick in 06) you will hate this movie. The countless plot holes, flakey and amazing human characters, terrific special effects and even worse directors and fight scenes make this one of worse movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> *** SPOLIER *** One of the HUNDRED large plot holes included the Pred / Alien hybrid, from breast-brush, to mature bad-ass in seconds. It takes off on a board. Predator ship kills and spits a Preds ship before the ship breaks even Earth. job.) AS AS. In the first AvP we have a ship from Sr. Seed hunters. Three hunters won a hunting party and eventually left the "revered body" of the youth who were left. at the end of the movie. Are we expected to believe that the single breast burger has killed all of these Sr Hunters before the ship broke even? Also (and this was EXTREMELY cheap production value on the director / producer's parts) candles and pots and pots from face crawlers somehow magically appeared on the Pred ship, although the entire temple complex and Queen Alien destroyed in the AvP movie is. These facials eventually get an intense role in film ... of course. And how about all these facials who become adult Aliens in a time? What a joke. Although there were a lot more plot holes, I don't think IMDb would appreciate me filling up their servers by writing them here. <br /> <br /> Flakey and amazing characters, where should I go to boys and girls? Where to start ... almost all these goofballs are clich√© people from other movies or TV shows. The villainous bad boy who left out to avoid jail, but just shows the day everything is going to save the day ??? Where did I see it? Oh yes, last season at Jericho !!! Then there is the 20-something-city sheriff (a former trouble maker himself) who once was with the bad boy best friends. Where did we see it? Oh yes, Jericho and Step Tall! Then there is the generic soldier (WITH NO RANK) who comes from a generic war front that does not meet like a long-time loved one and hero at the airport or bus station, but at her own front door by her daughter and husband. And who is this soldier? What did she do in the army / air force / marines / fleet / coast guard? WE DO NOT KNOW because the movie never speaks US. But ... dunh, dunh, dunh ... she was a kind of soldier / lugman / navy / sailor / kiss who knows how to drive a Stryker Infantry vehicle and ... magic ... a HELICOPTER !! ! This character is just a generic copy of every "coming home" service person ... except that she brings a set of night goggles to her daughter that costs this hundred dollars. This is what soldiers must sign and not just "bring home." UGH! <br /> <br /> The special effects and combat scenes are frightening me. These are the things I enjoyed most in the first movie ... watch Preds and Aliens go there! However, the way it was filmed was the action series so dark and filmed so close you couldn't tell what was going on. You couldn't see who was doing what and what was going on if they fought it out. Altogether, these hundreds of items are going to kill this franchise and fanchise. No one is going to care more about seeing their favorite slideshows, and can only guess that the series will go from here, as producers no longer want to dump millions of dollars on a sequel.
