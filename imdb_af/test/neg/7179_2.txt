It is without a doubt the worst movie in the Hamilton saga and the worst actor to do Carl Hamilton. Peter Stormer just can't deduce it, with his psychotic appearance and no style. He may be good at doing killers and psychotic maniacs as in "Fargo" or "8mm", but in this type of rolls he is just useless. <br /> <br /> Lena Olin's presence didn't use this movie. She couldn't save it because it was: an American copy of the big budget action movies like "Goldeneye", "The Hard 3", "Broken Arrow" etc. This movie has nothing Swedish in it, but the actors. It is clear that some Norweag upstart directors made it with McTiernan as model director. br /> <br /> Mark Hamill's presence is just laughing. 2 out of 10
