I must say, I found this movie very disappointing. Yes, I know Maltin gave it 3 1/2 and others think very high of it. But, the opera sequences were god-fearing. I take it Jeannete MacDonald is an acquired taste. Yes, in the short rows I saw with Nelson Eddy, she is much better for him. But on her own ... God, I don't like opera and despise operetta, and she's basically unbearable. At one stage I had to cover my ears. Gable is just OK, and Tracy is discarded. The plot is annoying in the JM, never just tell Gable, she loves him and the opera and why can't she both do? Instead, she suffers heavily (or not) with the compromises she makes. The supporting casting is clearly irrevocable. Besides the star three and Jack Holt (and I suppose his mother), they are all just background and forgotten. The EQ sequence is the only thing that stores the movie. And not. Yes, it's pretty spectacular and moving. But the "o God is wonderful" looks very confronted. I choose incredibly "In Old Chicago" to the age of disaster. Save yourself on this one.
