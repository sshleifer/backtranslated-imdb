Great Balls of Fire is the movie you show to someone you really hate. It is absolute torture of the highest rank and is probably used by minions of a strange force to extract information from prison intelligent agents. I enjoyed Dennis Quaid's performances in the past, but he is completely over in this movie. He didn't cross the line so much, he polished the safe over it, then he came back to jump over and over. He sticks and mugs as if on an incredibly bad journey. This is one of those rare acts where you wish you could enter the movie and beat the man within an inch of his life to do something so terribly terrible. Was he desperate to win a Golden Raspberry or another bad actor award? That's the only conclusion I can make. Thanks Dennis, you've given us a bad performance for ages. Where was the director to govern in this guy? <br /> <br /> The opposite side of the extreme is Winona Ryder, she's the plastic features and plastic work. I got an overview of her acting style that compared her to a wash dummy. It was, of course, an insult to washing mummies all over the earth. Everyone could have the role of Jerry's minor cousin / wife through more humanity. This leads to the mixed message of the movie, it is 100% good to marry your own cousin and have a child with the union. I fail to see what is so good, but Hollywood seems to think that minor incest is at all. Talk about "family values." <br /> <br /> Another problem is the format. Is it a straight forward to tell Lewis's life, or is it a musical? I'm not talking about the music, I'm talking about the real weird scene Jerry is driving to school, starting to sing a song and everyone is dancing as if it was Broadway musical looking for a Tony. Fantasy and reality are thrown together in a mix that doesn't work. But who really cares? I don't. And neither do you. You can't get back the minutes of the life you'd waste on this movie. So don't waste your time, it's too precious for something that is wrong and poor.
