I'm really not sure why people are so complimented on this strange movie. Having said this, I actually sat through the whole 2 hours and couldn't say it wasn't quite indefensible. <br /> <br /> I think the key problem is that Frank Marshall is not a true director and it's clear in the movie - he's an experienced producer, such a movie has made a lot of time and will understand Which goes into the process. But I think it's quite different to being able to really regulate a movie - the direction was competent, but somehow flat and directional. Marshall has more experience as a unit or second director, and it has come to pass, in my opinion, in the final product - it seems to be a group of sets that did not really have any continuity in his feelings or character. <br /> <br /> Fun, viewable, but good? None.
