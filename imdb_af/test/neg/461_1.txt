I'm the kind of person who can enjoy a good B movie if it has some sort of value-giving value, but Dead Space has nothing to do with it! This is the kind of movie that will make you frustrated, restless and sick in your stomach. <br /> <br /> Bad acting. Lame story. Terrible consequences. Terrible, unbearable dialogue. Dead Space has it all!
