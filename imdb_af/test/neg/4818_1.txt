As a New Orleans resident, I can say that almost everything in this movie, from the abominable N'Awlins dialect to the highly creative "manipulation" of Crescent City geography, is terrible. This is another of the Big Hollywood movies that decide to stereotype New Orleans like: 1. A city full of French sounding idiots 2. A city full of people who sound like they just came back from Blanche Dubois's summer house 3 'N City of drunks, where every day is Mardi Gras 4. ' A city of deep secrecy, where almost everyone is a victim of voodoo (I admit we might be a drunkard, although not every day Mardi Gras). "The Big Easy" is one of the worst movies about New Orleans. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
