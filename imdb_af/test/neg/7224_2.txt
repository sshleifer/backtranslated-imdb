The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it shows bands and their music when it changed in '81 in NY during '81. Regarding the film itself, it has at least three major errors. First, there is narration by the film, which is not necessary at all. In the few places where some explanation is needed, just a little dialogue would have been added, would have gone. Secondly, there was no clear attempt to sync any of the sound. In fact, it is clear that most of the dialogue was recorded later without trying to fit the movie. The third mistake was in the end. I will not end the brave souls who will endure the torture to pass through the film, but it does commit a sincere sin in the author. Not the money or time it takes to see it is not worth it unless you are a fan of one of the representative bands.
