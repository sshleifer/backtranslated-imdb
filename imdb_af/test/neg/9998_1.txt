I occasionally let my children see my garbage so they will understand how pathetic the performers are. They are pathetic, not because they are fat, but because they whore their dignity for a few minutes of celebrity and fortune. <br /> <br /> For anyone who pops up, sniffs and grinds on the national TV to be fat (totally their own fault) is misleading. What does this say about us as a nation? Suppose your lifestyle choices and their consequences are not our responsibility? <br /> <br /> "The biggest loser" is a suitable title, but it has nothing to do with your weight. <br /> <br /> Absolute garbage.
