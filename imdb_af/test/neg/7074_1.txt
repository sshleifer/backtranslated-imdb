"Tamara" just felt like another teen-oriented knock-off of the "I Know What You Did Last Summer" trend and is painfully boring. A high school wiped out, which is heavy in witchcraft and black magic, is accidentally killed during a cruel prank buried by a group of bulls that bury her in the woods, to tell no one. The next day, the so-called "dead" Tamara, arrives at school with a completely new image and seduces her murderers and has a little revenge ... It's basically a combination of "Carrie", "The Craft" and every other straight-to-video, teen-upper turkey that touches the shelves these days. The actors are absolutely scary and look about ten years old to leave high school. There are some gore, which is really nothing interesting, as the movie is so boring and I can't wait for it to end. If you like modern garbage as I insist, you are looking for this one, otherwise you won't save ...
