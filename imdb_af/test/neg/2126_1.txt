What might go wrong with a movie that includes a lot of Italians pretending to be Flordians, and a few vague-lava-scaled crustacean things like the hell-inspired hell-spa devil?!?! <br /> <br /> Everything's going wrong, I'm telling you! <br /> <br /> This is a very good MST3K episode, because dislike the ball, which is without errors, is easy to do when considering this movie is a mess with a nasty and boring plot. <br /> <br /> 9/10 for MSTied version. 1/10 for un-MSTied version. <br /> <br />
