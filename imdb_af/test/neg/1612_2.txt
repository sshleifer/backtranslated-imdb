A malfunction in space sends astronaut Neil Stryker (Glenn Corbett) of course to something of a parallel world, called Terra, circling the sun across the Earth. If a creature from space were to pose a threat to the world order, Stryker is held until it can determine exactly what to do with him. However, Stryker becomes suspicious of his environment and escapes. With the help of a sympathetic nurse and an old scientist who opposes the government, Stryker will try to drive and return a space ship to Earth. <br /> <br /> Stranded in space (or the stranger if you prefer) is another of the 70's made-for-TV movies that had to be changed in a regular weekly show. In this case, it's easy to see why it didn't. First, there is nothing new about the show. It was undoubtedly designed to use the same formula used by The Fugitive of The Incredible Hulk or Planet of the Apes. You know that a stranger is constantly going from one town to the next, taking any strange work he may already be pursuing by a government agency or newspaper reporter. This is a formula done to death. The second strike against Stranded in Space is his head, Glenn Corbett. Can this man come in any less likely way? I threw him to be caught. Without sympathy for the main character, this kind of performance would never work. Lastly, it's supposed to be science fiction. Just because everyone is left-handed and someone is hanging three false searchers on the horizon, do I have to conclude that this is a distant planet? So it's a mere coincidence that they all speak English, like people dress up on Earth and run Plymouth Furies? Yes, right. <br /> <br /> The only highlight for me was the inclusion of Cameron Mitchell in the cast. Certainly, it's hard to see him in something awful, but you know the old saying. Any Cameron is better than no Cameron (yes, I've never heard of it). Like many of these 70-year-old TV films, I saw Stranded in Space with gratitude from Mystery Science Theater 3000. I won't call it a major episode, but there are some good jokes on the way. So in the end, while I upgrade the movie a 2/10, it gets a 3/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
