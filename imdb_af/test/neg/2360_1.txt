totally useless ... because I was there, I did it with the subject I have to say that the club atmosphere has absolutely no respect. It might have done if the characters were not just mouthpieces for incredibly dire, unrealistic drives. So many scary worthy scenes that make the office ashamed (not a compliment to this movie). It can also have helped to tell a story, a point, a message, a comment, anything. Seriously, Kevin & Perry Go Large has more to say about the subject than this movie (term much prefer in this case). There should be minus numbers reserved for movies like this. -10 (extra turd)
