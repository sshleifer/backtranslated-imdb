Val Kilmer is almost nowhere in this movie - happy for him! He might play 30 seconds of screen time and his role is completely irrelevant. After watching the movie, couldn't I tell you what role he played in the movie? OK ... they suck you in the first hour by immersing you in dark underground tunnels. Ghostly movies filmed in dark underground tunnels suck most people the first 30 minutes after an hour. Then you'll start wondering, "why do I look at it?" I remember how easy it should be for a director / writer to use dark underground labyrinths to make a movie. Simply film people wandering in dark tunnels and you immediately have a strain. But that's where this movie doesn't go! We all wonder who's crashing at night, but there's nothing in the dark in this movie, but more darkness. The story is even worse. Apparently there is an underlying story to the movie I learned to watch the movie. But the film uses such a poor dialogue that it has never been reached during the screening. I still don't understand what the author / director meant to say. Some children were caught underground by a deceived sister in Russia? Why? Are they in our time - the same time as the characters? Are they ghosts? <br /> <br /> It was an absolutely horrible movie that drew me to write my first IMDb review to warn others to avoid it.
