Directed by E. Elias Merhige "Begotten" is an experiment with some interesting ideas that don't quite succeed in what they are trying to do. The film is a 76 minute ultra-slow, question-effective, annoying experience that seeks to provide an intriguing philosophy of Earth creation and human nature. <br /> <br /> It opens up with God as a precautionary psychopathic Man making tears, opening his stomach with a knife. Blood and human waste appear from the intestines Mother Nature. She continues to satisfy herself with the dead god's semen. Later she gave birth to the Son of the Earth. A retard that is constantly abusing a group of cannibalistic people who I believe is human representation. <br /> <br /> "Begotten" takes a distorted and disturbing look at the origin of life. Demonstrate the self-destructive nature, violence, lust and greed that has become a trademark for man. The problem in the movie comes from two points. One is that the film is just too slow in the exhibition. What we get is spent a good thirty minutes showing how the Earth's son is constantly shaking naked on the ground and at the same time being molested and tortured by humans. Such a tasteless extension gets bored very quickly and doesn't have the punch to hit the viewer's senses. <br /> <br /> Another point is "Beggoten's" visual appearance and sound. The greyish, inverted, black and white low frame cinematography disturbs the disturbing factor of the plot, but such novelties often only work for short periods. Then their effect starts to lose if the audience gets used to the look. The sound is suffering from the same problems. It is constantly repetitive and similar sounds get annoying so fast. I have an urge to turn off the volume. "Begotten" loses it's charm shortly after it started. It tries to be original and creative, but it does not extend to the ideas that are vague plot, instead of repeatedly repeating the same scene. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is that "Born" stuck in one moment. . Although it is trying to move forward, the visual and audio stays the same. Show the same action in a slightly different way with just a little different sound. A gymnast cannot just make a movie. It also needs suit and variety, something Merhige apparently forgot.
