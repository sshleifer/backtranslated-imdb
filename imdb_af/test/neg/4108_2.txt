The acting was terrible, the cheesy, fake, KOP green screen effects were ridiculous, and the creatures were totally delayed. The only good thing about this movie was the concept and the laugh I got to watch such a bad movie - then I got pretty angry because I realized I was saving $ 4 to rent it. Why would a movie like this ever be in theaters? I know this movie came out almost 5 years ago, but does anyone make any effort to make movies? I just write random stuff to fill space, because I need ten lines of text to publish this review. This next rule should just about do that. Annnddddddd there!
