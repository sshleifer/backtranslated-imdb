I went with high expectations, because the director's "Shower" impressed me so much. Despite some dilapidated folly, "Douche" stands high on my list of favorite movies for all time for his profound insight into family relationships and his generally excellent acting and direction. And I've seen it three times. <br /> <br /> But "Quitting" has flattened, according to me. It was a senseless exercise and I was so tired of the main character's irreconcilable personality that I long for the movie to end. I admit I fell asleep six or seven times, but it was only for a few seconds at a time, so I think it's still OK to write this comment. <br /> <br /> I admired the parents and sisters. The device to use all the right characters in the movie is a nice one I've never seen before. <br /> <br /> Disappointment, I will still make an effort to see any movie with Yang Zhang's name, The base of the beautiful "Shower."
