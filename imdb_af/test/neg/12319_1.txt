The cat in the hat is just a slap in the face film. Mike Myers as the cat in the hat is actually not funny and Mike Myers couldn't have been worse. It's his worst movie he ever was in. The acting and the story were just terrible. I mean how can they tell the beloved stories of dr. Seuss is making film and being one of the worst movies of all time and such a disappointment. I haven't seen a worst movie yet, maybe Baby Geniuses. But this movie is just as bad, I can't even describe how badly they made this movie. Bo Welch must be dismissed or the author must. <br /> <br /> Heathen's lookout: 0/10 No Stars F
