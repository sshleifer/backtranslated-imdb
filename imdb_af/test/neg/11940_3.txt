When I see the trailers for this movie, it looks like a good romantic comedy. I was expecting a little light pleasure. Instead, I was bored and a bit depressed. <br /> <br /> Honestly, there was no chemistry between the leads, and the movie had little anything it was funny. The little girl was wealthy - when she was crying, I was crying - but I thought they might use someone a little younger in the role. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie was filled with long, dull silence or swelling opera music. I'm not anti-opera, but I would have preferred to spend that time so we could get to know the characters, all stiff and underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> I was really disappointed in this movie. All the time I watched it, I thought of how much better it could have been.
