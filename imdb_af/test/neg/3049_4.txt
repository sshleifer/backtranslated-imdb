I wonder if all these PG-13 horror movies just glorify screen tests for young and upcoming talent. Get a first-rate screenwriter, an inexperienced director, a few TV actors who break their big screen and look for what they can do. "When a stranger calls" is a little better than most such recent offers, but is still quite near the book; dug with plotgate and genre clich√©s. <br /> <br /> The story is incredibly simplistic. The sleek 87 minute run is heavily filled with unobtrusive friends and a senseless cheater's boyfriend. The killer even has the signature motivation of Jason or Michael or even the original movie's killer, and is therefore never terrifying. The police act in such an incredibly ineffective and lazy way to tackle professional injustice. Simon West brings the same attractive banality to proceedings he managed with Lara Croft, but his style of directing is definitely generic, with no real talent or vision indicators. The performances are routine, dark corridors replace real horror, and are scarce from the tired cat-in-the-box variety. <br /> <br /> The cinematography and production design, however, is above average for this type of film. The house is beautifully designed, all dark wood and glassy reflections, and there are a few moments of visual interest. <br /> <br /> Although there is no gram of dramatic originality, it serves as a fairly satisfying 'dark house' thriller, keeping interest longer than most of its soul.
