Arthur Miller has always been known as one of America's great playwrights for works such as "The Death of a Salesman" and "The Crucible". "Focus" is one of its lesser-known plays brought to the silver screen. However, if I know a great playwright Arthur Miller, I doubt his original play was much like the movie. The film emerges as empty and formulated, with William H. Macy as a non-Jew who was ignored by a Jew by anti-Semitic neighbors in World War II Brooklyn. Don't get me wrong: the acting is OK, and I suppose the people behind this movie are probably trying to make a point about racism, but the movie just doesn't work. Macy, Laura Dern and David Paymer just can't create an effective story with the material here.
