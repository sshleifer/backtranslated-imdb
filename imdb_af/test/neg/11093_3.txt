With all the potential for a good film in its beautiful settings, movies and filmmaking, this movie's frenetic manuscript, lead speed and timber performance have just been a great disappointment. With decent direction, editing and musical score, it could be a good movie, perhaps a dark version of Blake Edward's '10 ', instead of a nebulous version of Ron Howard's' Splash'.
