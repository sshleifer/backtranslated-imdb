Director Delbert Mann was a much better director than this film shows. He has ALL the rest on the REAL, IT'S TOUCH OR MINK, and the last days of PATTON, among other things. This mediocre, made for television telling Dicken's masterpiece, is so bad, even those unfamiliar with the often filmed story will be dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> Apart from the fact that the movie is available from only two well-known suppliers (Brentwood and BCI Eclipse LLC), the poor quality of the transfer, and the scratchy and confused soundtrack, the task is to find this movie on video , Not worth it. <br /> <br /> I've always believed that if a company is going to put a movie on video and charge the public money to buy it, then they must have at least a copy of the movie and " do a good job on the transfer. Unfortunately, none of the two suppliers has such a work ethic and the result is only suitable for the bargain in the local discount store. <br /> <br /> The story is mainly told by flashbacks, which make the movie episodic and talky. Many of the rich details of the novel are lost in this translation. The characters of Martha, Traddles and others are clipped and the relationship of young David and Steerforth is not being investigated enough, so we are wondering why David will go with the guy. <br /> <br /> The relationship between David's son and young Agnes was never developed and it is difficult to understand why she and David eventually marry. As Martha is left out, it's a mystery how Dan Peggoty finds his cousin. And the absence of Traddles makes David a very lonely fellow. <br /> <br /> Some people have credited this film with a good job of shortening the long novel. I do not agree, it is at best a greenhouse on the book. Anyone who saw the 1935 George Cukor version agrees. <br /> <br /> The performances in the version by Fields as Micawber and Rathbone as Murdstone are definitely worth seeing. And the more recent Masterpiece Theater version (April 2000) and Hallmark (2000) versions are both excellent achievements made for television adaptations of classic novels. Directors Simon Curtis and Peter Medak responsible for the films deserve the highest praise. <br /> <br /> My final comment about David COPPERFIELD 1969 is Don't Buy It, there are some much better versions of the movie. available. If it is on television, turn the channel to something else. It's a waste of one hour and twenty minutes of your life. Sorry, but I can't praise such a terrible movie.
