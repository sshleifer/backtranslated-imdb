I can't really see anyone having any interest in seeing this movie. A woman meets a man, he wants to play games, including her, but only until she realizes what she misses. She's leaving, and it's really. It took 9 1/2 weeks before Elizabeth (Kim Basinger) left John (Mickey Rourke). She had to leave him for 30 minutes and ended our misery.
