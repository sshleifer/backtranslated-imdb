It's hard to decide what to say about this one. It's not quite a hundred percent bad. Although the film-in-a-movie is inexpressibly bad, it is meant to be campy, but to miss a mile. I'm pretty sure, however, that it is deliberate. Danny Aiello is quite adequate here, and more or less nails his pathetic character. Dyan Cannon was well in a small role. Clotilde Courau was impressive as the youngest twenty girlfriend. And Linda Carlson had a brave topless scene that she had drawn very well. <br /> <br /> So, it's not quite bad, but I don't believe this one achieves its goals. All in all it's probably worth going through.
