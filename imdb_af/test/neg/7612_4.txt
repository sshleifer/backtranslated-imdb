I found this movie very disturbing. Treadwell is delusional and disturbed, until the point is likely to suffer from mental illness. The imagery shown is him and not an actor, yet it shows behavior that ended in death. Is it appropriate to show real footage of a suicide? Let's not make words. The film shows behavior that led directly to his death. <br /> <br /> For those who think Treadwell is a hero, think again. The footage he shot was about him and not the bones and foxes he claimed to help. He did not do any meaningful research on their habits or numbers and did nothing to really protect them. All he did was run around in the woods and convinced him that he was better than everyone. The reality is by desensitizing the animals to people, exposed to great risks. His self-sufficient behavior did not cause his own death, but the death of his companion Amy plus also exposed his beloved legs and dragons to greater damage. <br /> <br /> But I'm also worried about Werner Herzog's action on this movie as he did. <br /> <br /> A friend and I had a long argument on this movie that loved this movie. He believes people who are seriously disturbed are making interesting topics and he calls the film Downfall as an example. But in Downfall they use actors. We didn't see the real Madga Goebells cyanide capsules put in her own children's mouth. <br /> <br /> There was something about using the real footage in the Grizzly Man that reminds me of the horrible soccer stage tragedy where people were killed and the photographers who could be helped prefer to just take the horror . <br /> <br /> Herzog's film shows us that Treadwell's footage is more about Treadwell. But Herzog did the same. His own personality and opinions are broadcast in this documentary, which allegedly deals with someone else. Scenes like the one he is listening to are not needed. We already knew what was on the band because the shoulder told us. We didn't need Herzog to dismiss a tear with one of Treadwell's earlier friends. It didn't add to the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie showed us that Treadwell was very self-sufficient, but it also showed us that Herzog is.
