MINOR PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD !!! <br /> <br /> How did such talented actors become involved in such a continuous repetition? Robert DeNiro plays a Dumb Hollywood version of the standard <br /> <br /> violent, tough cop (he beats the bad guys and rolls his <br /> <br /> eyes to the police who prefer to to stay the book), and Eddie Murphy plays a <br /> <br /> not so difficult policeman who would rather be an actor (ie, he yells, <br /> <br /> "Freeze, Police! "and pat his" hard look "down). Of course, they are <br /> <br /> along with Bobby's loose cannon tactics to get him in hot water <br /> <br /> with the media and he's starring in a <br /> < "Cops" -like reality show. Take a breath, cuz, it's as funny as it gets <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> No energy has been put into writing - it feels like a light repetition of <br /> <br /> every copy-friend movie thrown into a blender with a 15 minute starring, <br /> <br /> yes, DeNiro himself, almost the character he plays here. <br /> <br /> The jokes fall flat, the action feels listless, and nobody seems to be <br /> <br /> with a good time. It's dead on the screen. <br /> <br /> Please don't waste your time. Even if you have a dominant affinity <br /> <br /> for one of the actors - avoid it and do them a favor. If this <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> earns money, these types of scripts will be perfectly acceptable to actors of their quality. <br /> <br /> DeNiro. You've made serious movies. I remember them - <br /> <br /> they were good. You were nominated for awards for them - remember how <br /> <br /> was that fun? Now, to "Analyze this" (which was good), "Meet the parents" (which was also good), and "The Adventures of Rocky and <br /> <br /> Bullwinkle" (which wasn't good), I think we should parody yourself and be less self-centered. "Casino" feels like a long time <br /> <br />. And no, I don't count 15 minutes as serious Bobby. Anyone who has taken <br /> <br /> the media satire seriously should get their weekly world news
