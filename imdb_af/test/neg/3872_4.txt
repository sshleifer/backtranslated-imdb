B. Kennedy tried to make a successor by exaggerating and exaggerating a gigantic left-western (not as left-wing as the G. Kennedy successor who came to this one). <br /> <br /> This is the ugliest movie of the two pursuers? very ugly looking. It's slapdash. B. Kennedy strengthened it, but without having the genius for it. Hundreds of peons, hundreds of Mexican _companions, hundreds of women, a desert, unfinished landscapes, a storm? The biggest scale. <br /> <br /> Everything in this awkward sequel, just in a strange way, is ominous. . <br /> <br /> The movie itself is very ugly. Brynner, who made the best role in the first film, doesn't look good in this one either. <br /> <br /> Rey plays a priest; He will be a political leader, Quintero, in the next successor to the franchise. <br /> <br /> It is true that when you have so many characters, you may not need a very interesting storyline; sometimes. For example, Brynner meets McQueen; then they choose another 'compaddress'; or, B. Spencer meets Coburn; etc. It is nice to see where and how they will meet the rest of the crew, etc. But you need at least these different characters. Unfortunately, Burt Kennedy's installment is not very good. <br /> <br /> The return of the Seven (1966) begins with a bullfight. Vin and Chris meet there; they decide the third survivor of the original Magnificents ?? Save Chico, which belongs to a large group of 300 peons kidnapped by the Mexican bandits. We get the name of Chico's attractive woman. That's Petra. Chris must be a small army again and here's a Dirty Dozen hit? Chris picks his men from the culprits. Another member of the commando is a female woman who will look after the women who are left without men. The sexual humor is especially dissatisfied and unpleasant in this movie. It strives to look smart and spicy; It's just boring and stupid and rough. <br /> <br /> Choosing the members of the small army was one of the greatest joys in the McQueen movie. Unfortunately, the first successor in the first successor of the three teams is the Magnificent Seven. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Fuller makes a mean "Vin" in this Mocke? A grueling attempt, does a Mexican revolutionary leader have a greedy plan? He kidnapped 300 peons and used them to build a village and a church in the memory of his lost sons. (Useless to say that this insane Mexican revolutionist does not represent Wallach's role in the first film.) B. Kennedy plays exclusively on the camp and on top things: ugly provinces, a thunderstorm, gigantic lightning, a desert. A great battle between the emancipated peons and the revolutionary vaqueros. Of course, the return of the seven (1966) completely abandoned the good sense of the McQueen film. <br /> <br /> What is particularly shocking is that this successor came to the original movie fairly quickly, but everything has changed in the way of making Western. <br /> <br /> Both persecutors seem strange.
