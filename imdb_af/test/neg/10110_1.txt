It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The cast is an international one - Australian handicap-to-British, raises American and a character with an English name that exerts an unrecognizable "European" accent. What accepted efforts to accomplish this motivated crew is completely undermined by a plot and a special ignorance script. So short were the surprises of the film's budget and overall production values ​​are so low that it won't bother to win a movie limbo competition. In the last twenty or so years, our horror films and stalkers have seen spectacular performances of extraordinary (though not necessarily "high") quality made in no budget. Recent examples include the weak but completely scary "Blair Witch Project" and of course - the youngest - the low-budget winner, SADF, with virtually unknown leaders (Gary Elwes is just someone you don't remember, even if you saw ahead of him). In DARKHUNTERS it is shocking to find a well-known character actor, Dominique Pinon and Hollywood. Jeff Fahey struggles to save the movie. It is an embarrassment to see the lonely, empty man (Fahey) in a corny makeup that provokes bizarre bad lines. I would have rated this movie 0 out of 10 made it possible!
