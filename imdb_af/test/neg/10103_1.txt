Awesome action with the worst special f / x I've ever witnessed. It's bad enough. I wasted $ 3 to see this cramped heap of shit, but it's been an hour and a half I lost that I could do something else, like getting a root canal or volunteering for the jury duty. Getting drunk can't even help this video. <br /> <br /> To put it bluntly, I believe I have lost some IQ points during this idiotic piece of sensible "work"! Perhaps this time I should have followed my own advice. Never expect a decent movie if it is written, directed and produced by the same person, and never expect anything of value from Jeff Fahey.
