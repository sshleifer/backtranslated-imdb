The movie opens with beautiful landscapes of the North West countryside. Fence posts that come from sweet ground, a freight train crossing fields of hay in the distance, cloud clouds, small roadside structures, a motel or a dinner in the middle of nowhere. In addition, an ugly but mysterious Twin Peaks piano arrangement is all in an American Gothic form of everything moderate and atmospheric. However, director Jon Jost keeps uncomfortable frames, blocks of letters, opening credits with annoying swooshing sounds, color frames announcing "BLUE", numbers that add up to the 12 steps to a conclusion announced in the opening credits. It goes without saying in the first few minutes that, although Jost is more than capable of capturing landscape and atmosphere, he doesn't care. He does not love the Pacific Northwest open walls that Terrence Malick does in Badlands and neither does the time or inclination of Twin Peaks, David Lynch, to weave mystery and intrigue around a given place. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is more Jon Jost's frustration with experimental tricks that serve their own purpose. The use of dividing screen is interesting. I especially like how we split the first image of Ricky Lee into two, one tells childhood that only matters to him, the other curses and slaps his head against the wall and over The course of the film that second Ricky Lee dominates, the macho precipitation hipster with the shades that are hopelessly self-centered and stupid. On the other hand, the stop-motion animation and the choice to play most of the movie in voice over story work. It sometimes does, as Jost writes as well as he shoots static shots from the small town of American Nowheresville, but Beth Ann's monologues, conceived in the most flat nose monotons, are a voice that crossed Stephen Hawking's computer speech program , crossed with a horse that rocks. So on the ears it stirs the purpose to pay attention. <br /> <br /> Each of the couples is related to our past experiences, their little triumph and foolishness and doubts and relationships that have gone nowhere. They say very little to each other and what they say they say with empty faces. But they smell like rabbits. It seems to be their only communication channel left open, perhaps the only one who can trust with any safety. Jost chooses his main characters in Frameup under the na√Øve and vigor, those driven by an American Dream have become acidic, but he does not place them above them. He does not condemn in his portrayal. They may be wrong, but they are blessed with moments of humanity, uncomfortable though it may be. We are called to give empathy and love rather than show and laugh. It is becoming the most successful framework; The movie's characters are alive, even when their expressionless faces don't, even when Jost gets in the way with his stamped framework and intrusive camera games. <br /> <br /> Then we go back to angry rations about the devastating effects of money played over a built-in dollar bill shot, we get a weird psychedelic order where Jost's camera slips under huge foliage, which will soon begged, as Beth Ann repeatedly flushes the "red-tree trees", we even get a sudden turn-around to plot and genre as the couple Beth Ann and Ricky Lee, small town losers with nowhere to go and nothing to return them keep going to death, come to California and decide to rob a 7/11. The movie does not rise to an emotional crescendo in the aftermath of the 7/11 work, as one might expect from a 'couple-on-the-run' road movie, it shoots slowly and you look out the window to see it didn't really get a place. Parts of the ride are hypnotic and parts are almost touching and funny, but everything is mostly annoying.
