I had to watch this one for my Canadian theater course and I was told it was considered the best Canadian movie. When I looked at it, I didn't really agree, as I saw much better. I understand that there were Canadian themes and messages, but the fact that the characters and the plot were so disconnected with me (as a spectator) didn't really care what the movie was trying to tell me. The plot was too dry. The characters did not have many positive personality traits, but it was to emphasize the messages not to mark spectators. This movie shows a bit about Quebec's history. Not a very interesting movie; it certainly doesn't earn on such a high pedestal.
