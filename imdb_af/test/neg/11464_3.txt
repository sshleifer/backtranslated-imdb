This movie is called "Solomon Kane". What it is not. The main character wears a hat, but that's all he has in common with Robert Howard's character, Solomon Kane, as known from early pulp magazines and many publications ever since. It's a fantasy movie, not really that bad and it can easily have passed with a pretty good review - if it wasn't called Solomon Kane. The hero is a newfound character who is definitely not SK. The story is not Robert Howard either. <br /> <br /> As a fantasy movie, it's another movie that follows the traditions of the genre: simple story, poor CGI, poor actors, poor directing. Still, it can be fun, you know, "the cheaper they are, the better they are". But since it is called Solomon Kane, I cannot accept it. Imagine a movie of Lord of the Rings with a hero Bilbo fighting the black wizard Saugalf with the help of his dwarf friend Aragorn and the beautiful heroine Shadowfax. And with a final battle where the three use a magical ring to kill the evil wizard who transformed into the dragon Gondorian. Imagine. This is exactly what this film did with Robert Howard's character Solomon Kane. <br /> <br /> I would give it a 4 star review if it was just another horror movie, but because it is called Solomon Kane, I can evaluate it only 3 stars.
