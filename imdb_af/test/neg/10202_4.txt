... looking for the cutest "so bad thing good" movie, I repeatedly laughed at the first fifteen minutes of various films, just to stay disappointed and be bored at the end. Not this time !!! My eyes were tearing, my stomach and my cheeks hurt to laugh so hard in the film. Certainly, Hulk Hogan is a sub-actor and the plot is completely predictable, but everyone is immersed in this movie and knows it all. Anything anyone wants to see when renting it is a can of a bunch of "YEAH BROTHER" s and "WHATCHUGONNADO" flying from his infamous mouth. And while the Hulkster on the screen sticks a bit compared to the Hulkster in the ring, seekers of the ultimate cheese will definitely not be disappointed by this backhand jewel of a movie. A laugh riot.
