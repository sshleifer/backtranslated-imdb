Czech cinematography travels through dark times ... this movie is tangible proof. Of course, Slama wanted to make a mediocre documentary about fictitious people who are characteristic of their stupidity. A young and healthy boy who does not want to work and prefers to stay in a rotting hut with an intrepid alcoholic aunt. Because of the idiot of Tonik, who can only announce 'Dad', I will not work in the factory (I really want to know why); I understand the condition of his "home", but I'm really unable to digest the terrible mess. Concise sentimentality everywhere. Why didn't Monika accompany her son to work abroad? Young Czech couples do this very often. And take someone else's children to live in a ruined barn ... it's too much. Irresponsible mother (poorly dealt with by Geislerov√°), naive & stupid son (Tonik), stupid and confused girl (Monika) ... Yes, someone has already told it - heavily directed and acted soap opera. Actors such as Martin Huba, Bolek Polivka, Tatiana Wilhelmova and Simona Stasova did their best, but unfortunately it couldn't save the whole piece.
