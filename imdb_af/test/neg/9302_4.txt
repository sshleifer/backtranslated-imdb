As the title suggests, there is a philosophical, meritocratic thread running through this movie: if a man has the talent and seems to find his way in society and money that could be the outcome if he denies it because he is not has the X factor? This question is treated unsatisfactorily in this adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's book and left me cold along the way. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon is the title Ripley and apart from his way to a funded yacht to Europe falls under the spell of his missions target, Dickie Greenleaf (Law). Homosexuality and social insecurity are all entangled in a violent clash that makes themselves difficult for the rest of the movie. Law, Damon and the sadly pleasant Paltrow as Dickie's girlfriend are OK. I love Philip Seymour Hoffman's comedy Freddie Miles, the bluff society friend Ripley can never be. The problem is that the story beats without bow or redemption, which makes it difficult to swallow. 10/04
