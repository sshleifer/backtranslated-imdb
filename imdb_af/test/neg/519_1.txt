This film has to be put there with Ed Wood movies. A horrible script and bad, bad play. <br /> <br /> A machine gun fights in front of the glass platen of the board; minutes are going to hit someone and no one has coverage - not one window ever breaks. You can think of a flare as the big U-Haul truck can become mystery - not a scratch. <br /> <br /> Do CIA agents and government contractors = scream = Top secret information at a stand-up cocktail party with hundreds of people. <br /> <br /> There is not one actor you care about; everyone is level and basically unlikely. <br /> <br /> A Hawaii-bound 747 flies from Los Angeles and falls twenty minutes later in the Pacific "... in 100 feet of water ...". A short while past when the flight attendant revealed to the other five passengers, they left only two hours of air. on a 747? <br /> <br /> The next day the rescue teams appear and the six passengers are still alive. <br /> <br /> A mediocre movie that goes from bad to worse. . <br /> <br />
