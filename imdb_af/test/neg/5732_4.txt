Sometimes deliberately champion, at other times unintentionally stupid (as in the opening scene where a woman is informed that she has been raped and that her family has been slaughtered just for the sake of the exposition), this film is finally not funny enough or capable (as a fair adventure story) to be really enjoyable. I'll make you decide what the highlight might be, but the low point is probably the battle with a stupid metal dragon. Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for Sonja, with her fresh face and her sturdy, slightly muscular body (and I think her dark red hair fits her perfectly), but Schwarzenegger gives one of his few colorless performances like Calidor.
