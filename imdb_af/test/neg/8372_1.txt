This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life (I come closer 47)! The description on the back of the cover equals the scrolling text right at the beginning of the movie. The further plot was zero and even a lot of bodies would have shown more life in their "play". I saw the full length of it and was really relieved when the final character's death indicated the end of my suffering! The location was either a kind of safe or a dirty beach. I think the home video equipment served as a camera and the lighting was substandard. The dialogues were uninspired and meaningless. As the actors have faces. This brings me to the topic of "make-up": after its appearance, it has "gimmicks" in some teenager's magazines "my first own makeup" or similar. What bought me was the name "Lovecraft" printed on the cover. The only connection with the works of this brilliant mind was the use of the name "Necronomicon", which was misinterpreted as "Book of Light". The 4.70 EURO I paid for this DVD was a complete loss because the DVD went into the recycling box without any further adjustment.
