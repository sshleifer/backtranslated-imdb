1st watched 10/29/2006 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-John Stephenson): Mild entertaining story of a group of five children forced to live with their eccentric uncle while their father and mother fight and work in the First World War as England entered the war. They are told not to go into the closet of the uncle's house, which, of course, do them over and over, and they discover a sand festival they want daily, just until the sun sets. This is the "IT" referred to in the title, created by the Jim Henson group and expressed by Eddie Izzard. The problem is that their wishes usually cause other problems they are supposed to learn. This part of the movie is not done very well, as it is clear that the children, especially the Freddie Highmore character, do not learn from them, but rather go back to "it" to solve their next big problem. "IT" isn't nearly as funny as it could have been with comedian Eddie Izzard really didn't give much chance to improvise, and Kenneth Branagh is wasted as the eccentric uncle, though he is the best character. The kids are good at their acting abilities, but the story would probably have been better to go into the fantasy empire, but they also had a human story to tell it too, which probably caused the confusion among filmmakers . All in all, it was an OK movie, but could have been much better.
