This is one of the most original, click-directed movies I've ever seen. Even if you didn't like this movie's antecedents, 'The Bad News Bears' and 'The Mighty Ducks', they should have done a better job than this one. From the moment the new teacher greets her class and says to her, "Don't save us, we're all losers," you see everything that is twenty miles away for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> All the usual suspects are here. In addition to the mocking teacher, we have a group that is supposed to be bitter children (they are brats, yes, but not so endearing), a slow sheriff they love to worry about, an arrogant head coach of the win -measures, etc., ad nauseum. Only Olivia d'Abo as the new teacher shows some equality. I've never done much to Steve Guttenberg and his performance as the sheriff doesn't change things. Jay O. Sanders is a skilled actor, but his character, the competitive coach, leaves him nothing to work with. Let's hope the writer / director, Holly Goldberg Sloan, will come up with something better next time.
