In yet another miserable attempt to make a fast-paced Hollywood entry into one of the greatest television masterpieces, Peter Segal created a monster. From the context, if one didn't know Brooks's work before it was watched, the movie would be a cumbersome budget movie, not sure if it would be a thick joke and stupid comedy, or just a ordinary action movie with nothing moving on. As a young generation, Y'er, who has just been working for five months over the five seasons of Get Smart, the 60's TV show, this movie had my pain from the moment I got in . Steve Carell saw the part. The backgrounds, agent 99 who gets plastic surgery and 86 as an analyst who was previously morbidly obese, are ashamed of the complexity of the original duo and paint a flat boring reassessment. The scriptwriters, who can't really be funny in both the dialogue and the situation, seem to have fallen back on the lay-out for Don Adams' well-known lines, flashbacks to fat camps, references to Carell's office in the interview style room corners they have, and a female chauvinism, falling flat on his face. <br /> <br /> For those who have seen the original, the authors of this movie thought they would include memories. They call Herbie, Fang (now a worthless little furry dog ​​that carel kovette), the shoe, the cone of silence, and his classic red car and the doors and phone that set the show. The classical music is back, but now everything is updated, usually for the worst. Cone of silence is now a little blue telekinetic forcefield, the control headquarters is right under a museum that controls the past. The film has no creative random technology, and replaces it with crossbows in Swiss army knives. Much of the "humor" in the movie is Carrel who has hurt himself, or another character is hurt, whether it is a bug that accidentally shoots at the crossbow for two minutes, or is hit by security guards or throws into aircraft. In the original, Smart would insult a big enemy, attack him with no success and try to talk to him before being pulverized. In this one he attacks without success and becomes pummeled. The screenwriters seem to have not understood, the humor was established with the dialogue and not the useless violence. It's as if they took the names of the show and cut everything that made it good. <br /> <br /> The poster hides Carell's face as that of Hathaway's. The movie is also taken away from anything that can make it good. They exchange classical music with the exaggerated dramatic action and romantic music in big-budget movies. While the original felt a camp, it replaced the quality with massive doses of CGI explosions and pow sound effects. I was really looking forward to this because I finished the original series just two months ago and it is ranked in my top five performances of all time. However, it was a great disappointment. The credits say they worked with Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, but in all the things I read on the internet, they were largely left out of the writing process. Finally, if you want to waste your money on a cash-in with little value and no respect for his namesake, go for it. But be prepared for the ride not to remember you. <br /> <br /> PS: I almost forgot George Bush humor. They call "Nuculor", asleep at fine art, president's work for their oppression, and appreciate the approach to solving real problems. If you hear the same jokes, you heard in a big budget movie form 3-4 years ago, beat your money here.
