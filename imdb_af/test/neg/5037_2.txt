From the cultural center epicenter, four workers have tried teenagers to change the world through music and fashion. This was the last attempt to make it last century, and they failed. Before cleaning the dust, the band driver and SEX shop owner Malcolm McLaren spent the money. The Sex Pistols have earned a "mockumentary" about their own role in their success. The film is called The Great Rock A Roll Swindle (The Hint) and consists of very small footage of The Sex Pistols that actually play music, and many footage from McLaren make the audience foolish. <br /> <br /> Cable-surrealistic nonsense in which guitarist Steve Jones is a detective on McLaren's tail, quickly releases him and drummer Paul Cook can storm out to Rio and spend time with a big train robber Ronnie Biggs. Prepare yourself for the spectacle of three very unattractive men looking naked for a boring irony-free version of "Belsen was a Gas" (a song about the death of Jews for gold in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp) and " another song sung in Ronnie's deaf including the lyrics: "God saves Myra Hindley, God saves Ian Brady" (lyrics that Johnny Rotten would have considered improperly). The Sid Vicious scenes are little and idiotic. Jump out of bed in a dong with a swastika over the testicles to sing a bad boy-biker song from the 50's. Play in the "Punk's a joke" theme of the movie, trying to turn Sid into James Dean. I'm surprised. McLaren also does not take credit for Siddy's death. The redeeming scenes are those of Sid in Paris and the infamous display of My Way. The punk rock boy right there. Mocking heard an adoring before they all shoot. No need for a whole movie, but just watch the clip on YouTube. <br /> <br /> From Julien Temple's far superior (and more enjoyable) 2001 documentary succession, The Filth and the Fury, we have a more balanced / honest view of what happened in 1978. But there were also a number of scenes I liked to see in Swindle (like anger was a repetition of the same material). One was an animated Sid completed with Sid's voice acting; "You don't know what I'm going to cut, or I'll open you up" - of which 7 inches have still appeared on the cover of the Something else - a slip has been shown in anger, but I don't know what context originally appeared . Was it in original prints but removed to Sid's death? Was there more? Anger also cast light on the film. Who killed Bambi, who was the original intent to make the hard day's night movie McLaren. It played Sting (!) As a member of a gay New Romantics group, and watched a damn face more entertaining than Swindle. <br /> <br /> Sod Swindle, this is a fraudster. If you have to, rent the dirt and anger and courage in the failure of music as a world-changing controversy.
