I can't even describe it. It's the worst movie I've ever seen (I'm a nice guy when I call it movie). Just another big-budget-made-to-somebody-who-not-like-think. It's not even scary. It is rebellious if there are big movies that never reach the big screen, and then this ... "thing" to deceive movie fans. I think big producers make everything they want. <br /> <br /> Just get a big producer, hot chicks (though terrible actresses) and a lot of horror movie clips and cook it for a week or so, and you'll get "The Nun". <br /> <br /> And I thought Bad Boys 2 was terrible !!
