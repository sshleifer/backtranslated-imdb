Honestly, it was an embarrassment to watch Lane and Gere in this movie because it is BAD. The acting was bad, the dialogue was extremely flat and sincere. It was well shot, but then it's a big budget movie again. It was too predictable, even for a chick flick. I even knew from the beginning that he would eventually die. The only thing I didn't know was how. Too politically correct. Very disappointing. The only thing worth looking at was the scenery and the home, because it is beautiful. But, if you want, see National Geography. I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie. As for Gere, he is a good actor, but he has movies like this, so I'm not surprised. An hour and a half I wish I could bring it back.
