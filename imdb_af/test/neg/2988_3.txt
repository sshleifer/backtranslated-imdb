Silly and violent thriller who is a rip-off of 'Liberation' but without any charm and intelligence. The plot is ridiculous and it seems tired and anxious to be free from this improper entry. This movie is a good example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea. It's a pity to see good actors like Thomerson and James makes such a mess.
