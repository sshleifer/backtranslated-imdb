To be completely honest, the popularity of this show is saddening me. Inuyasha is certainly not terrible - it has some good moments, sometimes flashy humor, and, unlike so many animes, dignity. However, it is completely lacking in the essential elements of a valuable story. From the outset, it looks like it's stereotypical. The main plot is centered on collecting the pieces of a crushed gem before being possessed by evil and, as one suspects, is a completely generic epic fantasy relationship. The story follows a familiar pattern to combat multiple enemies for pieces of the jewel and is therefore reasonably predictable, lacking in complexity, and easy to lose interest. But as much animas have shown, a poor appearance can be saved by deep, realistic characters. Unfortunately, no one saves the story of Inuyasha. Kagome, the main character, is the stereotypical anime heroine (and too little of Akane, the main character of the original comic writer's previous work Ranma 1/2); She is kind to other women, but treats many men, especially her love interests, with unfair, trivial, unfair cruelty. Inuyasha is a tough-on-the-outside-but-sweet-on-the-inside, and Miroku is the sad "pervert" stock character. <br /> <br /> The errors continue with what happens to this plot and these characters - nothing at all. Despite constant action, the story does not progress. Despite ordinary romantic moments, not even the main relationship. Despite enough time, the characters never really change. And to add a cherry at lunch, all this stagnation is stretched in about 150 episodes. <br /> <br /> My last criticism of this anime is the animation. While it is definitely not ugly, it shows almost irreverent laziness from the creators. The animators seem to be delighted in long scenes of Inuyasha jumping through the air whistling the wind in which they have little to do, but moving a background. <br /> <br /> In short, with all the wonderful animations of the world at one's keyboard fingertips, there's absolutely no reason to look at Inuyasha.
