Last week I watched a Royal Shakespeare company production of Macbeth. It was 25 years old, filmed without props except swords, no furniture except chairs. It was RIVETING. The acting was super - all the actors trained Brits. Contrast the performance to this ... yawned yawn. Al Pacino, like Shylock, was tragic, heavy and couldn't lose the New Yorker accent, despite the long .... pause .... between ..... lines .... The whole thing was soporific, even the "comic" scenes were barely even worth a smile, leaving a lonely stomach. It's supposed to be funny. They tried to make it tragic. It wasn't just boring either. I give it four points for costumes, scenery and Jeremy Irons, who are good at playing a dull, depressed, deep-fitting man (can he be anything else?)
