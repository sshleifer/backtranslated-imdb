Are we serious ??? I mean wow ... not, wow. I think I saw this movie in an old issue of the War Journal. It's pathetic, originality is completely dead, instead of trying to formulate a new idea that we receive is a mere repetition of an old plot line and to justify it, we just change the gender or race of the original character. moronically and everyone must be sick and tired to see it ... but i think it is just a ridge and will probably fall on deaf ears to the sound of another thorn that is the toilet water like the best western since hit. to Yuma ... (wait for it) ... 3:10 to Yuma! Thanks Hollywood for killing movie as an art form and making it into a commercial barrier of neo-pop junk and blatant delay ... wonderful !!!
