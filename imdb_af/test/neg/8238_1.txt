I recorded this movie and was horrifying to find out that the movie is based on a rape of a little girl who eventually takes the parents to their daughter. My first thought was that I was never ashamed to be an Indian as well as a Hindu. I found this movie not really terrible. Please don't waste your time. As far as music is concerned, there are at most 2 terrible songs and the movie used is cheap. The beautiful scenes are not where India is known. I just hope I shed some light on how disgusting this movie really is. Yes, it can highlight how angry people are in power, especially when it comes to religion, but to sit down and watch almost 2 hours of this movie can almost make anyone gag. If you're watching a good Indian movie, watch something by director Mira Nair.
