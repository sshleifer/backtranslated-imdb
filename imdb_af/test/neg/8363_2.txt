I rarely see a movie with such a cast, such a potentially strong story and based on a bestseller book that is so poor and to some extent incompatible. <br /> <br /> The premise of a story reads like a Brent Easton Ellis novel - many drugs, hopelessness and self-induced tragedy as a young Elisabeth Wurtzel (played by Christina Ricci) trying to deal with a suicide suspect who cannot accept that she actually has a good life. life and it's basically its pathetic to be such a baby. <br /> <br /> Christina Ricci not only plays a tragic persona, but also a tragic actor who screams and screams for most of the movie. actually makes you want to scream - kill yourself already and let's roll up the credits ... The director is not helpful, because he does not deliver any pace and the story feels so uneven that you have no idea what this damn girl actually is not over. The director was apparently on Prozac when he was directing this imitation of a movie and thus leaving the movie on the autopilot. This makes it an unbearable mess. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming feature is a sympathetic Jason Biggs, as Wurtzel's boyfriend (who Fortunately, I decided to shower the self-sufficient egocentric egoism) and an incredibly good Jessica Lange as the crying baby mom. Apparently, Lange cannot be beaten by horrible writers, directors and brave fellow actors. Pure class. <br /> <br /> I don't know if it really is or was Wurtzel, but the film has made me completely unimportant in her writings. <br /> <br /> In the end I just watched this movie and started thinking right away: OK. Time to watch something, it's really about real problems ...
