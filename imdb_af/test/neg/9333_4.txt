"Solomon and Sheba" was the kind of movie you only had to see in the late 50's when I was a child: a biblical epic spectacular with famous artists, unusual costumes, lots of extras and battle order. I went to see it; but I remember that "Solomon and Saba" didn't impress me. It was a strange thing since I enjoyed many "The Ten Commandments", "Quo Vadis", "Helen of Troy" and others. The point is that when you are a child, you do not ignore it in the photos that adults (eg bad plays) and you are easier to please with warriors in their weapons, battles, swords and action, so if you don't impress, then there's something wrong with a product of this genre. <br /> <br /> Although this film has such features, it is definitely standard and average. Yul Brynner's wood performance as the Hebrew king does not even light up when he dances his excited and half-naked Gina Lollobrigida. She is better and makes an acceptable act. George Sanders doesn't seem interested in what he's doing, and Marisa Pavan (Pier Angeli's twin sister) doesn't like Brynner's conscience at all. <br /> <br /> The final sword game between Brynner and Sanders is just for the plot and has no interest and intensity (it had to be filmed.) <br /> <br /> Not a good farewell to the director King Vidor, Solomon and Sheba will probably be remembered as Ty Power's last unfinished picture.
