I like this movie and watched my copy twice after getting it a few weeks ago. But you should see it in the right context. <br /> <br /> I did not check on the dates, but I bet this movie came out later and definitely about the same time as the Collier and Walt Disney populations of the space flight vision is promoted by W.Von Braun. This is reflected in the effort to look factually correct and scientific. Although some ideas are being taken away (eg, step elevators), it is correctly correct. Other things are wrong. <br /> <br /> For example, we are told that a rocket climbs to a height and then ninety degrees To enter space ... like reaching the top of a staircase and turning on the landing ! Then we are told that the total speed of the ship is changing towards the rotation of the Earth. <br /> <br /> This is a hilarious misunderstanding of what really happens. Most space launch centers are located so close to the equator where the Earth and anything on its surface rotate roughly a thousand miles per hour, including any rocket that leaves to space, in an easterly direction (the same as the rotation of the planet). Of course, once the ship had driven west west, its speed would be greater in relation to the Earth's surface, but it would not add to the actual speed of the vehicle. Describe in this movie "airspeed"! <br /> <br /> Similarly, we are told that travelers only feel free or "weightless" when they reach a few thousand miles from Earth, beyond the planets' gravitational field. Again, comics are wrong. Most crew spacecraft do not travel more than a few hundred miles, but as long as they (and their content, including crew) move at a sufficient speed that their momentum in an outward direction balances gravity, they will orbit freely fall. Of course, traveling far enough away from the Earth and even a slow object will go off the Earth's gravity, but leaving the Earth's orbit requires the outcome of 'escape velocity', about one and twenty thousand miles per hour. The vehicle will therefore by definition already reach "orbital velocity" (and "weightlessness"). <br /> <br /> But the movie has many more hilarious things than this. Someone decided it would be better if they missed the moon because of a technical problem, fell asleep for a few days and then woke up to see they had accidentally gone to Mars! So the captain testified that it had to be a divine intervention! At what point is any pretense to be scientific, cut into small pieces like confetti and thrown on the wind amid the cheerful dance of an increasingly barmy plot. <br /> <br /> The strength of a movie like this is indeed in illustrating "how far we've come". Not least in attitudes towards women. The condescending drug hoped for by the female crew is hilarious and also shocking. To think that such attitudes were so "normal" recently. <br /> <br /> As I said at the beginning, I find this movie very entertaining. , as a late night, light through the journey into outer space, from the point of view of the days before it actually happened. An antidote to the cold routine of space flight as it has become in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> I won't reveal the end. It is brave and shocking for a movie of this vintage and character.
