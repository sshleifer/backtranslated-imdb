Today was president's day, my wife and I checked the "The Notebook" DVD at our local library. This is a movie released in 2004, which has fallen below our radar, because we are big movie-goers. I am a published author hoping the screen to play my first book. I have seen references to "The Notebook" in reviews of other movies. That's why I looked at it and gave us the perfect opportunity this morning. We both really liked it. It cried my wife; with many things we could relate to our own, continued love affair, and even I retired. <br /> <br /> This afternoon, after many tasks, recruiting and eating, we decided to actually become a Matinee. When we came to the theater, we preferred to watch most of the current group of movies, we chose to see the "Victoria Day" for some reason not at the theater, although both IMDb and let my cellphone movies play it. So, instead, we looked at the poster for "Dear John" and that it was written by the same author as "The Notebook", which makes it the obvious choice because we enjoy so much of TN. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment! First, the characters did not have the same promise or sense of empathy as 'TN'; and we have responded through all the agreements - two dozen or so - which made us quickly realize this movie was nothing more, as another reviewer said, a poor man's notebook! "It had a real" cash cow "feel, which meant the Sparks just threw a story together, based on the exact" TN "template to make a quick cash. Not only that, after the 'bug-eyed' troll unlikely 'Dear John's-John' for the lash cancer patient, we made the movie ridiculous with everybody who passed half the juicy thin line to the end. There were only about 6 of us in the theater during this four hour. Monday, Matinee and my wife told me to keep it so I wouldn't ruin it for the other. It was so bad. <br /> <see it on the heels of "TN" that the finishing touches were clearly recognizable and Sparks blatant, inexpensive attempt to write a palette that was painfully obvious. We just wish we could see the "Victoria Day" rather ... no matter how bad it might have been after seeing this poor entry into the theater. And oh ... for the last 30 minutes I said, "... don't give that cow the coins, don't that cow give the coins?"
