Every time in a while I remember seeing this bizarre fiasco that is a cross between "What happened to Baby Jane?", "Sunset Boulevard", the Lana Turner LSD movie "The Big Cube" and Manson 's murders, which also took place in 1969, but perhaps before this so-called "movie" was made! There are some descriptions of the plot already here, so I won't go into it. But it is noteworthy that Miriam Hopkins plays a parody of herself: a chattering, ego-maniacal, faded actress. Perhaps she thought she was making a movie so successful as one of the Bette Davis horrors. The old gal Hopkins never stopped working, so you have to hand it over to her. She shows a little too much meat in this movie, something Davis and Crawford never did. And there is a scene with Miriam in the real tough Hollywood Boulevard Christmas parade filmed in Xmas, 1968. <br /> <br /> Gale Sondergard is old, old, old. It's just shocking how shrunk and awful she looks. John Garfield, Jr looks a bit like his dad, but not that interesting. I think one of the Three Stooges is the tour guide at the beginning. If it's not one of the Stooges, it's someone. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to find this thing in the form of a commercial video tape given to me by a friend who knows everything about the litter. It's great !!!
