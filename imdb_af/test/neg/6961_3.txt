To describe what is seriously wrong with this movie, it should contain * spoilers *, so if you see it and expect to be surprised, don't read it! <br /> <br /> I like everything about this movie except the plot; And in a thriller like this credible plot is essential. It's well behaved, if a little slow moving, and the camera works and Portland scenes are great for a low budget, unpretentious picture. The dialogue is very good. <br /> <br /> Mason is severely withdrawing youth working at a telemarketing sales insurance company. His high school friend, Berkeley, is his employer and looks like a brother to him, despite the fact that Mason is, of course, sick. Mason has nightmares that offend him for his inhaler. His faces and nightmares indicate that in his past he had serious problems with female women and the film seems to be a serial killer of women. He met a beautiful, beautiful girl named Amber and sketched her in his notebook. She likes him and suggests to him to paint her portrait. He sees more of her and starts waking up from his extracted state, and becomes almost halfway man. Then something goes wrong. Amber finds sketchbooks with drawings of other girls and she starts wondering. She gets scared and pulls away. We wonder if her sudden cold will hit him over the edge. His behavior becomes more volatile. <br /> <br /> This is the set-up for the revelation. To explain how this movie goes wrong, I have to explain what happens. * Another spoiler warning! * In order to make this plot work, we believe that Amber, a very outgoing, pretty young girl, is going to go for a seriously emotionally disturbed young man who, at least at the beginning of their friendship, stays vacant and can only go in monosillabelle talk or not speak at all. He's gone nerdy, he appears on the edge of the total catatony. Yes, I know, girls can be attracted to all kinds of weirdos, but usually the Charles Manson type or punk rockers, guys with some manic energy. Mason is almost a zombie, he's almost not there. Any beautiful young thing would cross the street to avoid it. It's just not credible that this girl is attracted to him. In addition, there is no credible reason for Berkeley to enjoy the mad Mason, who just isn't credible. <br /> <br /> But wait, there is a revelation. Amber fails to appear at Berkeley's home for Christmas dinner where Mason expects her and Berkeley, his old friend, has to tell him that Amber and all his other former girls, the one he drew in his many sketchbooks, not at all! She and all the others are just figs of his distorted imagination: he dreamed them. <br /> <br /> Well, that explains why a normal cute Amber is going to go to Mason, she's just a imagination of his imagination. It may be the final revelation of the movie with the correct preparation and setup, but it is not. At this point Mason walks back to his apartment and finds Amber there ... he's furious, he kills her. But now we are given to understand that Amber really was, not Mason's imaginary friend. <br /> <br /> In the end, after evidence that Amber actually existed and that Mason killed her, Berkeley must admit that he was wrong, that he had misjudged Mason. It would work if Mason had been halfway from the beginning, but because we always suspected him to be totally strangled and possibly a murderer, it's no surprise to us. We suspected he was long ago and can't understand why Berkeley couldn't see it. But then we are again wondering: if she really was, why would Amber be attracted to the catatonic Mason? <br /> <br /> To make the end worse, is we never given to understand whether all the others of Mason's girlfriends, the one in the sketchbooks, were really whether Amber was the first real? And if the others were real, did they kill them too? What did he do to the bodies? <br /> <br /> The problem is that the filmmakers just didn't know what to do with the material. Perhaps there could have been a way to straighten it out and tell a credible story, but this movie isn't.
