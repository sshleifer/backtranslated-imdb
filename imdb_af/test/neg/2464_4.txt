Jack Black and Kyle Gass play fantasy versions of themselves in this comic show for their side band Tenacious D, an art rock outfit with satirical, barbed lyrics. An ex-runaway obsession with heavy metal and a beach-alive, pot-sleeper pretending to be a rock god, meets and forms a band (the birth on both of them forms the group's moniker). Opening with a funny prologue that is a Twisted Sister 80's video, "The Pick of Destiny", is a fairly well-crafted movie aimed at older children; It sometimes looks like a middle-aged variation of Wayne's World, with jokey stoner interludes and a climate with Beelzebub itself. Yet Black and Gass has a very comfortable report (they also acted as producers and all the music). The target audience will, of course, go for it, though inspiration is a little low, especially in the second half (just over the time our heroes are impulsefully policing police in a student driver's car). The music series are far more successful than the attempts at film satire and for the first thirty minutes or so, Jack Black's manic enthusiasm is contagious. * 1/2 of ****
