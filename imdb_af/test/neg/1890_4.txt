I didn't figure out what the chosen title was doing with the movie. This is another gathering of monsters, just like the HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN. Not exactly a masterful plot, but Universal had to capitalize again. <br /> <br /> Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens) is either very ambitious or over the top in the ego section. He is working on the cure to change Larry Talbot from the Wolf Man. Somehow Count Dracula falls to fall by getting a solution to his vampirism. And to finish off the good doctor's experiments is restoring the Frankenstein monster's energy. Along the way, the bloody doctor's blood is busy with Dracula's. <br /> <br /> John Carradine plays Dracula again. This time he is more convincing. Lon Chaney Jr. as usual is the soulful Wolf Man. Glenn Strange is the Frankenstein monster, who has very little to do this outing. Also with the notable roles are Lionel Atwill and Martha O'Driscoll.
