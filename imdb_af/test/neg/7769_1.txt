I am really desperate for the woman when discussing this joke of a program as if it is intellectually involved and promoting female liberation and independence. This show is the biggest offense for women alongside all the libidinous hip-hop videos. If talking like a bunch of reckless teenage boys over $ 100 in swimming restaurants, shopping unnecessarily and jumping into bed with the closest man on site, is considered empowerment, the fate of Western women can be doomed like us talk. <Br /> <br /> Apart from the damage it brings to the female sex, sex and the city are NOT entertained. Not once was it funny, engaging, exciting or original. The episodes are monotonous. Each character is made mannequins that behave in the same way every episode. None of this level, unattractive women have developed. Perhaps the worst is the main character, Carrie Bradshaw. In addition to being horrible, her love for over-analysis of relationships is worthy. On top of that, the show portrays men as a lot of empty buyers who are unable to commit healthy relationships. Even when there is a decent man, he is somehow painted as a villain. The total lack of empathy for men is clearly the work of a "progressive" pseudo-feminist. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the whole show is that these women live unhappy lives. Any intelligent woman will never envy them. It's a banal show with even more banal characters. The NYC Tourist Board must hate how this garbage shows their other fine city! Fortunately, this train wreck is over! Desperate Housewives are seen as the appropriate replacement for SATC. While DH can be reasonably far-fetched, it explores at least women in more advanced ways. Plus, it treats men more respectfully and it's actually entertaining!
