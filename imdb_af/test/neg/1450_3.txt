Fluff: Mary Boland is always in the foreground. I never touch her top-cross zaniness, especially in "The Women" and "Pride and Prejudice". W. Fields' short role is fun, although the famous pool table welcomes you a bit, as it looks like it is going for ten minutes. The folly of the film, typical of the period, is wonderful. Also, a wink to Alison Skipworth's wonderfully grounded hotel mistress; I'd love to see more of her (she reminds me of Marie Dressler, another personality who deserves high praise). <br /> <br /> Minuses: Gracie Allen. An annoying, unknown presence whose annoyance was unmatched by the rise of Adam Sandler. This near-falsetto nostalgia tinted with an accent of unknown origin is getting old in her very first scene. This is the first of the Burns-Allen movies I've seen and while (like a great classic comedy buff) trying to experience at least one movie with every big comedy star, it's definitely one team I won't be back to. call. Her timing and interpretation of the material is completely down. A Maddeningly mediocre talent. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: An OK comedy, but the gags are few and far between. And just for an hour you can't expect it to be an A-grade Hollywood comedy. Only recommended for Boland and Fields fans who want to see all their work.
