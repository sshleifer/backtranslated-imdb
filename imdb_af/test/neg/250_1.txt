Despite having a very nice front lady (Rosita Arenas, one of my sons), the play and the direction are examples of what NOT to do while making a movie. <br /> <br /> Located in the south of Mexico, Popoca, the Aztec Mummy (real Aztecs, by the way, didn't make mummies) was awakened by the main characters and started at the first movie (The Aztec Mummy) make trouble in the Mexico suburbs. In this second part, the leading man and woman want to find the mummy and place it in his last resting place. (A fireplace would be my first choice.) <br /> <br /> In it, the Bat, a criminal master-mindless stereotype of a criminal genius that features a "human robot" (an idiot in a robot SUIT) to control Popoca and (get it) to take over the world. The final match between the robot and the mummy is hilarious, some of the worst choreography ever seen. The funniest part is that this movie is made and released by a serious Mexican movie studio! <br /> <br /> The acting is just as horrible to hear the movie in Spanish as it is in English (they called the overworking name!). You must watch this movie through MST: 3000. The comments are even harder.
