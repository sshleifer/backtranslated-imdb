I actually liked this movie. Sure, the acting was flat, there was no plot, and the villain was the worst I saw. Michael Bernardo as Dante is worth laughing in his own right, with an amazingly funny catch and evil laugh. But it's worth seeing just for the WORST explosion you'll ever see outside the Power Rangers series. You will know it when you see it. Honestly, this movie should have a low grade budget. I almost stopped watching for an hour, but I recommend watching the whole thing; At the very least, there is plenty of candy for everyone to enjoy. Recommended for viewers with high tolerance for poor movies.
