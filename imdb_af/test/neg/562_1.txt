The man with Bogart's Face puts it himself the nostalgia of the viewers for the late 30's late 40's film era. Failed for various reasons. First, Sacchi, while looking pretty much like Bogart, and even as he sometimes speaks and uses his ways, completely lacks Bogart's charisma or acting ability. It's really clear when Sacchi doesn't imitate a scene of one of Bogart's films. Secondly, the film does not have the first class character characters that Bogart was able to work with. There is no Peter Lorre or Sydney Greenstreet in this one. Certainly, we are acting by, among others, Victor Buaeno, Olivia Hussey and George Raft, but they are not just the same caliber (or are not given enough screen time). Thirdly, the attempts at "modern" humor all fall through. All the underwear jokes, with Marlowe almost * never * removing that damn hat and trench coat (although Bogart would have), etc. just not funny and really pull this movie. Fourth, I've never heard a goofier theme song on this side of Mitchell. Finally, the film's false reverence for Bogart (and other classical actors) is really annoying. Bogart has almost never played a straight hero, at those times he was a hero. He played complicated characters. This movie makes Bogart to be a trigger-happy, moralistic do-godder. While it may have been true about some movie characters, Bogart's characters rarely fit that account. These are movies like these that make people bother with the cinema of the past. Think it's all hokey, "good guy beat the bad guys and get the girl" with low production values.
