Oh my god, it just gets worse than that !!! I always like foolish little sci-fi B movies that are so stupid, it's funny and I thought it would be one of those, but it was just as stupid, I absolutely regret it being allowed to be released to become. What did these people think? Of course they are not real filmmakers and I really hope they have returned to their day-work when they realized that it is best they can do! The acting and the non-special effects were nowhere near the standard of even the lowest budget B movies. And what's with the men who were dressed as women, they couldn't find any women who wanted to appear in this crazy thing. No, probably not. <br /> <br /> I'll give it a "0" if possible, it doesn't even earn a "1" for horrible. Don't waste your time (and especially your money) on this terrible loser of a non-movie!
