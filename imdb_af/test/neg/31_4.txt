It hurt to watch this movie, it really did. I wanted to have it even entered. Disappointingly for very little money I looked past and said that I should appreciate the inspiration. Unfortunately, although I appreciated the film at that level, the acting and editing were terrible, and the last 25-30 minutes were very thumb-twiddling area. A 95 minute movie should not be dragged. The ratings for this one have been good so far, but I fear the friends and family might have a say in that one. What was with those transitions? Dear Sir Editor, Have you just bought your first copy of Adobe Premiere and it's your main purpose to use all the goofy transitions that come with that stupid program? Anyway ... some better actors, a little more passion, and some more enjoyable editing and it makes a decent movie.
