I don't know why all the previous comments are the approval of this movie. THAT IS, not far, but ... THE GREATEST MOVIE I HAVE LIKELY seen, full of clich√©s, bad acting, actually no ... very bad and acting. When I saw it In a theater I would run out of the first 20 minutes. I f you hate somebody, let him / her look at this movie ... that's how bad it is. A girl with an imaginary son / friend who gives a relationship with a real one because her imagination is jealous .... but I think it figure ... she takes her parents who also have some spiritual problems ... plus The character that is supposed to be, I think its laughing stock, the thing that must make you laugh, Cal's roommate is a serious nutshell and just makes me feel sorry for him ... and the whole movie
