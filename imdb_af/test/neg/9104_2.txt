This movie was bad on so many levels. The writing was terrible, so even the best actors couldn't see this movie. This is a pity because they had some good actors in this movie. I mean if anyone saw any of the Police Academy movies, you would know Steve Guttenberg was good. His character in this movie was very serious, which was a big difference to the characters I had seen him before, so it was a plus. And I thought Steve Guttenberg was extremely hot in this movie. With or without the shirt you can't deny having a BIG body! Sexy face too. Loved the 5-hour shadow look, it made him look dangerous. In one part of the movie he is lying in bed without his shirt and I have to say, I'd like to have thrown in there and try to think of his thoughts from his problems! So honestly I will just watch this movie just to fantasize!
