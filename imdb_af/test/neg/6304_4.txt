I love all the main players involved in this bizarre movie. Terrance Stamp, Guy Pearce & Hugo Weaving have all proven themselves as some of the best and most capable actors, but I couldn't go into it. I don't know if that's because I don't understand the lifestyle or what, but I couldn't get my head on this movie. Worse than anything, actors have made the ugliest drag queens I've ever seen. I think it was part of the point, I don't know. I realize that this is probably an insult, but I don't know what to call them. I have to say I bought the guys as the artists (the right term?), But the story was just not very good or very interesting. I would say that I usually can't appreciate costume designers, although I see it if they are wrong or out of place, but I was very impressed with this. Very creative to say the least, but not attractive, but I don't think they should be. I do not know that I am definitely not the target audience and will never see a show of this kind of artist, but I will not see ballet or opera, so I do not know. If it's your kind of movie, you'll probably love it, but if it's not left, it's ... not for most of us. I just checked it won the Oscar for costume design and I will say it legally. I also have to say that Ebert doesn't give much to this movie, even though he looked better than I did.
