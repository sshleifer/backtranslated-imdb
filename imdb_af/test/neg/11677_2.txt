It will be pretty easy to heal this movie: a North Korean spy call girl is shot in the forehead, but survives. The bullet embedded in her brain seeks her knowledge as well as sex. Not known to her, she walks away from the shooting with George W Bush's cloned finger in her purse, a key that can unlock the power to use nuclear weapons. Just call it a skirt, and at least a few people will come to the theater. I'm not sure how many went to see this four-year movie, when it opened in New York last April, but I don't hope much. It sounds like a light and playful pinku movie, but it has art house predictions and is really incredibly boring. Many past pink movies have been successful in their artistic aspirations, but this film's aspirations just make the time between the rude sex scene. And then the sex scenes aren't even good! I saw some beautiful surprising things in dirty Japanese movies. I've never seen this country produce anything with sex this boring. The Spice Channel is more imaginative. The only valuable thing in this movie is the lead actress Emi Kuroda. Otherwise, this is pure torture.
