First, I'm not a firefighter, but I'm in some kind of fire brigade (the guys called when an earthquake hits and the real firemen need more people for SAR), so I had training and simulation but I have no real experience. <br /> <br /> Yet, there are a few points that you notice as absolutely incredible. I can understand that they have removed the mouth and nose pieces from the masks and that there is not enough smoke, otherwise the public will not see anything. But some things defend logic: <br /> <br /> - No second mask attached to the oxygen. How about hell, do you want people without the one smoking through the smoke? <br /> <br /> - Recall people. No, it is not so. I will also shout if someone has hooked such a rope around me and hung from a building. If I can shout, it's, and don't get out of the air, because the rope is pushing my lungs. The second time they are abseiling Jack, it's better, but rather strange. <br /> <br /> - "Goal high". No, you do bloody. You always fight as low as possible. You don't fight to sprinkle flames, you want to extinguish the fire, and it's under the flames. <br /> <br /> - No discipline. They run around like chicken. And they are screaming all the time, instead of using radio, and keeping discipline. <br /> <br /> - No tactics. Why don't they work in teams of at least two? You can still get divorced, but it takes much more than if everyone just moves around looking for victims. <br /> <br /> - Do they really start building buildings without watering? I Europe, firefighters will never enter without a burning building. <br /> <br /> - Firemen on the roof. WTF do they think they do it there without security lines or water? - Explosive rooms. Wood and stone do not suddenly explode. <br /> <br /> The better points are actually comrade and the other non-firefighting parts of the movie. It's very kitsch, but it's good. I'll give it a point.
