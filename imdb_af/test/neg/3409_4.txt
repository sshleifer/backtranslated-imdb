First, just to say I didn't get the issue I was thinking of - I chose the Italian version of the R2, but what actually arrived was a British edition of 1998 - claiming it's a special issue - I never knew there was a British DVD release - but the promised bios were not really on the disk - just a few duff trailers. Anyway - as far as the movie itself is concerned - just as I have recovered from Night TRain Murders, my second genital mutilation thriller arrives in the same month - this time in (an Italian) British nubile schoolgirl is attacked and teacher Fabio Testi - (unfortunately) married but one of his students nails becomes the main suspect. Joachim Fuchsberger is the detective on the case. Sorry to say I was less than entranced. It was vigilant, but more than just wrong, and apart from the horrific nature of the crime, the "surprising" murder of Cristina Galbo, actually told by the DVD cover, was a spoil to me. Grrrrrr !!!! and a surprise twist that shed the "victims" in a new light - I thought it was very routine. However, it turned me off from the two "persecutors". with Karin (Hannibal Brooks) Baal and Camille (I spit on your grave ") Keaton.
