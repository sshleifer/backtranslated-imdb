The big problem I had with this movie was that Lombard's character, as another user put it, was "unnecessarily cruel". Lombard plays the role of Ann Krausheimer Smith, who believes she is married to David Smith. He played well with the sharp dressed, but pretty clumsy Robert Montgomery. The movie has a few funny moments, especially when Montgomery's character is very trying to get his "wife" back. Understandably, she is upset because marriage is not technically legal, but she finds it only three years. <br /> <br /> Lombard's character looks rather cold for her husband's sincere efforts to woo her back. Although Montgomery is not highly skilled, Montgomery is still visibly affectionate, yet Lombard is as cool as a yacht player. There are almost no clues that suggest any kind of reconciliation between the war couple for many of the movie, and it's hard to see any kind of comedy - even dark comedy - in that aspect. To some extent, the film is almost a sadistic undertone, with Lombard's character "kicking" her husband's poor efforts. While one can consider this other 'Battle of the Gender' type of film, the reality is that it is a highly fought battle, if it: Montgomery's character, while definitely wrong, is not enough to make it a typical example of the male chauvinist / misogynistic (an excellent example of this is Michael Douglas in 'War of the Roses'). In fact, the character is largely effeminate, as evidenced not only by the sharp Montgomery dress (which is probably largely due to the constantly sharp dressed actor himself), but also to his discomfort to try - but not to the role of " a female bachelor. His only big mistake is his vanity, but the error does not balance with his partner's excessive cruelty. And there is no suggestion that she try to enter any jealousy from subconscious love. It makes it so cruel and sad. Montgomery's character simply looks weak. In fact, no woman would want a man so bad unless she wore the pants. But again, a woman wearing the pants in a marriage will never be so cruel, as she has already confirmed that role early. That's why the whole theme looks strange. This film is not a champion of feminism (Lombard's character shows signs of the kind of independent woman of the 60's, but the idea is soon stopped and the character falls back in the 1940s), not a random battle of the sexes (as Montgomery's character is actually a masculine witness and therefore a lost cause). <br /> <br /> This movie is a slapstick on the surface, but under that veneer it is much darker, with sadistic undertones. All that makes her decision look good, strange. (Maybe it was strange that the whole point was?). Anyway, slapstick this movie is not.
