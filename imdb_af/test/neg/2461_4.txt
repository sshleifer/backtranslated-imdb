It's about as pretentious a movie as a level director like Joel Schumacher can make, I think. A group of medical students take it for a few minutes to die; In revival, they discover that their sins have been manifested somehow. As some of the characters are visited by dead people, and some are hunted by their guilty conscience, it's not quite clear what the connection is, but the visions look like the sixth form of art films. Why the students treat their experiment, as some great journey they make known is a bit of a secret, because the results are completely untouchable and, as the movie has mentioned several times, has been documented many times. Still, it's nice to see Schumacher practicing for his Batman train wrecks with a bit of old neon paint and colored light bulbs. And William Baldwin is a shelf.
