"Glen of Glenda" was Edward D. Wood Jr's first attempt to direct a feature film. For this he chose a topic and chose close to his heart ... transvestism, the art of a man wishing to dress in women's clothing. For his credit, Wood tried to deal with the topic that was largely taboo in 1953. Unfortunately, wood did not have the budget, nor how to make the film. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a prologue by Bela Lugosi makes little sense and then moves to the discovery of a dead transvestite Glen / Glenda (Daniel Davis aka Ed Wood). Inspector Warren (Lyle Talbot), with the help of psychiatrist Dr. Alton (Timothy Farrell) is trying to understand why a man wants to live (and die) this way. <br /> <br /> Glen is engaged to Barbara (Dolores Fuller) and is reluctant to tell her about his obsession. And that's it. We see endless footage pictures of anything from highway traffic to shore-based soldiers, between the shots of Wood wearing the same street as Glen or Glenda, and looking desperately at women's clothes in a shop window. Poor old Bela, who was on his luck and was friends with Wood, kept the whole story going. I'm not 100% sure, but I think Bela's scene was added for his name value after the movie of the movie was completed. <br /> <br /> To add to the confusion of Lugosi's narrative, Farrell as dr. Alton also provides screen narration. Lugosi continues to say, preserve, preserve ... carefully, carefully, and a little gibberish about snakes and snails and puppy's tails. <br /> <br /> The story also deals with a transvestite that has a successful sex change operation and tries to explain the difference between that person and Wood's character (s). The dream sequence is laughing. A wedding in which someone is dressed like the devil appears is a good example. Wood also gives us an apparent rape scene with the actors (?) Fully dressed, but leaves the imagination, risqu√© for 1953. <br /> <br /> This movie, along with Wood's other "classic", was so bad that they have become embraced by the public as cult classic over the years. For this reason, they survived to this day.
