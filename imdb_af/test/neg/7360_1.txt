This review contains spoilers. I had no expectations about this movie. I pulled it out of the video store rack with the movie "White Noise". <br /> <br /> First, the credits for this silly movie run for about 5 minutes. The pacing from start to finish is slooooow. The main heroines don't like wearing a bra and the director seems to enjoy the jiggle effect when Anna Paquin walks off the stairs. If you like movies for boobies, this one has a low level buzz factor. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it is nice that the movie of elements of Lovecraft and other horror skips genre mechanisms, but at better movies there is at least some rational or consistent irrational behavior. This stinker tries to establish a sense of modernity and reality, but then you have situations where no one calls the police, although they have exposed a treasure trove of potentially incriminating forensic evidence, and other worldly rituals are well spelled out in a comprehensive book on the worldwide rituals like on Buffy. I waited for Miles to show up and give advice on how to kill a certain type of pigeon like that. <br /> <br /> The premise is that it is possible to open an age of darkness where creatures that creep on the ceiling can cut your throat or cause the meat to grind effect on you. Ho hum. To do this you must have a sacrificial circle and then have seven children who cut their throat through people who love them. It opens the world to the age of darkness. At least this is what it says in full detail in the book of ancient occult rituals. What raises the annoying question, how did the people who wrote the book know, and if so, would you really leave this information in a book you can get from the library, the less it gets from " a library in a world that has not already been covered in darkness, a lunatics age, which could have been used earlier by the "Occult Practices to Darken the World for Stupid, 2nd Edition" . It seems the father is in the story of the 7th child, the one who ran away from the ritual 40 years ago; He was released by his father, who is the doctor / grandfather in the movie, who wanted to try the ritual with presumably other dumb parents, who just wanted to see if it was dumb like the opening of the world to darkness really works. The grandfather let the father go because he didn't really like him. Aduh. Stupid silly movie written by a moronic director who apparently thinks he's a kind of Eurofilm author. There is also a scene in the movie where the child appears with big wheels on his face and the mother grabs him and has the total lack of response. The whole movie is like that. People who really look strange continue and do not respond to any kind of normal way. Must be a bad plot and direction. <br /> <br /> Anna Paquin does her best to play her character realistically without breaking a smirk, and she looks in a dumbbell top, but at several critical moments in the story, her character doesn't save call back. You know, more of the same, "I'll run into a probable demonic evil situation without any knowledge of defense or help from others who carry flashes or fires, although I see the impending punishment." And even stupid as it may seem, even if you bring the age of darkness, these creatures that make you bloody cannot attack if you have a light source, but they appear as people you know and say you're the Light Source . Remind me of the video game "Alone In The Dark"; Perhaps this movie is a ripe of the game's concept. <br /> <br /> The best actors in the film are the young child and Anna. They die at the end. The whole family dies. The dark creatures lead them to their deaths, but really, the stupidity of the characters in the family was the main cause of death. The other adults can exchange with any other actor from the Red School magazine's fine theater series. <br /> <br /> To turn around, the worst thing about this movie is the stupidity of the characters who are blindly bumping around. an obvious abnormal situation, the real crap plot (there is an old architect in the story who designs a house with a sacrificial altar hidden in it - the architect suspected from the beginning that there were occult sacrifices in the house but don't tell anyone because, well, no real reason, they couldn't get the kids, but he didn't bother to tell the authorities about the HIDDEN ROOMs he designed in the house, but he love hanging the house for a period of 40 years because he is worried about what is going to happen inside ... then the frightening mechanisms are used (more children standing in the dark or just in photos and blood in the background) and the director's egoism when you see him In the DVD attributes that describe his crap work as a new and original version, you can understand where the real horror of this movie lies. /> <br /> Is it entertaining? At 2x speed on a DVD player with the evil Enabled headers can be entertained until you reach the end and realize the movie is shit, otherwise it turns up. The film-like equivalent of a fatty shake; The empty calories are horrible. <br /> <br /> The film gives the impression that the director "The Ring" should have seen and wanted to try to create something similar in the mood, which in this respect failed the movie, and yes, even in this respect , Jaume Balaguer√≥, it is my opinion that you suck about what you do.
