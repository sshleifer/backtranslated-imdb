Although this movie's trailer and poster implies that Sally Hemmings was an important character, I might not have been so shocked to discover she was just a minor (and I mean Minor) character if this movie is supposed to be by Sally's own. tell family! I mean, if you tell the story of a family member who has been ignored through history, would you really tell the man who darkened her on the main character? His other lover (who turns white) as the real love interest? I know I won't! I am as pale as they normally are a big fan of Merchent ~ Ivory flicks, but I can't do the film's treatment of poor Sally Hemmings.
