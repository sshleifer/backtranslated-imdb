This movie has sucked so many levels! Have you ever seen the dentist? This film made The Dentist like a masterpiece. I don't recommend this movie to anyone, unless of course you really really really get bored, then maybe. It was so meager. The killer reminds you of the grandfather of the monsters, except he has goggles. When Jessica said, "I want you to meet someone, my inner bitch, I thought she was kicking his butt, but all she did was a dirty-garbage bin on him. The crying scene about her woman, i felt the pain behind his tears ......... NOT !!!!! So before watching this movie, grab a blanket and a pillow, get comfortable because it is very relaxing.
