Oh dear, dear! What do they think? Terrible script, terrible acting. I don't even feel sorry for the actors ... they took their checks to the bank and listened happily. <br /> <br /> Since then, an air shaft by Charing Cross fell out on Bank? Why are vehicles left entering the Tower Bridge in the direction of the city when the boom hit? Why is Toringbrug not crowded when the city is evacuated? How does Carlyle dive into a raging torrent .... and survive? I can go on ... and on. <br /> <br /> There is no real sense of urgency in the command room. They might as well wait for the English elf to return to the scene after the tea interval at Lords. <br /> <br /> It says something when I'm waiting for the ad breaks to learn more about eagerly anticipated diarrhea treatment. <br /> <br /> Totally Horrible Trash!
