1st watched 4/30/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-John Waters): Corny Waters-like comedy musical with some funny scenes and good parts, but it didn't make a very valuable experience. John Waters directed this music-filled spoof of the fifties scene with Johnny Depp playing the title role. This movie is very similar to what he did with the 60's spoof "Hairspray", but this one is not as effective. Some of the songs are striking, some of the characters are interesting in their Waters-like way, and the portrayal is good, though sometimes exaggerated. The storyline is similar to the movie "Grease", where there is a good group and a bad group. The bad group guy, Cry Baby, wow is a good group girl. The good girl is then joined to the bad group, but if Cry Baby hurts her, she falls back to the good group. It just ends the way Cry Baby tries to win her back. Now, the one expected in Water's movies is that the bad group doesn't always look that bad and the good group is acting like they have a pile they know. I also saw it in Hairspray. The wacky and goofiness isn't really that much fun in this movie, and it just leaves us feeling that the movie could have been much better. The first appeal of the Johnny Depp character is that he can at one time make one tear roll on his cheek (thus his namesake) and drop the women over the place. It is overused and the basic principle is that the movie is good, but not so good.
