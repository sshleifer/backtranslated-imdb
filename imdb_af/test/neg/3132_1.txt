There is something rotten about this movie, and basically the way it becomes a sinister and twisted character in a hero by exploiting our sympathy with its negligible situation. Sampedro, like many who have lost hope, chooses suicide. The fact that he has been considering it for over 26 years makes his condition worse, but the belief that we have to do what anyone asks, even if it means ending a life, is very wrong. What a contrast to the uplifting example of scientist Stephen Hawkings, who suffered a much worse condition for much longer! Yet, with the morals upside down, the film is in heroic worship, and the people who disagree are painted in simplistic idiotic terms. There is little room for subtle ones especially in meeting with the priest (deliberately manipulating the real life encounter with a much younger priest). In this way I suppose the movie is on the same scale as Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will. The treacherous idea is that everyone should have the right to take their life if they feel they can no longer live. No matter whether you are physically or psychologically damaged, there are people who believe you have the right to choose. The same people will probably make a case for abortion. It's all part of the current tendency to get the suffering or sufferers out of sight, brush it under the mat, Mommy will say it. OK, and we all feel very happy with ourselves. So we go down the slippery road to believe that some live, just not worth living, and then we will decide that some people cannot really decide for themselves, then we will bring the state to them to decide. Adolf Hitler runs straight from the other Oscar contender "der Untergang". Of course, Hitler believes that he does exactly what nature does in the possession of the weak. Under his regime there were forced abortions among the "weaker" tribes, the mentally handicapped were quietly disposed of and the Jews were "humanly" wound up by using gas. He would have applauded this film and why not. with his philosophy ... a few lives just aren't worth living. "I am different from Ramon Sampedro, Hitler and all the people involved in making this movie. Human life is sacred, it's not right, it's a gift and a Nobody chooses to be born. Who can choose death, it's not about religion, it's about protecting the weak and helpless, something this movie does much to undermine!
