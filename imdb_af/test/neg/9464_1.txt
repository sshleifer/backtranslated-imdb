I can't believe I even tried to look at this filth. As a keen B-Horror movie lover, I was more than sounded to the prospect of this movie by popular budget writer Herschell Gordon Lewis. Unfortunately, from the opening of the movie, I couldn't think of a worse movie than my life. Well, maybe Gigli, but I firmly believe that Dr. Gore (The Body Shop) is worse when I think about it. A horrible plot that moves incredibly slowly, the movie goes on with no real horror to speak of. However, I will admit that some scenes are purely hilarious when dr. Gore disputed his golden victims. The camera is zooming in on its excessive, bulky eyes, while this pure soundtrack is all the time to add to the entertainment. I laughed for the better part of 10 minutes. When he erected his "prodigy" child, the movie dropped almost 20 minutes and showed him and his "girlfriend" as he talked to her, then they talked between the goldfish, picnic, and so on. Unfortunately, there is only music playing throughout this fandango with no speech whatsoever. This part of the movie will leave you when you tear your wrists with the dull edge of a butter knife. I want to think almost at the beginning of this movie. If you like bad movies, watch this one.
