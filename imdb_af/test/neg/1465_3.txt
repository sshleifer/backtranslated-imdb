I found it on the shelf and swelled with joy! I danced to the counter, slapped my money and ran home! You know what ?! I fell asleep halfway! Try again the next day ... YAWN !! What is it !! !! I couldn't see it! I love all the other things he did (I didn't see one with the sample in it). What gives? Is this me? Or he? So sad. Boo hoo. PS, I worked like the camera.
