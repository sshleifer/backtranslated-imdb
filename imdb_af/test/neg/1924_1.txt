*** This comment may contain spoilers. *** Warning: it contains spoilers. I saw some nice lame movies in my day. And it's just to see if I see about 80 movies a year. I should say that out of the 80 movies I see at the theater, maybe 5 really good, 15 or 20 is not that good, 40 or 50 is good and then maybe 5 or 10 is absolutely horrible. Here, Earth falls into a category to itself. It's one of the most predictable, fierce, despicable movies I've ever seen. It's loaded with unlikely characters, maudlin situations about post-school special topics and enough fluff here to make the YOUNG AND RESTLESS look like American BEAUTY. And I'm not unfair. It's a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a rich man, a poor girl, a poor guy and a small town who makes fresh cookies every day for all his townspeople. Do you get hot and fuzzy? Let me continue. One day, the rich snot in the town in town with his new graduation ceremony his father bought for him and he insulted the pretty girl at dinner, almost got a fight with her long-time boyfriend and chased him and destroyed him the little dinner she works for. So he is sentenced to a summer in the small town where he and the boyfriend have to prepare the food together. What this means is giving us enough opportunity to see Chris Klein without a shirt so we can understand why the girl would fall for him at dinner. He has abs !!! Oh, and he's rich !!! And .... he's the biggest jerk with no respect for anyone. He is James Dean, he is a rebel who doesn't give a damn !! He is rude to everyone in town, he does not want to associate with someone who is nice to him and he acts like a spoiled rich brat. But Leelee Sobieski still falls for him. There is no reason why she does it, she does. Oh, forgive me, that's right, I forgot to mention that he likes the same poet she's doing. Well, if it doesn't make you wet, I don't know what it is. <br /> <br /> Here on Earth also have some of the most predictable moments I've ever participated in in film. There was one point when I left the theater to get popcorn and read the graffiti on the bathroom wall and I told my fianc√© exactly what was going to happen in the next ten minutes. On my return she just laughed and said I was right, even when I said there was going to be a dancing scene. And further, the disease she is contracting suddenly is cancer. This is the most beautiful cancer patient I've ever seen. Have you ever seen a cancer patient die slowly? They lose weight, they lose their hair, start to rot their gums. It's not a pretty picture. Sobieski is glowing after she goes on cancer, as she is pregnant. What an insult to people who have looked at love slowly dies of this disease. And how do you contract knee cancer to fall into the veld? <br /> <br /> Now I realize I've seen too many movies, and sometimes my cynicism ripens, but it's ridiculous. There was not one thing to like about this movie or the Chris Klein character. He's a while, he's unpleasant and he never tries to make peace with anyone around him. Here on earth is not just a bad movie, it's an irresponsible one. It received a 4.2 on the IMDb voting card, which is too high. It is an embarrassment for writing screens and anyone who has given the green light to make it should not only lose their jobs, but he or she should never promise to walk a step closer to writing. no. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10, and it's generous. This film must be shown at film schools as how not to write and write a movie. <br /> <br /> If you are bored and really need something to do, and your choices clean a farm full of cow fist or watch it, choose to clean the cow dung. It will smell better and you will feel like you've done something good with you two hours.
