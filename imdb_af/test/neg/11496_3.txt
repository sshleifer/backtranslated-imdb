I recently hired this promising mini-series, I didn't even know they had adapted it to television. I really looked forward to the book. Icon is one of the best spies I've ever read. What a disappointment it was. The plot just looks nice like the one in the book, the characters are completely disregarded and there is a little scary. A shame is really. The story behind Icon is ideal for the silver screen, but I think television budgets are just not big enough for a decent adaptation of this spectacular book. <br /> <br /> Providing a lot, much better than that. Avoid and stick to the book, which is a must-read.
