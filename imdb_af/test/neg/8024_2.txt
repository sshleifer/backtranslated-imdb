It's funny ... one day before I saw this movie, I watched a documentary about Leni Riefenstahl, such a comparison came automatically ... of course there is no :) <br /> <br /> This movie is poor in every aspect ... acting is not convincing (especially the one that Simona plays ...) and unnatural ..., in the confusing editing and always a taste of unfinished shot, music does not fit, the story does not flow, it gets boring and the movie comes out much longer as it is ... o, and the characters are not very well shown, you can't really tell a lot of the girls (except what you see). .. The movie also tries to shock with explicit curse (which is very nice :) <br /> <br /> So ... 2/10
