Charles Bronson gave the viewers very good moments on the screen. But this movie doesn't have everything a thriller / action movie should have. There are some action scenes in the movie, but they are really crappy. And when the action scenes fail, does the story save the movie? That is not my answer at all. The story is even worse than the action scenes. It is very straight and boring, and although I am a big movie fan, I almost fell asleep a few times. I don't know how they turned up with such a failure. A low budget, maybe? Regardless, it seemed that all the actors didn't have the film at all. If that happens, the result is really bad.
