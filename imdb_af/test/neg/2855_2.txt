This movie is not stupid. Don't bother to look at it; believe me, you are better off. <br /> <br /> Long and short of the plot: A defense attorney represents a man who killed his son and other children. To defend him, she comes across a wooden doll from Pinnochio. She took the doll home. Pinnochio is busy killing people. <br /> <br /> This movie moves very slowly just to have such a bad end. The plot is very bad and Dennis Michael Tenney's musical score is unfortunate. The story, written by Kevin S. Tenney, is just useless and does NOT call any horror or fear. It's far from working on Night of the Demons and Witchboard, which is decent outings but nothing to write home about. His direction is good, but with such a bad story no one could have made this movie good. <br /> <br /> Finally: 2 out of 10, perhaps the most boring, most boring movie I've seen all year.
