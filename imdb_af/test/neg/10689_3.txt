Given the budget and the inexperience of everyone involved, Livin 'tha Life could have been worse. Jamal wants to be Chris Tucker (who I've always found very annoying), as a previous commentator noticed, but Peanut (Edward D. Smith), while some of his (over) responses go too long (a director's problem ), has some relatively subtle and funny moments, such as when instructing Jamal about the right way to smoke a joint relationship with a partner. Throughout, he is usually more ready and self-possessed than Jamal, who could have been the boon of a good exploration of the contrasts in the relationship, but has not developed very far. <br /> <br /> But the inexperience of the writer / director / filmographer / etc. is no excuse for his inattention. Has he ever seen a movie? Faces are important! Did he ever hear of a close-up? Even Ed Wood could do a close-up. I don't think it's much of a budget issue. I could just give a general description of what any of the actors look like, and not just because of no closeups, but the lighting ...! Outdoor shooting lights can cost too much, but you can make a reflector with pieces of paper! It would have required moving the camera closer to keep the reflector out of the lap, to solve the proximity problem at the same time. If it's too technical, you can turn the actors over so they aren't in the shade, or you can expose the shadows, and if not in L.A. shot, I will use cloudy days. It goes without saying that the movies you steal are all possible, with the exception of Bernie's Weekend, better than that, but Livin 'tha Life would have left a much better impression if it didn't pinch the viewer off the road just to get a glimpse of what the human element might have been. <br /> <br /> PS The scene in the barber shop is just stupid.
