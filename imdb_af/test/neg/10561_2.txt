Maybe as if just laughing at the way my favorite of Jane Austen's works is portrayed. Maybe I'm too serious about this adjustment, but I'm afraid I'm biased for the A&E version. I have a hard time getting mr. Suggest Darcy featured by anyone other than Colin Firth. <br /> <br /> The characters were level and often forced. Lizzy looked the real feel so clear in the book. Her desire for Wickham is overplay, and then suddenly, as for Darcy, her credibility was not. <br /> <br /> Darcy is well shown, I will allow him. He managed to maintain the discretion needed, but I felt he didn't project the feeling and inner struggle that made his character so enjoyable, especially in the proposal scene. <br /> <br /> Mr. and mrs. Bennet was also well-played, but lacked in many ways. The mad temper of Mrs. Bennet is not completely captured in her performance. <br /> <br /> Mr. Collins' was a good portrayal. Very in line with the book. <br /> <br /> I will refrain from commenting on Lady Catherine, except to say that she may be the worst depiction in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Other problems I saw were the few freedoms they took with the sequence of events like Darcy was present at the first meeting with Lady C. And also that. Lucas and Sir William did not join Lizzy at her visit to the Collins. <br /> <br /> The choreography was terrible during the dance screens. The scene where Lizzy and Darcy dance loses much of its intensity, because one cannot get past the feeling that they are looking aquatic on the ballroom floor. At least this BBC version left the dialogue between Lizzy, Darcy and Sir William when he praised the two for their dance, because they were indeed very ill. <br /> <br /> Occasionally there were moments that kept me, but overall I find this version a disappointment. I would not recommend this movie unless you are like me and you are excessively distracted by such foolishness. <br /> <br />
