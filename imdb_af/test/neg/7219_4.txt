Let me start by saying that you know a movie is poorly executed when extras make the cover. Having said that, anyone who says it is the worst movie ever is dramatic, and anyone who says the movie is big is completely outrageous. The movie "is what it is." And what is it ... A modest budget ($ 4 million, I estimate) studio successor. The movie is not terrible, but for Road House fans it will be a disappointment. And that brings me to problem one, just as Dirty Dancing wouldn't be what it was without Swayze, Road House isn't the same without it. The lead has depth, character and equivalence to carry the movie. I felt the lead was poorly cast and the producers had to bend backwards to get Patrick to do so if they did a successor. The other team was uneven with outstanding actors such as Will Patton next to players of the day who could not act out of a paper bag. Busey, what I saw, looked good characters as if he had just submitted it. Ellen was well played, except that he was not credible at all as a Bayou child. Sherri, the DEA agent at the first bar was hot and a good actress, but her part was uncomfortably small and undeveloped. The writer missed all the opportunities to add depth and interest to the story and characters. Instead, you choose a base one-dimensional movie. What leads me to the biggest problem, the writing ... I had a bad feeling when the credits rolled and there were three writers separated by a "and" and a ". It looks a lot of amateur. And that's what The writing was, I heard the original script was better and then a rewrite was done and the hard core was sucking in. A few shaky parts of the movie to watch, are ... handy drug deal under the table. "Shark can meet up with a crowded dessert bar, I'll pull a block of cooks out of my jacket and you pull out cash and we'll move them under the sundowner. WAIT! "Make sure you look cool when you look left and right to make sure nobody looks!" Secondly, I love it when someone is shot in the chest and then you see him 10 minutes later as a lion. There are some nasty editing cuts to the end of the movie especially during battle scenes and when the main character is chasing the doors and walking in a patron. What brings me to the reality of the DEA training, I won't get both technical ... But jumping through the doors is not standard training. Also not typical female agents brushing their buttocks to make it into a man not oriented field, acting like weak characters ... Drilling! Thanks for the chauvinist view. There are other things I could learn about a course at a school about it ... The battles, the disgusting dialogue, the recycled story ... etc. ... But besides everything you just can't keep from ex-mr. Applegate, he completely lacks the humble zen coolness that Mr. Patrick Swayze made such a bad ass. He hits me like one of the 5 foot actors who think they are a bad ass, but like Van Damnit he runs into a very bad ass (Chuck Zito in Van Do not case) and gives a lesson on bathing stuff. "Therefore, what I feel is the main linchin of the movie, if you're a bad ass, you're a bad ass, you don't have to try. Example: Swayze! If you're a pretty boy who's hard to try to prove you're a bad ass ... Then good ... You're why you heard, the average Joe ... Won't rent this movie, and if they do they will write reviews like this.
