This German horror movie should be one of the strangest things I've seen. <br /> <br /> I wasn't aware of any connection between child abuse and vampirism, but it's supposed to be based on a true character. <br /> <br /> Our hero is deaf and dumb because of repeated reports in the hands of his father. He also has a pop fetish, but I can't figure out where it came from. His co-workers find him terribly annoying. <br /> <br /> During the day there is a moderate accountant and at night he breaks into cemeteries and funeral homes and drinks the blood of dead girls. They are all attractive, of course, otherwise we will not care that he usually tore their clothes up in the middle. He eventually graduated to actually kill, and that's what caught him. <br /> <br /> As I said, a very funny movie that is dark and very slow as Werner Pochath never speaks and spends only his time drinking blood.
