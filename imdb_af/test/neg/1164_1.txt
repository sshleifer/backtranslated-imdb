This is the worst movie I have ever seen and I believe I have a very bad movie. I love Cheeesy horror, but it was just awful. There was not one scene in this movie where I felt scared. All the actors had to be people who found them at a bus stop 20 minutes before the shooting. I wish Blockbutser would give me 99 cents back. The acting was terrible. The writing was incredibly bad. Someone had to screen this movie before it was released and had to know it was terrible. I would be ashamed to have my name related to this monstrosity. Don't rent this movie. If you do, don't give it back, and no other poor will ever make the mistake of renting it.
