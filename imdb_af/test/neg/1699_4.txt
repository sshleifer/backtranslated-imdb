If you are a Catalan nationalist anarchosocialist with unspoken respect for the myths of the Spanish Republic, this movie can be for you. Two brothers, the real people (one of whom is Marc Recha himself), re-enact a fictitious version of a real journey made by the spectacular Catalan countryside, and history is being evoked (pans with ball walls, artillery trees on the soundtrack), but not shown. There is very little dialogue, and most of it happens to be: the story is told in a third person voice-over, the voice is that of an actress portraying the real sister of the real brothers. The images have little to do with what story line there is, which is not much. Many are beautiful, breeding pans over bright semi-arid mountains and rivers (think Terrence Malick or Gus Van Sant - there's not a bit of both Gerry and Last Days here), with some amazing still images and motionless frames. It is best enjoyed in the wonderful natural sound environment of the film and without the ultimate boring narrative or even occasional background music (some pretty good, a bit odd, but all worth it). The best part of this movie is said in these sequences, with their occasional comment-less inclusion of power stations and dams. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the brothers is sketchy and generic; A main character is a man-biting catfish, never shown. The more the director's Catalan nationalist anargo commitments are portrayed, the more the film's richer, unspoken message is subverted and the more annoying the narcissistic experience becomes. Although the director said during the NYFF show that the movie was discovered with his third-person story from the beginning, I would like to see a version of it without the narrative or the music and just the natural soundtrack and the minimalist dialogue - The result may be more moving, and would not be as much baffling anyway. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, this is probably the only movie you will see this year in which a man in the frame is wearing a cloth object (the bathing suit he wore?) hanging from his penis. It's one of the few moments in the whole movie where your interest (sorry) is hit by something that actually happens on the screen (what is it? Why does it hang there?), But as usual no answers are provided. Many Warholian, many sixties, and not a little tiring.
