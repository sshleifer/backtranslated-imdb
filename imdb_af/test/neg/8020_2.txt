It is a poor merger of just about everything: refugees, relations between Croatia and Slovenia, globalization, sexual orientation. A very cumbersome metaphor about Slovenia that is at the crossroads between its past, symbolized by everything that "virgin" becomes queen of the household and its future, which is symbolized by listening to music in clubs and being lesbian and never have children. <br /> <br /> It plays on a fairly recent Slovenian legend that has a virgin and a "forest king" that takes the form of a goat (Zlatorog Beer's images are also based on the legend), but Unfortunately, the treatment is very incoherent. Weiss seems to think the end justifies the means: she can use all sorts of "dreamy" rows, and then choose which one is true and true. How can the jeep ride with the "Bush King" for all three girls really be, but the scene outside the tent is actually only in Simona's imaginary? The end time just pulls on and off (I can't believe the movie's duration is just 98 minutes, I watched a director's cut without knowing it?). The three girls should look at the camera for about 10 seconds as they look scared and happy at the same time (so obvious). <br /> <br /> I never thought I could do badly in a movie whose language I didn't understand, but it didn't take long to see that "Simona" is mostly overworked, as if in playing a quiet movie. <br /> <br /> It wasn't that bad, because I thought the director just started and wanted to find out what she was thinking She thought her generation did everything on film by doing a semi-experimental movie, until I realized that the director was actually 37 years old when she made the movie and that her work was probably 'serious'.
