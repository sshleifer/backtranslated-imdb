I watched this movie at the Edinburgh Film Festival and would not recommend it. It is two and a half hours long, during which there is not much happening. The main characters are gormless and lacking in charisma or personality. Nobody smiles at all during the film (I don't want to have their life as well) and although Domino has a healthy sexual appetite, it doesn't seem like having sex. <br /> <br /> The whole experience is depressed and overwhelming, the director wandering around every scene in a way that has gotten me crazy, rather than beating me to the beauty of his technique. <br /> <br /> Too many questions left in my mind: why does he cut the Algerian man's head? Why does he live? What does he look at about the award fence? Why does he kiss Joseph? Why did we go to see this garbage rather than order another bottle of wine in Bouzy Rouge?
