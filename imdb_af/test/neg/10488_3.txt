All right, it's awful, and I mean it's very easy to disassemble this movie. C'mmon, what do you expect with the title, synopsis and role players such as Carol Gilley, Ralph Baker Jr., Dorothy Davis, Bill Thurman and my personal favorite, Roger Ready. Yes, B-star John Agar is here as a sheriff to get rid of the Texan landscape of a robotic monkey from a NASA experiment. The movie has terrible performances, terrific scenery, terrific special effects and terrible lighting. I can't really say much good about it, because if bad movies go, you can do much worse if it finds something terrible to go through. It's short-lived and has many moments of unintentional humor. Failed clues, lighting screen display, screen scare, an incredible curse, and of course, John Agar are trying to be the best of the movie, with a serious display amid this muck. The start is the hardest part to go through, as it seems to be needed for these two teens forever to get to the bushes along the Texas back roads, where a great monkey will soon revenge will deliver its own terrible way ... Yeah right! Nagskrik! Bah!
