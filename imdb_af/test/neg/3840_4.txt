Like most of this movie, I did it for the stars Michael Madsen and Dennis Hopper. The two are much underestimated and unfortunately, therefore, many shit should be heading. In this movie, Hopper plays a man who accidentally kills an extortionist and is assisted by the mysterious Madsen. <br /> <br /> The movie isn't really as horrible as it could have been. I both worked much worse, both independently and together (LAPD, horrible movie). The direction was pretty poor and the writing needed some revised, but both provided the best possible performance with the material being offered. Also the end is pretty strong, so you can say the story has potential. But if a filming review of a movie, it might be much worse, it doesn't say much for the movie itself. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's one that can be easily skipped. if none of these actors enter you. But if you are a fan of one or both, give it a watch. They both give strong performances that overshadow the obvious flaws of the film. Trust me, there are many worse options out there.
