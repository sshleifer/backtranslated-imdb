When I became a father only 5 years ago, I was ready for many of the sacrifices I had to make. I knew I had to change diapers, take swimming lessons and attend many fears of Santa Claus parade, but I wasn't ready for the kind of sacrifice I made last night. It is cruel and unusual punishment in my humble opinion. <br /> <br /> Underdog is bad. It's not quite Karate Dog, but it makes the Shaggy Dog like Pulp Fiction. If Underdog was a television program, I would recommend turning it over. Not even the presence of Puddy and the voice of Banky Edwards can save it. Bend. Wow. <br /> <br /> It was just about the best 80 minutes I ever enjoyed. James was on my right and Michelle on the left, and I spent more time watching their response to this talking pilot than watching the screen. By 5 and 3 years old they were the target audience, and this movie nailed the target. There is a scene where Underdog looks hard at other dogs and Michelle thought it was the funniest scene ever captured on film. When Underdog flies into outer space, James was literally hypnotized on the side of his seat. The kids absolutely loved Underdog, and that's why I was there. This is what goes on last night. <br /> <br /> Unless you accompany someone under the age of ten, you have no business to waste a second of your life, watch this brutal movie. But if you want to kill 80 minutes with your four-year-old, I won't judge. I had an explosion.
