O God! It can be a very interesting movie and it really is. I'd like to give it, but I give a 2 for my vote. Why? I saw it in a theater! Watch this movie on DVD or on TV! The shooting is really scarce !!!!! It keeps a completely tasteless framework! <br /> <br /> Seeing this very interesting movie in a theater is really painful. You've quickly become seasick and you have to take a lot of trouble not to hit your neighbors' seats! <br /> <br /> It's really a shame because the story is edited in a non-linear way. It's pretty scarce (and a very good idea!) For a documentary. <br /> <br /> Watch it at home!
