Not Misunderstood as the Highly Designated Samuel L. Jackson Vehicle SNAKES ON A PLANE; SNAKES ON A TRAIN is a low budget, has no actors (to talk about), but some pretty decent visual effects. An attractive young woman (Julia "Rayanne" Ruiz) doesn't want to marry her husband with anyone's choice; so she is under a powerful Mayan curse that hatches snakes in her body, slowly swallowing from the inside. Her only hope for survival is a shaman living across the border in Texas. Time runs out for her; and she is on a train from El Paso to Los Angeles. Earlier, the snakes leave her pain-relieved body and grow it fast. The passengers on board the train are now trapped and will soon be snacks for the snakes. The final race is undoubtedly the best of this 91 minute movie. Also acting acting credit: Alby Castro, Al Galvez and Giovanni Bejarno.
