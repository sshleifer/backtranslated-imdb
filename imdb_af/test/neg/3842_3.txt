At times when I watch this movie, I start thinking that the people who made this movie were on drugs. What's wrong with this movie, I'll tell you bad plot, bad jokes. Better handy and flat-out characters, everything is just bad. br /> <br /> The film is about Pest Vargas, a two-bit swindler who gets the chance to get $ 50,000 to survive 24 hours by a German hunter who kills people for life. So Pest must think of ways to think out, think this hunter before being killed. <br /> <br /> I know what your thinking "What the hell is that?" another wannabe Ace Ventura trying to get money, really this plot is just boring and confusing at times it changes the story and you get lost during the movie. <br /> <br /> Regarding the funny scenes, this movie has a straight face oh yes, I laughed a few times but nothing laughs out loud. Except for the jokes, it is thin and seen before it looks like Ace Ventura meets Dumb and Dumber, but bad. <br /> <br /> As far as character development is concerned, it is dry and flat. You don't learn much about the main character. Pest everything you know is that it is an annoying scam, but it doesn't change its image or is a bit smart just corny.as for the German hunter all you are crazy and wants to go back to Germany. Really you start wondering why this man is on an island, if he has money to go to Germany. The hunter's son, Himmel, is getting better, but not much. He is really a coward and is snake-obsessed for reasons at the end. He stood up to his father and sides with plague. <br /> <br /> As far as the play is concerned, Nly there was an unforgettable perforation, but just over the top. For example, John Legizomo is so over the top with performance and does not fit in his role, but he does not accommodate Jeffery Jones who plays the hunter the same thing, but gives a stereotypical performance as well as the rest, or not enough , or just over it. <br /> <br /> Overall bad comedy that you find at K-Mart for $ 2.00.
