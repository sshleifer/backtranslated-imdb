Forced, cloying, formulaic. Do these adjectives say you want to run to rent his rent? Miriam Hopkins was brilliant in the original "Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde." A few other early movies of her, especially "The Story of Temple Drake," are never shown, but said it was excellent. <br /> <br /> Here, they are cuddly, bushy and thoroughly unattractive. Ray Milland as a Greeniwch Village bohemian, not convincing at all. <br /> <br /> The two child performers are creepy and also have no connection with the town as it was at that time. <br /> <br /> Speaking as a native of Greenwich Village, I find the environment ersatz, generic and phony. Not that I was around for a few generations, but my family was there in 1937. It's not funny. It's not remote. We don't care about the characters. <br /> <br /> At this time, so many movies were made and done with the struggling masses versus the capitalists. "Easy Living" comes into consideration. It didn't happen in town. But it is very true. It rings with a bell.
