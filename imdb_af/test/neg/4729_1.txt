Against my own better judgment I was going to see this movie today and God wishes I didn't. Awful. The first AVP movie looks like a classic compared to this, it's so bad. These guys actually make Paul WS Anderson a master narrator. In fact, that's what I expect an Alien and / or Predator movie will look like if it's made by Uwe Boll! This movie has actually insulted me, and Lord only knows what would happen if Ridley Scott or HR Giger were ever forced to see this piece of shit. I can't understand how any fan or franchise can keep this movie. <br /> <br /> Surely I don't know where to start. I mean, the first AvP was shit, but it is at least a semi-interesting story and setting, and sometimes some real stress. It has not taken itself too seriously and can at least be semi-enjoyed in a pure way to leave your brain at home. But this one felt like the people behind it thought they were making the next horror masterpiece. One after another was a confronted 'spectacular' scene in a dark room or hallway with a terrible musical play, basically pinching your head and saying, "Be scared." As James Cameron once said, you can't be scared to be scared, you can only raise your own senses. The guys who made this movie of course did not pay attention because they tried everything in the book to force you to be scared, rather than getting yourself. It's a clich√© for internetnerds to say, "God, I was so bored of this movie and felt like leaving." Well, that's exactly how I felt, even in the middle of the action scenes. They took this movie quite seriously, which removed any possibility of enjoyment. Even the gag about how governments don't lie to their people is thought without irony. <br /> <br /> As far as the characters are concerned, I knew that the human characters would be completely useless film but seriously if they were going to be on the screen, they should at least do something relevant to the story. I don't care that this guy is being beaten by his three-child boyfriend, I don't care for the mother whose own daughter doesn't even know her, boo-hoo! (a pair of night goggles for a gift? Give me a break!) or the released criminal just trying to make a decent life and set an example for his brother, what a guy. Hell, even the mandatory hot-chick-in-panties moment was more confronted than usual. I get the feeling that they have expected the audience to be so shocking at the end, as well as that breasts come from children, expectant mothers are raped and the like, it will make everything up. I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Then we move to the stars of the movie, and again very little to write about the house. Were the strangers well designed? I will not have an idea, because you can never see the damn things. All you see is one of a mouth, a head, a tail or a very dodgy cg outline that climbs a wall and barely enough to actually process it to be a stranger before mr. "I cut Marilyn Manson and NIN music videos, I think I'll do the same thing here." The editor goes with the cutter. Also note how hack action directors make their movies at night and in the rain? Hmmmm. The Predator had already known to fight giant monkeys! Yes, the Predator was more impressive this time, and I thought some of the new weapons were cool, but it was about it. Also, since when did a Predator sound like a dinosaur from The Lost World? There were a few things I liked. One was using sound effects and music from the original movies (I also giggled a bit on "Get to the helicopter!"), Although other references were dumb (the main character's name is Dallas, give me a break ). I also liked the visual FX for the Predator's vision, as well as how the hybrid looked alien (surely one of the resurrection). But really, these are the only positive things. Overall, I experienced this movie, useless, insulting and above all offensive to the vision of the original creators of both beings. That they left the door open for another, almost depressed me. <br /> <br /> If they were any good, they would remove Dan O'Bannon, Ron Schusett and HR Giger from the credits of this movie. They did nothing to earn it.
