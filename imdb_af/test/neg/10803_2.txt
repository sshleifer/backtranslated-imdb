The plot of this movie is dangerously thin and the only "star power" if we can call it Joe Estevez. I don't know what is more shocking. The fact that this film was made or the fact that some people actually commented on it. If you ever see the cover of the video, you can read it. Someone even went so far that the actress / writer could be the leading lady of the 90's. Yes! And Joe Estevez can have more money than his brother Martin. If you want to get it done, I strongly recommend watching the MTS version of it. At least you'll laugh a lot without going insane.
