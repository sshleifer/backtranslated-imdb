I thought the movie had an interesting name and could only have thought, but I was wrong. This film is boring, especially in the early and middle parts. I can't comment on the end because I couldn't just watch the whole movie. The point of signing a student researcher just because he goes into your lab doesn't make sense. This student had an interesting kind of moving robot in his apartment and unfortunately this non-living thing is more interesting than the characters in this movie. So if you're having trouble sleeping, I encourage you to rent this movie.
