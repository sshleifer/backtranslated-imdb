... I can't believe there are actually people here who recommend this movie ... It's such a slow POS that doesn't go anywhere. Oh yes, it's going somewhere, but you see it coming from miles away. Acting: Really really bad, maybe the bartender was kind of OK. Edit: BAD! I think the editor said, "We need at least 90 minutes," because half of the screens could have gone into the bin. Music: Don't Start Me, The Lustiest Score I've Ever Heard. Who is the song in the last scene crying out loud? Directed: oh me, IMNSHO David Lynch sucks, but someone who tries to copy him struggles even harder. Skip this one.
