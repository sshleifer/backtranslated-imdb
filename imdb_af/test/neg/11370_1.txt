Director Jeremiah Checheck, who brought our big budget debates like The Avengers and the remakes of Diabolique, did this ripoff of the Die Hard concept. It looks like a Blair Witch budget. <br /> <br /> A California nuclear reactor is dominated by Arab terrorists. But - are you right? - the terrorists are not Arabic; they are really dissatisfied with American soldiers who are destroyed as Arabs! We find that they are not really planning to blow up the reactor, just make a statement. We are not sure what the statement is, but never mind. So there's really no threat. But then one of the terrorists decides to go it alone and actually blow the plant because he's crazy. So maybe there is a threat. But the army goes in and all the bad guys are dead. So there was no threat. Oh, and a good man is also murdered. Let it be a lesson for everyone. <br /> <br /> If it all looks different and wastes so much time, then you have the idea of ​​what Meltdown is going to look like. <br /> <br /> The writer never disturbs the characters or even gives personal details that can drive them out or engage the audience emotionally. So, we are left with one dimensional characters: the expert-that-no-one-to-listen; the trigger-happy sergeant; the-slimy politicians; the-dweeby Engineers. The story jumps from one cliché incident to the next in a formula composed of virtually every action movie you've ever seen. But almost every turn, just when we think there might be something in the game, the writing falls and we find that there is really nothing to worry about. <br /> <br /> Like Die Hard, there is a police officer on the inside, unbenownst to the bad guys. The big quarrel is that the policeman is here .... A WOMAN! Oh, and she's also injured. But not so bad, just enough to drop her a few times. Oh, and instead of the walkie talkie that Bruce Willis had this cop, a magic cellphone works everywhere ... even underground! When he doesn't shout for everyone else, Bruce Greenwood - his granite jaw - tries to stroke her over the walkie talkie. He even makes a joke once, but we're afraid his face can crack. This is a serious matter. <br /> <br /> But mostly, it's a scene after the scene of people arguing: the military expert argues to wait it out (his reasoning doesn't look very healthy, but he's supposed to be the smart man in this movie so okaaaay); the people at the White House argue with him; the army sergeant remorse him too; the beautiful Pakistani nuclear engineer claims the chief terrorist. The dialogue is absolutely B Movie all the way and lines like, "Stop the broadcast! STOP THE BROADCAST !!!" Maybe you will roll your bank down if you wonder if the characters actually refer to this folly. <br /> <br /> Perhaps to compensate for the lack of production quality, the camera work in the faux documentary version of the camera is working. Gram style that is supposed to lend immediately and energy to the screens, but the way it is careless and amateurish, it is straightforwardly irritating; even pretentious. Further efforts to detect the pace are made with the inclusion of unconscious black and white footage that is randomly interlaced with the main action. But it is also pretentious and annoying in that Blair Witch kinda way. In short, the stylistic efforts seem very amateurish. <br /> <br /> The music lives up to the footage - it sounds synthetic and cheap. Kind of like a porn movie, but with less melody and much more heartbeat sounds. The graphic treatment is itself bad: cute graphics in a big red font scream for us '9:28 pm' as if the duration is actually making a difference. <br /> <br /> Meltdown can work as a marketing concept. but it is clear that the script was a second thought. FX - part of Fox - puts this cheese production together and drops a few million dollars. Now that's what I call a crash!
