To try to keep up with the hype of youthful audiences as the 70s approached, OaCD, YCSF was the product of chicks and owl material chosen for musicalization. Here it is over life regression, ESP and hipno therapy ... nice loop! The real problem with the concept (music or not) is the extremely low dramatic input; just where can a movie go and what can happen when a man falls in love with an early incarnation of a girl he can't stand? It can't be a new place, but strangely, it can't even be an old place! Indeed, if it could, audiences would still have no interest in Yves Montand's union (a much older, arrogant, French ass play) and Streisand. (a much younger girl). We are never invested in them, their situations or outcomes. Montand is overlooked and his strong accent makes much of his lyrics incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> It's been given a level 60s veneer that makes it extremely disposable; despite efforts here and there by Minelli which is respectful. It's not even adapted from a non-musical story that met with any previous success ... it's just right! Streisand sometimes has a funny business to offer, such as when she tries not to fall asleep on her roof and improvises an energetic dance. But she's too much trust in her impressive (translation: annoying) kooky, Jewish girl Shtick. However, she can sing very well at both the "soft" and "powerhouse" ends of the series. Amidst a score of musical shooting, she gets 3 or 4 great songs of much higher caliber than Fanny or Dolly has to offer. "He's not you" is a sweetness as sublime as Lorenz Hart's "My Funny Valentine", but the movie can't realize any impact; because the lyrics don't look like something in the movie, and nothing remotely suggests that a great love grows between Chabot and Melinda. <br /> <br /> The only cut we can see is a much larger movie's poor hatchet job. Strong research shows a longer, better explained and more decorative, but not necessarily a better movie at: http://barbra-archives.com/films/clear_day_streisand_2.html. You can be sure there are more Babs in that version, but more importantly, there will be more thoughtful work by Minelli. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Montand Babs sends down the title song, after discovering he's a total dick that gives her a self-esteem to let go of the hook. And she took the bait. So, uh ... Hooray. <br /> <br /> (* Quickly it's nice here, Love all the pruning, He's not you, and the title song)
