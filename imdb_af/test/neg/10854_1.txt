Well, I was at a British University, I actually went to the one in this lot of movie, and it was nothing like that. It's a terrible, bad and active movie. The worst thing is, it could have been really good if they bothered to spend more than 12p on it. If it really represented real British students, it had to act like one and take out a loan of 15 thousand pounds. It says nothing about Uni life, where was the forest dive, drinking tea until 4:00, the endless chats about group dynamics ??? Where was the diversity and fun? Maybe I'm just romantic, but I don't remember Fresher's Week being so terrible, and I'm tea total. And in the end, the question still remains ... a bed or a wardrobe?
