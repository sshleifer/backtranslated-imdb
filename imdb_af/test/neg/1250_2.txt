How does this movie suck? As a fan of Michael Imperioli's work on The Sopranos, I chose it on Blockbuster, based on his name and a story that sounded like it had promise. It still does, but this movie doesn't. <br /> <br /> Every turn of the story is completely predictable; I kept looking for the lifetime error in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. It's all there: the noble woman comes from tough times, the man fails to live to his potential, despite her best efforts, the child in the middle, etc. Etc. Etc. The mysterious alien's identity is what I really did like to throw things at the TV. I would have been more satisfied with the fact that Little Stuey woke up and realized it was all a dream. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers can also be a moral of the story ... "A little ahead of the credits, as another reviewer pointed out, this thing really works like a after school special. Don't gamble don't drink, don't use drugs, stay with your wife, spend time with your kids ... come on, how about some nuances? What about some interesting bad guys? Author / director AW Vidmer should be spoken for special notice: not only is the dialogue guided, the pacing (within dialogue and on one side of many scenes) makes this movie at least 45 minutes longer than it needs (and believe me, it feels like longer) The talents of Imperioli, Renee Faia and some of the supporting role players (Steve Schirripa, natch) are the only things that hold a 1-rating, all their good work is almost offset by the horrific work depicting the boy Stuey, not sure if it was a decisive mistake (h ey - it's a mob movie, so let's throw someone from Blue's clues that can't do anything but over-emphasize with a big fake smile ... in the Disney movie) or just terribly directing, but those scenes are really painful to watch. <br /> <br /> I would be interested in another filmmaker's action on this character and his story; It's a shame. Imperioli has already been used by this movie. Terrible, terrible, terrible.
