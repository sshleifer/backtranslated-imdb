First, the initial concept of a lost fortune in gold bars discovered in a New Zealand lake, is a good opening in a rounded World War II aircraft. What follows is nothing more than a cartoon. Men chasing men, cars chasing men, helicopters hunting men, helicopters hunting boats, boat hunting boats, for the better part of an hour, the most boring nonsense, with absolutely no progress to the story. Special mention should be made of the chop shop editing, as many scenes are apparently split in random order. The actions of all involved are embarrassing. A last thing, the picture quality and sound quality are so bad on this DVD that you will be terrified. - NOTE
