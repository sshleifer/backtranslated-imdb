There is a reason why the world has forgotten these creatures: they are boring. This is a hammer production which means that anyone who made this movie should be hit with a hammer, a few times if possible - and where it hurts most. Most people think more of a dump than this idiot made this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously now? The movie starts with a few cavemen who go hunting a little. Antelopes must now have developed many of the prehistoric times, because they really attack and kill people here. Then it's time to meet the rest of the tribe: more bearded men, some fashion models, and even some very old, gray-haired guys and grandchildren. Of course, these old geese never heard of cave people not exceeding the age of 30; they refused to bow to the will of both logic and prehistoric records, so that they lived. One of the cave dwellers is not beard; he's clean. Not quite as clean as Tarzan, the Lord of the Humanoid Shoe who does not boast the jungle since childhood and without a razor, but out there. <br /> <br /> What follows is the mandatory earthquake / melt-lava destruction sequence that causes many of our non-hairy friends to meet their punishment. It is interesting to note that fashion models before the earthquake showed their breasts more. Then they have to be ashamed or something, because they have covered their chest for a while (maybe they are covered with ash so I mistakenly thought they were covered). More action follows in the form of two models that grapple in the sand. The next best thing for female mud wrestling, I think. After much of the desert is crossed, we encounter black-hair stripes - no matter how different - a blonde tribe. Dug. <br /> <br /> More spell binding things follow. There is the redhead fashion model that is bothered by a cave teenager to see a hedge. There is also the scene of a woman who dies at birth: these cave mod models are so fragile. Eventually we get an even darker hair and laminated stem, that is, an evil strain. One of them becomes a WWF champion after actually beating a big bear thing. 1,2,3 ... and it is finished: the bear is the loser. We are also witnessing a jealous cave man who miraculously recovered from two major injuries: first he was stabbed in the thigh with a large spear, but he walked away as if it were a scratch. Then he is thrown into a cliff on a large rock by the blonde-good-two-shovel caveman, but he walks away as if he were thrown on a huge bench. In the end, it is unclear whether he falls off an even higher cliff or is crushed by that voodoo doll. Oh yes, voodoo was used in prehistoric times by white tribes living in the desert and whose women were fashion models. It's always important to learn from movies. <br /> <br /> The message of the movie is as informative as it is educational: cave people like to fight for local power and they also love their fashion models. As if a self-respecting cave man would fight to be such a sorry bunch of leaders.
