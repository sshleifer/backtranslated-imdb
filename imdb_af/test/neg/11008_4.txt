Although I found the play excellent and the cinematography was great, I was very disappointed with the adaptation. <br /> <br /> One of the important parts of the novella is the fact that Ethan and Mattie decide to kill themselves rather than go on. It is never presented in the movie, they show it as a sledge accident. <br /> <br /> The character changes in Mattie and Zenna are almost non-existent. While in the novel, they almost change places. At the end of this adjustment, they both seem to be disabled. <br /> <br /> Finally, Mattie and Ethan completely destroy their relationship with the power and poignancy of the final <br /> <br /> The change of the narrator who was a preacher was one effective change. <br /> <br /> Neeson and Arquette are great in their portrayals. Joan Allen was also wonderful, but her character is much of Wharton's novella. <br /> <br /> I don't expect movies to portray wedding novels, but this one has gone a long way. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would not recommend watching this movie unless you read the book because you will be confused and disappointed.
