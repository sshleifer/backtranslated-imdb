As I watched this movie, I felt like a plastic bag was closed slowly around my head. The acting was terribly choked, and it was bad acting. The most brilliant piece of acting in the whole movie was the man who had to play in the state-in-a-coffin. I felt nothing but relief when it was finally over. I expected this movie to be a real tragedy, with some deep psychological intrigue in the aftermath. Around it was stupid, no beginning, no climax, no end, but just going, and the plastic bag getting worse. Let's get real here. It's a horrible movie.
