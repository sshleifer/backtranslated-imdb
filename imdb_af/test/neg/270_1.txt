I didn't expect much when I went out to see it, but my God was a disappointment. The original was kind of fun within his genre, but it's so bad, I've been abused when I left the theater. There's no plot, it's not funny, it's not nice to look at, it's just embarrassing. After an hour I was hoping, my patience would be rewarded, but now I'm sorry not to leave the theater. Do yourself a favor and ignore this one, see it when it comes to the small screen. Or see it on the budget DVD, anything you do not waste money on it. Don't say I didn't warn you.
