It's a very mediocre Jackie Chan movie and one of his biggest worst James Glickenhaus has ruined it! All the characters are decent, I think, but the story is so, but Jackie Chan is still great in it, even though he got bored. Jackie and Danny Aiello had zero chemistry together, and it was very boring many times, but the finals were above average and managed to be quite entertaining, and had good stunts! I haven't seen the Hong Kong version yet, but I'm sure it's better than this dud, plus the twist is very predictable! It is really lifeless and leafy, and I don't care for Jackie that he doesn't look happy in it, and if he doesn't stare into it, it would have been unbearable and totally unshakable. The opening is supposed to be memorable, but it's nothing I haven't seen before and done better, and I thought the whole movie was pretty lazy and could have been a great movie if Jackie controlled it! has no root for any of the characters. It's a very mediocre Jackie Chan movie, and one of his biggest worst James Glickenhaus has ruined it! Not recommended, even for Die Hard Jackie Chan fans. The direction is terrible! James Glickenhaus does a terrific job here, with very bare camera work, bad angles, and keeping the movie boring for the most part. The Acting is so. Jackie Chan is AMAZING as always, but he is not his usual energetic self, and looks bored and filmed throughout the film, has no chemistry with Danny Aiello, and I don't really know him either! (Jackie Rules !!!!!). Danny Aiello is OK here, as Jackie's partner, but his character is a bit of an ass, and he had zero chemistry with Jackie, he did it well. Roy Chiao is decent as the biggest villain, but has just gone through the moves and was not all that threatening, but he is still over. The rest of the game is at its best average. Overall Not worth your time or money. * 1/2 out of 5
