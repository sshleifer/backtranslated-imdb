The last sentence of this review is a great spoiler. <br /> <br /> I've been enjoying Joe Dante's work since Piranha. He did many different genre options that were both funny and honest. <br /> <br /> But it's pure crap. It's the kind of satire - in line with thanks for smoking - it's so literal and straightforward that it doesn't leave anything. A) to be laughed and b) to make the audience think. <br /> <br /> It's a pity, because the plot and the material are so rich, timely, and ripe for intelligent commenting. Incidentally, there is absolutely no reason for the main character of the Ann Coulter character at the end of the film. It's just ridiculous.
