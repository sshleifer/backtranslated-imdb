I just fired at the AFI FEST 2006 with disappearances with about 30 other people in a mostly vacant 1000 seat auditorium. The festival programmer started commenting after his lack of audience. "Well, at least some of those attending the festival have good taste in film." Well, Mr. Programmer, after watching this movie, I have to reply back to. "No, we don't, and neither!" This back-woods period follows a young (not so) Wild Bill as he and his mystical family run illegal Canadian whiskey across the border during America's ban. Old-fashioned criminals (Kris Kristofferson and the company) not only need the money to save their Vermont farm, but want to introduce a small Wild Bill to the virtues of mankind. <br /> <br /> Although well photographed, this adventure story is missing which makes movies of this kind, "tension" and credibility. Kristofferson's bright performance and dry monologue reminds me of a dream I have ever had where Al Gore played Willy Wonka's role. I just didn't mind and when the Bill Bill of Wild Bills appeared out of the air to advise him, it just didn't fit. Yes, I almost fell asleep almost once. <br /> <br /> Gary Farmer does a good job as the Cameron Frye in Ferris Bueller character; Big Bill's son-in-law, while teenager Chris McDermott uses the blue eyes for his acting advantage. <br /> <br /> But overall, expect to see Jay Cravens play Disappearances at a Block Buster $ 2 Bin near you.
