OK, I could only find three reasons to consider this movie, considering the extremely low budget. <br /> <br /> First there was Linnea Quigley and Rachel Carter. Actually, the two gave me four good reasons to look, and behold, I did. <br /> <br /> The only other reason to look is that many are filmed right. Now I didn't know it before, but I saw an Orange County car and said, wow! It was shot in Florida. <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the leap back to the past and the ancestors of the young child, but it really was. The pumpkin man's murder was pretty lame, with the exception of the biker. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Quigley and Carter, OK, but the return of the living dead will give more excitement.
