I was a great Olsen fan once. I got this movie when I was six and it looked almost uninterrupted until I was nine. Then it lay on my shelf and dust gathered until yesterday. I was left speechless. <br /> <br /> Mary-Kate and Ashley play Allie and Mel, two twelve year olds who are sent to spend Spring Break in Paris with their ambassador grandpa. Along the way they meet, as one expects, two cute French boys who show them the most beautiful side to Paris. I think the two boys were okay, false French accent set aside. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable and humor is shallow and wheaty. Mary-Kate and Ashley play two shallow girls with too much makeup on their face. <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie if you're not in the Olsen twins or family flies.
