Rarely seen a movie deviating so much from the original look and still (more or less) acceptable. Bloodlyn is a rather short (which is a good thing in this case) that focuses on the mysterious Hellraiser box. Who wanted to make it and how it spells a game on the whole bloodline of the man who eventually created it. We were introduced to 3 generations of the Merchant family (all played by Bruce Ramsey); one in the 18th century Paris, one in the present and the last one in a future galaxy far distant? Views on this storyline can be very different? Whether you think it is very idiotic and far-fetched or original and risky. The initial atmosphere and setting by Clive Barker has completely disappeared, but the morbid surrounding remains and various rows are still very creepy and disturbing. Hellraiser: Bloodlyn has quite a beautiful blow and Pinhead's charismatic presence (Doug Bradley) is still an extra horror value. Pinhead ?? accompanied by a pet puppy this time ?? still know how to kill, too bad, he speaks too much and his nasty speeches tend to get bored quickly. The best aspects of this production are the newly introduced "cenobites" and the occult Parisian portrait. Huge downhill is the poor writing, the absence of the typical macabre humor and the lack of references to Barker's initial masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Although not highly memorable, Bloodline is the last visible Hellraiser movie. After this succession, the series went completely down. So far, 2 further successors have come out (2 more are still in progress) and none of them is worth seeing. Hellraiser: Bloodline suffered from many production problems and the director finally chose Alan Smithee? Means he does not want to be remembered as its director. Who can blame him?
