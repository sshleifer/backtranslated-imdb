I'll give it: I didn't stop watching, and it's not corporate, that's so cool. But my internal critic cut it into pieces - I suppose I see too many movies. Houtskrift, the snake is just kind of sounds from their mouths without any flow. Editing, previously mentioned, is hits and abuse; sometimes it causes a good ghetto feeling, but mostly it is annoying - jerky, impressive angles and really dull, foolish faces. The actors were marginal, although Letisha had her moments. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why the audience is caring for Curtis, he is a total screwdriver and the actor is completely unexpressed and not very funny or engaging. Directing does not help you love him or even hate him; I just wanted him to lock up and be shot. I didn't care for his impotent revenge when it rolled around. The completely predictable end is not credible at all. I'm not sure why we're supposed to believe some former successful traders he deposits are stupid to fall for his little ones. "Oh, you've just gone out of jail and been tried. Here are thousands of dollars worth of cocaine, it turns around me. Don't save me now, etc." <br /> <br /> A good sex scene in the beginning gave me hope, but it was eventually let down. Handling a rape scene was slightly eyebrow-raising, even though it was quite interesting. There are better movies in this genre that don't insult your intelligence by trying to have some kind of authentic ghetto realism, while it looks more like a movie school presentation. 4/10, a F.
