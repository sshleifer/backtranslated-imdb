If you're like me and observed the original "Benji" phenomenon from afar, you see for the first time 30+ years later, you may be shocked to discover how terribly awful it is, and more hidden than ever about its popularity back in 1974. <br /> <br /> My judgment is not entirely objective, as I tend to have a favorable prejudice against children's films and therefore they are very slack. On the other hand, I always hated this particular dog, a feature in the last few seasons of "Petticoat Junction". Never a good show, the dog-less early episodes were at least a nice showcase of beautiful actresses and the introduction of the dog cut into their screen time. <br /> <br /> Benji is a 86-minute mega dose of the dog following him on several daily jobs through the town of McKinney, Texas. If it goes boring, you will be advised to give "Benji" a wide birth and never drop your remote into the hands of a "Benji" fan (if there is anybody else). <br /> <br /> Unlike "My Dog Skip", "Monkey Business" or "Because of Winn-Dixie" the human actors in the cast are very poor. "Big Valley's" Peter Breck plays the standard strict father and just looks embarrassed at the idea of ​​appearing in something, this lamb. <br /> <br /> If one of your children (of any age) appears to be entertaining "Benji", consider returning to their medication. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
