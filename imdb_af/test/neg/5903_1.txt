This movie could have been so much better. It is a beautiful story set in very difficult times, yet it is so poorly executed. The leading actors have done excellent work in the past, and for the most part, they are doing an adequate job in this film. Although their dialogue is sometimes tuned and forced. The direction might be more concise. Most of the criticism must go to the writers, who have made a good story and made it boring. In short, there are thousands of much better ways to spend 2 hours.
