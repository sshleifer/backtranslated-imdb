The characters were so original that it hurt. The small, slim-eyed computer scent, the funny African American with dumb cliche punchlines, a cool white man with compassion for cars and the handsome leader who ends with the beautiful girl. The actors are at best mediocre. Eccept from Norton doing a pretty good job as the bad man. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is also stupid and a total waste of time. It's all about a group of spoiled boys who use the world as their playground, where every safe is in a big house that keeps them on the table with food. I mean, why work for a life when you can rob people? <br /> <br /> AND, .. Who the f **** messes with the traffic lights in a big European city?!? And in the middle of the FRIGGIN day!? Think of all the damages and not the deaths of innocent civilians. What about all the ambulances and firefighters? <br /> <br /> I donated no compassion for the main characters, and again Mr. Wahlberg gets his bloody gold or not, I can't give less of a fart.
