Is there a fire brigade NOT used in this movie? From the opening line, "I'm getting too old for this" by the firefighters of the firefighters, the "worried woman", the loss of his best friend in the fireplace, to the final funeral for fallen brothers, this movie looks and sounds like it was written by the marketing department in Disney ("Our studies show that audiences really like it when ..." and then they put it in.) <br /> <br /> There's nothing original here. Any emotion we feel for these guys is brought to our admiration and feelings for firefighters. <br /> <br /> Check out Rescue Me if you want to see real heroes: Daily guys with bugs who don't mind running into a burning building to save strangers.
