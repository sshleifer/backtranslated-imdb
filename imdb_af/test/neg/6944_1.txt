This is by far the worst movie I've seen in Bollywood this year. I can't lie, my wife loves this movie a lot. It wasn't Bobby Deol or Arjun Rampal who made this movie become incredible, but it was Amisha Patel. She plays the role of a blind woman in trouble when she almost falls from a mountain where the hero Arjun Rampal saves her (in the middle of nowhere). It amazes me here how a blind girl is aware of danger when she falls from a mountain, because she cannot see her environment. From this scene I watched the movie very carefully and in every scene there was a mistake in the scene of Amisha Patel. The way she plays a blind girl is very bad. The only way she does this is not to look in the eyes of the person she is talking to. When I watched this movie, I respected Rani Mukherjee with her performance in the movie Black. Amisha will never reach this level as an actress. <br /> <br /> In any case, she falls in love with Arjun Rampal. This is the clich√© story. Suddenly Arjun is killed by a man who is in love with Amisha. Amisha is in despair, but then Bobby comes into the movie. He also falls in love with the blind girl. Bobby Deol is a good actor in my view, but he can't move the movie to a higher level where Amisha Patel buries it deep in the ground. I have to say Bobby deserves better roles in better movies than he has ever received. Bobby grew in the play of the first movie his beautiful father gave. He was so bad at acting in Barsaat, but if you see him acting now, you get the tremble and believe every word he says. Just a high-potential movie like a Yash Copra movie should meet its path. <br /> <br /> Well, when Amisha also falls in love with Bobby, some people come into her life. Arjun Rampal is not dead! Who believes this crap? I don't. Why didn't they give his role to one of the ugly guys of the movie family (Shushant Singh or Aryeman Ramsay) and Bobby played a role in one of the blockbusters with Amitabh Bachchan? I'm sorry if my comment sounds like a scream for an actor like Bobby to give him a big role, but he deserves so much better than a movie with Amisha (big screen vs. face) Patel. This movie was so terrible that I regret buying it.
