God, I hated this movie! I saw it at a sneak preview 13 years ago, and I still have bad flashbacks. It was, without a doubt, the WORST movie I've ever paid to watch. It was poorly written, badly directed, and (surprisingly considering the cast) acted heavily. I'd rather be thrown on a razor-nook roof, and then my skin should peel off, rather than put it back on. Can you guess I didn't enjoy it?
