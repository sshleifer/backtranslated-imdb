As a Genghis Khan "fan" I was looking forward to this movie. After devouring Conn Igguldens' epic novels about Genghis and reading numerous historical records, I feel I know something about the subject and were delighted to share my knowledge with friends via this movie ... <br /> <br /> It turned out to be a deception. This movie is made virtually from start to finish. There are a few things that seem right, but mostly it is purely to believe the authors. It doesn't have to be a problem, I like good entertainment, just like anyone else. Unfortunately, it is usually boring. Nothing of the greatness comes out in this movie. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend this movie if you know something about the topic.
