I must admit that I have been disadvantaged here; When I learn more about a film from other reviewers than watching it myself, it's a problem. Although the plot of "The Man Who Won Too Much" seems common, it is easy to see, but the film leaves too many cryptic elements in the way of what a satisfying mystery could be. By the time we got to the scene where a witchy looking woman established the secrecy of "the first degree of the seven folding ray", I didn't know whether to laugh or rewind to see if I had missed something. <br /> <In retrospect, the cryptic note by Mr. Lawrence (Leslie Banks) from the shaving brush gloves, a handy written message leading to a dentist named Barbor, and finally to the Albert Hall, a place, not a person as indicated by " A. Hall ". But for all the plot, it was never made clear why the murder goal was taken. Okay, so Louis Bernard died because he knew of a plot to kill a diplomat called Ropa, but why was Ropa a target? Think about it, why was the note even written and protected in the shaving brush? Did Bernard ever need to remind himself what would happen? <br /> <br /> With its diverse scenes, "The Man Who Were Too Much", it's hard to follow and a little disoriented, but I'll give Alfred Hitchcock credit for this early attempt. For perspective, I have to look at his other work of the same era, although this movie certainly can't hold a candle for his later works like "Psycho" or "North at Northwest".
