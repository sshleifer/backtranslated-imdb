I really don't know why I agreed to see this movie, but like a complete fool I did it and for that I deserve to be shot! I saw the original Killjoy. Well, I say I saw it. I watched it, but I found it so bad I finally watched it in 4x speed to get it over and get rid of the annoying dialogue, but I said I'd see it and I even did it was in 4x speed. <br /> <br /> To cut a long story short, Killjoy 2 kicks off where Killjoy is gone. By this I do not mean the plot, I mean the complete and total bag of dirt known as acting and cheap. I have nothing against low budget movies, but I enjoy them, they are different from Mega budget blockbusters, but this movie is just awful! The acting is diabolical and the writing. Well, I think you could have given Stevie. Wondering a pen and paper, and he would have made something much better! This movie is just annoying, not to mention the annoying laugh the clown has, which is so clearly mentioned! Anyway, I didn't make it through this movie. About three-quarters of the way it was time to turn it off and throw it through the window. Buying a DVD can be a rip, but as a Frisbee it was a mega-buy! <br /> <br /> Please be the love of man himself. DO NOT see this mop, it is probably the worst thing I have ever seen and considering the mess I have seen, it says a lot! <br /> <br /> My review on this movie would be .... Nailgun on the head / 10
