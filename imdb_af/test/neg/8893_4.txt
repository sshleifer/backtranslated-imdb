This movie has become very close to a good movie. The direction should be a little smoother to move from one piece to the next to make it more plausible. In particular: The main character's need to escape is not explicit enough. Does he try to kill himself? Does he try to escape? His life doesn't look so bad, so it makes it harder to swallow that he wants to leave his life so much. Also, it is not very clear how much "fell in love" with Jennifer Jason L. If the film had been reviewed with even more attention to these details, it would have been wonderful. On the other hand, for a nice movie, it's pretty good! Perhaps if you have a few drinks to disturb the logical thinking, it will be nicer. <br /> <br />
