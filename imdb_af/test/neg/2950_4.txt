1st watched 2/18/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Leon Leonard): Fair Adventure movie based on a novel by the writer of Moby Dick fame, Herman Melville. This movie is about the captain of a ship who stole the eyes (it was extremely rare black pearls) from an indigenous tribe's God statue and hid them somewhere he had known before leaving the island of Tivi. He became very ill and was on a secret journey to return to the island to get the pearls for himself while others (like his daughter) thought he would go back to being treated by the local medicine man. Others didn't know what the reason for the trip was. A Stowaway actually knew the reason for the journey - to give the eyes of their God back. The foolish part is that the pearls are hidden very close to the statue and all the time the natives have run their tribe without their eyes (they have caused all kinds of problems). Along the way, we are (for some reason) treated to a short underwater natural sight with an electric eel bumping a local octopus (I think only Herman Melville knows what it's all about). Once they arrive at the island, the captain dies but passes the pearls to his daughter, but she also curses the disease. One of the bad guys finds out where the God is housed and convinces the daughter to go there and steal the pearls back, but at this point the good parents find out what is going on and a fight occurs. I will not tell you about the outcome of the battle or the end, I will give it to you to find out if you want. As I said earlier, the movie was OK, but some very stupid things I've already mentioned have reduced its impact. I wonder if that new "Pirates of the Caribbean" got some of his plot of this one --- hmm ?? black pearls, a curse (I wonder?) Well, it doesn't matter, those elements didn't make a very good movie in this case or the other. They seem to learn they are lesson, but with the money that goes into that new movie, they're sure they won't. Oh good.
