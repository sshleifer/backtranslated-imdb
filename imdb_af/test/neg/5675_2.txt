Beats me how people can describe this adolescent exercise as film noir. True there is a gun and a bottle and a lady and the head is a private eye, but it does not make the genre, people. This thing plays like heated TV cop show stuff - very bloody knock and lousy continuity - with a bit of Chinatown memories thrown in. Nice to look at the first 10 minutes. You want contemporary feel, watch anything by John Dahl.
