With the NBC's "Thank God You Are Here", the network can try to repeat the successes of ABC's improv sitcom, "Who's Line Is It Anyway?" in which host, Drew Carey, will judge the actions of a handful of companions who are asked to improvise scenes of some kind. Dave Foley and co-host Dave Alan Grier oversees a handful of remarkable comedians who have to improvise their way through various scenes, all starting with "Thank you, God, you're here." It takes itself too seriously (why viewers have to be reminded repeatedly that the actors have never seen the sets), both co-hosts seem less than enthusiastic. After watching the ongoing sub-pairing, the actors tried to laugh, but I wonder if the live audience really laughs or improvises. Expect this time slot filler to be a very brief one.
