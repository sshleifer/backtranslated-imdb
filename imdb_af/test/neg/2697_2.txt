A women ex-police spokesman, who drowned for recklessness (and probably could beat Chuck Norris in a fight), entered himself as a private bodyguard; her first client is a worthless playboy type. It takes half the film for her to kick off the power in the first place. Very good fight choreography, but the plot is strictly by the numbers, and the acting is as wood as the dialogue. Give this one a miss.
