Time spent is theoretical, so I can give the script a little leeway. <br /> <br /> I also understand the concept that changing just one variable can change the potential of history. <br /> <br /> What I can't understand, however, is the way the change in time unfolds. We are subjected to a series of "time waves" that progressively replicate the evolution of the planet. While it's a convenient plot device, as it gives our heroes enough time to fix the problem, it doesn't make sense at all. Certainly, if you change a variable, and that variable has a significant or even completely changed planetary evolution, then the evolutionary process will be determined by the time you return to the future and no waves will be needed. ? After all, why would a change that happened 65 million years ago have to wait until now to be effective? The fact that the moth is projected well in advance can make it credible, but the life of that moth has changed significantly 65 million years ago, and therefore any change in evolutionary history would have begun and not be dependent on a return to us current time. <br /> <br /> To solve the problem, the team goes back in time to prevent the change in variable ever happening. By doing this successfully, we see that the changes to evolution never happened, and that no one even remembers the events! Surely what works for the solution should work for the original change? I like a good movie-sci fi adventure, but if it's not in a galaxy far away, it should have at least some theoretical possibility to make it really entertaining. <br /> <br /> Good point of departure, bad plot, reasonable acting and, in all fairness, just a twist on Jurassic Park. <br /> <br /> Not on my "watch again" list.
