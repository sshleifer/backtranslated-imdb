I can appreciate movies with captions from abroad and especially the one in which the subtitles are weak and don't really seem to follow the story or really make sense, but this movie has too many parts that don't really make sense. br /> All in all, I can admit that I have some scary and freaky parts, but they are repetitive, I felt like I was watching a loop trailer; seems to have shot a short movie with different actors. <br /> <br /> In the veins of RINGU and GRUDGE, but not even the hype ... the excessive length killed the excitement. <br /> <br /> Unless you are a strong fan of these types of movies (which I thought I was), don't waste your time on this one.
