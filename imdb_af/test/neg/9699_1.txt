I've spent some time going through all the reviews for this movie. I'm in line with almost every reviewer saying Noah's Ark is crap, crap, crap, crap, crap! Do the NBC managers not have any class? I feel sick to my stomach to actually see both parts of this mini-series. The writing is so stupid, so useless, and yes, totally indifferent! I can understand making some changes for dramatic purposes, but this movie just changed everything in the story. God himself goes through the trouble of killing the entire Earth's population, but somehow he misses one man who sows to sell things to Noah. Give me a chance! And what happened to Noah's sons acting like Indiana Jones, saving girls in need? If all that is not bad enough, there is the part where God asks Noah and says, "I'm sorry, Noah, I was wrong." Newsflash NBC, God can't be wrong! This film is the most tasteless and shameful biblical film ever made.
