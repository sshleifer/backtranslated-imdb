The amount of hype and the great success this movie has seen is a proof of how desperate our people are against a good independent Saudi movie. In fact, the great success of Tash Ma Tash is also proof. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to start with the importance of filmmaking, as is evident to those with half-brain how films have changed the world. <br /> <br /> And I'm not going to say how much our society needs a lot of movies to wipe out many problems we have in our country. Religion, politics, women's rights, education, general health, terrorism, law and much more. <br /> <br /> News about the fist Saudi movie came a solution to some of the problems we had, especially to the youth. Instead, we experienced a naked movie. <br /> <br /> The ignorance and naivety of the writing was obvious. It was as if a 13 year old wrote it. <br /> <br /> Now I heard that the budget for this movie was great. I want to know where the money went, huh? The effects were really ugly, the editing was poor. The writing was "kharabeet". You really don't know what the story is and what the director of this movie wants to strive for. <br /> <br /> A note about the actor who played the religious brother, his performance was good, but with bad direction. Another thing about the role of the religious friends he had is not how religious guys are acting here in Saudi Arabia! They are not "evil" as this film intends. In fact, they are some of the most beautiful people you will ever meet with a very unusual way of life, and that is what should appear in the movie. <br /> <br /> The youth follow the religious here because of a reason, and that is the young ones are the most passionate and sentimental. And with the well-formed principles of religious life, the youth follow them. Again, that's what had to appear. <br /> <br /> We need another "First Film" with a Saudi writer, actor, director, composer, even cameraman. So they all work passionately for their experiment, not just for the money! <br /> <br /> And we have to do what Shakespeare did hundreds of years ago, we need phrases from the Koran in the writing of the movie. Since people in our society still see art as a form of sin, the challenge facing a Saudi film maker is changing the mindset in that corner.
