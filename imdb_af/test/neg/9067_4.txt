Is there anything else on earth to be more tempting than to learn what awaits us from dead bodies? Spanish director Ignacio Cerdà (a soulmate of his German colleague Jörg Buttgereit) provides an answer to our curiosity and asks us for an exciting journey into the world of preparation tables, scales, surgical saws, human intestines and twisted thoughts. <br /> <br /> Welcome to the autopsy room! <br /> <br /> I don't know what facets of the movie, apart from its notorious reputation, helped it get enough high ratings. <br /> <br /> Storywise, it's pretty straightforward and straightforward - a day in life (actually half an hour) of an angry suspect (or perhaps assistant pathologist or whatever he is) and dismissing his psychologist tension in a non-traditional way, right in his workplace. I'm confused about what particular message the writers have been trying to make with this one-note plot. I suspect it may somehow be inspired by Udo Kier's character's strange behavior in Andy Warhol's Frankenstein. <br /> <br /> Artistic values ​​of the film are also questionable. It is difficult to evaluate the performance of the actors who do not print a single word. Their emotions are hidden behind the medical masks. There is not enough room for a large camera. Actually, the whole action is usually deployed within four walls. Truth - effects and make - up are impressive and the set - up looks very acceptable, but only a handful of medical / forensic experts can judge how honest and anatomically correct the dissection is performed here (if anyone cares). Honestly, I thought the autopsy was done to investigate the condition of certain organs and to determine the cause of death. Now I know that the corpses are cut down, raped and humiliated, the intestines are torn apart, the brain is washed away from the head, filled in the stomach and mixed with the intestines, then the body is cut back and washed - nothing personal. And what do these poor people expect to write in their fraudulent autopsy reports? Shock and Violence Factor - It is very unlikely that an unsuspecting viewer would discover that the disc he was meant to watch with his wife and children next to a Christmas tree turned out to be a graphic video guide on vivisection. This obscure item is hardly available, searched by people who are well versed in the subject and are not easily offended. Therefore, it would be senseless to warn someone to sabotage this movie. They are well aware of exactly what they are watching and what they want to see. <br /> <br /> Cerdà is really talented and attractive director, evident from at least two other parts of his "trilogy" The Awakening ", amazing black and white short, and 30 minutes 'Genesis', visually stunning and moody piece with a discount and interesting concept. And I'm pretty sure one day he will conquer the hearts of filmmakers with his new, more mainstream-oriented material. And sooner or later, a aftermath will be a rarity to the meticulous collectors of its "early" warm-up works. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, I'm afraid it may be highly recommended. for medical students or specialists studying stress disorders and sexual disorders.
