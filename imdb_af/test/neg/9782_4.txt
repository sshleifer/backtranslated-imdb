This horror movie starts out promising enough and there is a moment where I thought, "It's going to be really good." However, it gets rather boring at the end. The acting is pretty good, just like the location and the story starts well. The problem, insufficient death on the screen and an end where you basically turn the monster tail and run. I wanted to see more, especially after a very good sleeping bag scene where I thought the movie was picked up and going to be a winner. Unfortunately after that the movie showed the monster very little and the back of the DVD lied because it told me that the desert among the people literally became alive and could consume their flesh ... now there would have been a movie , an almost inevitable situation. Granted that viewers made it uncomfortable and that could make the tension worse, but that's what horror movies are supposed to do! Instead, we have very few shots of the creature or creature as it was and when we see it, it is mainly the defense. Still, it wasn't bad, but needed more horror, less hunting and more.
