Before Airport 79 ', these movies were pretty good. They have decent special effects, all-star cast and good acting. This movie destroyed the franchise, and there are many reasons for this. Let's talk about the special effects WOW !!!! they are terrible, what the director thought about. I know this is just 1979, but we can look at other very good special effects films such as Star Wars (1977) and Moonraker (1979). I like the idea of ​​the Concord and it could be the best airport movie, but they talked too much about it. How about Joe Patroni (George Kennedy) shooting a flame from the cabin window, to prevent a heat search crashing. He also does 90 degree dives and loops. This totally overlooked and unrealistic WOW !!!!!! Believe me, the special effects do not help this scene, and are really poor. They almost look like a cartoon, and so is the whole movie !!! !!! Lastly, we can talk about the play which, in my opinion, is extremely poor to justify at best .... About acting is a big problem in this movie, especially George Kennedy. What I really like as an actor, but not cut in this movie. The full blame should be on the director, who has done a very poor editing work, and has really banged the Franchise Airport. Bad the Concord is not used today, it was a wonder of the air travel ...
