This movie was really bad. At first they didn't even hear the facts. Half of the movie is made up and it's more about the deputy whose mother is one of Ed Gein's victims. The acting was horrible, except for the guy Ed Gein plays, but it's not hard to waste a stranger. Although I think it was terrible, I gave it a try because they started it with real crime pictures. This was the best part of the movie. Once the release of the movie was finished, the movie went down. The author of this movie tried to spit it, but it didn't have to be. The story of Ed Gein is interesting enough without falsifying information.
