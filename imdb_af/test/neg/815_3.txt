Difficult to think what they thought when making this movie (that is, the authors, directors, producers, actors, editors, etc.). Christopher Plummer, a 129-film veteran, is excited by the score of other actors with apparently no motivation more than raising a salary. I think there is nothing wrong with that, but as soon as it is paid, it does not mean that anyone should look at it. <br /> <br /> It's my mistake that there are really good reviews for this movie at imdb. Art? If you want to see art, go to an art gallery, don't see this movie. Comedy? Watch a repeat of the Flintstones, about the same plot with less time wasted. <br /> <br /> Dabney Coleman gives his usual performance, better or worse. And some of the young actors may have had some good experience doing this movie. But Plummer ???? It was an embarrassment to watch his performances, and I was positively placed on him in the course of the movie because I knew it was Plummer of Sound of Music celebrity! I see from his bio that he called Sound of Music "Sound of Mucus", so he didn't like it as much as the 100's of millions who liked him. <br /> <br /> I wonder if today He was asked, how do you rate Sound of Music compared to where the heart is, what would he say .....? Probably something like "where the money is" ....
