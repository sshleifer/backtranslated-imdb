It has to be one of those times, you come across a movie with a neat cover, my first impression, sweet, full moon, crow, a scarecrow holding a crook. OK to impress me (I watched scarecrow on television a few weeks ago), a nice slasher movie to start the evening. ................... wrong, completely wrong I think 5 minutes in that I'm going to take it out, but I thought I wasted $ 3 on it, so I'll finish where the scarecrow, and I think she is the bones of the fisherman's man wearing heavy rain boots. you see it so often. I watched this thinking .... OK when will that brats walk in this man, at one point I thought they were dead. but no .... I mean Frig, they are still alive. I just touched on a few parts about their bad scene. one was the start of zooming in at the beginning. The director / actor / writer says, "Remember I had that feeling, but I have it again." And it was either a zoom in or out, to hell, I looked back. but i think the scene was shocking, i mean what's more shocking, his wife had the same shocked look ............. she believed him? I'm sorry, but YEAH .... I didn't know he was psychic until I read the movie box to make sense of what I saw. Not only that, they used photos to make you think this movie is at least clear. <br /> <br /> The other thing that made me laugh was the scream in the camera, scary it ... ... OK .............. A girl filming a close-up, shouting in the camera for 5 minutes ... right ... I laughed at how pathetic it was, these kids could not like the rest of the people in the movie act. br /> <br /> In addition, getting rid of things from the shot must be lost or something .... because the bad guy just had a stick. Not even an ax, someone needs to ax the steam production film. <br /> <br /> Don't fall for the picture, this movie is a piece of sh * t. I watched the trailer and guess what it has <br /> <br /> GIRLS WHERE ARE YOU WITH ME AND CORN
