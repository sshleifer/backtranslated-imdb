As I watch BLACKWATER VALLEY EXORCISM, I have experienced scenarios and dialogue so incredibly that I was convinced it would be a comedy. A few choices of dialogue worthy of a stomach laugh: "I ate a rabbit." "I told you she was in possession!" "Do you tell me, the devil is in my daughter?!" <br /> <br /> There are many, many more, but you have to discover it yourself - if you dare. <br /> <br /> The story goes in all sorts of ways and things happen that are unlikely to happen and everyone looks like it's a perv or psycho of some kind (even the priest). And I didn't even get the bad act. The most important of these is the co-player of Isabelle. The director just had to tell him to act like having a stick on his @ $ because that's the general impression one gets. <br /> <br /> I don't really want to move someone away from BLACKWATER VALLEY EXORCISM, because there's entertainment value to have ... for all the wrong reasons, but if you're looking for a decent horror movie and actually, it is frightening ... running, not walking, walking.
