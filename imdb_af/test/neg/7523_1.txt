This is a Time Machine. It runs for 96 minutes in "real time", but it feels like 96 years. The first 20 minutes were completely redundant. Massive amounts of "dead" time throughout. What happened? When will something happen? Who cares? Apparently, the film was made on a tight budget. I notice the following for you building up: The Morlochs: nothing like saving a little money by sharing the sets and costumes of Lord of the Rings I share? The scary man in charge of the Morlochs ... The frightening thing these guys can think of was someone wearing one of Gene Simmons: (from the band Kiss) old costumes ??? Few well-known fact: future freaks have finished nails. <br /> <br /> Save your money, save your time. Pass on this one.
