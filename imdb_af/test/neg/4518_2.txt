Why does this movie have so many surprising reviews? <br /> <br /> It is amateurish, unfriendly and annoying. <br /> <br /> The only memorable thing here is the grainy title song. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are low and the "comic" (if you want to call it) ideas is poor, they look like remnants of remnants of SNL that even they wouldn't dare on the screen. <br /> <br /> I'm starting to mislead IMDb ratings. <br /> <br /> It's light years away from Kentucky Fried Movie - not even in the same Galaxy. <br /> <br /> It is not even possible to write 10 rules about it. <br /> <br /> OK, another good thing: ugly street tonal and ugly people - something you can't see in today's TV and movies.
