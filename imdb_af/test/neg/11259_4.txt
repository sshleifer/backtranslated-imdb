If you ever listened to any of the James Lee Burke books on tape or CD and the reader was Will Patton, you can agree that Will is the embodiment of Dave R. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones is a native Texan (or so I heard) and no one suggests a Texan better IMHO, but he is not a Cajun. His delivery is wrong. I've lived in the state for years and I can still hear the strange patois that contains a Louisiana accent. TLJ doesn't have such a thing. <br /> <br /> I thought Marry Steenbergen was a good choice for Bootsy, but I missed seeing Cletus (who will be cast in this role? The Rock? Mickey Rourke? he will have to be big. ) <br /> Overall, I thought the movie was just a 4 - the plot fluttered like a fish out of the water and didn't have the normal interesting non-linear continuity the book typically has. <br /> <br /> Hopefully Hollywood will try another JLB book, "Last Car to Elysican Fields" would be a good choice. We'll ever see some of the best villains of JLB ever.
