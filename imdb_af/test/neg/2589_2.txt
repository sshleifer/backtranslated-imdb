It's so blatantly a black widow (1987) made of the black widow - even the insect titles are so similar. <br /> <br /> If you want a better "money for money" movie, watch Black Widow, starring Debra Winger & Theresa Russell. <br /> <br /> This movie is evil at its best. I just had to see it to see how it ended.
