I don't know what Chasidik movement this movie was? I saw this movie a year ago. I am an Orthodox woman living in an Orthodox Chasidic? community And I can tell you I was offensive by this movie! It's so far away from reality, it's scary! The director can hire at least a Chasidik rabbi for a brief consultation before making a "Realistic" movie about ultra orthodox! For example, Meir's Davening (Morning Prayers)! Whether a Jewish wedding or a Mikveh (ritual bath) customs. <br /> <br /> Film is loaded with technical inaccuracies. But it is not they who bother me. It's the spiritual side. Orthodox are depicted next to the Taliban. Woman is powerless, while men are the ultimate rulers! Please! Nobody can force a Jewish girl on the Chuppa against her! We, Orthodox, also live according to the law (Halacha), which clearly declares man's responsibilities towards his wife. Not to beat or rape! And no one (even Rabbi) has power with the woman in the Mikveh.And Balanit. ! Director has clearly tried to bash Ultra Orthodox! But can he at least do it in a nice and more educated way? <br /> <br /> Love story? Cute! But not credible. Animals are long and dull. The end sucked completely. For all that drama I was at least hoping for a nice ending, for all the seats I felt I had earned it! Of course, someone tried to make a love-awareness movie for less striking Jews, or for non-Jews. Maybe. (Look at the Fundamentalist, they are so angry and mean ...) and they succeed! Long thing short: Hoping for a nice Europien (Kane level) movie, instead threw a tradition, unrealistic, misguided junk. I mean, today we live in a time of free will like never before. Everyone has the right to choose. Malka chose a rock singer. Rivka made her choice. They made him. Many people who do not notice backgrounds today choose Orthodox Judaism. For in this mad world religion can be a beautiful gateway!
