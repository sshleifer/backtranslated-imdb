Imagine every stereotypical, well-known cliche of every movie and television program set on Brooklyn streets between 1930 and 1980. Pop it up with a toss of caricature instead of real characters. Throw a mix of "period" music and whine electric guitars during the "rumble" scenes. Then pass the time to try out (or care for) which of the Deuces will be killed in the (anti) climax ultimate litter. <br /> <br /> I will give these movie points not just another romantic comedy, teen shots, explosive action movie, teen sex comedy, kiddie musical or Oscar nomination vehicle. But to make something new or interesting for the street gang tragedy genre might have been nice.
