A movie about a mysterious love letter that a small town puts on its ear, must be fun, romantic and easy entertainment. Instead, this movie is about things that have not been said and not expressed, so it comes to the point where you are grateful, anything is said, even if the dialogue is not exactly quotable. <br /> <br /> SPOILER - <br /> <br /> When the relationship says the most, one is least seen on the screen (Danner and McEwan), you know you're in trouble. But those two actresses are a very welcome sight in a movie screaming for some real people. <br /> <br /> END OF SPOILER <br /> <br /> Capshaw gets the job of creating a little character and she's not quite successful. As I said above, the theme seems to be oppression and I understand it is an element of life and love, but I also don't want to see a movie about it, at least not this. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend it at all, despite the talented governor left to care for themselves.
