The basic genre is a brand new demise with an uncomfortable menage a-trois. Fellowes tried to make much more of it by using the lies of the title to create all sorts of small twists, always designed to surprise the characters more than the audience. <br /> <br /> It's really quite messy. Fellowes does not seem interested in presenting the thriller elements in a way that will keep us seated. The focus is rather on the moral predicaments themselves. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is contradictory, stages here, language usage and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional clich√© landmine. Although there is no fascination at the venues, so the actors can continue with their space, the terrible score cannot create a further dimension and often work against the emotional momentum of given chapters. There is also a lot of prose, daring to say it feels like British filming. I didn't want to see a document of two successful middle-class people caught in an extraordinary situation. I wanted to see some kind of remarkable story of the story. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's the story that allows the rest. Just as the elements of tension are rather flat, the story is an asymmetrical sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes, woven as a vehicle for character examination. Wilkinson and Watson support this meta-set with good performances and John Warnaby's ebullient colleague Simon to Wilkinson is a welcome foil for many of the eyebrows. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed; Not that it was bad, but it could have been much better. 10/03
