Jeff Powers (Lou Diamond Phillips, "Young Guns 1 & 2"), a policeman with a history of criminals, is recruited in an elite clandestine LAPD division. It's not going well with Jeff's newspaper report, Kelly (Chelsea Field), who is looking for a group story. Soon Jeff's conscience gets the better of him, which is in conflict with Dan Vaughn (the unit's unit Scott Glenn, Hunt for Red October and "Backdraft"). <br /> <br /> That's A reasonably routine, dare I say everyday, cop-action / drama that offers no surprises, thanks to a cookie cutter plot that is content to go strictly from point A to point B. The act is good for what the actors do was given to work with however it is no real reason to watch the movie, just as sad to see as the six previous Mark L. Lester-directed films right in front of this one (from Class 1984 to Showdown in Little Tokyo) were all very entertaining vehicles. <br /> <br /> Eyebrows: Chelsea Field gets short topless <br /> <br /> My Grade: D +
