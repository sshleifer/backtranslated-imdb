Once you sit down to watch this movie, remember that you see something you've probably never seen before. Keep in mind that it is a movie where they naturally spend INSANE cash on explosions and not enough to act or anything else for that matter. The crazy thing I noticed is that each character is completely exaggerated, and the movie seems to have been picked up once to make the characters move faster! (I wonder if the Hong Kong version was also mentioned?) I understand the cartoon does, but it doesn't work for live action. It just seems strange ... as if the camera team decided to act because they couldn't afford real actors. <br /> <br /> The English version has been terribly baptized, and the character's words don't fit at all. I would have had instructions, but since it is a children's film, and since some children can't read well, I'll let it go. But there is something strange about this movie. It is supposedly a children's movie, but there are many material on SEX, RAPE, and STRIPPING that are not exactly for young Western audiences. (In the East, they have adopted different laws and sexuality in children's films much more). But parents are warned! There is a scene where two characters talk about rape, multiple scenes where people say 'sexmaniac' and a scene where this insane young Japanese girl makes a sexy dance for one of the 'sex maniacs' and shows him her breasts! Who made this movie anyway? <br /> <br /> Oh, and the special effects are laughing. You can tell the spaceship-like things that bombard the town are cardboard cuttings (or animation, I wasn't sure) that didn't even look convincing to a child. The creators of this movie left out very cold things from the cartoon, simply because they couldn't afford the kind of money they needed. I didn't like how the names of all the characters changed. It made me wonder if this movie was made by the same people as Dragon Ball Z. <br /> <br /> I didn't really recommend movie to anyone. Children, adults, or Dragon Ball Z fans. It's just a bad idea of ​​the cartoon, and of course one can see that this movie is rushing and there is no care about it. I won't even work in the camera. Just wait for the end points at the still photo that is set for 2 minutes. Most of the shots were not properly punched. ALL and the movie just looks made by amateurs. Grain film quality too. <br /> <br /> Just about everything awful !! <br /> <br />
