I think this is one of my top ten worst movies I've ever seen! There is like every two minutes. If it was on TV, they would have a preview every 2-3 minutes. But there is a view I have personally enjoyed: this is when the blonde goes to put a bath in a well of boiling water with a man watching and for about 10 seconds you see her whole body with no towel ! It was the best scene in the whole movie because you see sasquatch starring to them, but the last 10 minutes is when we see his whole body. Plus, most of the deaths are off screen and just shout or roar. And I expected the Sasquatch to die. But he doesn't shoot him and only 4 or 5 people die in the whole movie. I expected 8-10 people to die. Don't see this movie. I give it a F-. Don't waste your time.
