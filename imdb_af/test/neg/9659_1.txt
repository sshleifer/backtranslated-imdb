First of all, this movie is not close, my guess is that somebody actually bothered to steal every other page of the script. <br /> <br /> The movie contains bizarre time travel without notice, inconsistent dialogues, wrong details. In addition, the music is not bad at all, other than wrong tracks, and except that the volume between different songs moves up and down . The locker room really did a descent, and it says a lot. Misplaced sound effects destroy the voltage. <br /> <br /> Luke Perry does what he does best, but only worries, and occasionally he gets rid of hell. <br /> <br /> I consider this movie the worst of 2007, and I saw some bad people. Don't spend money on this one, it's not that bad, it's a laugh, it's worse. Above star rating, make a blacklist at IMDb because it's a damn lie.
