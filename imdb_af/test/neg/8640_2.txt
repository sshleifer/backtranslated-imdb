I watched Netflix Instant months ago and left a review there. <br /> <br /> Let me say, most of the other reviews are very accurate. This movie was bad writing, bad acting and bad directing. I also liked Russell and Pare from "back in the old days" and were very hopeful for them. In my Netflix review I mentioned that I had lost interest in the movie and had the dishes and made a sandwich, but still watched the movie from the kitchen. When I returned to the lounge, I was very confused as the last 5 minutes of the film unfolding. I even washed it back to make sure I didn't lose anything. This movie has been completely cut out on how to make a "turn" end. I suspect the idea sounded good, maybe the writing was intriguing, but the budget was so non-existent that sets were missing. And yes, I think all the bad sets were an attempt to give the viewer an idea. Everything it said to me was "low budget." <br /> <br /> Anyway, the reason I came here was because I saw Shutter Island over the weekend, and with what the judges said or didn't say, I was leading to believe that Shutter Island is the same, only with a budget of 50 to 60 times more! (Actually, I have no idea how much Dark World costs, but I hope they haven't spent more than 1 million!) <br /> <br /> So, it said, I thought if someone wrote rework a bit, have a bigger budget for a better "look" (or it means a better scenery designer, or better postcoloring, just someone with a vision). They can work Dark World back in a marketable product. Now it sounds like Shutter Island does. They seem to have the vision right, but the writing can still be finished. Money can't buy everything, but it has to be in Hollywood! <br /> <br /> PS My 2 star rating is for Russell and Pare.
