Friz Freleng's 'Snafuperman' is one of the smaller Private Snafu shorts. A warning of the importance of studying your field guide, "Snafuperman," shows it quite a lot. The story, in which Technical Fairy, First Class, Snafu makes in a super-man to help him see the mistakes of his ways, is predictable and unpredictable. Freleng's earlier Snafu short "Rumors" burst with ideas and laughs, but here the director is messing with a rather boring topic and he struggles to make an entertaining short of it. Even about three minutes, 'Snafuperman' seems to be dragging and, unlike the best cartoons in the series, it feels like an instructional movie first and entertainment second. Though faster than the usual Warner cartoons, the Snafu pants retained a surprisingly high standard. "Snafuperman" is a reflection of the kind of quality you reasonably expect from a less talented creative mind.
