This movie was absolutely horrible. Stupid premise, and terrible action by everyone. Whoever wrote this trash should be hung up. Remind me of a hack student movie, BUT TRUE. Anyone who ever made it must give up now. I know opinions are subjective and everyone, and some may think this "fantastic" as some think "Dune (1984)" was fantastic, going well out of your horse and watching real movies. OK, the acting was tolerant and with better direction it could have been much better, but it did not learn that way. I don't know how much more I can say about this waste of film, except to throw it off completely. Anyway, it was terrible and I recommend avoiding it like the pest, if you don't get anywhere near a dreamland, rent the movie next to it.
