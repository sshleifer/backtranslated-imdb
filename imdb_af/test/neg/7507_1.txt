Just when you think you've seen the worst that the zombie subgenre can offer, there's another budding Romero and his team of no talent to prove you wrong. <br /> <br /> I endured the Zombie Bloodbad trilogy, Death Valley: The revenge of bloody bill, put semi-comatose through the zombie diaries. He laughed hysterically during Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence and really thought that amateur movies couldn't sink lower. However, I just looked at the Zombie Planet, a two-hour fastening pile of writer / director George Bonilla. I think I found the best in horrible zombie movies. <br /> <br /> In this terribly amateurish effort, which is Mad Max's share and shares Dawn of the Dead (but ALL bad), Frank Farhat stars as TK Kane, a tough fighter who is the zombie ass a hobby kick, just with knives, a cup, some concussions and what he obviously sees as a real average look. <br /> <br /> After a desperate unspeakable opening series in which he embraces a horde of dodgy-seeking zombies, Kane springs with a group of survivors who must not only defeat attacks from the undead, but must also gang evil evildoers who controlled the area (by searching and handing over any valuable items they find). <br /> <br /> Of course, Kane is not the kind of man to take a bunch of z-grade post-apocalyptic bully boys, and he's about teaching the bad guys a lesson (mostly through them) a threatening way to glow, just pause to periodically save poles of zombies. <br /> <br /> With horrific action by almost everyone involved, a horrible script, ridiculous effects and crooked production values, there's virtually nothing in this movie to make it a worthwhile watch. To be honest, I like the basic premise that the zombies are the unexpected result of a highly popular slimming drug that urgently requires carbohydrates (we learn this as one character explains the story easily to Kane, which hardly has any idea what happened), but it's about the only vague interesting aspect of the whole production. <br /> <br /> I have some respect for anyone who succeeds in financing and making their own movie, but when the results are These poor, that respect is lost when they decide to make it available. set for public viewing. I would have liked this one if I made it.
