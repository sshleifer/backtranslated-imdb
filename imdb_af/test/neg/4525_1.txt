Another TV program becomes a movie. Steve (The Office) Carell plays fake agent Maxwell Smart in a movie that is so bad it makes the worst movie you've ever seen, the second worst movie you've ever seen. The seventh story - if you can call it, it has a megalomaniac that is trying to take over the world. It's so unique, it's absolutely pathetic. About the only thing that Anne Hathaway does as agent 99 looks good - she doesn't seem to be able to do anything else. Bill Murray has the fine sense of limiting his screen time to about 90 seconds, and a few TV series faces appear in very small roles. Movie is supposed to share thriller and share action movie. Nor is it. Although I really wasn't a fan of the TV series, it was at least lighter years before this piece. All these things are dragging it through the dirt and making it cheap, regardless of the good memories we had on it. Thanks, Don Adams is not here to see it. Keep it on Hollywood! Keep making such crappy movies and send them to the multiplexes a week. No wonder the film industry is going down the tubes. This movie is so rotten, it's not nice to laugh. If this movie was a newspaper, it could be used to arrange the bottom of a bird cage. There is absolutely no reason to see this movie. A root canal is more enjoyable than that. Rating zero minus five stars. Unless you're a Masochis, stay away. Better still, do what the title says-Get Smart and save your nine dollars. You can buy about 2 liters of gas with it. Put it in your car and be thankful you didn't waste it, go to a multiplex to see this bomb!
