I'm very interested in animal children and I've read a lot of Edger Rice Burroughs novels - but this horrible movie couldn't keep me interested, and I can't let go of all the absurd, unrealistic scenes. I just managed to sit down through the African part and John's first few days in Scotland. Let's talk about 'unrealistic' and 'straight stupid'! The actors in monkey cases look like extra-large chimpanzees, rather than big monkeys (there's a difference). They did not move with the grace that a wild animal would have. (For comparison, see some of the better Planet of the Apes movies where they trained their actors to move in simian fashion). The monkeys eat large pieces of meat - not a common monkey exercise as far as I know. I'm a struggle for animal stories, but the writing didn't care for me about the monkeys. The great white hunters of John Clayton's expedition are wholly charicaturish. Clayton's parents were hit on a seashore, but somehow it's a very long journey along the river to get to the coast - give me a break! Let's talk about 'slow'. Even the people who think it is an excellent movie, admit it is not an action movie. Far from it. It is trying to be a character study - unfortunately the straight dummy is dominating! I didn't read Burroughs' Tarzan books, but many of his other series - they were full of meaningful action and heroic purpose! This movie is just not there.
