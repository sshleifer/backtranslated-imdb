Why do I hate it? Let me list the ways: <br /> <br /> I have nothing against Mary Pickford, but a 32-year-old woman who is 12 years old is just stupid. <br /> <br /> There is a battle scene in which children throw bricks on each other and it is considered jokes --- and it goes on for 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> Strange as to whether any of the children are even remote. <br /> <br /> The title cards contain lots of racial and ethnic villains <br /> <br /> For a "family" movie the battles were too violent (loved it when Pickford chased it out with a little boy !) and the humor was just stupid <br /> Seriously, 40 minutes in, I gave up and turned it off. The slurry, racism and small children threw each other on each other. There was also no plot I could see. The only thing worth seeing in this movie was William Haines, a leading man in the quiet era. <br /> <br /> Not painful. Avoid.
