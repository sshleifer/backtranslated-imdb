It has some of the dumbest fights of all time. If I was a veteran of any war, I would cry when I watch this movie, not because I remember being in Vietnam, but because it is a poor representative of any war veteran. Although the troops carry M16's, the movie doesn't look like Vietnam. The Viet Cong uniforms look like old remaining Japanese uniforms from a WWII movie. Of course, the institution is a few crazy Hollywood back parties. The worst scene contains an American soldier fighting "hand in hand" as in a bad martial arts movie. After sending several hostile troops, he said, "Hey, come here and kick some!" to a helicopter in the air. He was then shot. This movie is trash.
