A repeat of a successful movie can at best be a difficult business; To make a true classic memory, especially one that is the definitive film of a director like Alfred Hitchcock, is something else again. And after looking at this version of `Psycho ', led by Gus Van Sant, two things immediately come to mind: What is the point, and what on earth do they think? Especially in view of the fact that Van Sant used the same script (by Joseph Stefano, who was taken from the novel by Robert Bloch) who used Hitchcock. The final result here highlights some of the finest aspects of movie filming: first, that a remake should be the same; use a retool of the original rather than a "copy" by new players; And secondly, shooting in color, with more blood and a bit more graphics, detracts little from the film's impact. Although it was a noble effort by Van Sant, it has, ironically, the same errors that Norma Bates has been harassed: The mind of the film is divided; half was Hitchcock, half of Sant Sant. And the two, already met, will never be bound. Van Sant, who even worked on the original screenplay, would have been better off making his own movie - all the way through - rather than trying exactly what Hitchcock did with some scenes. The opening shot of the movie, for example, and especially the "shower" scene, is probably one of the best known scenes in the history of the theater. Copy Hitchcock, from the shots that look directly into the shower head to one of the drains, and scream the same! shout! shout! "sound effects - even as a tribute to Hitchcock - again, derived from the story. And if you're in the actions of William H. Macy (as Private Eye Arbogast) factor, you have another split in the psyche of the movie. Macy is a tremendous actor - one of the best character players in the business - and his performance here is excellent, but as good as it is, the attitude and delivery is pure David Mamet (with whom he has worked many times), and apparently Out of context with what Van Sant does, so the movie comes with a triple personality disorder: Hitchcock, Van Sant and Mamet. I felt I was watching "House Of Good Will Psycho Games." '<br /> <br /> As far as performances are concerned, Macy's was as solid as they came, and Anne Heche (Marion Crane) created a good job of creating an original character, which is the fall of an imitation of Janet Leigh escapes The weak links were Viggo Mortensen (Sam), who made Marion's boyfriend so unattractive and unattractive, made you wonder why she was in the first place with him, and Vince Vaughn, what - just like that fine as possible - was just awful like Norman Bates, his entire performance was that of an actor who played a role (and not very convincingly); Due to effeminate ways and his speech with "spontaneous" outbursts of manic laughter , Norman has more caricature as a character, totally incredible and pretentious, giving the movie the feeling of a reenactment of a "True Incident" that you would see on a television program; the sensitivity of the movie to cut off Norman alone in his storeroom after a shot of a sober-faced Peter Graves, intimidating. "So was the thought of Norman Bates on that fateful reign when Marion pulled Crane out of her car and into his life. "The supporting film includes Julianne Moore (Lila), Robert Forster (Dr. Simon), Philip Baker Hall (Sheriff Al Chambers), Anne Haney (Mrs Chambers), Chad Everett (Tom Cassidy), Rance Howard (Mr. Lowery ), Rita Wilson (Caroline), James Remar (Patrolman) and James LeGros (Charlie the Car Dealer) .Nothing else, Van Sant's "Psycho" is a curiosity that suggests a good director, a predominant Excellent cast and a proven product are not necessarily a success, admittedly, the contemporary era of psychobabes, American Psycho and Hannibal Lecter slightly edged the edge of Norman Bates. but there is still a simple intimacy in this particular story of the relationship between Norman, his mother and his victims that will remain inherently disturbing and terrible forever, but Van Sant is unable to convey that sense of fear. there was ever a movie made straight-to-video had to be, this is the case. Better yet, it was never born. I rate this one 2/10
