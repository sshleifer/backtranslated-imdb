This is by far the worst I have ever seen on film. My uncle's home movies have more talent in them then, this piece of crap. <br /> <br /> The plot summary is basically that these twin kickers play a sick survival game with a man and his private army on an island. The man has a very cheap paper machine seeking hand. <br /> <br /> The play is horrible in this movie. There are scene changes at the drop of the hat. For example, for at least 30 seconds, we see a guy who magnifies a song for himself that doesn't add anything to the movie. It has the worst dialogue I've ever heard in my life. I don't think this movie can get worse if it's already. I would describe it as a will, Norris action movie went wrong. And I hate Chuck Norris.
