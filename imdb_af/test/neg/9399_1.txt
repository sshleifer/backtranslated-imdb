Ridiculous, deceptive dogsling with horrible acting; unceasingly, superficially and continuously trawling all the most banal clich√©s about Tuscany and Italy, divorce and means. The main actor grieved her through the film nervously and struggled to portray the appropriate level of smugness, self-congratulating self-pity, the worthless character and the essay. I'm sure the book was bad, but it couldn't have been that bad! The camera is permanently equipped with a javelin "Tuscan" lens filter (perhaps the Tuscan sun is not Tuscan enough?), Which they forgot to remove when the scene moved to Rome and (how imaginative!) The Amalfi coast. You have never seen the white marble of Rome's Vittorio Emmanuelle monument look so yellow. I mean Tuscan. One of the worst movies ever, so it's worth watching.
