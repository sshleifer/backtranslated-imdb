This film has the feel of a college project about it, which wants a breakthrough project, to see the theme. But it is not successful. The cinematography is poor, and the play even more. The characters, in my opinion, do not come as credible. The editing of the movie doesn't really work as well. There are many bad effects, which I believe are being put in to try to add a terrible effect. But to me it is just a feeling of indifference. <br /> <br /> I will stay away from this movie unless you are a dedicated movie freak who likes watching "different" and "horror" movies. However, I believe this movie is not worth watching for the average person. You get no pleasure from the bad effects, and the handycam feeling this movie offers its viewers.
