Movies like this upset me simply because they don't earn the funding that enables them to end up in my DVD player. This film is ambiguous in its jacket blurb and even more impenetrable in its decisive choices. (Why is Ms. Song a romantic interest? Do they just want an Asian woman there, or does her relentless character give the story of this "message" movie's story a fresh perspective)? One has very little to continue with the movie, and even less than the story unfolds. But a good hour in the proceedings, I realized that the dull casting is that all the casting agent can get. The unconvincing character studies are the result of writers' brain power, and the story is amorphous and plagued by impeccable references to the misery of capitalism, materialism, and advance in the postmodern world. By the end of this movie, just before I got caught and missed the last two minutes, I felt that "Everything's Gone Green" is a product of "connections" in the world of film - someone with very little talent knew someone with very little skill, knew someone with absolutely no marketing intelligence (but very disposable ego) and made this dull and ineffective attempt to haunt and humor-with-a-conscience nonsense. And that's what most malicious are - how much infinitely better scripts have been conveyed in favor of this almost immovable triangle? Skip this movie and feel good about yourself doing it.
