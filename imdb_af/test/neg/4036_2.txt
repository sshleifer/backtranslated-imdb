I had the terrible accident seeing this "b-movie" as a whole. <br /> <br /> All I have to say is save your time and money !!! It must be the worst b-movie. It should not even be called a b-movie, more like a f-movie! Because it fails in all aspects that make a good movie: the story is not interesting at all, all the actors are paper thin and not credible, it has a bad direction and the action sequences are so fake it is almost funny. ..... almost. <br /> <br /> The movie is just full of horrible one-liners that can't find a respectable person in the smallest bit amusing. <br /> <br /> This movie has to be aimed at men, but all the women in it are so totally unattractive, especially that old, wrinkled thing that comes to the end. They try to be sexy in those weird, horrible costumes and they fail! <br /> <br /> Even some of the most ridiculous b-movies will make you laugh, but it's just too painful to watch !!
