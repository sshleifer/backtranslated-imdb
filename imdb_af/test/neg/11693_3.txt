I'm a fan of the horror movie, no matter what hemisphere it comes from. I know what to expect from the West, the East and most terrors in the middle. So I received the DVD from 'Acacia' in the post and I look forward to a slow build of ever-increasing tensions and scary children with strange, unfounded movements hiding under quilts. <br /> <br /> The main selling point for this movie was that it has a much more linear story line than many of this ilk - you get who the characters are, where they come from and what they do. You get the baseline information (nice couple, can't have kids) and realize that the premise is just too normal for something freaky, NOT to happen. <br /> <br /> Then comes the bad. The number one complaint is that the story is insufficient. I got it pretty much the moment the child embraced the tree. I knew where the movie was going and even predicted the order of death and for what reason. <br /> <br /> Editing is shocking and unfortunately not for the benefit of the movie. Even though I was considering the events, tension was not allowed to build because the director received a new editing package for his birthday and wanted to use it as much as possible. <br /> <br /> And my final Gryp is ... the tree was unnecessary. It would have been a perfectly good story of subtle abomination with just the couple who came across the child's death. The titular tree bought nothing new or exciting for the movie. So I'll finish where I started - my overall impression was "Oh."
