It is the story of a neurotic woman struggling with the concept of marriage as a business arrangement, the romantic nature of a one-night stand and the uncertainty and fall of true love. <br /> <br /> Much of the story reminds of other recent KST movies (eg the English Patient), but has much less profession. <br /> <br /> After the first half - I checked my watch and wondered if I would make it home in time to catch Leno on TV. <br /> <br /> I passed Gladiator to see it!?!
