The DVD for this movie is by Alpha Video - a company that almost always releases the poorest quality prints. In Alpha's defense it is often the only print available, but specializes in public domain and inexpensive-o-movies. If you can get another picture from another company, try it first, because the print for this movie is scraping and blurring. Yet, compared to most alpha DVDs, this one is excellent, especially since the sound is quite clear (and alpha never appears to be closed captions - even with horrible movies). <br /> <br /> For a long time a man has been singing a lady. One night he was a bad boy and spent the night with another woman. Shortly afterwards, he came to his fianc√©e cleanly, forgiving him and marrying them. <br /> <br /> Soon after the wedding, he gets an angry call from the other woman - she must see him and have just tried to kill herself. When they meet, he learns that she has an SOS and she wanted him to know that he can have it now. Then, although there is a nurse and they treat her for the suicide attempt, somehow she finds a gun and kills herself! It makes a big mistake. He didn't tell his doctor and didn't tell his new wife. There has been a while and now she and the baby are infected! At this stage, the doctor meets with the man and tells him how important it is to get treatment and they show him rooms with extremely infected people (actually it was just movies of people with STDs they split into the movie - most of whom have syphilis). <br /> <br /> In some ways, the movie is very progressive. It addresses a serious issue and it is interesting how the film encourages couples not to wait to get married, but to get married quickly and to give up sexual urges - but with each other (not bad advice). On the other hand, the film never says exactly what it is talking about. They never use the terms STD, VD or the like, and even call it the diseases. Often it refers to syphilis but sometimes it refers to herpes or other STDs - the information is not very clear or specific - a very common problem with such films from this era. Audiences had to be very confused at the time about what they saw and many of the more naive probably needed to tell their "faster" friends what it was telling them all! <br /> <br /> In the 1930s and 50s, many small and often bad production companies spoke of "such films", which made films condemning the dangers of drugs and sex (although they are actually a bit of they wanted to promise cheesecake for audiences who usually can't see such a fast rate in Hollywood movies). Many of these are hysterically funny, as they are so over and the information is so inaccurate. The best-known examples are REEFER MADNESS and SEX MADNESS (both by the same two-bit production company) and compared to how boring and stupid these two movies are, this cheap movie looks like it should be in the Criterion Collection !! <br /> <br /> Interestingly, there are strangers out there (I'll definitely be included with them) who love to watch the movies because they are often so bad and so horrifying that they're fun. However, this one is not so bad, nor is the message complicated and the victims' movie is not as big as some similar films. While the message really had to be more explicit and useful, for a 1933 movie it was pretty good - despite the sometimes poor acting and the ridiculous suicide scene. Remember children - just say 'NO' suicide! <br /> <br /> Yes, the two years of treatment they are talking about were actually the norm for syphilis back in 1933. Nowadays, it's much more treatable - just like the rest of the STDs.
