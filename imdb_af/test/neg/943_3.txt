Let's start saying that there is really no reason to watch this movie. I just sat there because I tried to kill some time before working. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's your typical sophomorical "comedy" aimed at the teenage set. There is nothing remarkable about it, except for the complete ridicule of the story, not to mention that there are plot holes that are large enough to sail a Carnival cruise. Of course, it's not supposed to be a realistic movie, it's supposed to be funny. Unfortunately, it usually also fails that score. I have to admit that I laughed a few times, but mainly in a "holy sh * t, I can't believe how stupid it is" kind of way. <br /> <br /> If you never see this movie, don't miss anything.
