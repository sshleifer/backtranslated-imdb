What a terrible movie it was! I made it in about 50 minutes and started cutting up to the end. The plot is nothing special, and the dialogue of the movie deviates so much from the main story that your head will explode out of anger. Many useless minutes only waste to listen to characters about something that is irrelevant to the plot, and / or something that can be said in a shorter time. The camera work is shaky and granular. It was as if Mr. Milligan was needed to remove his finger from the zoom button! I also noticed that at some points during this movie it was as if Andy had seized and would shake the camera uncontrollably. The diagonal between scenes was jumping and didn't flow. The murder tones were nothing special - incredible and legally fake. Hardly any gore, as the title indicates. This movie runs about 1 hour and 20 minutes and the murder tones take about 1 minute TOTAL of the entire movie. What a miserable piece of garbage this movie was. Andy Milligan is probably one of the worst directors to plague man with his talented directing and camera work. Usually I can make it really bad horror movies and later laugh about it. BLOODTHIRSTY BUTCHERS, but I can't. I'm just angry, I wasted an hour and a half of my life to see it (which I wouldn't do to get it back). Suggest me, and DO NOT see this movie unless you are going to fall asleep. Awful.
