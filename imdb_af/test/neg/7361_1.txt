What starts out as an entertaining movie, turns into one of the most disjointed, innocuous, incompetent, stupid, attempted horrible films of the past year. <br /> <br /> Absolutely terrible. It's such a derivative mess that scares every decent fright that you can think of without frightening a single one. Whether it's the latest trend with crazy kids or ghosts running past the camera or the old schoolboy of Fulci's Gates of Hell. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that not even a cat jumps out of a cupboard to make you jump. To avoid.
