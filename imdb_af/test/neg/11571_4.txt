Twenty-nine years before 9/11, there were still 9/11 representing an important date in the history of Chile, South America and the whole world. It was the date in 1973 when a bloody coup in Chile Salvador Allende deposited the first Marxist president democratically elected worldwide, ending the Chilean experiment of a democratic transition from capitalism to socialism. Allende committed suicide when the armed forces attacked the presidential palace. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film is biased and too nostalgic to the time of Allende's reign to be an objective version of man and his place in history. The times were upset and Allende was a disputed figure in the history of his country and of the whole world. He was probably elected democratically, but his policy plunged Chile into economic crisis. He was hit by a coup and a right-wing dictatorship, followed by oppression and blatant human rights abuses, but he was also an ally of Castro who, in his policy, saw another way of making revolution. We will never know if his intention to build a socialist but democratic society has succeeded. The authors of the movie take a completely pro-Allende position. There is no point or point to explain the other way, to answer questions, such as why the middle class opposes or how its democratic standpoints can go with supporting or supported by Castro. The tone of the commentaries is nostalgic and apologetic, almost propagandic. People who want a better understanding of this episode of history should wait for a more balanced and objective film or book in the future.
