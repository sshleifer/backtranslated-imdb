It was a movie that could have been good if there were not so many unnecessary historical inaccuracies and if the actors were chosen or chosen to look a little more like the real people (not very difficult). Sissi did not go to Mayerling to see her dead son; she also did not die in the street; they took her to the boat and then back to the hotel, which was much more dramatic. I'm not sure about the wedding day, but I find it exaggerated that a lady waiting in the wait would dispose of the emperor and leave her completely naked (and in the 1850s) or that the emperor would proclaim "yes , I finally laid her down "to the meeting place. As far as I know, it was done right away on the first night and no one rewarded her as if she were a street walker. The saving grace of the movie is really Stephane Audran, excellent actress and true character.
