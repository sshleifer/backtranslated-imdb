It wasn't a good movie. Poorly written and performed - the concept was not new, the effects poor and not a showcase for Arnold Vosloo, who is really a half-actor. I watched it under a few protests and just remember that I saw it before - it is so forgetful. The play consisted of a number of shine and looks without sincerity. I was expecting it to go, and before long I just hoped it would end. As far as the medical pieces are concerned, I didn't expect a true version of ER events, but it was just comical. I'm a Dr, so know what I'm about. And the operative bits were simply silly. Don't waste your valuable time - unless you have absolutely nothing else to do - go out, call a long-lost friend, watch paint dry, sort your soccer tournament, do a household job. Avoid at your risk.
