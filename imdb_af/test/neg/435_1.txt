I just can't get it. Why is it a sequel to the movie "American Werewolf" when it has absolutely NO connection with it at all? The first movie was funny * and * scary with groundbreaking special effects. (If the memory is serving, the Oscar category for special makeup effects * was created * for this movie). "Paris" is not one of these things. Awful effects, and not much else. Don't see this movie. Hire the original "Werewolf in London" instead. You'll be much happier.
