Okay. I really tried to be in the (so-called) stupid and surrealistic humor that made this movie. I am told that the Japanese version of this movie is much shorter than the one sent to America (going figure!), And has fewer political references. Apart from that, I found this sexual / political farce just as boring and useless as standard porn. The central female lead is easy to spot and can actually act. I'd love to see her in a non-pink film where she could actually spread her muscles (and no, not the one you think). It is obvious that Japan (and indeed) can produce as much shit as other countries. I couldn't recommend it to anyone, with the distant possibility of someone having a Jones for Asian porn. Go see a real Japanese movie.
