A montage prologue, made naturally by the blessed maniacs who actually chose to spread this thing, is trying to convince us that the comic impact of these staggering incompetents is a bit of nothing intentional. Don't believe it: it is for Lloyd Kaufman as Andy Warhol is at Herschel Gordon Lewis. It is so thorough in his project to torture his hypothetical audience, that it seems to be a kind of misanthropic negational art installation, but it cannot be because it is so completely self-consciously deprived. As ominous and ugly as "Things" or "Frozen Shouts", it is right to improve the ante by regaining itself with a maddeningly bare urge to be seen to be believed. A Hitchcock-style shot-to-shot analysis of the attack on the cardio girls can deliver twenty changes and maybe three minutes of the recording - only the sequence is ten minutes long! You want to believe that it starts life as a slightly portable short subject, unless you have taken the repetition, it will be far less fascinating: eg. When the 'enemy' enters the room, he only inspires extensive, highly apathetic, completely blank stars from his imminent (off-screen) victims. Repeat this scenario about four times, in marginally divergent settings; use this with perhaps thirty lines of dialogue altogether; offers actors even more hateful and deadly than those in the above classics; and grace for us with a monster containing gauze, ketchup and one yellow Spock ear, and you have a movie too wise to refuse, a working definition of bad. I'm proud to own it!
