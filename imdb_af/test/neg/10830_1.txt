This movie does not even have the saving grace of so bad that it is good. It's really awful. It is closer to a tongue-in-cheek parody than a disaster movie, but unfortunately it was serious. Made for TV, but not worthy. It contains every clich√© and cheesy plot moment you can imagine. Oh, will he save the town from the flood? Will his wife admit that she still loves him? Will they escape before the flood drowns them? I can't explain how bad it is. Awful predictable plot that makes you win it is so cheesy. Bad effects (although to be honest, I saw worse overloaded water). Bad writing. Woeful acting. Horrendous. So bad in the fact that you should probably get drunk and see it.
