It's the scary movie ever made in Hollywood. This is a warning of how to take a European masterpiece and suck its life until it is a dry shell like an insect carcass on the windowsill. Terrible because it reveals how the world of Hollywood really works: ignorant money getting dross. It makes me wonder how many big movies the corridors of my memory can populate if the Hollywood process hasn't forgotten them for forgotten mediocrity. Shout for the murdered children! Look Trackless or read the Golden Egg if you dare, because they will return forever in the immeasurable moments of your life: when you walk along the street and you see a 'missing' poster; in ordinary parking lots; when you hear the Tour De France on the radio; And especially when you think "what is the damage?" in a sock with a hole on a perfect day. <br /> <br /> If I can just give it a zero.
