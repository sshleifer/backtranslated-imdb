This story had the potential of a good movie. The difficult choice of love for money and the anxiety and regret to make the wrong one. However, the film was devastated by the terrible miscarriage of Robert Redford as the villain who offered $ 1,000,000 to sleep with Demi Moore. As Redford has to pay for it. Redford's boyish looks good and All American charm just doesn't cut it as a unlikeable, threatening, drill. Redford's acting skills are insufficient to threaten his character. I can see it now, $ 1,000,000 to sleep with Robert Redford. OK the lady says, but you'll have to give me time to raise the money. Jack Nicholson would have been perfect as the slum ball.
