Hope Floats with Sandra Bullock is a real disappointment. The story starts well. Her husband deceives her and finds out on national television. Therefore, she must rebuild her life. Here it could have become interesting or built up in a story line, but you are so bored. She moves back with her parents and Harry Connick Jr., who plays, starts Justin hitting her. The two have no real chemistry at all, but you have to get the impression that Justin is in love with her. The movie ends as you think it will but you wish it didn't end like any other kind like that. They had a good start to this movie and could have made it into something visible, but instead it is a movie you definitely want to miss.
