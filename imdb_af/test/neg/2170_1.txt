At the vote I would give a 2, but when I saw that I was meant to hit it, it hit the nail on the head. The portrayal of Native Americans as bloodthirsty wildernesses is very upsetting to me. This is the third movie I of D.w. seen. griffiths where men's races are stereotyped in ugly ways. The man can't tell his side of the story, so I'm going to try to stay away from Mr. Griffith to attack personally. According to me, the three films are probably thinking of millions of people and their children's children. Films like this are probably made for many of the grudges that are still with us. Some may say the camera work was great, the action is the first for the time. The positive is far off the negative, it's like someone taking $ 10 away and giving back a money to make it up.
