I watched this movie 2 weeks before a snowboarding holiday, so it was really just for me to get hold of my thoughts for my vacation. The movie boasts some sweet snowboarding skills, throughout the movies in action scenes. These moments were wonderful, a bit like extreme sports channel watching. Unfortunately, the story was terribly horrible, the acting was generally good, with a rather small role. This movie is apparently comedy, it tries to be comic at least, but it seems as if the comedy and the storyline were written by a teenager. The story lacks any depth or purpose and the comedy struggles to be more than a little snigger a few times during the movie. It may be worthwhile to rent just to watch the snowboarding action, but then there are many movies out there that are totally dedicated to snowshoes and do not contain a UN funny badly written story.
