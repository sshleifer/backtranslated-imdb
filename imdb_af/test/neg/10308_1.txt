Wow, there are no words to describe how bad this movie really is. I'm usually proud of the fact that I can make a movie, no matter how bad, but it was just too much. I would just suggest watching this movie as a torture device. If you get past the horrible plot and dialogue by looking at it dumb, make the movie-most camera work and slim special effects this movie a real horror. If your thoughts consider it because your Sandra Bullock fan doesn't even bother, because she has less than ten minutes of screen time, and her acting is absolutely horrific. Not to mention the rest of the cast, which can be replaced by baboons who would do a better job, we should not at least listen to the terrible dialogue.
