I have a question for the writers and producers of Prozac Nation: What is the cause and what is the solution to the widespread problem of personal depression in America? In the moving performance of Christina Ricci as Liz Wurtzel, the film portrays a young woman with unlimited potential as a Harvard student and as a writer. But this is not a story of success, just one of self-destruction as we watch Liz brings misery into the lives of all who come into contact with her. The film explores divorce, family dysfunction, drugs, alcohol and prescription medication as possible reasons for Liz's unhappiness. But none of the superficial statements is satisfactory. <br /> <br /> At some point in the movie, it would have been helpful to suggest that Liz should take responsibility for her life and her problems. There was no light on what the film allegedly was a runaway problem in the United States of Depression. In the story, Liz has a caring therapist (Anne Heche), a caring roommate (Michele Williams), a caring boyfriend (Jason Biggs) and a troubled but caring parent (Jessica Lange). In an important scene in the film, Liz lies in a hospital bed and looks at breaking up the spacecraft Challenger. Instead of comparing Challenger with Liz's life, the film had to use the image as a starting point for her healing and recovery. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me of a generic movie victim movie on the lifetime network. An excellent movie was wasted, especially in the seriousness of Christina Ricci. Of course, the real Elizabeth Wurtzel found herself the resources to handle her depression and become a successful writer. It is a pity that the film cannot even give us the slightest glimpse of her courageous spirit.
