This is my first Almodavar movie. I would admit we chose it mainly because we knew it had the prospect of Antonio Banderas in gay sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is just about everything this movie recommends. I consider myself a fairly sophisticated viewer, I like European movies, "art" movies, and I can generally recognize a quality film, even if it's not for my specific taste. <br /> <br /> But this movie was a complete look to me. The plot was ridiculous, the characters lifeless, the box called it a hilarious comedy, but I didn't even laugh. Loosely and uncomfortably built, with a very senseless dialogue. I don't get it at all - it looks like an amateur effort. Can anyone relieve me?
