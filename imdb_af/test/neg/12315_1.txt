Just about everything in this movie is wrong, wrong, wrong. Take for example Mike Myers. He reached the point where you realized that his criticism hadn't changed more than ten years ago since his SNL days. He does the same funny minds and voices. His cat is painfully unfunny. He tried very hard. He's a funny type A comedian, not the cool cat he's supposed to be. The rest of the movie is just as bad. The sets are incredibly ugly --- and a waste of millions of dollars. (Cardboard clippings for the background buildings would have made more sense than building an entire neighborhood and main street.) Alec Balwin tries to make a funny big Santini impression, but he still ends incoherently. There is even an inapropriate cheesecake moment with faux celebrity Paris Hilton --- keeping in mind, as it is supposed to be a Dr Seuss story. Avoid this movie at all costs, people. It's not even an interesting train wreck. (I hope they will make Horton Hears a Who with Robin Williams. Then we will have the bad Seuss movie stars spasitc comedian trilogy.)
