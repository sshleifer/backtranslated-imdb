This movie is shot with a digital camera, and it shows. There were plenty of annoying digital tricks used to alienate the viewer, even with a terrible score. As if that wasn't enough, the play was terrible too. Now in Hartley's movies, the play is always peculiar, but here it was just BAD, especially by Satan (Thomas Jay Ryan) and Harvey, who (thank you) didn't say much. After all these external problems, it is also a pity that the story itself is not that good either. The jokes are predictable and incredibly straight, and the events just jump from one incident to the next. The so-called book of life with Armageddon inside is not much more than an excuse to see actors struggling to say their lines. All in all, this movie is a waste of time and money and effort. Thumbs off.
