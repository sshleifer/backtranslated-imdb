This movie she tries to capture that classic bad Canadian movie: <br /> <br /> "peculiar" and unpleasant characters (a few); "peculiar" town with "peculiar" people; a "strange" coffee shop or restaurant (coffee shop here); many shots of Canadian stuff for postcards (ocean food here); many call "come from this town"; straight drilling. <br /> <br /> And it succeeds at all points. <br /> <br /> Something to notice, though. I couldn't figure out if this film is just trying to be "strange" comedy or something surreal like a drug-induced or psychotic hallucination after north exposure. Editing this movie unknowingly jumped from one unrelated thing to another, with zero pacing or motivation. Not to mention the fact that half the time we didn't even know where we were going. For example, take the very first shots to scream teenagers in a car. Who are they and what did they do with something? And this sub - uh plot (use that word plot loosely) concering children who seem to stretch generations. I don't think they actually do, but the editing makes it seem like they came from flashback, suddenly to the present time. Huh? What am I missing out on? <br /> <br /> Avoid. Unless you laugh. Or you want to try out the improper editing.
