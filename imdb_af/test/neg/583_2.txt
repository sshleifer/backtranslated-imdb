OUR TIME had a chance for a feature film in his 22-year history, and that was the best thing to do? It's boring, forced, and useless, and I have to agree with the other poster on this movie; the 1994 LITTLE RASCALS remake was better than that. Almost everything is. The children are subordinate to the Civil War proceedings; It doesn't feel like a GANG movie, but like a humorous, second-hand Shirley Temple clone.
