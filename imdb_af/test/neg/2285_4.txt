Thunderball and Never are two of the biggest cash missions and are never a surprise father of Empire Strikes Back hero Irvin Kershner. Klaus Maria Brandauer seems to steal the show, when Bond's mission in the middle of the unfolding plot moves more to Hollywood skirt (Sometimes when Basinger enters). How about Klaus Kinski? I still think Largo's casting or, as evidenced by both films, breaks the story. The worst of all is the attempt to dispel the aging and very hairy Connery, as the gender symbol was indeed in the 60's. The 80's was an infertile time for Bond movie mostly, but for Your Eyes Only is a good title. Sometimes, if I have to spend some time over the holidays watching this movie in the regular band of Bond festivals, I think the best feature of the movie is its score, and I'm not in soft '80s' jazz.
