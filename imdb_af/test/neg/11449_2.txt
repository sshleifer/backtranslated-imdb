The subject was good, direction was OK. Mohanlal was effective in his role as a major. The actions of the supporting actors were at best amateurish. The deciding director and director must be held accountable for this debacle. Hawaldar Jai was horrible, he stood like a sore thumb with his poor histrionics. He didn't look the part, and didn't move like a soldier. There was a scene where a satellite feeding of the skirmish with the militants was needed and they showed it from a camera angle. Satellite is a hundred miles in the air, so the only angle is from above. It was quite an embarrassment. The audience nowadays becomes mature and recognizes when one tries to pull wool over their eyes. The director is a master, so the story can be beyond his personal experience. No problem there, but the movie is just as good as its actors and directors. So when Major Ravi goes for any other projects, he needs to pay more attention to the decisive.
