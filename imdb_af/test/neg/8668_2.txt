I read a lot of Jane Austen in my time and approve of several theater / TV adaptations, but this one we just don't need. <br /> <br /> Appreciation is a 2 because I don't want to say it's just not that boring you will feel like you've wasted 90 minutes of your life. Dull writing that matches even duller acting. I heard Billie Piper is OK in Dr. Wie (not a fan, can't confirm it), but in it she just sucks. There is absolutely no chemistry between the leaders. It's Austen, it's supposed to be a romance! <br /> <br /> Don't let it pass, or Austen or historical plays. There are many better programs to watch.
