The original airport (1970) was a classic type, and the first two B-movie sequels (Airport 1975; Airport '77) were at its best, but this crass and infinite final entry had no entertainment value and shows a shocking contempt for his audience. It is unusable and not even good to laugh. <br /> <br /> All three airport successors were theatrical releases made by Universal's television wing, but one is even under the modest standards of a TV movie of his day, with cheapjack production, cave casting. visual ugliness. and tasteless, unfunny "comedy". The project is clearly doomed by the "creative" efforts of universal executive Jennings Lang, who personally produced and received a "story" credit. <br /> <br /> Everybody starts somewhere and writer Eric Roth (Forrest Gump) may have an element of self-burlesque, like the previous films (especially the infamous Airport 1975), but there's nothing worth it in Roth's turgid, incoherent writing and even the comedy plane! It left the litter untouched. <br /> <br /> What makes The Concorde: Airport 79 especially offensive is the abusive abuse of professionals. The worst victim is the highly gifted Cicily Tyson (Sounder, the autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman), relentlessly reduced to a regrettable subplot in which she accompanied a frozen heart transplant on the unfortunate flight. <br /> <br /> A special kick for the groin is reserved for the amazing George Kennedy, who is the real lead, despite being thrown into the list. The official mascot of the "Airport" series and the only actor who appeared in all four movies earned Kennedy more than the lead and his turn in the captain's seat would be the only possible reason for this entry, except the pinch of one last book. Kennedy offers the only warmth and humor in this mechanical muckup, which briefly sets aside the bravura machismo and reveals a true sweet and gentle touch to himself, and his sweet and heroic character of Joe Patroni. Unfortunately, we should never forget how fat and old and over Kennedy is, and excessive boy Alain Delon mercilessly calls him "Porky Pig" as part of a totally flat, buddy bonding. Even Kennedy's Parisian romance, the only human part of this plane wreck, is simply a set-up for a hateful joke on Patroni's, Kennedy's and the viewer's expense.
