Set in the mid-1800s when the British cleared the New Zealand Outback wilderness to settle colonies. The daughter of a British army surgeon, Sarah (Samantha Morton), falls in love with the son of one of the Maori leaders. The Maori is a native tribe and a dangerous people for the Europeans to deal with. By the time Sarah's child, who calls his "Boy" born, his father died. By the age of six, "Boy" is kidnapped by his father's family and Sarah will start her search for him with a man (Kiefer Sutherland), who is in love with her. <br /> <br /> Twice Oscar nominee Morton is definitely the star of this movie. Sutherland is a total waste. The lead actors are Cliff Curtis, Stephen Rea, Temuera Morrison and David Rawiri Pene. This movie is R evaluated for sexual content and violent combat tones. I find the title RIVER QUEEN very misleading and the DVD cover with Sutherland and you believe he is the leading star should be a crime.
