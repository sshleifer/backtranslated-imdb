Should I say more? The reason why the GOOD Australian version of Kath and Kim, as mentioned, was good, was because it was hilariously funny originality. The reason why this new American version is so dreadful is because many of them are taken directly from the original. Not to mention the infidelity to the characters. Kath is meant to be a day. Kim is meant to be fat. Kel (or Phil as they called him) is meant to be pathetic. Brett (or Craig) is meant to be a loser, not a person acting like heroin and completing every sentence with "man". Thanks, Szubanski didn't sell her rights to Sharon. She will probably be a long-haired blonde who loves Kim. <br /> <br /> Kath and Kim are MOTHER AND DAILY. They are not meant to look 2 years apart. And they're not meant to giggle like schoolgirls. This show is a shame to share even the same title as the Australian version. America: Get your own television shows.
