First, I just want to say that this show could do well, better than it does now. What made it down was definitely the acting one. Miranda Cosgrove, acting as main character, became almost worthy of her own performance when she was on Drake and Josh. Unfortunately, iCarly was a major disorder. Not only can Miranda act convincingly, but she is incredibly stiff when she moves. She looks as though she is not sure how the character will "move" or stand. In the very first episode at the end when she throws the hat, her arm never leaves her side of her elbow. Even when she was dancing, she looked like a stick in the wind. And the song? The theme song was great, just because Drake was in it, the music was pretty good and Miranda's voice sounded fake. I must admit, the plot and settings are good, unrealistic, but hey, it's Nick. They are virtually known for stupid lines and characters. But wow, iCarly is the worst of them all.
