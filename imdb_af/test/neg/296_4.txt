I've heard a lot from this new bird flu that has killed dozens of people in South East Asia over the past three years. Apparently it is on the threshing floor to change into something contagious and millions of millions of people will be wiped out in a global pandemic. I thought I'd call it if you haven't finished writing your will yet. <br /> <br /> I also thought I'd mention it because I watched something CARRIERS watched tonight not "about the naval war, but open with a scene crossing OUTBREAK and" an episode of THE X FILES I saw many years ago. I thought I would look at the stories about the dangers of bird flu with extra resonance, but after the non-impressive opening career fall into a cheap and cheerful TVM and like every other TVM you see the main characters are female, one of which bald authority figure is while the other main wife is a mother of young children. It goes without saying that there is also a sick child subplot. <br /> <br /> What is annoying about the TVM format is that it overwhelmed the potential of being a good movie if it was made for cinema. There is a rather boring scene of someone coughing blood over a nursing face and an impressive jay walker is running, but these bits are soon forgotten, as the mood has since come down in the family sentiment. And just about every other TVM ever made was made for a substantial female audience
