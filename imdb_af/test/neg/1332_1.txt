Wow, talk about terrible. Don't waste your time. I wish I had seen the other use comments first. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, I didn't watch the whole thing. It was just too terrible. The worst, sappiest dialogue ... I could go on and off. But what really made it unwavering was the direction. Those poor actors. You can't even tell if they have talent, because they don't just have pathetic lines to talk to, but the director didn't give them any action. If you check out the directors' filmography on this site, you'll see why this movie didn't have a chance. <br /> <br /> It won't even be good if a TV movie is made. <br /> <br /> Ouch!
