"You're in the Navy Now" is painfully bad: probably the worst movie, Gary Cooper, ever made. It's supposedly based on a true story, but the incident inspired this movie doesn't seem to have enough plot to maintain a feature-length script. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on local television while I was home-sitting for my mother-in-law in Long Island, New York. There was a furious blizzard outside, and I was literally snowboarding. If I could get the door, I would definitely not have seen this movie anymore. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting names in the supporting role, especially Charles Bronson (under his original name), Lee Marvin, Harvey Lembeck, Jack Webb and Jack Warden. Forget about it. Everyone stinks in this movie. Even the usually reliable Millard Mitchell is terrible. Lee Marvin and Jack Warden are so short on the screen, there is no point to look at you. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper plays a clear naval officer dedicated to driving a ship powered by a new experimental steam turbine: basically the whole ship is a giant teakettle. Cooper realizes that the command is not a sought after one. If it were, it would have gone to a better officer. <br /> <br /> Cooper was a good actor in dramatic roles, but he simply didn't have a comedy. He made several bad comedies, and this one is his worst. Jane Greer has always bored me, and she has bored me more than usual. This ship went off with all hands and sank without trace. Did I mention this movie stinks? I'll rate 'You're in the Navy Now' a point out of 10. Toot! Horn!
