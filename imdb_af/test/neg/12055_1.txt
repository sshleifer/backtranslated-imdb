But I can't say how I really feel about this pile of steaming dung. Where to start. The movie quality, there isn't any. I saw clearer photos on America's FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS! The acting is substandard, the gore effects are good. The clown mask is the best part of this movie, the story is repetitive. The same thing over and over. At least in a Friday THE 13th or HALLOWEEN we hold the bulk of the main character. There are no main characters, only victims. Man, now we come to the worst part of everyone. The last survivor killed the clown and found it one of her friends. When the police finally arrived, they didn't believe her and she was locked in a rubber room. What kind of termination do you call it, crap, that's what. In my opinion there is no excuse for a bad end in a horror movie, it was just messy writing. The excuse, "It must be bad, it's a horror movie." or "We must stop it from opening it to a successor" is just excuses, and that's all. I must give the THANKSGIVING TURKEY the CAMP BLOOD.
