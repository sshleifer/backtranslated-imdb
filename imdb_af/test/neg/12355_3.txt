Gotta add a comment to this one! <br /> <br /> First of all, ironically, you need to add the "spoiler alert" to meet IMDb's parameters, but there's absolutely nothing to spoil it. </ br /> <br /> There are six characters: the beautiful gal that the A-list mountain guide in the "climb" area and apparently among all the guides (including Mount Everest Sherpas) on the planet; her lost love, which left two years before the title, who allegedly sought the party but never found it; her shop owner friend, also a guide, who could be better than a Sherpa, but no match for her; the strange chief actor who involves her services and says they will find her long-lost love in the bargain; she is a co-worker, a computer hacker with seemingly unlimited expertise, of a level sufficient that Gates may seek advice from him; and his other colleague, a bodyguard who believes an IQ does, even close to three digits. <br /> <br /> There is, of course, ominous actions, and the secret actor's main quest is to recover from a satellite that has fallen into the "Pass" and has world-changing and unique data for their unprecedented wealth to bring. Exactly what is never revealed. <br /> <br /> The text looks like something that a C-in can get in a new writing school (but a F if it is submitted at a higher level) and the thesis <br /> <br / > The most interesting aspects of this movie for me were serving parties with three other movies or roles I saw. <br /> <br /> First, the mysterious, inexplicable secret data reminds one of "The Spanish Prisoner", an A-list / Mamet movie, which contains a valuable corporate "process", which is never specific. explained, but better for it. Certainly not here. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the cookie may have proved even more resourceful than "Rambo" in handling when threatened later in the presentation. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, I remember a Steven Seagal flick (don't remember the title) where he was half aware and had about 1/3 of the time and fully comatos for another 1/3. Although I didn't look much at his work, I saw enough to notice that he is already getting the best work he ever had, and most in line with his laconic persona. In this opus, while awake, the young hacker could have been the most engaging personality on the screen, but while he was incompetent and incompetent during the last part and was unable to emulate, he was the best observed during this seemingly infinite two hours. /> <br /> Take the thin, silly base for a plot here. Imagine being compressed in, for example, a lbit on SNL, with Gilda Radner, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Martin Short in the four roles. They can record low with little changes in the dialogue here. <br /> <br /> The most interesting aspect of the last analysis is to consider what information has been in the spy satellite to be "even billions" worthwhile for any of many nations, yet made worthless (according to the guru hacker) if it is only placed on the internet, without any adverse effects thereafter? Even a turkey like this one should have at least a small trace of logic somewhere. This one is completely empty.
