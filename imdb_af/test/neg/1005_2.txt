Three businessmen are involved in a state battle with three mysterious men. The three businessmen take revenge, which increases after the other murder. The story is probably about the violence that can happen to ordinary people. <br /> <br /> The plot has too many holes. The details were ignored to move the story forward. The acting was uneven. The color balance was terrible, although I watched this movie in DVD. The small budget and meticulous schedule were clear. The whole thing seems to be an excuse to shoot the final rifle, and the end was just incredible.
