Thunder Alley banned Fabian from NASCAR tracks after another driver was killed. Stanley Adams may want to put him on his team of racers, but the other drivers aren't there to have him. <br /> <br /> Desperate for employment. Fabian makes a propaganda owner, Jan Murray, to whom he pays him. peanuts and try to capitalize on Fabian's bad rep. He has to take it, but Annette Funicello, whose Murray's daughter, offers another reason to hold on. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is Fabian's struggle to return to the NASCAR circuit while also Annette and his current girlfriend Diane McBain. Personally, I would have taken McBain, she has it all about Annette. <br /> <br /> Thunder Alley is helped by shooting at the southern NASCAR songs and good NASCAR racing movies. Not helped by a pretty stupid story that comes true for Fabian's problems and his rather unrealistic recovery of the same. <br /> <br /> More NASCAR fans can go for this.
