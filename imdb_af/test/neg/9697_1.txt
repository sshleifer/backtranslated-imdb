This movie could have been an impressive epic, but the makers have done their utmost to make it foolish. Even God himself is not spared in this movie because his words are infused with childish jokes. The result is defamatory and irritating. Only people who do not mind seeing a cheap parody on the biblical story may see this film embarrassingly. The makers of this tasteless production should see 'Il Vangelo secondo Matteo', a film by Pier Paolo Pasolini, which shows that it is not necessary to distort the words of the Bible to make a good story; The most impressive result is obtained by a genuine version of the plain text itself.
