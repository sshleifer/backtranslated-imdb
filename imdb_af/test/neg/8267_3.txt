I found this a very disappointing experience! But I added a better style of similar style to this entry. <br /> <br /> This "Felicia's Journey" is intriguing. It has drama. But it's full of stereo types! <br /> <br /> So it serves only judgmental temperaments without caring for more honest justice and fairness and truth, above black 'white judgments that fit 30-second ads of "NEWS" that track our multimedia experiences everyday especially news bulletins, true or misleading in such depictions! <br /> <br /> It's so increasing, it reminds me of the Little Red Ridinghood fairy tale! Consider the innocent young girl with no identification over the borders questioned by a guard, but free without any evidence to look for her "Romeo" who did not give her an address, because the pathetically inappropriate lack of substance in the gritty voice of the "helping hand" befriends her with its unlikely story made by the layer! <br /> <br /> It seems to suit the directors and management team that no one has faith or prayed to God, even in their times of despair! <br /> <br /> So in these early settings orchestrate it and tell a lot about what's coming! A nightmare betraying the essence of substance without fairy tale resolution, without truth or integrity or credibility! ... Then turn over and it's over. What a disappointment! If you want to see a much better movie exploring similar themes with much more credibility, with much more powerful insight, look at the 1983 Paul Cox / Norman Kaye "Man of Flowers" movie !!! <br /> <br /> Unlike here you won't be disappointed!
