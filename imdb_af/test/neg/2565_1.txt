I don't know about the rest of the viewers of this movie, but personally I'm dead and sick of Steven Seagal movies. When the law came out, it was a good action movie. Wahoo. Now in the Patriot, Steven Seagal plays Steven Seagal from above the law. I get tired of seeing no character changes. It's the same character, time and time again, over time. He needs change. This movie was probably one of the worst action movies I've ever seen. To call it an action movie, it gives almost too much credit because there are too few action scenes and they are widely distributed in the film. I think they wanted to go for some drama, but it was a meaningless attempt, as the film depicts nothing but the regular equator Steven-Seagal, we saw thousands of times. Get a new look and lose the pony tail is all I have to say, I definitely didn't recommend seeing this movie in any form, going out to eat, hey, renting Barney going to Vegas, but don't come under this circumstances rent this movie under the prescription that Seagal will perform well.
