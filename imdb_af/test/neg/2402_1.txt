SPOILER - This movie gives away plot points and discusses the end. I hated this movie - mostly for political reasons, but also for moral and aesthetic reasons. Politics, this film glorifies war and military technology - really blows things up. We are led to bravery as the music swells and the Afghans use our weapons to blow the Rusks. And no American soldiers are jeopardizing their lives - so it's a fun war. Aesthetically, there is not a touch of true human emotion in the film, just smug, privileged people are sarcastic, feel better and do what they want, regardless of the consequences. And because of the consequences, the film only makes a few small hits that actually led the Afghan disarmament. I read a previous concept of this script, and it ended on 9/11 - with Charlie Wilson realizing that things went really wrong. But it won't make the audience feel good. It's a good movie about killing Ruskies. And it made me sick.
