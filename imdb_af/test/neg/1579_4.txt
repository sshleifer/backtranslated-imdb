I'm a big fan of the ABC Movies of the Week genre. I'm just 27, which means I wasn't even born after the series ended, but I'm trying to pick up as much as possible on DVD. I have about a dozen or so. I read such wonderful things about this movie, both here and elsewhere, that I was very excited to see it. I just received my DVD today and watched it anxiously. I will admit that the first or two phone calls gave me the creep - that boy's voice will give someone the crawl! But it started to work fast and the whole divorce plot was stupid. I also figured out that Michael Douglas was the antagonist about half an hour before the movie ended. Once the story is told how Elizabeth Ashley's character locked his mother, I knew something was fish. Plus, no one ever thought about asking him why he suddenly happened that night when the fire was in the barn? I would admit that I thought he had coached a boy at the school to make the calls. I didn't guess the dumb boy or the prescribed tapes (did they ever say whose voice it was? I doubt Douglas could ever get his voice so high?). <br /> <br /> I'm just giving this movie four out of ten, because I liked most of the actors in it. Ashley is especially good. <br /> <br /> This is a pity, because this movie has such a good point of departure, but oh well, that's what sometimes happens when one gets his or her hopes for a movie too much.
