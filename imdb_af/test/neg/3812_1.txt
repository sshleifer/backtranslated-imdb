Harry Knowles has a quote directly on the cover of the DVD titled "The Next Icon of Horror". Actually?!?!?!? I heard a lot of hype around this one, but I wasn't quite convinced. However, I am a mortal horror fan and will just give a chance about any horror movie. No matter the budget or the rating, you never know where you're going to get the next jewel. Not here. Not Hatchet. Hatchet was poorly thought out, poorly behaved and not funny. Just because you had actors playing Freddy Jason and Candyman and a Buffy-chic topless with tons of tons, don't make you a horror expert. I don't even want to describe the plot, because it's so idiotic. Honestly, my money is on Rob Zombie. There is a man who knows old schoolgirls. Forget this trash.
