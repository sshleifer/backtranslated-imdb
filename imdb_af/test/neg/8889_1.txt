This movie is so bad, it's out of faith. Even for an independent low-budget film ... it's just fine, suck. I can't even believe that Troma would smear such crap. I was a fan of some Troma movie for years (Toxic Avenger, Squeeze Play, Rockabilly Vampire to name a few). But LLoyd, come on, it goes far beyond the limits of any taste. It contains some of the worst-acting imaginable. I think it would have been possible to find unemployed street people who have been so good ... oh wait, that's what they did. I mean, these characters have negative charisma. With any luck, the producer and director of this movie will have a huge karmic debt because of this cruelty. Like the special effects people. Apart from the horrific acting and the terrible special effects, the dialogue is absolutely traumatic for the ears. The script is full of plot holes, the size of Alaska, and there are serious continuity issues. The worst part, however, is that it doesn't even entertain the smallest way. And this is the most unforgiving sin in making movies. But don't take my word for it. Go out and waste four dollars to rent it. Don't say I didn't warn you.
