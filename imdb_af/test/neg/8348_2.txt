This movie is a disaster in a disaster movie. It's full of great action scenes, which only makes sense if you throw all the sense of reality. Let's see, word for the wise, lava burns you; Steam burns you. You can't stand next to the lava. Deriving a small lava flow is difficult, let alone a significant one. Scare me to think that some can actually believe what they saw in this movie. <br /> <br /> Even worse is the considerable amount of talent this movie has made. I mean the play is really good. The effects are above average. Hard to believe someone reads the scriptures for this and let all this talent be lost. I think my suggestion would be that if this movie is about to start on TV ... look away! It's like a train wreck: it's so terrible that when you know what's coming you just have to look. Look away and spend your time on more meaningful content.
