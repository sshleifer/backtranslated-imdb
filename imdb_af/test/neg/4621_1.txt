I want to believe that all the new horror movies coming from Japan these days are edgy and look great. <br /> <br /> Spinwood is also not. <br /> <br /> It's rare that I've finished watching something and ending up teed for the waste of time, but Spider Forest was an exception in this regard. I was very teed off. The creators of the film passed on one level; Throughout the movie I couldn't stop because I wanted to see the answer to the puzzle spun from the storyline. I couldn't stop looking. That's why I was so angry when the movie was finished. They've been dragging me for this POC for 2 hours. WARNING: Spider Forest is still one of the Japanese "ghost" stories, though you don't realize it's going to be. <br /> <br /> I never want to see a Japanese ghost story again. They are fake and confronted. "It's a ghost story" has become like a great mediocre to clear any and all insoluble plot holes you have in your storytelling.
