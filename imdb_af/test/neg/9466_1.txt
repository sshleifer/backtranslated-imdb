My friends and I watched so much time that I lost. It's worth seeing for those who are in the right mindset, which is not such a good horror movie as a movie for the funny quotes and bad effects. This movie is best viewed with other similar individuals, so you have someone to laugh with. <br /> <br /> You will laugh as Greg jumps and shuffles around the lab, his pet king, while his heel is moving from the right. to go on his back. "Greg, stop clowning!" Brandon. You will laugh like J.G. Patterson gives hand signals to direct Greg to the other side of the desk while his hand is in the lap. And you'll probably chuckle when you realize that the final woman doesn't have one of the features he used to build her.
