The Willies start late one night when brother Josh (Joshua Miller) and Kyle (Jason Horst) camp outside with their cousin Michael (Sean Astin), deciding to tell the time by telling scary stories. <br /> <br /> First, Michael, with a story called "Bad Apples," in which a young boy named Danny Hollister (Ian Fried) is plundered at school, but the sinister new keeper, Mr. Jenkins (James Karen) decides to help him. . <br /> <br /> Next is Kyle, as he calls a strange story, "Flyboy", in which an overweight bully with a disturbing fascination with dead flies he deserves in a horrible way. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Brian Peck The Willies didn't do much to me and I doubt if it would do you much. The script is strange as far as episodic anthologies go, instead of the usual three or four stories, it has only two main stories and a few bizarre "urban myth" type mini-scenes at first, it consists of the person who ordered food from a fast-food restaurant just to find a dead rat in her chicken, a man who died of a heart attack on a ride and someone trying to dry her puddle in the microwave just to explode it. I have no idea what the purpose of these scenes is, but they do not add anything to the movie, as for the two main stories they both are weak. For a start it is too long, which is a big mistake in these types of movies, usually the stories in anthologies are short, sharp and fast with a fine twist to the end, usually getting people what they deserve. But in The Willies, the stories last for the best part of 40 minutes each, which is longer than the average TV episode. I have to admit that I have found both stories very boring, they have very little for them and look like children. The first story is better to look at than a whole, but it has no doubt as far as I could see, while the second one ends up with a nice 'net desert' but its build up is poor and postponed for none good reason. . I really like horror anthology movies, so The Willies come as a disappointment, honestly, it allows the genre. <br /> <br /> Director Peck is apparently working on a low budget and as a whole. The Willies are pretty hard to go through, there are many continuity errors and they are poorly made. There is no atmosphere, there is no fear, there are no gore, the special effects are poor and it offers some unnecessary shots of a dirty toilet. Overall it's a nice, unattractive movie to go through. <br /> <br /> Technically, the Willies are rough around the edges to say the least, the effects are far from special and it has a very bare and grainy look to the picture. The acting is poor, no one will surely win the awards. <br /> <br /> The Willies is a poor movie, it's not scary, it's not fun, it's not entertaining and only has two long stories. Definitely not recommended.
