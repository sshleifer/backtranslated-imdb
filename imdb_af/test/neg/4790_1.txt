Unlike a police officer and showing where the child died from eating a spoiled hamburger he found under the bed, it was consistently the worst and most foolish performance to survive for the first time. If it wasn't for Jason Lee's unfair success in film, this performance would never have made it out of conception if he led with a relatively unknown as the head. <br /> <br /> The concept is TERRIBLE. Moron Redneck Hick spends his lottery profits to save himself with the white trash of his past. Is it funny? periodically but not consistently. Is this stupid? Each and every episode. <br /> <br /> I saw many good shows, come ahead of them, but this blunder survived longer than I could ever have imagined. The dialogue is incredibly unfunny like the episode themes. Every episode for someone with an IQ of more than 100 is an absolute battle. And the icing on the cake? Jason Lee's annoying voice tells every episode. If it wasn't for the state's southern culture and redheads from the south, this show wouldn't have an audience. <br /> <br /> If you are a moron and need a show, totally lacking in humor, but even worse overflow tastes, bad dialogue and dim white characters in life fail ... well then you are probably an actor on this show.
