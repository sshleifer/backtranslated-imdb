I feel very generous to give this movie a 2 out of 10. Well, it has been noted that the special effects are "okay" and Renny Harlin made one of my favorite genetically-modified shark attack-a research station movie. what you can know as Deep Blue Sea. The opening credits are also fairly well done with a remix of WhiteZombie's "more human human" and it goes pretty well with what is in the context of this "movie". But enough praise, we can reason why this movie sucks so much. <br /> <br /> Not since Your Boll's Alone in the Dark have I ever felt that the special effects in a movie have been totally wasted. Our story begins with four guys who are descendants of four different families. , each of which has a never fully professed power of a never fully explained family background that has never done a fully-fledged art of witchcraft. Oh, and for some reason, these descendants are all 17, everyone goes to the same school, everyone is on The swimming team and everyone, for some reason, is sitting in bed with their shirts, sweating and talk to each other on the phone. I have nothing against gays, gothic or thirteen years old, but that's what this movie is aimed at. at ... 13-year-old goth questioning their sexuality. Yes, there are girls in what sits on their beds in their pants or whatever, but how do they not get off their shirts? hey is the only righteous. <br /> <br /> In any case, the characters in this movie are told that when they turn 18, their new profound, almost godly powers will be gained and awarded. But before I go further, I forget to mention that when they use their powers, they learn slowly and become more addicted. This explains why they had people in their late 20's to play 17-year-olds. Oh, and if something needs to be explained, don't worry, someone will explain it all in one big dialogue. God sucking this movie ... where was I? Oh yes, the ascension. <br /> <br /> Well, apparently there was a super-secret alpha-one family whose other one forgot or something, I don't know, I don't know was slumbering at this point. But they were written out of how and the new child at school who is friends with the group is a secret "one of these descendants of the fifth family. And I say "secretly" because anyone who has seen any of the prints of this movie knows that this new guy is the bad guy. He has more power than the other because he is older, I think. Anyway, Bob Loblaw (says it out loud), things happen and we get the final fight in the movie. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was all the game for a witch battle. You know, like Saurmon vs Gandalf or anything along the lines with magical battles, because you know it's about witches and things. Now, when these two witches throw it, it's more like ... how can I do it ... a very, very crazy version of a Dragonball Z-type battle. They throw things at each other, talk, throw things, talk, throw things, talk etc. If I say 'throw things', I just say because I don't know what the F #% k throws at each other. It looks like big gobs of slimy water. God, this movie sucks, anyway, when our main witch rises, he doesn't get very powerful at all. He just throws bigger cups of slender water. Things happen and it ends in a way that you and the viewer know will end. The good witch wins the bad witch. <br /> <br /> You know how shocking a movie is if the bad guy says something so incredibly stupid: “I'm going to make you Wiotch. That's where I want to punch myself in the face to sit through this whole thing. <br /> <br /> Yes, I admit, the idea of ​​witches waging war uses the power in today's, sounds a bit cool, but when the execution is this bad, I really wanted them not to movie made. Perhaps if it was R-rated, Tit's threw in and threw more deaths with a bit of gore. It could have worked. Maybe it worked. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in looking at it, don't buy it or even rent it. Wait for it to come on TV or borrow it from your sucker from a friend who bought it. Just don't waste your time with this hack of a movie. If you spend any money on it, there is a good chance that you have made an effort to make a successor named by Your Boll, The Covenant 2: Only in the dark with the house of the dead.
