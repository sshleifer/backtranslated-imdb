To pick it all up, hit the end of the days and watch Roman Polanski's The Ninth Gate instead hire. This movie is the perfect stereotypical American movie vs. Ninth Gate which is the perfect stereotypical European movie. <br /> <br /> Ninth Gate: Noir-ish, intelligent, beautiful, atmospheric, excellent acting (Johnny Depp, esp), beautiful scenery, great cinematography, funny one-liners, intellectual, minimal dirty language, thoughts. The only mistake is that some people didn't understand the open end and said the movie was "crappy" because of it and there were some dubious scenes. <br /> <br /> End Days: Too much violent, liberal use of dirty language, NO musical count except for a poor attempt to get a commercial soundtrack first heard when Gabriel Byrne as Satan bumped into NYC (But all you could choose was Korn's Jonathan Davis incomprehensible). Has nothing to do with the plot, violence, incredibly predictable, violence, and did I mention much more violence? I think some of the special effects were good, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe I'm wrong, but I thought ninth gate was much more interesting, strange, original and intelligent. But maybe Americans don't need it. * dripping with cynicism * Although I am an American, I sometimes wonder.
