I am a great Amy Adams fan and have been around for years. I'm also a big fan of musical. Having said that, it's not a good movie at any level. It's pretty boring and the acting overall is very poor. Amy Adams is uncomfortable acting with Scott G. Anderson because she is in another league when it comes to acting. All the performances come out as a lot of amateur. The musical performances are pleasant but nothing special. <br /> <br /> Scott G. Anderson is just a bad actor! I assumed he was sitting in this movie because he has a good voice, but that's not the case. He has an average voice and sings on the key, but it's about it. <br /> <br /> I think I can see why Amy Adams did this movie with the singing element I just wanted her to have. I can rant over other poor elements of this movie, but I'll leave it immediately.
