I was subjected to this stack one Wednesday afternoon when my mother-in-law looked at it. I can't come across someone who basically remakes a crappy high budget Hollywood flop ("The CORE" with excited actors like Luke Perry). If the HIGH budget dropped one, causing people to do the same SAME film 2 years later, with NO budget going nowhere? I laughed most of the movie because I looked so suddenly (I'm actually shocked that it's not broadcast in Legal rather than on TV), and how it's basically the CORE script that's not bad, what If you saw "the core", you know why it's worse, it's funny, as the CORE was already so bad it was funny. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy getting a laugh out of VERY bad movies, this one will be straight up your feet. The only thing I can say is that I wish Luke Perry was able to have a career because he is not a horrible actor. He does not land terrible roles. Crappy made for TV movies that only went to television on day, is almost one step closer to the end for him. If it wasn't for 90210, he would have a career.
