Four guys (Jacks) go into the restaurant business with a fifth guy and lose all common sense. They allow them to be abused more than the textile workers at the beginning of the century, without leaving the situation. It's really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I just hope I can sell this item to someone who might have it. <br /> <br /> It is true that it is your attention if you cannot disturb the illogical plot developments too much. However, it is very stupid, but especially when a stranger enters the restaurant. Who is he? Guess. <br /> <br />
