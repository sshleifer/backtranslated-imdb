I can't express enough not just how bad this movie was. First of all, a waste of some legendary stars, although they are rather old and fairly unconvincing. Fred Astaire, well, I think he had to owe somebody a great favor, as it was his last movie. The script is a mess and the movie looks terribly thin. I think maybe when I saw it back when it came out (1981), I thought it was decent. However, it was one of the worst to see so many real good horror movies. The only true convincing thing in this mess was the very young and lovely kind of the creepy Alice Krige. The main young character tried to do the best he could, but was terribly horrible. I wasn't sure how much of his lack of skill or lack of intelligible script was, but he was just bad. Don't watch unless you see a bunch of old guys scared a little.
