I have very little to add to what all the other reviewers have made more than clear! This movie is terrible! Except terrible ... In fact, so unbearable that they haven't yet come up with a term to describe the horror that is "Skeleton Man". If you expect your movies to contain a minimum of logic and plot, stay away from this as human as possible. Certainly, many people are killed by this skeleton doll wearing a ridiculous hood, but nobody ever bothered to explain what he was, where he came from or why he was so angry with the world. He looks like a cross between Skeletor of "Masters of the Universe" and the rider of "Sleepy Hollow" and runs amok in some godly wildernesses. The introduction of "Skeleton Man" is another completely delayed aspect! For almost half an hour, I assumed the movie was on a small remote island, but it simply plays on the mainland where fine roads cross the forest and power stations are at the end of the forest! Huh? Why do everyone pretend to be stuck when they are like a million escape routes? Anyway, after a few random murders, a special commando group, led by poorly-excited Michael Rooker, comes to hunt a monster of which they know nothing. Actually hilarious is how every member of this team introduces him as an expert in a certain field (we have a sniper specialist, a tracing genius, a drill instructor ...), but they die ALL before any of them is able to demonstrate their so-called masterful skills! The horror of God must actually hate Casper Van Dien, as he is again present, depicting a heroic soldier who steals a truck for no apparent reason, crashes on the highway, but somehow it becomes hit the forest to die there. Straight, it makes sense. Furthermore, the characters steal cool one-liners from "Predator", the horse's horse constantly changes colors, helicopters are brought with bow and arrows, ordinary dots cause trees to explode and totally useless Vietnam flashbacks haunt Michael Rooker. I say we all combine forces and vote this pathetic movie in the IMDb bottom top 100 ASAP!
