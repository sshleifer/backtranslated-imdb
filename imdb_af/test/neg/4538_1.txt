It was a terribly short movie trying to be funny in a dark way, but not funny. Say at a film festival in Chicago. It's really what the title says and I was not into it at all. The bad storytelling was what it did. If you wrote it again and shot it again, it can work. This attempt fell into the hole. Terrible movie.
