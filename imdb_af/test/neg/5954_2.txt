This film had so much in it. Prehistoric society, adventure, romance, true brotherhood, violence, sex, religion; all portrayed abundantly .. without a single word expressed !!! And how does it suck so badly? This film will reconsider the origin of humanity. If it were the product of anthropology, you would rather defend Darwin theory and Hegelic synthesis all together. You can't carry it even with your brain. And now you think, "I have to see it." I warned you. I take no responsibility whatsoever if you regret spending an hour staring at this artwork. Well, I warned you. It must be forgotten and buried forever.
