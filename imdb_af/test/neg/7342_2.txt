I'm shocked by all the good reviews on the cover of this movie and on IMDb. It belongs to the $ 2 bin at your local video store. To say that it is a B-movie is extremely spacious. <br /> <br /> In addition to a single releasable character, just a little better than the average acting, and an ugly 80-year-old image quality, the writing for this movie is soft and lifeless. This movie isn't just boring - it's pathetic. (Sometimes there is a bit of interesting chemistry between the two main characters.) Even the final plot - rather the only plot - saves this movie. <br /> <br /> Rent "Diamond Men" if you have to, but do not hesitate to switch them off once you are judged of its worthlessness. 2 out of 10.
