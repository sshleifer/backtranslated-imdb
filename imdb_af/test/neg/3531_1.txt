I saw this movie at Temple University. I can't imagine anyone ever seeing this movie in a theater (projected on film). The acting is similar to Saved By The Bell (The TV Show). The plot is simple and unattractive. The sound record keeps track of the wind sound and the DP requires a light meter. Vampires, Vampires, Vampires. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money.
