Ho hum. Rich kid gets in trouble, poor girl falls in love with him, jealous ex-boyfriend causes tension .. yadda yadda. I actually laughed aloud in many parts of this movie because the next scene was so predictable and simple stupid. As one scene moved to the next, I often wondered how we got there, as I skipped a few chapters in a book. <br /> <br /> The script was rather unfortunate and didn't mind me or my wife cared for any of the characters except the chatterbox. Now, if the former boyfriend got an ax and separated the girl and the rich child, then .... we would have a movie, and all the stupid dialogue and jump in the plot could be acceptable. But since this movie seeks to touch and completely miss the boat (and ultimately to the romance equivalent of divine intervention to try to make a tear) ... it just falls very flat. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Cut your toenails instead, you'll have more fun.
