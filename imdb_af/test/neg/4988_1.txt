When Underdog debuted the cartoon in 1964, I was 7 years old. He was Top Dog (pun intended) in my book (this is until Batman spent a year or so on ABC). Even when it was clear that Disney would make a live action version of the once-popular Saturday morning cartoon, it was so clear to me that it would be a piece of shit. Even reading the reviews in the papers confirmed it. However, I made it a point to: a) never write a review unless I saw the movie from start to finish; and b) never to spend a red cent on a movie I'm almost certain to hate, I will hate. <br /> <br /> Thanks to YouTube I: a) is fully qualified to write this review; and b) it costs me just 84 minutes of my hard-earned time. <br /> <br /> It also proves my point that this movie is not just a piece of shit. It is a steaming heap of dog drops. It looks just like the TV series, although they almost did it with Simon and Cad. <br /> <br /> All in all, Underdog is a huge waste of time and money, which fortunately I didn't do. t have to spend. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * from *****
