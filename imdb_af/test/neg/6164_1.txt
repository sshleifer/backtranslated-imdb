Unfortunately, House of D is just terrible, with a ridiculous plot, terrible writing, some mediocre acting, and actually just about everything about it is sub-par. <br /> <br /> Tom flies NYC to somehow survive as a lone child in Paris, and manages the beautiful Parisian girl to convince him that he eventually marries being French, despite " poor understanding of her language. She is shocked when he later reveals his "secret" to her! Riiiight! <br /> <br /> He then "presents" his story of woe to his own son, and who we are expected to believe is just the biggest birthday gift a father can give his 13 year old son. If only such things were so easy! David Duchovny disliked his own wife, Tea Leoni, in the role of his mother and stopped again. Leoni makes me laugh as a cartoon, but she is simply wrong for this role. <br /> <br /> One of the problems with it is that none of the characters is sympathetic. I just didn't give a damn thing that happened to any of them. I would rather hope that Robin Williams and his trademark "child in an adult's body" would fall into a town mockery, but it was not to be and we had to endure his sympathy. <Br /> <br /> Anton Yelchin and William's daughter, Zelda, were not bad, but I suspect the cute reviews others give them are simple because they were not as close as everyone else in this movie. They weren't big, let me say so. <br /> <br /> There are so many stupid and confronted aspects of this movie - Erykah Badu, the bike, Catholic school and staff of Morons, the convenient stupid characters, etc. - that this review will last forever, so I will just end by saying that House of D is a very poor movie, and I'm almost embarrassed by Duchovny. <br /> <br /> The thing that really irritates me is how I was so strongly encouraged by online "friends" to see that I have traveled a long way to doing so. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't have been so bad that this movie is. as bad as I just spent a few hours at the local movie, but I lost a whole day and discovered that my so-called "friends" or stupid or dishonest, because it's a horrible movie!
