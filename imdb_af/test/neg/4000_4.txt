I know many people will automatically give this movie a score of 1, just because it's not the big budget and top-of-the-line special effects they're accustomed to. However, I knew what I was doing when I turned it on in the video recorder. <br /> <br /> I don't think we get much lower budget unless we film a family reunion. The lighting is terrible, sound quality is sometimes incomprehensible, and the acting is very bad by virtually everyone involved. BUT, it's still a fun movie and the plot is interesting enough. It centers on a fellow named Tom Russo (Asbestos Felt), who put his luck on his job. He is very protective of his wife and does not allow her to work, putting even more pressure on herself. As he works more hours, we slowly see him in madness and obsession, and he is suspicious that his wife is cheating on him and killing the various men (most years of recovery) he feels responsible. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the gore effects are extremely cheap, but fit the overall tone of the movie. The brutal ways Tom Russo comes to kill these men give us an idea of ​​just being mad. The pacing of the film is also very good and there is seldom a boring moment. The end doesn't really hold the rest of the movie's plot, as it seems to be a soul-slasher movie after a "Dawn of the Dead" wannabe, but it's still entertaining and I have to give Tim Ritter credit for using an unconventional end. <br /> <br /> I can honestly say I enjoyed this movie, but it is not a good movie at all. The budget is his main stumbling block and the consequences are almost too much to think about. I do not recommend it to people who are totally spoiled by the big-budget movies and who cannot have an open mind for ultra-low budget films. You simply won't enjoy it. For others, and supporters of gore - I say, give it a shot. You will find at least some salvation in it! <br /> <br /> My Grade: D
