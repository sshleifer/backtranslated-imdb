The Greek room for parts of the movie was very nice and photography gets all my voices and it's about the size of my raves for this movie. I found that all the characters were narcissistic archetypes that were so common in American culture and were level and uninteresting. Susan Sarandon and Gena Rowlands are easy to look at, but I have found their characters very narcissistic and unlikely for many other reasons. When Gena Rowlands sings at a party, it made me wonder how this woman can think of herself as a capable star of the stage. I was tempted to hit the MUTE button until she finished singing. Molly Ringwald was herself and Raul Julia's character was so lecherous that he was just dirty. The movie was too long for me and I couldn't spend it again, even at the point of a gun.
