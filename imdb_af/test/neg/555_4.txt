I can assume that it was the NEXT karate child, so Ralph Macchio could retire from the series, and while Hillary Swank was good at the role. The plot of the movie is just scary. <br /> <br /> Mr. Miyagi's old mate of World War II dies and lets his widow take care of her rebellious granddaughter when her parents die in an accident. The girl has no discipline, but is the hero because the local ROTC ... which I will explain in a minute has it to get her. You know the drill ... Miyagi takes her under his wing and in the end they hit the bad guys and everyone is happy to ever live. <br /> <br /> The hokey, his cheese, is the 90's. but it is not even the long and short of it. My first case of "huh?" is why there is a "military section" in high school? I thought things went out in the 1960s, especially in a public school. As much as Michael Ironside kicks in his role as the main heel, since when has military been involved in a high school? My next grab is that the militants jump during the prom scene to scare the shit out of people ... why? The thing I noticed in all four movies was, at the end of the shoulders, suddenly facing all the nonsense they had the main character (Billy in part 1, Sato in part 2, Kreese in part 3). This movie is no different. After Ned and cronies basically sabotage the senior promotion, Eric's car inflates and Hillary Swank threatens the whole movie ..... Ironside tells them to beat her and they are like "um ... no" if you're going to do pathetic face turns , at least make sure the characters have done nothing over it, like blowing a hot rod. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the love plot between Eric and Hillary Swank. ... Corny but nothing to melodramatic, pulling a fresh air out of the garbage Ralph Macchio into the first 3 movies. <br /> <br /> I will say for his own movie, after watching the first 3 movies, I can assume it's more or less a twist ... but I can't accept the whole military thing , much too unusual because it has to be taken seriously. Now if Ironside and crew were a wrestling / soccer team and he was the coach, it would have been more credible. <br /> <br /> Ironside and Morita deliver the goods, Swank is OK ... the rest is the same If something, the one highlight is when they blow up the hot rod, it was cool 4 out of 10
