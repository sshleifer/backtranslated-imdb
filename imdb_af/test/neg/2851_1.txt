First of all, I must say that I really like Udo Kier and have always respected Armand Assante, but nothing can save this train wreck from a movie. Udo doesn't even appear later in the movie and the acting of All is just terrible. The script is all over the place, the dialogue is wood, the "action" is laughing and the plot can be summed up on a dirty cocktail napkin. I really wanted to loosen up something in this movie, but I held my hands over my eyes, shook my head and repeated to myself. "O Udo ..... why ??? .... Why? ??? ..". If you are a fan of Udo or Armand, please don't see this movie. It will only make you sad.
