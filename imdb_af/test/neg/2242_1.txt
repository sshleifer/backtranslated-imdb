This movie is not worth going down, but it just made me decide not to watch the next Tarantino movie. And I loved Tarantino's movies. <br /> <br /> Not artificial, not entertaining, not funny, not funny, nothing, just boring and stupid. If this movie was Tarantinos first, it would have been its last. <br /> <br /> Tarantino must get himself, otherwise his next movie will be 3 hours senseless, boring and uncool dialogue. He seems to have fallen in love with his dialogue - and his love is blind. After you finish your popcorn, there's no reason to sit in a theater anymore.
