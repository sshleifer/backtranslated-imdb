I watched this cooking a few times before I wanted to pull my hair out. Only one question ..... Who can't prepare a joint meal in 30 minutes when everything you need is at hand, already packed, sometimes chopped and you have very little else to do except one to cut some vegetables. Also, almost every cooking program on TV is 30 minutes and most of these chefs do all their preparation work (except Sandra Lee) during their show. Oh and yes .... they also do full meals. <br /> <br /> Keep the comment of the guy who hated the "EVE" comment. Add "DE-LISH" to my list of stupid words. <br /> <br /> Then you have the obvious .... A higher, greedy woman who is truly her own best audience. She laughs at her own lame remarks, scares too much for the camera, because she wants to convince us that she is as good as she thinks. <br /> <br /> NO she's not "the cutest thing." She is a 40-year-old woman who is not DE-LISH.
