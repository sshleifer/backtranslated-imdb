Big, waddling, engaging tree trunks bad "individuals" on a "Pacific Atoll" (look suspiciously like South East ...), reaction to revenge and revenge. Unlike the stupid stumps in "Navy VS The Night Monsters", the Tabonga is actually a mature man tree. Well, grown in 2 days: Moost got on that Miracle Grow spikes ... Anycow, it's not from hell, but from the grave of a false native, Kimo (Greg Palmer, "The Zombies of Mora Tau") . , killed by the indigenous elders to hang out with the terrible American scientists. The scientists include dr. William Arnold (Tod Andrews, "Hang 'em High", "Under the Planet of the Apes") and Professor Clark (John McNamara, "War of the Colossal Beast"). The finishing touches are Linda Watkins ("The Parent Trap") as the avid Mrs. Kilgore, the obvious comic relief that sets out a clear false "cockney" accent. A star role indeed !! Anycow, because his thorough, vacant wife, Korey, played amateurishly through Suzanne Ridgeway ("Love's A-Poppin"), helps him set up, Kimo declares his revenge on her and all the elders. Then the dull American scientists disrupt the tree, bring it back in the name of science, and let it slowly touch the island, killing all who did it wrong. Of course, we all know that evil monsters carry honest girls, and the Tabonga grabs the cheerful female scientist dr. Terry Mason (Tina Carver, "Hell on Frisco Bay") and cloud with her. Vine ally, a good shot with a Remmington hit a knife in the Tabonga, and it is about death in the mercury sand. This nice silly gift is one of the all-time cheesy howlers. The Tabonga is probably the slowest monster in moovie history, upside down with the sound, over-robot of Robot Monster vs The Aztec Mummy and the perverse creep of Creeping Terror. Do not try to laugh as you watch the Tabonga throwing false natives into the hills and dropping in mercury sand, dodge spears, and slowly over the "island". Harmful writing, wood performance, and juicy direction indicate that this pulpy fertilizer is very spoiled for bite. This low stack of slides was the last hurray of long-time editor-turned director Dan Milner, who soon vanished into the well-deserved darkness after this movie. You hit it through the vineyard of the MooCow first: "From Hell it Came" is a compost classic !! : ??
