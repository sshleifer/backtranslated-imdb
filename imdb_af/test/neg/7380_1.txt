If you asked me how this movie was 1 month ago, I would probably have left most of this out, but I'm a fan and as a fan I often visit the movie sites when Super Troopers came out. release on DVD and was addicted yes this is a difficult site to stay on, but the stuff is usually like good families holding them together. What a story about this company / comedy group. START people to watch movies on street corners, universities, wherever they can and all for free and to develop it to a great fan base after a few years. decided to include a site that helped them and was created for the fans, but the worst thing about it .... They didn't tell them. They just decided they were better than us, they wanted new fans, not the fans who helped them get where they were. You know the same fans who begged them years ago. Yet the clever crew they are, they released the best movie with Super Troopers and got everyone's attention and thanked God for it, because after that they sucked everything else. Good for your guys to go, remember when you realize your stuff is not that good and you have no new fans, you are the one who drove the original away. FATHER YOU DO WHO YOU ARE NOT THE OTHER. Don't burn your bridges
