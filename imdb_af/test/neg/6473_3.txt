But I still enjoyed watching her, so I gave it a 3 instead of 1. Her expressions are invaluable. Some of the other roles (eg Michael McKean) are also slumbering. The cat itself is somewhat amusing. Apart from that, the movie is all the clich√©, which results in a far too long car hunt. (It is also at this point that the film has become unnecessarily rough, so far many "relatives" have been.)
