I'm still waiting for the dark moped movie where we won't know how to finish it from the beginning. I think Linklater can experiment with animation. This time I didn't expect such a thing, but I needed it a lot. <br /> <br /> Joan Cusack sucked. She moved to a TV level that last appeared with a clicked synika. The muppets were more lifelike than she was. A disappointment. <br /> <br /> But then the whole movie, bar Pepe. I loved him. He was the only one who ever made me laugh (while Goldbergh as God choked and cursed me). If we can't see a dark muppet, then that of at least a PG: 13 one with more Pepe's controversial jokes and animals with metal head, egg-still-chuggin persona. <br /> <br /> The worst Muppets I even see the boring Christmas Carol, save this one. The muppets should avoid this on commercial holidays. <br /> <br /> 5/10
