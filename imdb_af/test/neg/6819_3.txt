sure this movie might have had its funny moments with the sat questions and I know the movie is not supposed to be completely credible. The movie made it shameful, for example a girl like it would never go in a million years. It also had people in the movie, had spectacular performances where the play was so bad. Also, the plot is bad that at least they can have better work on the dissertation and at least focused on the comedy. The comedy was also a bit dry and became very boring after the first few jokes. It was like ten minutes, laughing, then the guy when it will end up kicking in the bottom line if you want a thin of acting blend with a stupid plot and a romance going on and watching this movie.
