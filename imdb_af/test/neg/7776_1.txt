Terrible horrible movie for television. Again, Lifetime brings us the predictable triangle; Shabby lady to get stupid, unconscious woman from another silly man who has no idea. <br /> <br /> I get antsy when I watch these movies. You may ask, why do I look at them? I have no idea. Usually by accident. And the movie is so bad, I can't get away from it. I'm waiting for the bitch to let her come. And usually I'm not happy with how she just gets her desserts. <br /> <br /> Now if you can believe our vixen, steal its embryos from the clinic and how to do it? Without blood tests, DNA, queries and recommendations. She continues to kill the broker, Gabrielle Rose, in broad daylight in the courtyard of a house and no one sees her? She killed the mother, Susan Hogan, and you can predict that suspicion when the mother mentions that she is allergic to peanuts and that the pills to combat this allergy are in her business book. Guess what? I will not continue with this. <br /> <br /> Finally, you are left alone in the house with the woman and the bitch. Well, good, triumphant evil, but much too slow. Victoria Pratt as the evil girlfriend is adequate in the role, a little too marvelous and obvious. Tori Spelling is just to look empty most of the time. She has the big, big Bette Davis eyes that look like they are sticking out of her head. I liked her better in TRICK. And Tahmoh Penikett plays the man who goes to assure his wife. There is nothing for him and his ex-girlfriend, even though he has seen everywhere in the village, is very nice to her, half-naked with her in his home when he sent the woman home. city ​​to stay overnight. Yet he denies the romance. <br /> <br /> Lives never indignant the viewers with their rude plots and stories about women and their stupid men. Wish I could give this chestnut a "0" rating.
