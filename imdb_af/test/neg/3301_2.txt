I've been living in Istanbul for 24 years and I (39 years of experience will imagine) know what Istanbul has been through for years. <br /> <br /> Faith Akin is still very young (born in 1973) and falls into the big mistake of being ORIENTALISTS when he looks at Turkey (just as his other movie Gegen Die Wand did). This movie seriously defeats contemporary urban Turkish life and relieves the audience when it gives (many false) clues about Istanbul's geographical and cultural distribution. <br /> <br /> Anyone who could speak Turkish could easily testify that many underground bands and groups portrayed in the movie (Siyasiyabend for one) are so MISERABLE and their members can't even speak a proper language what they cannot be considered 'representatives' of contemporary Turkish music. Much less a piece of shit that many Turkish listeners do not know at all. <br /> <br /> Our Turks have long been accustomed to 'superficious' westerners looking to Turkey with some orientalist points: try to fit the real Turkish image into their minds. What's new in this movie is the fact that now a Turkish delegate (Faith Akin) is making the same mistake: Look at Turkey with a few false western glasses and scrambling to portray it as if he understood better. Already a vain attempt. <br /> <br /> Just ask a Turkish friend of yours: What is a musical documentary version without mentioning the names: Zeki Walls, Baris Manco, Ajda Pekkan, Teoman, Muslum Gurses, Ibrahim Tatlises, Ferdi Ozbegen ? .. and many others who have so far listened to the real MUSIC we listen to today? <br /> <br /> Faith Akin has a long long lesson to learn before chatting and confusing other people's thoughts with fake images about contemporary Turkish music.
