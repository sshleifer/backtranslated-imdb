"Go Fish" justified Rose Troche or wrongly getting the reputation of a movie maker with much promise. <br /> <br /> It is then difficult to understand how she can make up a movie consisting of stereotypes associated with inferior sitcoms. . The whole movie is hollow. I ran the whole way. <br /> <br /> It would be a glimpse of the nineties human sexuality. Well, not much more here to be taught than from "In and Out". By the time most of us know that there are men who are sexually attracted to women and there are men who are sexually dressed in men and there are even men who are sexually attracted to both sexes. <br /> <br /> Rare, this revelation is depicted on the screen with so little white and style. <br /> <br /> Pathetic.
