Caesar's dog (Richard Haydn) is engaged to Johanna's (Joan Fontaine) dog. However, when Virgil (Bing Crosby) arrives in town to sell a gramophone record player to the emperor, his dog is attacked by Johanna's dog. After a vengeance attack when Virgil is banned from town, a psycho-analyst claims that Johanna's dog should confront Virgil's dog so she can overcome her doggy fears. It is arranged and the dogs are in love. So do Virgil and Johanna. The rest of the film passes with romance and at the end Johanna's dog gives birth. But who is the father .......? <br /> <br /> The dog story is the very poor vehicle used to try to create a story between people. It's a terrible story. There are 3 main pieces of music that are all rubbish - bad songs and terrible choreography. It's just a very boring movie. Bing has too many words in every sentence and delivers it in a scary, annoying way. It's not funny ... EVER .......... but it was meant. Bing and Joan did much better than that.
