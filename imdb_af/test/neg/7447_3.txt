For most people, RoboCop 3 is the movie that is really the big shame for the Robo series. It has few fans, and most people hate it for its scandalous commercial PG-13 approach. Now I'm not going to say that RoboCop 3 is any good. Honestly, it almost struggles. But as far as a proper shot and executed movie, it surpasses this piece of circuit chaos. Yes, the truth is that RoboCop 2 is the worst of two bad and unnecessary prosecutions to a close masterpiece. So, as RoboCop 3 Robo in a cartoon-like superhero in an ultra-mainstream production for kids to enjoy, at least make it open. I do not know where RoboCop 2 starts and ends, I do not know what or who it is about, I do not understand what is going on, I do not understand what jokes are deliberate and what I will not go insane If I try to understand the characters, I see nothing of any value in anything someone says. I can't believe anyone looked at the gunhead and thought it would work and I can't believe that Irvin Kirshner had the finished result and figured out he liked what he saw. He may not have been incidentally, not Miller, or Weller or Allen. It's not hard to see why. <br /> <br /> Now, RoboCop 2 has it's fans, I know. Mostly they belong to this league of absolute anti-pretenses, with the expulsion of anyone who expected any depth or subject of the first film, as academic Roger Ebert Sith pupils. It's just a lot of fun, a good piece of action and great entertainment, the argument goes. Yes, if you just don't listen to what one of the characters is saying, you might be fooling yourself into having Arnold in the pack instead of Weller. Don't get me wrong, I like a good action movie, with pure entertainment value, as it is just the most satisfying virtue. But RoboCop 2, sir, isn't such a thing. <br /> <br /> Watch the first few scenes. This horrible actor tells Robo that he is just a machine, and then goes into this operational speech about how he could never be a man. Whereupon Murphy's wife (whose OCP for robotic stalking complains) runs out into the blue and has this sad moment with him, and then it is never heard again! I will surely want to go to this scene because everyone has such absurdities in them. It's like a twelve-year-old fan who did the script, the characters work completely randomly and say it first and then say. OCP wants to ban crime with a new Robo, especially this drug called "nuke", but does it seem like they really just want to become this great capitalist empire and control the whole city? Politics has left. I think it's understandable, as the villainer, the villain (played by Tom Noonan, who did a better version of it in Last Action Hero and it says a lot) is an addict, but is still used for this machine. The woman behind it all has an agenda that is impossible to understand. <br /> <br /> With this twelve-year-old movie, this movie played the notorious role of "Hub", this crazy kid who swears and kills people, played by a child actor. I'm not going to be moral about it, it's a free world and if you want a psycho-child in your action movie, go for it. I don't know how much Frank Miller's original vision has been placed on, but the credits at least recognize him as a "story." And if I look, I can see it as a cool character. It's a pity, a male killer, but again it's the world of RoboCop and who will be surprised? This whole business with the OCP trying to become this huge monopoly over everything is also good dystopies and good. The idea of ​​RoboCop to get in touch with his wife and child, they also included in the story - will also be good, and as far as I can see a natural and logical step if they now have to make a RoboCop successor. <br /> <br /> But that's just ideas, of course. As many people have said, the script is 100% wasted. The child has one play (the torture scene) where it is shown that he is really just a stereotyped inflated child, and then we have this unimaginable scene where he dies and gets everything soft and friendly towards oil stop. Why doesn't he just pick up his uzi and try to take him off with his last breath? Isn't that what his character would do? Does he give his life a second thought on his deathbed? Not necessarily, since his last words are "suck", so why? It really makes no sense, and it can be said about everyone, not everything, in this movie. Is there a strike in the police force? Is RoboCop Machine Or Man? What is the reason for Robo's turn for 10 minutes in this community service machine? I mean, it's really funny, I won't deny it. But why build it and then throw it out? And why is the Allen so underutilized? and what's it Weller has a clear urge to express with his character and yes, well, the threads are huge and the mess is huge. <br /> <br /> This review is just as messy as the movie. The only reason I get an extra star out there is because of the actors of the first film, I'm sure they have good intentions with it. I mean it's something somewhat stable, a kind of anchor in this sea of ​​bad movie making.
