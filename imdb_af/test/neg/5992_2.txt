A hump of trash can only make the Full Moon Studios, a group of college kids who stay free in an old hospital without anyone knowing it as a demonic creature with two faces (barely the entire movie is due of incomprehensible lighting) moving through walls killing every member who has a certain sheet of paper with antique marks. Someone among them (it won't be too hard to prove, but a slight twist is so unpleasantly revealed and neatly executed) is the main force behind which the animal kills and must be revealed before it kills everyone. /> Inexpensive, poor behavior has a "This is it?" a kind of bad end that surprised you, why you just wasted your time. Tanya Dempsey, who could not act through a wet paper bag, has the heroine duties as the newest member of the college, called Clark. Oh, and the title refers to the sound the animal makes before it attacks the next victim.
