Cameron Mitchell plays an actor dating a young actress who was the head of a movie studio. (She's too young for them!). At a party, when he lights his cigarette, the studio boss throws a high alcoholic beverage into his face and gets fire. In the hospital, his face is completely bound and he still puts on a cigarette! He becomes the resident sculptor of the Movieland Wax Museum and Palace, where he also turns cigarettes on! <br /> <br /> Mitchell recovers, more or less, with a very poor burning makeup on one side of his face that looks like gray spackle and band, and an eye patch. When Mitchell doesn't smoke, he kills people. Well, he sometimes kills people, as he prefers to spray them with something they put in a waxy coma. If he doesn't regularly administer it (and he never seems to remember), they start moving a little, though they are in a kind of hypnotic zombie. However, all his sculptures are not people. He obviously has talent as a sculptor. <br /> <br /> The end, which looked like a much poorer pressure than the rest of the movie, is really absurd. They didn't know what to do, and returned to the title for an idea. Apart from the strange grain final shots, the rest of the movie is pretty good, except for the sound in some scenes that seem to be run by a blown speaker. Certainly not one of the better wax museum movies.
