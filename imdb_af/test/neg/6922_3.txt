As it has a theater delivery nowhere around the world, it only serves as a reminder where the careers of those talented ladies Denise Richards and Milla Jovovich went. It is also a special grid type film, the kind that thinks they are clever, funny and original while poor in every aspect. Full debt can go to Brian Burns, who wrote and directed this pot boiler. His screenplay takes a fairly unobtrusive situation and does not go anywhere with it. The situations develop completely without any inner logic, except those of a desperate scriptwriter. Characters are thinner than cardboard cuttings, behavior stupid and without any real motivation. Nowhere is it more obvious than in the inclusion of Mrs. Richards. We don't believe her relationship with David Krumholtz's character for one minute and the way she gets back into the game after the one-hour point is very sorry. Why would anyone fall in the first place for an egocentric, self-obsessed, arrogant b ** ch, much less a second time? Especially after presumably finding his ... term ... true love? And if any of these is not enough to completely sink this movie, then the central couple is. The link between Krumholtz and Jovovich is only slightly more credible or developed than the Richards one, but it is of no use. There is no chemistry, no spark, nothing that we would rather accept as a credible couple. Worse, these two central characters are particularly annoying and annoying, making annoying and annoying things the viewer ultimately has no interest in. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very poor performance. Even the hard-to-go rom-com fans might want to learn this one because decades of film have been made with more skill or more charm.
