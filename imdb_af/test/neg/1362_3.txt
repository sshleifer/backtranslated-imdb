This movie is full of pseudo-deep thought and it's in its author ness, which includes a canned ham voice review and incredible dialogue. Dialogue that is thin and deaf is the way Spike is sometimes (not always) when writing 'certain' characters. For those who like nonsense movies like Pieces or April and One Hour Photo, it's another one for you. <br /> <br /> It has been said, this commentary is nothing against Ryan Gosling who showed his wonderful links in The Believer. A movie proving that movies are a director's medium, and when a movie is rotten, it's fair to say the mistake lies there and not in the actors.
