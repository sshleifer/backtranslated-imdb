Don't be fooled by the other reviewers. Although this film contains an impressive variety of talent, leave the material they offer much to be desired. Nat King Cole's 3 numbers are pretty lame and not even close to his later efforts, though impressed with his piano playing. 'Moms' Mabley is not a little funny, although I remember her as a very entertaining talk show guest of my youth. In fact, the best performances of a few fat guys are impressed by a live tap dance and a Four Tops take-off, and the jazz band itself, especially in the number the bass player has. The print itself is pretty poor quality, and the wonderful Butterfly McQueen is completely messed up in the wraparound plot.
