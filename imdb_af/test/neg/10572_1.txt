Went with friends and one of my friends and thought it would be a good way to start the spring break, but the movie turned out terribly. We all agree that it should not have been PG-13. More like R material. Lots of sexual dialogue, cussing and referring to boy and girl parts (below the waist). Not worth the time or money. Encourage not to go or rent it if it comes out. If you finally go, don't take smaller children. Not the type of movie to see with the family! If you're curious about the content, check out the Content Advisory section on the Superhero Movie page on IMDb. Most of the content intended to be funny was extremely rough. Especially when they make fun of Steven Hawking.
