Demi and Woody are married, but they are poor. They meet Robert Redford, and he's really rich. He takes on a fine lady, and since he is a gambler, he makes the couple an "indecent suggestion:" one million dollars a night with the little woman. <br /> <br /> At this stage, you no longer have to watch the movie because you can put the details together in your sleep. Of course, Demi will accept the offer. If she's not there, there's not the first half of the movie. This will of course affect Demi and Woody's marriage. If it is not, there is no second half of the movie. And of course everything will come out at the moment the credits roll. If that is not the case, there is no happy ending for the office. <br /> <br /> The absolute best thing you can say about INDEPENDENT PROPOSAL is that Demi Moore looks good in a black dress. As for the rest ... The writing is incompetent, the direction amateur, the performances are insignificant. I suspect Redford, Moore and Harrelson blush and change the subject every time the movie is called. Do them - and more importantly yourself - a favor. Unless one offers you a million ... miss it! <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
