It's the early morning of our dissatisfaction, and some of my friends and I just got by looking at the wind. Actually a disaster movie. Not in the sense of forces of nature that cause devastation on an unsuspecting population, but rather a terrible film that endures destruction on an unsuspecting audience. To give you an indication of how frustrating it was to see this particular bomb, I will give you an example during my first sighting. If the choice is chosen to watch and say this movie for a second time, cook myself, I'm afraid to say the choice won't be immediate. But rather than just ripping "ad peliculam" with lousy one-liners, I'm going to know specifically why my friends and I put this particular movie. <br /> <br /> To start off, I like low-budget horror flicks. I even like artsy, low-budget horror flicks. I like "Cold Hearts", "Midnight Mass", "Jugular Wine", etc. Movies that were ambitious and daring, even if they were not in production value, performance and even action. Generally speaking, an interesting performance, unusual camera technique or just a well done scene or two will save a movie that runs a little rough around the edges. With these examples in mind, I would like to say that I hated the wind. <br /> <br /> The movie was probably the most disappointing in that it was incredibly frustrating to watch. Of the actions of the main characters, after the flow (?) Of the plot, to the large gates inspired by the opening, which ultimately aspired to dust (and not even logically attached to what in the rest of the movie did not appear, leaving the viewer, expecting something more, with a sense of fear for nothing). The dialogue was, at best, mocking, timber and totally unrealistic. By this I mean, no one in any of the situations in which the characters were in, would have responded or said the way the characters did what they said in the way they said it. There was a clear lack of vision and direction to fix this problem. <br /> <br /> Character interaction and development was uncomfortable. Claire, the "Lambent Sex Goddess" or the aggressive, passive-aggressive lambs in the film thought, was so open in her manipulations that she could also draw a gun on the characters. Nevertheless, she was the shining high point of the film. The other main characters (with the exception of Mick's Milfy mother, who was not terrible) are so unclear that they can be portrayed as well by the same actor. Let's see if I missed anything: borderline personality, co-submissive goons with deep feelings of sexual confusion and inadequacy, prompted to adjust the spicy anger by the artificial orchestrations of a loose-lips bimbette-sudden-and- unmistakably-turned Caligari. No, I think it covers it. <br /> <br /> Lack of size was also problematic. How did those involved in making this movie expect the accidental viewer to conclude that this was the beginning of the end of this amateur, incredible, poorly depicted luster phenagon (what would you call it)? largely in the woods in the middle of nowhere? There were no witnesses of the "atrocities" offered. There were no witnesses in this movie. <br /> <br /> The promise problems that stem from this lack of attention to detail were great even from the point where the plot began to fall ill. Case-in-point: If that old Bob took that route through the forest to get to the gym, and here's the key, **** every day ****, there's a good chance someone else would have been to see something later, while the perpetrators argued out loud about the crime scene. One would think that with the murder of a young man in the forest, the town would have been in a riot, the characters would be questioned, and so on. But there was no witness in sight (except Earl, the safe psychopath without inner monologue). We suggest that there be no witnesses for this film as well. <br /> <br /> As far as the quasi-homosexual meanderings are concerned, I have no problem with that either. It's not as if they have come as a surprise, as we have been screaming over the past few days about the closet-case station of most male characters. Again, not problematic in and of itself, but thrown in for the wrong reasons. It was completely unnecessary, thrown for pure "shock" and / or "dangerous art" value, and not shocking or dangerous artistic from any perspective. What we had before was an uncomfortable attempt to leave a boring, clumsy movie with a boring, clumsy plot. The poorly toned sexual tension, which first appeared in heavy hands in anticipation of this volatile snare, first made this film suck into the totem pole of "mediocrity criticized" for the film so that it was not the inherent grace enough to suck properly and harangue. "<br /> <br /> So it's with most of the movie, a lot of artistic fumbling, very little meat and much worsening. It's not that we don't get it. Oh, we got it right. The fact that we cheered the blowgeoning in the final scene as the * only * tableau healed on his face is an indication that something was terribly wrong with this movie. To move fast as its name implies, this movie has turned slightly forward, like the sweaty path, while it is full of hands, no, this sensation is a good summary of the daunting frustration realized while watching this train wreck There is no fresh air with regard to this movie, but only the tedious miasma of bad ideas is poorly understood, and it is advocated.
