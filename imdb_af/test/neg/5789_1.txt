Oh, man, I hated this movie. Granted, the places are good, but it's about the only positive thing I can say about it. Now I am going to state at the outset that I am VERY critical about the way weapons, especially firearms, are portrayed and handled in the movies. Being a war flag was portrayal good, but the rogue weapon handling in the movie would never be tolerated by a real SEAL team. The acting was more wood than my first sailboat, the equipment (or lack thereof) was laughing and the dialogue was, we will say, lacking in something interesting. Well, with the exception of the journalist, which was actually prescient. Watching this movie was comparable to the fact that Palmetto was watched at Woody Harrelson, where every scene was so bad you couldn't turn it off because you had to see if they could get worse with the next scene. Like Palmetto, they definitely did. The scene in the water, after which, after shooting the first of the enemy, they have FLOWER THE DAMN BOAT UP, thus having possible drowning, I laughed so loudly that I almost thought it for a millisecond was worth waiting for the movie for. Then Charlie Sheen decided to drag the surviving enemy to the depths of the ocean (as with many camera cuts, they seemed to have dropped about 80 feet). Throat was so damned, I was amazed. Then again, so was the whole damn movie. I enjoy action movies, but not this one. NOTE: The version I watched was a TV version, pan & scan. I can't imagine that it made a difference, except that the whole thing is blessed shorter!
