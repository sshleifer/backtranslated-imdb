Following on from the movie that is the epitome of the Ninja genre of the 1980s, the "Saviors of the Ninja" are devoted to this bizarre offering that Ninja Shenanigans mixes with spiritual possession. The end result is not different in nature. to that somewhat awful experience when one boasts a bat of human bat that threatens to swallow yourself in a public pool. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, the supposed 'action-packed' introduction of all places on a golf course (!) Here we see an evil green dressed ninja who murdered a group of golfers, as it clearly does not noticeable reason (although I have to admit that the level of elitist attitude adopted by many participants of this particular sport irritates me ... hmmmm Maybe that's why he killed them ..... yes, I can do it smoothly not have). Actually later in the movie we are told that one of the golfers was a top scientist, but this story line is never worked out or ever referred back! <br /> <br /> Anyway back to the intro, the police continue to surround the golf course and basically shoot the absolute hell out of the assassin .... and they have to keep him shooting because he just won't don't stay !!! Yes, literally, hundreds of rounds are being pumped into him, and he continues to kill more of the law enforcement numbers. <br /> <br /> Finally (after what looks like an eternity) our abuse explodes a smoke bomb and disappears. ... or so it seems, because he just stumbles away from the ground and definitely we are grimless officers who leave the scene to look for his body, he crawls out to hide and hide. <br /> <br /> We see the lovely Lucinda Dickey, a truly beautiful actress and in excellent physical condition, playing a phone repairman here. From its high vantage point it is to mock the dying (LAST !!!!!) ninja. Upon closer examination, the man, presumably at his last legs, suddenly shot over her and hit her on the ground. After a bit of a fight, our fiery heroine managed to break happily, but didn't count on the ninja who has hypnotic powers and she inevitably conceded to them. It is at this point that the dying ninja is actually projecting his soul into our heroine! His intention is to use her bodily form to kill the officers who killed him (the few he couldn't even erase!) <br /> <br /> From this point, throughout the film, when our heroine becomes one of the aforementioned officers impressed by an overwhelmingly spectacular spectacle of flickering lights, smoke effects and the sword that the ninja bequeathed to lift her in a very shaky way! <br /> <br /> Making matters more complicated, a particularly annoying police officer (wearing enough back and shoulders to shy away from an average yoke) continues to win her love (at a very bloody, annoying way !!!) Of course it doesn't take the gift of prejudice to work it out in a rather poor 'shock' (less) turn to the end of the movie, HE is revealed as one of the officers she has to kill! <br /> <br /> But wait, there is still hope! <br /> <br /> Step forward the one and only Sho Kosugi! <br /> <br /> Yes, the ninja itself and look as cool as ever! Of course, golf club news is moving fast and after learning the mentioned events that have appeared there, he flies completely from Japan to sort out the situation (the worst is suspected!) In a short story (it's been a few seconds!). Sho's interest in this particular ninja is proven to be personal after the reported villain Sho's father / teacher (?) Murdered and blinded one of Sho's eyes (so Sho had to do a very nicely ornamental sword-protecting eye patch. bear!) <br /> <br /> After storming off his dead nemesis body from the mortuary and then finding our heroine who offers an unusual residence for the evil soul, it makes a climax in an oriental temple ( seemingly in the middle of nowhere where our husband Sho manages to reunite the two unfounded aspects. <br /> <br /> Relive now from the dead, the evil ninja and Sho make it traditional ninja style with swords with the winner ........ good. Yes, you can probably guess. <br /> <br /> Really this movie ha Just two things that go for it, the always excellent Kosugi (which always looks absolutely fantastic) and the beautiful girl. Dickey. What a shame that the material they found themselves here is such a jumble stack of orders. <br /> <br /> Yes, to be fair, I've seen much worse than this in my time, although I definitely can't recommend it as those desperate to get their Sho Kosugi / Ninja movie collections. completed.
