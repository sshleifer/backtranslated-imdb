I remember browsing through HBO and seeing it. This, my friends, is one of the worst TV movies I've ever seen. There is no excitement in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Drew Summers (Candice Cameron Bure) while traveling in a trance to a small town. She lives with a couple who happened to have a daughter named Laura Fairgate, who looks exactly like her and is played by the same actress. Even the townspeople agree that they looked. Thing is, Laura was murdered about a year ago. Her boyfriend was missing about the time she was murdered, and he seemed to have killed her. <br /> <br /> While settling in town for a while, Drew begins visions and nightmares. These visions and nightmares can prove that Laura's boyfriend is not the killer. Throughout the film you find that Ray Ordwell Sr. (Denis Arndt) the one who raped her for a while and killed her. <br /> <br /> The movie is too long and very boring. The movie just pulls on and off and on and on and on. Amazingly, I saw another TV movie after it was named (Cloned) 1997, which was good, but I will review that one later. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 1 star 10. Avoid this TV movie. It's not worth your time. This is the worst TV movie of 1997!
