I was a fan of Buffy and hoped it would come to a proper end when Angel had only one season. But when the end came, I was surprised to see it. And what did we get? This episode called "NOT FADE AWAY" was the last. <br /> <br /> I was so disappointed with this episode. This is absolutely the worst way for this series. Why can't it get a happy ending? Why do some of the main characters have to die? Why didn't Angel become a man and was he reunited with Buffy? No, Angel must draw this bloody piece of paper that he will never become a man. How stupid. <br /> <br /> And the end is a stone hanger. <br /> <br /> What could have been worse? The Buffyshow started as big as Angel, but the hole Universe ended so crappy. Someone needs to spell out the man who wrote the script for this episode and make sure he is lost in hell. <br /> <br /> So don't save it, it's so bad, it hurts! Totally 1 out of 10.
