We all know that special effects cost money, but they seem to be able to use the money they saved to get the shots better. Of course, the train is a model in most moving shots, the helicopter is of course computer-generated, the alien looks like one of the end of the spaceballs, except it is a decade later and Spaceballs have had an excuse. <br /> <br /> The only smart thing they did was fade all the special effects to make them harder. <br /> <br /> Not even the actors could compensate for such poorly written writing and it is quite obvious that they didn't really try. <br /> <br /> Please don't waste your time. Please.
