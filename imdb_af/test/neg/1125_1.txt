I can't believe the actors agreed to do this "movie". I couldn't stand looking at it even for the fear of losing. points for each pass second. I think no one on the network who broadcast this dribble watched it before it was turned on. IMDB ratings are just as low for layer 1, it's time to get some negative numbers for cases like this.
