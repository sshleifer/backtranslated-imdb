If I were heading this movie just based on the acting / script / production, etc., I would give it one star. All these elements are terrible. I can partially forgive it, given the film's $ 250 budget. The movie features many entertaining scenes, mostly those of the unintentionally funny variety. Some of these include: A 14-year-old child steals and manages a bus, teenage schoolgirls (one of whom is a Joy Division t-shirt) who is afraid to bother the film's protagonists by a woman who " an obvious fake firearm, and a meeting with a plastic bullet in the Arizona desert. <br /> <br /> I would have given it 5 stars just for the entertainment value, if it wasn't for the presence of that terribly annoying, morally punitive old grandmother. I needed one star just because she had her. Who the * bitter * makes a wedding cake with black frost, anyway?
