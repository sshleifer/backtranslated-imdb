Where do I start with the Killing Mind before I call the good bit? This movie is about a young psychological profile FBI woman, or something that will work for the LAPD for some reason. There are a few recognizable faces, like the "I love you, man" block from Wayne's World, a policeman (nice beard age!) And two guys who always seem to be playing, you guess, police. One of them was one of the policemen in Gross Point Blank to John Cusack over the place, the other being the FBI man with specifications in Final Destination, who is also in the Fugitive as another policeman. I know the FBI, American Marshalls, CIA, etc. Are not police, but they are all the same. They maintain the law to some extent, which they make police in my book. Feel free to agree with the definition of a policeman you want, they are still seen as the one trying to bring down the bad guys. Anyway, I deviate. The woman works with this police who only looks in a basement library or something, and for some unknown reason decides to reopen a case that has not been watched for nothing. She saw the dead body as a child, so of course she decided to reopen the case because she was personally attached to it! I also like how the person who is profiling other people's psychological condition has seen a murder scene as a child. Surely this is the kind of thing that can screw with someone's head? She began asking questions from a journalist who covered the story when it was open, even though he looked the same age as the woman. He probably also wrote for a newspaper when he was 10, or he wrote some school reports. Then she decided he would be the best person to ask about it. <br /> <br /> Then we see, as well as the reopening of homelessness from 25 years earlier, she is trying her hand at small theft as some really inconspicuous blocks sprint through a busy street with a balaclava. Away to mix, moron! Anyway, she and the police she is eating ice in the park are pursuing him, and as he crosses a bridge with a woman and child standing there, the thief grabs the mother's baby. arms and throw the baby into the river. If you haven't guessed it yet, it's the best part of the movie. I'm not sadistic and don't hate babies or anything, but the scene looks stupid. I promise you will water your pants if you have to watch this movie. It's better than the Final Destination policeman & the Fugitive jump to save the baby, then declare to his friend: "It's a baby!" How he did not know it before he entered, is outside me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, she chases after the thief, but loses him. Later she remembers that a random dog did not bark at the thief, so assume it should be his and decided to trace the thief through the dog. The dog had no marks or anything on it, so she knew where to find the dog, and so the thief finds another question I won't go. Shortly after, I stopped watching. The story was really slow, and after I stopped laughing at the baby, I lost some interest and missed what was said. <br /> <br /> Say it, I go ahead and assume that the killer was the journalist because he was a little dirty and she spent a lot of time with him. And anyone who looks at Columbo knows that the person outside the police spending most of the time with the investigator is your bad guy. Plus, other people's reviews say the killer was pretty obvious, so I'm sure it was him. <br /> <br /> All in all, a trouser film, but worth watching just one glorious scene.
