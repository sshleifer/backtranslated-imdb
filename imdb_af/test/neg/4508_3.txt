Victor Buono as the devil? Certainly, someone had been drunk when the decision was made. It's not the worst part of this crazy mish-mash of different haunted devices, but it gets my voice to be the funniest part of it. While the movie is not terrible at all, it doesn't even come after other 1970's "haunted" flashes like Amityville Horror, The Changeling and The Legend of Hell House. The Evil One can entertain in places, but don't expect to be scared. It is better approached than it is: a stupid horror movie has made all the softer by its overwhelming approach.
