Scarecrow begins with a horror movie icon a director and then kills his servant before being laid to rest. This icon, which features Christopher Lee's attributes, continues to haunt the people as a group of horror film students steal his body from the mausoleum in which he is. <br /> <br /> The first ten minutes are well filmed, good writing and lots of potential for murderous chaos. But the film draws in the middle (though thankfully not so much as "House of Death") and never gets the first source of energy back. Many of the deaths are confusing, as they seem, people only became scared when they saw a drive or other strange thing. Twice we see toxic gas used. But the box promises that this horror star will be the embodiment of all the monsters he played. Boy, is it false advertising, unless he played his career, boring old men fucking and watching, "Matlock". <br /> <br /> The general principle of the movie is decent: horror society, children who have a dead body icon. A modern equivalent (digging Vincent Price or Peter Cushing) would make a good movie. Maybe a remake is in order if it wasn't too contemptuous. The theory does not come as well, and this film offers the example. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming quality of this movie (except the beginning) is the short appearance of a very young Jeffrey Combs. I saw him and thought "it's Jeffrey Combs," but I felt I was wrong because the box never mentioned him. But probably enough, Combs was present. (A note to the filmmakers: name Combs on the cover of the DVD, you will sell more copies as if you were misleading clients.) If you die a Jeffrey Combs, consult this early role. . Otherwise, I can't offer it as a great choice for a horror movie marathon. Let me suggest "Caller" or "Popcorn" as it is both pretty decent and will be the test of time.
