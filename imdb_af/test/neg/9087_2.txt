Whoever compared this to RAIDERS OF THE LAST ARK certainly knew what he was talking about. He also equated to some of the adventures of the puppy jackets that followed. "Kay Hoog" reminds one of those Lamont Cranston (The Shadow) and Clark Savage (Doc Savage). (The shadow, the real man of mystery - and the very first "Dark Knight" - was also one Kent Allard. If you first took Savage's name and added the Kent, you'll come with Clark Kent.) , innit?) Like Indiana Jones, High is not above the ancestors of an ancient civilization (although his thefts are often more blatant and less "charming roguish" than Jones's). Unfortunately, these two parties are far from the next series (of any time) in terms of overall quality. One of the first indications that something is wrong is a vision of the storytelling. It is a scene where desperados are horse-riding, literally breathing in his neck, just watching how high their clutches escape in a hot air balloon. Why not bother shooting the balloon is just one of many movie mysteries that plague these two films. <br /> <br /> The second half of these two parties is even worse than the first. Admittedly, it was one of the first ever series and as such a little slump has to be cut - but there are limits, even to tolerance. (At one point, the hero's reception is not put on the screen, but in the narrative itself! Talk about the cutting angles ...) Fritz Lang is one of the greatest filmmakers ever to make films; Unfortunately for those of us who admire most of what he did, the SPIDERS are a bitter pill indeed to swallow ...
