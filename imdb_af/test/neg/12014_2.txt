The only good one of the Problem Child movies was to bring Amy Yasbeck and the late John Ritter together. In addition, the flashes are as demonic as their hero. In this basically unnecessary sequel, the new divorced Ben (Ritter) and his little hellraiser Junior (Michael Oliver, who never needs screen time) are coming to a new village that is infected with voluntary bachelorette. Ben eventually chooses Lawanda (played by the most underutilized original SNL's Laraine Newman), whose Blanche DuBois tendencies don't fit in the least Junior. To add to Junior's torture, it looks as if this town has a little earlier in a younger girl form with Trixie, who happened to have played a lovely single mom played by Yasbeck, the same actress who made Junior's first terrible mess. played. You can see where the plot goes from here. Looking for my favorite scene is like pulling teeth, so I think I'm going with the "cherry bomb in the toilet" slap that will make future James Tolkan one of many adults (that guy always plays school authority figures). Jack Warden and Gilbert Gottfried return as their part of the first film, but unfortunately there is no appearance of the Bow tie Klansmaer, I mean Killer (Michael Richards) who made Problem Child more fun. On a serious note, I'm sure these movies, or abusive parents saw them or not, did wonders for America's red-headed children. Let us also greet this proud American movie for their immense promotion of adoption. Oh, and the dog's joking jokes - must be joking ... Shmucks.
