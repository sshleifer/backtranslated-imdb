I can only think of one of these reasons. To capitalize on the coming fame of Guy Pearce. This movie has no merit and unnecessarily Errol Flynn's memory wastes. The homosexual encounter was purely speculation. Flynn's contempt for this movie is striking. An easy way to blaspheme an actor who died years ago. Terrible and embarrassing. Very disappointing. Don't waste your time on this total waste. Look at my wrong ways if you want to learn about this fine actor or read his autobiography. This movie is NOT the way.
