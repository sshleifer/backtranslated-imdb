Ru Paul plays a secret agent called Starrbooty. She boasts another drag queen agent to fight the evil Annaka Manners (Candis Cayne) and get her kidnapped cousin back ... or something. Seriously - I had trouble concentrating on the plot! The movie is apparently directed by someone with a serious ADD - fast camera cut does not stop making it impossible to focus on anything. The dialogue is sometimes incomprehensible and when you can hear it, you wish it remains incomprehensible! Actually, the acting is pretty good, except for Ru Paul, who steals an embarrassment. The film is also full of disgusting bathroom humor that is just rebellious and not even remotely funny. After 30 minutes I had to leave because I was bored, sick and just couldn't stand. I'm proud to put anything, but it has gone beyond my limits! People compare this to the early work of John Waters. I do not agree. Waters' work is sick but good - it's just sick. Avoid.
