Just once, I would like Koontz's work to be given to a decent screenwriter, director and producer! Just once! <br /> <br /> This is a good effort by Jean LeClerc and Chris Sarandon, and an even better attempt by Victoria Tennant, but everything is purely untouched. The author has to be shot to bastard Koontz's work this way and the director ... please. <br /> <br /> The story is a well-written story, but the script is rather boring, incredible and terribly executed. The only work elements are the performances by LeClerc, Sarandon, and Tennant. <br /> <br /> On a personal note, I really wanted to work it out. I love Koontz's novels, but they never gave them the attention, support and talent they deserve. If they put the same money into Koontz's work, that they come to the barrels in the King, Koontz will rise quickly above. But unfortunately! Without powerful people who believe in his work, I fear he will never get the chance. <br /> <br /> As an adaptation to the novel, this movie was a total feast. As a stand-alone movie, it wasn't that bad, though it was very poor in many places with great plot holes and terrible, stiff, unprofessional dialogue that should never make it to the final cut. This movie failed to reach its potential. If they followed the original work by Koontz, a little closer, and invested a decent amount of production rights, it would have been a much better effort. <br /> <br /> But all I can see in it is how good it could have been and wasn't. <br /> <br /> It's a 4.3 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy:
