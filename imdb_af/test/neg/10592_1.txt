The Mod Squad is not a movie, it's a void. This is the fascinating thing about it and the thing that made me look? I have never seen a movie that has never offered anything before. It's a movie without any reason to exist, seemingly consciously designed to complain to anyone as if it were merely a contractual obligation for someone who really didn't like the studio. There is no plot, there is no characterization, there are no fixed action scenes, there is not even a scene as such, just a progression of increasing empty shots projected at 24 frames per second. I'm not talking about empty as in dumb summer, but empty as in "We don't have the pages yet, so point the camera at something and stop if you have 90 minutes worth it." It appreciates the "artistic achievements" of Charlie's Angels and S.W.A. so much more. What it offers is far too much of Giovanni Ribisi at his most boring execrable to make his bastard thousand-thousand-year-old son who portrays Marlon Brando acting routine, Michael Lerner who is dancing with Omar Epps? no, that's it. Oh, Clare Danes has a nice smile in one shot. And Dennis Farina has the feeling of killing early. Actually the most sensible movie ever made, it's like L'Humanite without the jokes, but you know it for kids.
