Author and director Robert Downey, Sr., a pioneer of the underground movie movement in the 1960s, satirized the advertising world of New York Madison Avenue with his avant-garde comedy "Putney Swope." Downey does not limit his cartoon to advertising, but tackles the black militant culture, the dynamics of Hollywood's portrayal of race, the elite white power structure and the character of corruption in any power struggle.

Swope's clients are stepping up after becoming CEO, and Grandstanding is attracting a new range of clients appearing at his office's pockets of money and willing to abuse Swope's militant employees. Swopes also use his African-American staff to use their ideas relentlessly after burning them and calling a number of offensive advertising campaigns, all of which are considered a "new wave of marketing genius". Incredibly, Swope's conservatism proves successful, but the agency is the target of government operators claiming Swope's advertising tactics to be a threat to national security. "The highlight of this black and white, 85-minute comedy is the color television commercials. Unfortunately, Downey doesn't know how to cut off those ads that consistently start well, but welcome them. Putney Swope involves our equal protagonist's handling of US President Mimeo in Washington DC (Pepi Hermine), a marijuana token killer with a Kissinger-like-Teutonic adviser (Larry Wolf) who spits tasteless jokes while trying to convince Swope Come up with an advertising campaign for his new car, the Borman 6.
