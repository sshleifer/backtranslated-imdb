Sherman Hemsley was great in Jefferson's and especially All in the Family. He was also very good at Amen, why on earth would he do this movie? This movie has a terrible writing and is a waste of a very funny man. Luis Avalos does the best he can, but it's terrible. This movie was the start of bankruptcy for Sherman Hemsley. I think he is very funny, but it is a terribly senseless ghost story. Paste with Ghostbusters.
