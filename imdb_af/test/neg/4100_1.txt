It's a pitiful movie. What makes it even more unfortunate is the time, effort and money placed in a super predictable script and action. <br /> <br /> It's about a kind of monsters, casually, and some sort of insect. Don't expect an explanation of the plot. There is nobody. It can work if something of interest or characters we can care about. There is no. Anything that happens to any person is as predictable as the other Sci Fi channel movies. <br /> <br /> Don't try to understand what some of the characters say. They talk gibberish, especially the annoying head woman, whose accent is a kind of thick British that is harder to understand than any old British movie you may have seen. She is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Much money is spent on a few big sets and scenery, and that's the big crime of this movie because it's just not worth it.
