Hulk Hogan plays Rip a professional wrestler who has a big heart, but is pushed to the limit when his girlfriend (Joan Severence) is kidnapped by murderers who force him to take another wrestler (Tiny Lister Jr.). At the bottom of the barrel action is such a failure that even Hogan is ashamed to be in it, and with the evidence depicted, he must be.
