One hundred and seventy-five million dollars is a lot of money to spend on even the biggest summer blocker. Not even Michael Bay had a budget that is great for Transformers, so exactly how Universal Pictures spent so much money. Evan Almighty is a mystery. They certainly did not spend it for one thing, because the film is not so much a classic comedy as it is a Christian flag that blows and carries one or two quiet chuckles. You will probably spend the time wondering where the budget has gone or why Steve Carrell felt the need to put it in a definite average movie at the exact moment when his star profile began to rise. <br /> <br /> A sequel to the Jim Carrey comedy Bruce Almighty, this film sees former supporting character Evan Baxter (Carrell) moving the ladder into the lead player slot. The story begins with him becoming the news agency to become a civil servant and to go to Washington with his wife and three generic boys (slightly strange primary school moped, rushed middle school and struggling teenager). However, Evan's attempt to change the world through politics gets a key in the works when God (Morgan Freeman) appears and asks him to build an Ark. <br /> <br /> In other words, this is an update to the old Genesis story, with Evan fighting cynicism and naysayers to build the huge boat. Unfortunately, while the premise is pretty promising, it doesn't offer much laughter. There is a bit of fun to be in the early stages, where Evan's straightforward MP is trying to address the demands of the public service with the unwelcome packs of animals pursuing him, and a beard that attempts to shave it all. as he accepts his divine mission, the film takes nosedive. <br /> <br /> From this point it becomes a message movie. Evan begins with a disturbing regularity preaching and Morgan Freeman stops giving good wisdom while gently predicting his voter in the right direction. Without Evan's resistance, the only trace of comedy comes in the form of some rubbish worms and John Michael Higgin's role as Evan's right-wing man. Higgins can show the same rich comic potential as he did earlier in Arrested Development, but his enthusiasm cannot save the sink, especially as Carrell has all put his formidable improper skills on the back burner. <br /> <br /> In some respects it is somewhat similar to the Passion of Christ, but unlike Mel Gibson's movie that everyone encouraged to believe in God by trying blood loss and guilt, Evan Almighty tried a more soft approach. The movie just tells us that we must have faith in God, because He has faith in us. Unfortunately, this movie is just as likely to make you laugh as the Passion is. Carrell is on autopilot, the jokes don't exist and Wanda Sykes makes an effort to become the most annoying person on the planet. It may be sweet, but someone just threw $ 175 000 overboard.
