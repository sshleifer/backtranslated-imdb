The storyline has too many mistakes and illogical sequences worth it. Jolie's play is pretty flat and poor, Washington is right, the rest of the role is cardboard cuttings. Somehow, almost everything about this movie extracts mediocrity. The plot is lame. The only thing I liked more or less about this movie is the fairly original methods used by the perpetrator to end his victims. Technical details are worse than the most far-reaching KSI 'knowledge' and gizmos and half-film wonder whether one or even the director cares for detail credibility. (Some Spoilers Hereafter!) I mean, an ECG machine with a pure sine wave that reflects one's heartbeat, a full body muscle paced quadriplegia and a dialer figure. A killer throws a man's intestines while keeping him alive to greet the rats on him, followed by a rat aimed at the man's FACE! What's with all that stupidity? Then there are quite a few continuity throws, but you can find others elsewhere on IMDb. Honestly, I found it a bit offensive, even for my limited intelligence. <br /> <br /> Time wasting. Still 4 out of 10 to stop my girlfriend from kicking me.
