If a movie can't keep your interest in the first 25 minutes, it's gone as far as I'm doing. This concept that you simply have to handle a slow first third of a movie and later be rewarded is nonsense. A good movie must start and end strongly. It all looks interesting and some decent shots and lots of promise, but ultimately confused and irrelevant. There are so many other movies from Asia to watch, which I am sure most of you have not seen, that I would really overshoot this one and look elsewhere. Why does IMDb need a 10-line minimum for reviews? I said my piece and I hope it helps some of you go to the next movie.
