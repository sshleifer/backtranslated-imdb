Other than that, the characters of the first movie have given up and given them more background. In essence, Lucian fell in love with the Lycan (werewolf) on Sonia the Vampire, a Romeo and Juliet scenario you know will end badly if you have seen the first movie. So, with absolutely no tension, we blunder ahead with two hours of incessant CGI and actors with little or no screen presence. Everybody shot in that monotonous color that had the first movie because nothing was shot in the daylight. <br /> <br /> Don't appreciate your time .. probably. In fact, the quality has gone down, even the CGI looks like it's done on the cheap, you don't buy for a moment it's actually werewolves.
