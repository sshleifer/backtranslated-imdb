It's one of the unsatisfactory and light entertaining movies trying to keep them more of them. But like many others, the material is not strong enough to fill up for a few hours. <br /> <br /> The peak is promising: three drag queens drive a bus through Sydney's Outback to Alice Springs. They are in great trouble - with homophobic residents, with the engine, with their past. <br /> <br /> The real problem is with the dialogue. The clues are good (although Pearce's ongoing campness gets tiring), but the one-liners and epithets feel forced to dispose of them. Characters should not laugh at their own gags. <br /> <br /> Author / director Elliott also feels the need to pile on the pleasurable, unpleasant shots of flamboyant costumes against harsh desert-like backgrounds such as so much cheap makeup. For a movie about self-confidence and being yourself, it all looks very unsafe.
