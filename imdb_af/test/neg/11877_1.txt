In my days I saw some bad action movies, but this one is just awful. I feel it is a waste of time to even write it, but I will make it short. Why does this movie suck? Here are 10 reasons: 1. Very amateurish and cut. 2. Bad bad bad behavior from the whole role. 3. Silly dialogs and too many clich√©s. 4. Too many plot holes, many scenes do not add up. 5. Bad photography (and many continuity issues). 6. Nice bad performance by the main female actress. 7. Unreliable action scenes (and not too well, or). 8. Even for a Snipes movie, he shows a great lack of acting. 9. Outrageous accent (of all cast). 10. Last, but not least, too many unquestionable facts, such as a soccer tournament in the US, should do the CIA background check to get new information about their employees, an explosion-free mattress, and so on. In essence - it's a waste of time, it's not funny, not entertaining, not even a joke. DON. T WATCH IT !!! Seriously, just do not.
