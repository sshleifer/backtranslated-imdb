With its little touch of surrealism, LWHTRB works as a low grade horror, but as an important follow-up statement to the original, it flows miserably. <br /> <br /> Things start to be somewhat promising during phone opening credits. We see and hear several interesting shots and sounds: The Baby's black crib with the overhanging, inverted cross; The kitchen knife Rosemary was worn in the Castevette's apartment and fell into shock (the tool is shown from the hardwood floor); and the emptiness of the Bramford itself, without tenants or furniture (voice remains can be heard from the previous film's dialogue). Also interesting is the Easter egg hunt on which the titular child participates (the eggs and baskets are also black). Once the story starts rolling, it never really rolls ... And what happens to Rosemary when she drives the driverless bus and knows God? <br /> <br /> Patty Duke (a weak substitute for Mia Farrow), Ray Milland and Tina Louise (like the Southwestern Whore, who set up the kid, Adrian / Andrew) are repeating her "Minnie" role. <br /> <br /> Although not a total failure, this successor had to be released in book form. Perhaps we all know a little better. and not completely left in the dark. A fairly recent sequel novel "Son of Rosemary" (1999?) Is the legitimate succession of Ira Levin himself. <br /> <br />
