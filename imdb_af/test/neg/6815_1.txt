Like a reviewer, I wanted to keep this movie. I was with my dad, who was the greatest lover and booster of classical music, but none of us could stand this movie. I won't even call it a movie. A better description can be a record of a few room concerts. As I recall, the camera never moved. On the contrary, I just sat on a tripod for the whole of each piece. The only attempt at dramatic effect was at the end of each piece when the movie would cut to wind-blown trees or small wolflets loading onto a beach. I'm sure the director would have preferred to use very large imagery, but the best he could get was a few inches high at some nearby lakes, and again using a stationary camera. Really pathetic. I can't imagine how anyone can justify this movie above five. As we walked out, my dad and I were completely amazed at how it was possible to make such a bad movie. I don't know about any good movies about Bach. The world really needs one, but just because it doesn't exist, it's not a reason to see this one. Someone will make one day. Review up to just reload _Amadeus_.
