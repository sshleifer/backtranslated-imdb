There is really very little positive that can be said about this movie. Walter Pidgeon is a truly unconvincing hero and even moreso when he tries to "cover" as a villain we must believe, drink too much and beat his wife a little. Margaret Leighton, as the woman / shelter sergeant, is a bit more convincing, but it is still hard to believe that a hood worth their salt would not be seen by their charade within a minute. The plot, hovering over a bullion, is stupid, and the action rather than pulls. David Tomlinson, who plays Algy in the same way that David Tomlinson plays all his roles, is the only gleam of light in a completely dull case.
