The filmmakers are trying to refine the influence of the Mondovis and Robert Parker as a transvestite with the German occupation of France and the government of Fascism. But they never find a victim in this movie. We hear winemakers, critics and distributors claiming that while the wine industry is growing, it is becoming increasingly homogeneous. But the film never makes a case of losing any good wine or exploitation of any person or culture other than naive Wine Spectator readers with a lot of cash. If they want to pay hundreds of dollars for a dim wine, so it is. <br /> <br /> If it was a movie about the diamond trade, where the DeBeers corporation's domination in human suffering, the muckraking style could be appropriate. But as it is, it just comes down as anti-American, anti-modernization and anti-capitalist. If the filmmakers were in the 1870s, they would probably have protested the harvest of American vineyards to save French wine.
