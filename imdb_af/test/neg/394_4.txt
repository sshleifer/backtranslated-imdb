Really, average is the only word that comes into my mind when you see it. <br /> <br /> The acting was average (maybe a bit above average), the use of the camera was average (actually lower than average, so shaky and the colors were granular and vague.) The plot was a good one, but moved so slowly and was not well used. <br /> <br /> It could have been so much more than it didn't go in a snail's pace and we saw more in the backgrounds of the characters. <br /> <br /> All we see is Alice's flash sheets here and there and how her home life is so bad (her mother is a working class woman trying to put an end to her and her daughter.) a look back from her when she was in high school and her friend told her: "Tell your mother to eat better" and "everyone says it's your mother." Yes, it is embarrassing, but why would you run away from it. <br /> <br /> I could definitely see if her mother was drunk or abused her, but nothing was wrong with her, except she was ashamed of it. How immature! <br /> <br /> We don't even get a glimpse of what the couple's lives were (except they were prostitutes for a while and the woman forgot her name, her baby gave up when it was 9 months old .) It could have been so much more. It could have been Alice who was abused by her drunk mother, going to Florida with her friend, but then it became a prostitute. Or something like that of the other, then the real plot of this movie (that is) Alice, a girl with a home life of probably 90% of America's population (WORKING CLASS). <br /> <br /> I don't see why it won an award at Sundance (it had to be at a very bad competition to win that one award.) <br /> <br /> Also for me was Alice's Boston / New England accent forced. It didn't look right. (I have to know, I was born and raised in Boston, but now live in Georgia.) <br /> <br /> 4/10 Not really worth your time.
