There was a time when the Alien series was a success with even the third installment, Alien 3, which promised under the guise of a fresh and young David Fincher. The first Predator was a box office mainly hit by his story, "in peak" star Arnold Schwarzenegger and director John McTiernan (Die Hard). The films Alien, Aliens, Alien 3 and Predator were all very successful and created massive follow-ups among general movie fans and science fiction fans. Probably, Predator 2 and Alien Resurrection had to end both franchises, but studios were unsatisfied and saw the opportunity to blast fans and combine the two. Step into Paul W. S. Anderson, Alien Vs Predator, and now the Brothers Strauss (visual effects graduated, not even directors or writers). The problem was that by allowing such profound and revolutionary creations of the Sci-Fi genre to first fall into the hands of a mediocre director and now directors' cuts have led to nothing more than curse, which was depicted by incompetence no. At the testimony of Alien Vs Predator Requiem (AVPR), the hard fans will feel sick to their stomachs that this series could be worse. <br /> <br /> One example of the film reduction of this franchise is in the opening scene and will probably cause obscenity among fans. The movie begins with an Alien coming on the Predator ship, arising from the predator's chest, growing into an adult Predaline and bringing down the Predator vessel. It now seems to have far fewer predators than it did at the end. from Alien Vs Predator) and all this happens to the ship still in Earth's atmosphere. Once the ship has compressed the AVPR, quickly exceeded inexpensive plot methods and basic narrative conventions, it doesn't dare to use any of the turns or subversions in the two original movies. The tiring plot progresses with boring pace, but only through the nearby conflicts of Alien and Predator, and when it's at risk of getting bored, we're treated to either an attractive blonde in a bikini or a quick firearm. AVPR is plagued by an endless settlement of continuity errors and plot holes with little or no narrative clarification, ie members of the public that constitute an elite military unit or the Predator that does not comply with laws laid down in previous issues. It is a film that has a complete disregard for its predecessors, it breaks some of the most fundamental rules of a successor, thus giving the feeling that it is trying to set it as a standalone feature. Independently, the film has no heart, no conviction and no soul, and with reference to the other films, even the most basic continuity is lacking. This is suggested by the overarching story of the movie, as it undermines the basic premise of the first Alien. For if the species had previously encountered, those in the first Alien movie would have been more skilled and not as ill-prepared as they had met them. <br /> <br /> On a movie, the movie is close to dire, I insisted on some points to shine a torch on the screen, the lighting was so bad. By using such gloomy and dark effects can the audience feel as if they are being challenged from the action? which is ironically its purpose and also points to the films' lack of budget. As with all science fiction, one scene is usually the most memorable. In this case, it's probably the hospital fertilization scene, as it has ever been so tough on the themes of the original Alien by making it too literal. The direction is poor, performances are poor and the writing rot. AVPR is the product of a conveyor belt manufacturing system in which ideas and techniques are compiled by ineffective people and then the final product distributed among theaters. It is personalized by the absence of gory death tones and blood vessels pulled out because the certification won't allow it? a lower certification that achieves a larger target audience. AVPR was purely a business and nothing more.
