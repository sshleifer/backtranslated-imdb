I think Tom Hanks is a good actor. I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little. I was very disappointed in the movie. One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feel of fingernails on a board. There is a completely unnecessary train / roller coaster scene. There are a few characters and scenes that are terrifying for small children for whom this film is made. The North Pole scenes with Santa and the elves could have been cute and beautiful. There was absolutely no warmth or charm for these scenes or characters. It usually doesn't work to make a short children's book in a feature film. This movie totally falls on my nerves.
