O boy. Movies like this really bother me. If this movie is supposed to be true, I assume that Rommel had known Hitler for a while before World War II began. In the film, Rommel mentions how Hitler has changed from the beginning. Well, I can't imagine Rommel not knowing about Hitler's government policy, so Rommel should share some guilty feelings for the German atrocities. With that in mind, I have a problem with a movie that makes Rommel's life at the end a tragic one. He made his choices and we have to feel bad for him? I can't do it. I also can't buy the theory that if the more competent generals could fight the war, the allies would have had more trouble winning it. If more competent people were in control, World War II could never begin in the first place. From a movie viewing aspect, the movie jumps from place to place and most of the time looks like a history special with big names actors playing the historical roles. Leo G. Carroll has some good scenes with James Mason and I liked the fact that everyone spoke English without the ridiculous accent. But other than that, not very necessary.
