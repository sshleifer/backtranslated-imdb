As you can read, the only good comment about this movie is made by someone who actually sees it at his church! <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie had started a good B-movie sci-fi, everything was there to make a good entertaining, easy movie, and then everything in this religious Jesus -would-save-all-brainwashing feeling. <br /> <br /> story begins with 2 main characters, 2 reporters, but it quickly gives the first role to that Jesus freak who is there to save everyone's soul with these descendants. <br /> <br /> In a few words: this movie goes from entertaining to brainwashing in about 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> Wasting time, money wastage ... BUSINESS
