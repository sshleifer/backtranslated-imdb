One of those movies where you take bets who will die first and who will survive in the end. There was just something about the movie that made me out of the zone. I think, because I hold back and think, "Yes, still in that tree ... still to the water." Poor character development. I felt nothing when they were in danger. I voted for the hook. I found it hard to believe that a crocodile would try to hit a boat in the first place and when it jumped into the boat, I found it unlikely. The crocus sometimes looks too supernatural ('everyone knows everything'). Even when the behavior of the crowns looks like it is unrealistic. It is a murder machine and will not allow victims to escape a row twice after three times, especially when they fall into the water.
