I really had the idea of ​​traveling between dimensions, and even kept the Wade / Quinn tensions in early episodes. Some of the worlds they created have given the main characters a very interesting background for their stories. But when the show went on, there were more stupid disputes among the friends and less of a real bond. There was less wonder and excitement when they were involved in other worlds and more ruin. And every world fell in love with one of the characters. The writing just got boring and everything was over. It would have been a pity to have a close bond of friends (a la Star Wars) who have been traveling to different dimensions on TV for years, rather than a tired band of knitted pickers.
