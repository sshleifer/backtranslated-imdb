To see this movie in previews, I thought it would be spiritual and in good spirits. Unfortunately, it was a standard case of "the funny bits in the preview", not to say it was bad. But the good bits were in the preview. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an adolescent movie that will make you sleep, watch this movie.
