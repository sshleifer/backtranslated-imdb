This is one of the most beautiful films. Like so many "women in chains" movies, this one is full of lesbians. BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA shows a huge amount of skin as a horde female jailer among the women while they shower and have sex with one of the prisoners, as opposed to most previous films, which have strongly implied them. For the early 1970s, it's definitely a soft-core pornographic movie - like GIRL'S GONE, WILD GIVEN TO PRICE! It is also a bad tear from DEFIANT OUR, although in this case it is two hot women who hate each other that connect each other when they escape. While the original film is considered a classic, this one can only be considered a classic example of bad taste. This is because there is no subtlety and the movie is just cheap - cheap excitement, cheap writing and very cheap acting. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier is the "black prisoner with an attitude" - a lady sent up and sent to prison on this hellish island. Margaret Markov is a revolutionary. When they escape, they cannot stand each other and have opposite goals. However, since it is clich√©-driven, there really is no surprise in how the movie ends - with both of them (gag my) friends.
