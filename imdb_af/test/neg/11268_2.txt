If you're in the mood for a lot of bad porn with no good porn combined with a bad horror movie, this movie is perfect for you. However, if you inhale air, make sure you spend your time, anything other than that. The acting is crazy. The "plot" is crappy. They tried too hard, and all the time I was waiting for the one good redemptive scene that could make the movie worth watching. Nope. Stick with the rudder cable.
