It seems incredible that the same decade Star Wars brought on the silver screen has mutilated such an unspeakable trip like this and many other 'adventure' movies. I am reminded of the similar cute but equally miserable 'Ashanti' set out elsewhere. <br /> <br /> What motivated A-list actors to record such celluloid waste is honestly beyond this author. They had to be very, very desperate. To be utterly outspoken, Roger Moore's appearance in any movie is the shit. Although extremely appealing in his youth, his entire stage is based on the ability to raise one eyebrow. Each emotion from A to B is transmitted by this simple stratagem. She was James Bond's daughters. Lee Marvin, on the other hand, appeared in some very worthwhile outings, perhaps most memorably 'Paint Your Wagon' and 'The Dirty Dozen'. He has a cartoon, but he is much better off playing straight. <br /> <br /> The excellent Ian Holm is a throw away, barely recognizable as a dumb African. Everyone else just turned up for their checks. <br /> <br /> The only plausible and viewable element is the German cruiser. It looks like a very big model. But it is credibly massive and becomes authentic - like its crew. The rest is not even hokum. The childish comedy jokes with the brutality and violence in a story that was uncomfortable, as if the writing itself had too many strings from Lee Marvin's gin. Here is a director who simply doesn't know where he is going. There are tips from 'The African Queen', some of 'The Pride & The Passion', 'Gold' and one or two other rip-offs of movies that aren't easily remembered. <br /> <br /> Strange, I've seen it 3 times, every time it's shown on television when I'm low with a cold or flu. Maybe it affects my judgment - but not much. <br /> <br /> Compare it to any Indiana Jones movie and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> I gave it two stars; one for the battleship and the other because it eventually comes to an end, although heaven knows it takes long enough to do so. <br /> <br /> Time for another Lemsip, I think.
