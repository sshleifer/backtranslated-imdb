As a fan of bad movies, I was excited to find a 3 pack cr @ ppy horror at Best Buy today. The set was inexpensive and included a horrible movie called "The Dark" that I actually remember seeing in the theater. <br /> <br /> The remaining 2 were equally bad. "Abyss" is probably the worst of the bunch. Since they were all bad, it didn't say much. But his stupidity, bad acting, horrible effects and delayed storyline actually made this one fun to watch. I was on the floor with every new plot development. The discovery of the abandoned ship, the missing crew, the realization that something was terribly wrong !!! It was wonderful !!! Of course, everyone's favorite scene looks like the sex scene. OMG !! I almost lost it !!! Between that a monster camera, I have to say I really enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of bad movies, so I enjoyed it, but in all fairness I had to watch the movie a 1. It was wrong ... But if garbage is your pocket, hire this one at least ... (YES the BAD wordplayer was intentional)
