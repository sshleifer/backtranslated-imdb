When George Sluizer was told, he could order an American version of the book "The Golden Egg", the film "Spoorloos" (outside Holland, this film also the name "the Vanishing"). He said it would only go If the end had changed, he said "the American audience" would not approve the original end. Of course, the original end is much better, and without it, the film loses its impact. Because I already put it in the trivia section, I won't give the original end and keep my comment spoiler-free. If you want to know the original end, see "Trackless" or read the book. This movie is absolute rubbish, and the first Kiefer Sutherland movie I don't like. Watch the original Dutch movie, which is one of the best thrillers in the world.
