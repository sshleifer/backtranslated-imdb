A virtual carbon copy of The Cave saves for a lower budget effect and a slightly different plot. I knew the movie was downhill when I saw the false campfire flashing lights, it clearly reflected in a visual close-up of one of the actors. The conflicts between characters and subplots seemed to have no purpose and nothing added to the film, except fewer moments of silence. The acting was not as bad as the typical B-movie, and there was some credibility in their fear, but as professional cavers it seems as if they are psychologically unstable for their chosen career. Generally, it's not worth wasting $ 4.50.
