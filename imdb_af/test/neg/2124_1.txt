There really isn't much to say about this. It's just really bad. The acting is bad, the writing is bad, and editing is probably one of the worst works ever. It's so sloppy and messy that it just serves to confuse the audience. There isn't actually a plot to talk about, mostly, it's a very fake monstrous fish that the Europeans attack to leave themselves as Americans. Pass on this one.
