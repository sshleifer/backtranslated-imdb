I will say one thing to Herman, USA: it will probably always play well for Minnesota audiences. I can't imagine there being another place in the world where a reference to the quick life of Bemidji or a line like "I knew there was something wrong with Iowa guys" would break the house down. I really enjoyed the first hour or so. Basically, a lot of lonely country boys take out a personal ad and find their village with willing female suitors (is a gender-specific word?). It's not progressive, surely, but it's sorta charm in its own right. Too bad the filmmakers had the need to sound on a confronted subplot about a fucking goldsmith and her violent man. Overall, it's just too cloying for its own good, but you have to give some props to a movie with the guts to give up with Kevin Chamberlin's build of a naked love scene. I will not always portray people who do not meet the usual beauty standards as sexual, surrounding people, but it is not enough to save Herman, USA. To paraphrase Jello Biafra, it is nostalgia for an era that never existed.
