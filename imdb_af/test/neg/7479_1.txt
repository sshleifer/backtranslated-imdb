He looks like it's a control freak. I heard that he was commenting on the control of the show, and told another guest that brought live animals that he had one rule - no snakes. He must appoint a comedian writer because his jokes are lame. The only reason I see him is because he has some good guests and bands. <br /> <br /> I watched the Craig Ferguson show for a while, but his performance is even worse. He likes to bunch to burn time. I don't think man has a future in late night shows. <br /> <br /> Daily also has the annoying habit of sticking out his tongue to lick his lips. He must do it at least 10 times. I like the Joe Firstman band. Carson Daily should be relieved before it's too late.
