I didn't want to write this movie on the reviews and critics in the Western world. I mean how wrong have they been about the Asian cinema that has now become a pile-up diet of the Hollywood remake monster? Plus Jet L is pretty damn cool, and he made some interesting movies in Asia. So with an open mind I was surprisingly average by this movie. <br /> <br /> There are good points. The story is very clever, using M-Theory as the basis to bring the plot forward that there are multiple universes, each with their own versions of worlds, and most likely you. Each time one of you is destroyed, the rest shares the energy and power among them. The idea that someone can be deliberately tried becomes the only version of themselves in all the universe to find out if they become a God. <br /> <br /> There is also Jet Li, and he is not a bad actor and pretty fine as a martial artist, plus Jason Statham who is a very good actor. Regarding the special effects, some of them are really cool, a blend of peak time, and slow motion with normal speed, very cool to look in places. The bad points? Well, Statham's accent is terrible, and some of the effects aren't as comparable to others. So it is clear that money was spent on some of the main shots and not on others that are probably considered too short on the screen <br /> <br /> A big hurt for me is the meticulous camera activity that Hollywood has long favored, something Jackie Chan often spoke about. Close-up motion screens serve two goals. It puts more emphasis on a single punch or motion, which makes it look harder and more real than it really is, and it also hides what's going on around the camera lens. For example, people who double a fake arm or face a stunt, etc. Has. <br /> <br /> What Chan always said was that he tried to open the camera and let the audience see what's going on, let them see The people were fighting rather than a close-up of a face and a fist, and cut that someone falls into the frame. The whole picture is more effective, and it is more impressive. <br /> <br /> So, the meticulous shots were just more annoying than anything, you didn't see Li's fighting skills and you found it difficult to see some of the action. Delay the tracks and roll out the Hollywood directors! The biggest problem, however, was the story, despite the fact that such a strong base was on which to build, they lost the meaning of the plot and focused on the action scenes. There are some serious plot buildings and explanatory moments that are completely overlooked and covered in the sense of a few sentences, but it could have formed an excellent and complex character development. <br /> <br /> It just kept everyone together. poor, and not enough of the story made. All in all, not a good movie and its potential is badly spoiled.
