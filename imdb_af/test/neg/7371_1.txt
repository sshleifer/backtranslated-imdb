A film about an interesting and sensitive history, filmed in beautiful surroundings, has managed to present a terrifying trivial and clumsy production, rough clumsy script, poor continuity, intrusive grinding music, struggling decisive and pallid acting. <br /> <br /> It was an attempt to pass between the screenplay and the play. The script probably won - the historical background, background and character descriptions were spelled out in the dialogue. .. Actually, words can't really describe how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> In a pre-release screening, there was a massive exodus of about thirty minutes. In about an hour, many of those who stayed were laughing out loud. I must add that I am a Francophile, I am fascinated by Canada and love historical film. It really was a one-off.
