The concept of this movie is pretty compelling: zombie kids get out of a deserted mine to take revenge for their death in the backwoods of Pennsylvania. Cool. The problem I had with the movie is the lack of creativity in dealing with the zombies. The makers could really have crawled this movie with some terrifying images, such as a "The Ring" like stop action, back camera drives or things like that. As the zombie kids walk through the forest, they look like a bunch of 9-year-olds walking to a playground in the West Philadelphia. Instead of choosing axes and kicks, they could easily wear baseball bats and gloves. Why would I fear these little children? Anyone can just run in a straight line to safety. Also, who would have been in their right mind a night with their kids in that creepy, downstairs home? The moment I opened that door and looked around, I would have said: "Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Sun, start the car. I'm going back to a forest and then we're off here. "Absolutely amazing movie. Don't waste your time.
