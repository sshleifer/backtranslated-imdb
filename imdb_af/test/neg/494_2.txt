I don't know any idiotic rock'n'roll cliches that aren't used in this movie. Ouffcourz, the rock entry life is just sex drugs and parties and tons of super models trying to drive you. Say it to stupid young boys. The filmmakers have read too many Guns'nRoses or Motley Crue stories. I have seen the everyday life of the ordinary rock band now and there is nothing to do with reality in this movie. If you are successful, your life is touring. This means you're mostly in a bus and trying to sleep. Just sleep. Because you need to be fresh, fresh and clean in the evenings. After life you have some time to carry your stage excitement. Then you have some time to have fun. But it's not a luxury or a dream. Artistic, this film was zero. Stupid characters and idiotic dialogues. The end of the movie was funny - the main character left heavy metal tape and formed a ground band! Yes, what a moral. Real 90s.
