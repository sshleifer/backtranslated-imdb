Many of Alistair MacLean's books made it on the big screen. Some of them (the guns of Navarone, fear is the key, where eagles dare) are well translated; some (Breakheart Pass, Ice Station Zebra, The Secret Ways) are sufficient enough; a few (River Of Death, Bear Island, The Road to Steaming Death) were pretty rotten. Caravan To Vaccares is another movie based on one of MacLean's ever-popular bestsellers, but unfortunately it's still one that deserves to add to the "rotten" list. Shared by uninteresting characters who come in uninteresting situations and escape, Caravan To Vaccares is an absolute failure, as well as an excitement and entertainment. The only semi-redemptive features are: a) being filmed in very attractive locations in Provence, and b) Charlotte Rampling looks quite overwhelming (with full nude scenes to begin) as the main female character. <br /> <br /> Disillusioned American driver Neil Bowman (David Birney) travels through France purposefully as he meets British photographer Lila (Charlotte Rampling). They decide to accompany each other and make their knowledge of the mysterious nobleman Duc De Croyter (Michel Lonsdale) known. The Duc persuaded the couple to help him protect and guide the Hungarian scientist Zuger (Michael Bryant), who was sought after by various shadow parties for information he had in his head. The secret of Bowman and Lila is the fact that Zuger has discovered a secret formula for using solar energy as cheap, economic energy. The Hungarian must desperately get his formula to New York, but rented guns are placed on his trail to catch him? presumably so that he can be traced back to a ruthless criminal lord and tortured to reveal his valuable secret, which they can then sell to the highest bidder. Bowman and Lila find themselves and their dreaded refugees in the French countryside of their deadly opponents. <br /> <br /> The movie looks terribly cheap and amateur, almost like an ultra-low-budget independent film produced by a non-professional cast and crew. Nevertheless, a fair amount of money has been thrown into the film, and all those involved have done much better work on various points in their careers. Therefore, one must assume that the film is bad because it is written, performed and directed with a clear lack of care and interest. The pacing is deadly slow, and the plot points are so laborious that the viewer has to put too many unpaid efforts to keep up with the story. Birney's performance is unfinished, and Rampling just creates a stir because of her naked scene? the character itself is an absolute drill, and the actress really looks bored at it. For those who finish the film, there is an unusual scene with deadly rodeo clowns and a fiery bull (!) Which, though not very exciting or well done, differs at least from the norm. Caravan To Vaccares is, in most respects, a very disappointing film, and once again a strong novel by the beneficial author suffered during his transition on the screen.
