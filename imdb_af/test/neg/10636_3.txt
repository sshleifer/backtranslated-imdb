I saw it tonight on TCM and was shocked by the overwork by Jean Arthur. Her eyes were astonished and generally over-done, everything was not in the same style as Dietrich and Art Lund. Dietrich was wonderful in her self-control and comic timing. She's the best thing in this movie. The Wilder gags were flat and frankly more like something a batsman in the college would write, trying to get away, with a bad, greasy and dirty but just sounding and not funny. It seems that humor has been pushed too hard to be funny. The end was completely confronted. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD: I never thought for a moment that Art Lund had fallen out of love with Dietrich and then he suddenly fell in love with Arthur. Oh, Billy. Get Really! 3 out of 10.
