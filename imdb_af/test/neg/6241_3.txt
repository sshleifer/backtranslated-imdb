I wanted to keep this movie, and definitely there is room for a psychic character-driven movie that doesn't go for the cheap excitement. Yet, for the enjoyment of a movie, requires a credible plot, some pacing and editing, and a sense of engagement. In The Clearing, which begins as an intriguing mystery, with abduction and unknown motives, it becomes a slow, tragic, meaningful exercise. Nothing really happens, and the so-called character-driven angles (as expressed by the director in his commentary) really do not matter much. <br /> <br /> Fine actors are wasted here. Robert Redford does his best to get Willem Dafoe involved and overwhelmed. Dafoe brings a little nuance to his character, as far as one can feel a little sympathetic towards him. It is a pity that Dafoe was pointed out as a villain. He went to Christopher Walken Hall of Fame of Typecasting. <br /> <br /> Wendy Crewson is usually good, but her character's entry into the movie was short and confronted, and I was wondering why they even bothered to introduce her character. By far the greatest waste of talent was Helen Mirren. In the director's comments, all I heard was how fine a talent she was. I agree, she's a great actress. Why wasn't she being used properly? Just at the height of this movie, she must show herself, but then the viewer stopped caring. <br /> <br /> Too bad, I like parts of this movie, but as another reviewer wrote, halfway in you know the movie won't get much better.
