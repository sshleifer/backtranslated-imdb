There are three main problems with the movie. Or rather, there are three reasons why it is not even a contender who is considering more seriously. <br /> <br /> First of all, it will always be true, it's not as good as the books. However, we at least expected some of the Sapkowski's white or depth to reflect. <br /> <br /> Second, we have the production. Fantasy movies are, in my opinion, the most difficult to produce. Everything from props to costumes, scenery, stunts and (especially) CGI is substandard. <br /> <br /> Finally, and it's very subjective, I can't really take the act seriously. I'm not educated in Poland, so I can't really judge - this can lack my familiarity with films in Polish. Similarly, the lines look very amateurish. The casting can also be better. <br /> <br /> In summary, the only possible redeeming feature of this film is the rest of the plot that is transparent: not a diamond ring on a decaying cadaver. <br /> <br /> On a separate note, I heard that the books were in English. I haven't seen them yet, but I can't imagine how to even translate them. I will ask the English-speaking reader to keep this in mind when judging the book.
