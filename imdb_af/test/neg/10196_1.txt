This movie was terrible. It's not something people have to pay to see. Some Christian groups seem to have made people change. I don't understand why it was released to theaters and not to TVs. <br /> <br /> It started out as an old-fashioned B-movie science film from the 50's, but quickly changed. About 30 minutes in the movie, the characters start about "God" and "Do you believe in Jesus?" It moves quickly to pure religion. <br /> <br /> I thought I was going to a Sci-Fi movie. The movie has poor acting; bad camera angles and amateurism. <br /> <br /> AVOID THIS!
