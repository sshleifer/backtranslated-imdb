Christian Propaganda ... Many fear mongering ... <br /> <br /> It's not SciFi, it's ChriFi (Christian fiction). The movie started, but took a sharp Christian turn. From then on, it was all about God, Jc, the Holy Bible and the devil. The UFOs are actually only demonic deception to deceive people into believing that there is other intelligent life in the universe. Satan's idea is to deceive you into thinking that there can be more to life than is in the Bible. <br /> <br /> The kidnapping can be used to explain the rapture. The people who were left behind would believe it was a mass-alien abduction, instead of God taking all the Christians to heaven. No reason to repent than his strangers. The deeper message in the movie is if you do not believe in God and have jc in your life than you believe in nothing and your life has no purpose.
