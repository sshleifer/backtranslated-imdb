Let's see how many ways you can offend my generation: 1. Of course, girl # 1 is a terrible shit cheating on her boyfriend and looks like a heroin addict. <br /> <br /> 2. Of course, girl # 1 sleeps with the man on the first date after being wasted. <br /> <br /> 3. Of course, the lesbians are "Germans" who are in S&M. <br /> <br /> 4. This one was actually a surprise. The end of the movie on a note of torture celebrated by the majority of characters was sick. If a woman is beaten, it's not my idea of ​​comedy. <br /> <br /> 5. Director's Comments - Talking about the incitement of actresses in the movie, just as you know, is tough and incredibly unprofessional.
