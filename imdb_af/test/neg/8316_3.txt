Many good things could have been done with this movie with essentially the same sets, plot devices and storyline. For example, why not introduce a seed of Erica's ability to kill her lover? Why not develop Erica and the police relationship slowly and convincingly? Perhaps Eric's metamorphosis contrasts with another post-event, relationship, etc. Include in her life what she is now rejecting? Why didn't her injury have an innocent bystander to emphasize Erica's wrongdoing. <br /> <br /> Instead, TBO uses revenge fantasy to its maximum level, and gives sincere lip service to the "don't do it at home" messages that are thrown in to qualify the movie as legitimate. <br /> <br /> I'm not a Jodie Foster fan. After showing a series of films such as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, NELL and one where she plays the ordinary mother of a children's gorge, Foster slipped into a series of roles where she plays the same hard-bitter, deadly heroine one day conquered. . It's good once or twice, but I'm getting used to her "fight against flight" close by. TBO could be a younger actress or one more convincingly embracing a woman in her forties (instead of 40 something Foster playing a younger woman). TBO is a movie with substantial actors, finance and resources that succeed in dropping to junk.
