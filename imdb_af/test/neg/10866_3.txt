Larry Bishop is 60 years old, dirty and not pretty. YET in this movie, he is like a drug to women in their twenties. Many movies are claimed to be sexist, but if any movie deserves the title it is this one. <br /> <br /> I can't even count how many boobs there are in this movie, probably more than hours. Larry Bishop spends writing. <br /> <br /> The writing is ridiculous, Bishop and his gang argue, bike, party, sex, kill people and the next day argue them, bike, party, have sex, kill people and the third day, and you get the idea. /> <br /> I love ERIC BALFOUR and consider what he had to do, he did well as Comanche. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie about Larry Bishop's character Pistolero is so one-dimensional Not even funny. <br /> <br /> He is also a horrible actor, and apparently he never intended to guide himself, but everyone he asked did not say what should he do? As soon as he realized he was going to do the lead himself, he probably did a rewriting of the script so he could touch more ladies. Although it looks visually good, at least the Biker scenes and Eric Balfour are not half-bad. This movie is just a big mess. <br /> <br /> I hope to never see Larry Bishop again in front of the camera.
