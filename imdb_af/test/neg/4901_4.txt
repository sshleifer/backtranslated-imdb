Inspired by a true storytelling is full of 1970's feelings, but is incompatible in the story. This is the story of a black college swimmer who ends up in Phillie at a closing rest center in a bad environment and somehow compiles a swimming team. The film stretches blindly for the first half hour until Terrence Howard, as our hero, gets the kids in the pool. It comes out at that point, and gets a bit captivating, but it still stumbles. There is a good story in here and it is clear why Howard and Bernie Mac participated in it, but the writing is poor and most of the way seems to make it feel as if it is something rather than something for us. story. /> <br /> Not the disaster that some reviews made, it suffers instead of all the recent sports-real stories Coach Carter, Invincible, Glory Road, etc., who at least knew you should at least works with the story to make a movie, as opposed to just having the audience suffer because "its real".
