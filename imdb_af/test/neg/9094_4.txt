A cold and boring story of a couple experiencing an Italian castle of 150 rooms while still grieving the loss of their young son. The couple's marriage seems to be on the rocks because of the car accident that took their son's life and their daughter stayed blind. At the castle's inventory for a future sale, a horrible, tortured and awkward creature loses out of the bowels of the 12th century castle. Pretty gory with great horror atmosphere and some sexual overtones. With Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Jessica Dollarhide and Elisabeth Kaza.
