First, I personally worshiped Demone and Demons 2, I saw them, although it was difficult to find good horrors without good official film distributed here in Russia when I was a child and it is an unchangeable part of my boy . Then I got nothing from Mr. Bava not heard. Then I saw his Spirit Son. Well, it's definitely not a good return! Why was the foremost character, whom we never really knew, in an accident in the middle of an empty road? Why do African servants say so stupid and stupid things about human soul? Why is the plot so primitive? Didn't we see enough ghosts for 100 years of film production? Obviously, Lamberto Bava has nothing to show us so far. It's a shame.
