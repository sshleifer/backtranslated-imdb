I watched the version with pathetic American dubs, maybe it made it much worse, but from what I could make out, the movie was pretty bad anyway. It was a low budget. The visual reminds me of a second-class TV movie, a random white dog that has been replaced for Dogmatix, which gives the BBC's 60 costumes. However, I especially feel that the characters in the movie didn't wear anything like the characters in the cartoon and as a result I never felt willing to forgive even the poor appearance of the movie. It will always be difficult to capture the feel of the comics in a movie without using animation, and I did not feel that this effort was finally worth it.
