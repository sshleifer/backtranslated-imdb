This movie is a definite 5. The other night I finally caught on HBO. I remember when it came out in the theaters, a friend told me that it would never be a hit, because Americans didn't want movies about history, especially movies that were more about ideas than action. I don't know if that was why FMLB didn't do well, but now, after finally seeing it, I can add some observations of my own. <br /> <br /> First, while Dwight Schultz is fine in Star Trek and The A-Team, as the lead in this movie, he is playing. I expected him to call Jon Lovitz-like, "I'm ACT-ING!" His phrasing and tone sounds like he tried, a WORKING OR, at a stage where he has to emphasize many different words and phrases. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I enjoy the clever positioning of Paul Newman's character as a manipulator trying to herd these cats (the scientists) each time to reach his goal. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, there was a discussion of the moral implications of creating the A bomb, and whether the US should use it. Probably not enough of this, or so in depth as fair. <br /> <br /> Finally, there was a huge number of twists thrown in for dramatic effect. I don't know how many of the events in this movie are true in life, but things like dropping the test bomb into its chains or having a laboratory accident caused by a ground coffee mug (and a scientist who as a result, the limits of credibility were stretched. Perhaps those things or events that were similar are really happening, but it felt that different scenes were only for dramatic effects, which undermined the whole tone and purpose of the movie. <br /> <br /> FMLB was OK. I need to read more about the real events to know if they are over or just mostly accurate.
