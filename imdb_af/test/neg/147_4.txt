I usually like Laurel and Hardy, but that is one of the movies they made while on their way to becoming a successful comedy team. <br /> <br /> The plot is too simple, based on one joke; how strange kilts and scots are. And that's all. Okay, there are other jokes, but I didn't find them funny at all; they were outdated and not very entertaining when the movie was released for the first time. <br /> <br /> Yet, the movie has two of the most beautiful faces in history, making them the best in history. uncomfortable story (which I expected to be filmed without proper writing) and the view is nice to look at. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it's just worth it for Laurel and Hardy fans, others need to stay away from it.
