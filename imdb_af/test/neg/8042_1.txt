Schieder plays a semi-credible role as president of the United States with politically correct Maria Conchita Alonzo as the female vice president. The movie doesn't stink. With so many plot holes, it's a wonder they have to hold onto the movie it was shot at. Refer to the late night HBO time schedules, this movie is not worth seeing at all. 10 minutes in it, ask yourself why it was written. 40 minutes in there, you wonder why you watch it. Save the effort and look for a repeat of Hee Haw or something. Anything is better than this clunker.
