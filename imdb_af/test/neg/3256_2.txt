When a hardworking entrepreneur from a prestigious country club is rejected, he starts a battle between the members and eventually buys Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) and transforms it into a theme park / golf course where everyone can join. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie at all, but it's sometimes almost amusing. Almost all the comedy is cheap slapstick and bad jokes except Chevy Chase. Chevy Chase plays one of his biggest roles as Ty Webb for a second time and plays it well. Not only is he the funniest character in the movie, he's the only funny character in the movie. Even Dan Akroyd fails to bring humor to this film, which aims to be a great sequel to a classic comedy, but falls to waste with others shown on Comedy Central. The movie would have been better if Ty Webb (Chase) had a bigger role, but instead he was reduced to a minor character and became the star Jackie Mason (who?) They had to bring all the players back and " made a successor. right way! It's a perfect example of what not to do when making a sequel to a good movie. Overall, Caddyshack II is humorous but a big mistake. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie.
