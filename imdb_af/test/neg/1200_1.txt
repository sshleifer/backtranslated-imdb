<br /> <br /> I still can't believe Louis Gossett Jr agreed to appear in this movie. Everything about this move feels artificial, forced and confronted. The air rows are flat. The enemy characters look like dolls. It's just a bad excuse for a movie. At least Top Gun had air lines that look good (the external shots anyway). The queen's songs are cool. Hire Midway earlier.
