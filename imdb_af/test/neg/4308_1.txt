I knew it was going to be terrible, but not so awful !! since it is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen, it doesn't! All the characters are boring, and the story is stupid and incredibly boring! The only reason I rented this piece of crap, because I'm a big fan of Michael Dudikoff, but he's wasted here, and looks very bored and shows no emotion ever! And I wept aloud when the movie was over! It's as if the movie had no plot and it was all about nothing, and Ice-T is godly (although in some things good), plus Dudikoff and Yvette Nipar didn't have chemistry at all. There is one scene that the director is trying to make emotional, but he just fails because Yvette Nipar did not show much emotion, but there is a decent Car Chase scene, but it is not enough for me to record this godly movie. do not recommend!, plus the dialogue is horrible. Avoid this movie like the plague, not a damn thing, please avoid and trust me on this one you can thank me later. The direction is terrible! Fred Olen Ray is doing a horrible job here, working with scruffy camera, legally cheap bits, horrible angles, laughable use of stock image material, and keeping the movie on an incredibly dull fit. The Acting is terrible! Michael Dudikoff is nowhere near his usual incredible self, he looks very bored and shows no emotion she's ever been. His character is also extremely boring. I can't believe he'd marked this piece, he didn't have any chemistry either. with Yvette Nipar (Dudikoff rules still!). Ice-T barely has anything to do and looks bored, and he didn't convince me once. Hannes Jaenicke is not very good here, he had a somewhat wimpy character, I didn't like him. Yvette Nipar is beautiful, but was really awful here, she didn't show much emotion, and had no chemistry with Dudikoff, and as a result I didn't give a damn about her character. Art Hindle, (Owen Marsh), Kathy Harren (Katharine Marsh), and the rest of the cast are also bad. Overall, please avoid like the plague! Fred Olen Ray and Steve Lathshaw should be ashamed of themselves! BOMB out of 5
