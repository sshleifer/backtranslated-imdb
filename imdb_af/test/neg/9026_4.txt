What a silly movie. While it looks nice, it doesn't make much sense. On the one hand, the film suggests that Juana's "madness" was that she was just a woman before her time. On the other hand, she has an obsession that is right from the worst Victorian novel of the wrong woman, and it looks like a kind of spiritual problem, like Miss Havesham in a castle. This movie is what Elizabeth would have been if Elizabeth wasn't able to get Essex's sexual appeal.
