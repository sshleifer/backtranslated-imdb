Mute, meaningless film should appeal to Southern Rednecks, teens with IQ's delayed and average Bush supporters. Noble Willingham plays the leading role in this simplistic script for what it is and uses a generous amount of MFers, eff this and eff that and SOBs. The end I expected to "save" this hollow story was the greatest decay, which made me hang out and wonder, "Why"? <br /> <br /> This is a story of cat and mouse or more like Bully vs victim. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time unless you hear the phone ringing every two minutes and constantly swearing and shouting during these 123-minute dumpster drops.
