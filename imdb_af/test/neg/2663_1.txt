A friend gave me this movie because she liked it. I decided I would finally see it. It was so long ago. I kept waiting for the tension to happen, but it never did. I kept waiting for something to happen to the opening styles, and it never did. I stopped the movie and came back later. I actually forced myself to watch the rest of it and hope it will be better. It got worse. I asked myself, who are these people? Do they have feelings? are they just robots? I'm glad I didn't pay to see or pay to rent it. The end would have been better if the Dutch died on the gunshot wound. At least we would get some emotion from the audience. Or maybe not.
