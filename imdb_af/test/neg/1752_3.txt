Some movies are not for everyone. It accurately describes Igmar Bergaman's film, Shame. At just 18, I still have what I think you can call a small form of ADD, so I'm watching movies that are entertained. Shame was a movie with a very interesting performance, trying to convey the effect of war on ordinary people, but it didn't happen to me. I don't know if it was the subtitles, black and white filming, the length of the movie or the fact that it took two hours of my study for a major chemical test, but I didn't enjoy it. I understand it is considered a great movie and very important in the history of the theater, but I think as my teacher pointed out, everyone did not like or like it. I think I just wish it had completed all its roads. Perhaps the translation has lost something, but I felt there were infinitely small shots that never reached a conclusion. You will meet and never see characters, or really understand why they are included in the movie. My overall recommendation for this movie is that it's worth seeing, but just to form your own opinion on it. Whether you like it or not, it is necessary to respect the point it is trying to convey.
