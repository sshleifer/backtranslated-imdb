This movie is basically a bad act about the old urban legend of the babysitter who gives attacks telling her to watch the kids. She calls the police what the calls are and finds it inside the house. when a killer has such a story, a small child can write it. Not much tension, it becomes clear who the murderer is halfway through the movie. At first, when the first victim is killed, it looks like a bondage fetish scene of a porn site or something. What's up there? The film is oh such a typical storytelling with a plot about as original as a Beatles concert. even through low budget clipper standards, it is a cheese. Don't waste your time with it. Nuff said
