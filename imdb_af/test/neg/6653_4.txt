I really wanted to see this movie - I thought the plot was really unique and intriguing. A policeman (Andy Garcia) has a boy who dies and needs bone marrow replacement to be able to live. The only game is a convicted serial killer escaping from prison. To save his son, he must find the murderer. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton plays the offender in one of the many disappointing aspects of the movie. Keaton is sometimes a good actor, but here he is almost boring. It's on top of the point where you just stop caring. <br /> <br /> Garcia is better but trying too hard for a movie that is not in the right place. Barbet Schroeder (once such a promising director with movies like "Barfly" that has been little or nothing in the US market) regulates well enough - I honestly thought the script was the culprit here ... it's just a big one rubbish. br /> <br /> The movie eventually wastes great stuff, good actors and a good director - all because of a faulty writing. What a tense and thoughtful movie should have been just a Hollywood action dud.
