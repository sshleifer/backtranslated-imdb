Perhaps our Aussies just have a totally different sense of humor and in that my lie is the only problem here. I have a database of all the DVDs I own (including those received as gifts - what it was) and so, when I enter a new one, I always refer to IMDb for information such as genre, runtime, director, leads etc. I noticed that it was a comedy and therefore I decided to watch it at a time when I wanted something light and a good laugh. Well, it wasn't! There was absolutely NO laughter and a modest amount of free profanity (Were there many radio announcers allowed to broadcast the kind of filth Steve Jones devises? What happens if a decent kid tackled at his station?). <Br /> <br /> Rather than enjoying a good laugh (or even a little giggle), I found the whole thing depressed. I gave it 3 out of 10, but to be honest I don't know what the 3 is! I think the basics of lighting and sound were not bad! <br /> <br /> We've lost an apparent stone crusher (Giovanni Ribisi) who apparently can drive a reasonable car (who pays the fuel?) and lives in what a nice apartment can be (who pays his rent? ) Given the opportunity to form what may be a meaningful relationship with what appears to be a pretty girl, he even blew it! Maybe it was she (Lynn Collins) who made this movie the 3 points! The fact that she works as a stripper rather than a hairdresser is one of the few aspects of this movie that makes sense ("I do so much in one night as I do in two weeks' hairdresser"). <br /> <br /> Unless you want to get depressed and get bored, forget about it!
