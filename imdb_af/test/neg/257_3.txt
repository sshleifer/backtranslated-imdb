In 1932, Humphrey Bogart was a relative unknown - an untried actor who played in one of his first films. And because he was unknown, the movie they gave him was clearly a B-movie - a fast-paced movie with relatively low expectations. After I saw it, I could see why it would take more Bogart and another movie studio before becoming a household name. While the movie is not terrible, it is certainly not good - it makes it more of a curiosity than anything else seen today. <br /> <br /> Bogart is a pilot who has dreams of building his own aircraft engine. company. However, when a vacant rich play girl comes his way, his dreams seem to be at stake. As one of the characters in the film said, the combination of the two is oil and water. They just don't mix. <br /> <br /> While Bogart throws his promising career, his sister goes away full speed on the road to Skankville - meeting a messy guy who convinces her to sleep with rich guys so they can shake off their cash ! Bogey has no idea his sister is NOT the actress she claims to be and no longer realizes that the rich woman he loves is leaving him for the same man whose mistress is .... Bogart's SISTER !!! All of this leads to a final which is fairly pleasant. But what follows is one of the stupid scenes I've watched in many years! By now, the rich woman will not marry the man who sleeps with Bogey's sister, but because she is now poor and not good for Bogart, she will fly and kill her. Bogey finds out, chases the plane on foot, jumps on the plane as it drops and crawls on the hull to control the plane and save her! It's so stupid and ridiculous, I laughed myself out loud. Until then, I got it 4 or 5. It sank the movie to a 3. How did the judge give it is an 8 I have passed. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that it was a talk and silly movie. In addition, it is wrong for Bogart, as the action hero at the end and the simmering lover is terrible matches for his persona that was created so wonderfully in the early 40's. Male and solid are better at the man - one of America's great actors, but clearly from his element here. <br /> <br /> By the way, those who like Pre-Code movies and their very mature sensitivities may want to see this one. Virtually everyone in the movie and pre-marital sex and Bogey believe in curses in the film - things you've never seen after the harsh and more moralistic Production Code was accepted in 1934.
