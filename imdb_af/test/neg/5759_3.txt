My partner and I have chosen to see this obvious piece of junk, based purely on its tagline ?? After nearly 30 years of dreary and rudimentary teenage cheats, I can't believe just a few nerdy horror brainiac are the brilliant slogan "They Axed for it"! Other than that, "Miner's Massacre" is just as random, annoying and forgetful as the rest out there. Maybe even more! The script contains all the typical clich√©s and features of all the terribly stereotypical characters you want a terrible and painful death. The gore effects are computer-manipulated and are therefore over and the mandatory "big" stars (Karen Black, John Philip Law and Richard Lynch) are completely wasted despite their top bill. Cursed mines and deserted ghost towns form an ideal horror environment ?? the creators of "My Bloody Valentine" have invented it in the early 80's ?? but its dull film simply has no innovative ideas or even surprising elements to offer. Very greedy twenty-something losers, who refer to themselves as friends, although they cannot stand each other clearly, defile an ancient mine in search of the gold allegedly hidden there. Of course, they make the Zomer Mine illegal in this way and he only has 150 years to prepare for a massive teenage murder. Yay! The cast is particularly annoying in this one. The girls all have impressive shelves, but refuse to show anything. Instead, they all prefer infinite turning and taking unnecessary risks. The dim-witted blocks clearly serve only as screen fillers. In her barely five minutes of play, Karen Black still manages to fool herself by portraying the most prototypical and hysterical local nutmeg ever. The zombie has a stupid and very unconvincing face, but he looks good and quite threatening when he shadows in the far shadow of the moonlight as he swings around his arrow. As the best thing about "Miner's Massacre" is the mentioned tagline, and you can read it on the box in the video store itself, there is very little else to recommend. Director John Carl Buechler made some modest hits in the eighties, such as the original "Troll" and an honest "Friday the 13th" successor, but of course it's time to retire.
