The Toxic Avenger, boringly distorted from superhuman size and strength, is back in this sequel that mostly gets everything wrong. Toxie goes to Japan to find his father on the suggestions of his psychiatrist, who is in an evil corporation who wants an evil corporation. He just wants the avenger to get a stranglehold on Tromaville in his absence. With new actors for Toxie and his girlfriend, who have a different name in this one, a much less rude, much more comical tone and a plot line that can't hold a candle on the original. Even with the totally uncut version that one can only get if you buy the Tox Box DVD set, the gore is the only thing for this one. And if you happen to be on any other version, forget about any enjoyment of this one. While the first one is a low budget classic, it is simply not. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D + <br /> <br /> Eyecup: Erika Schickel has a very fast nip slip; Phoebe Legere going topless; a villianess becomes completely naked; and a few extras in a bathhouse scene show different amounts of skin. <br /> <br /> Tox Box illiterate director's cut DVD Extra's: Intro and comments by director Lloyd Kaufman; Second comment with director Lloyd Kaufman, Troma editors Gabriel Friedman and Brian McNulty; Toxie on Japenese TV; Interview with Fangoria Managing Editor Michael Gingold; Interview by Videohound's Mike Mayo; same damn radiation March, it's on every Troma DVD; Clip by Lisa Gaye; "Toxie 15 years later" mockumentary; 2 PSAs; Troma Intelligence Test; Troma Studio Building Tour; Advertisement for Lloyd Kaufman's Autobiography; Stills gallery; Teatertrailer; and trailers for: "Toxic Avenger", "Toxic Avenger 3", "Def by Temptation", "Class of Nuke" Em High, "Sgt.
