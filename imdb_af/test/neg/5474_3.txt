The devil's men, apparently representing one of the last gaps of the occult's obsession of the 70's, came shortly before Halloween, tore the line book, shot it and kicked it through a glass plate. br /> <br /> To cut a long story short, some enterprising Greek filmmakers have chosen to join together in a new film franchise with the unlikely dual act of female, wise speaking American investigator Milo and stuffy but friendly, sad priest Father. Roche. An abandoned eagle mixed in some satanic jiggery poker days - offering tourists a sacrifice to an immensely depicted depiction of the minotaur and only Milo and Roche can stop him! <br /> <br /> Something like that. <br /> <br /> The reality, however, is extremely boring, frustrating and loaded with wasted opportunities. I strongly suspect that flattering filmmakers blew most of the budget to board Donald Plesance, Peter Cushing and Brian Eno (for the soundtrack) and hoped it would be enough to fight audiences in the English speaking world. <br /> <br /> That's not. The devil's men look pretty with certainty, camera work and fantastic places. Eno's score, although basically just a one-chorus drone he probably came out in an afternoon, is an atmospheric atmosphere and the movie is loaded with the 70's tear, including the Austrailian type of Fawlty Towers and uber hottie Jane Lyle of Island of Death infamy. But the positive ends. Cushing sleepwalks through it, looks like he was trying a maize cup his bum and Pleasance fusses about his best, but never getting proper stuff right. To make matters worse, Milo's character is frightening and unattractive. <br /> <br /> Well, it doesn't look so good. But from there, the film just refuses to go anywhere. There is an indication that the local villagers are owned, but to be fair, they never really do anything but shake their eye on glassy eyes. Maybe they were just tired? Just when you are sure, things will come to some sort of head. Milo and Roche interrupted the Baron's satanic party with ridiculous ease and sent him to meet his maker. The statue of the minotaur falls silent and hey presto! Satan is defeated. <br /> <br /> Yes, right. <br /> <br /> The vague optimism that The Devil's Men may be the first of a series of films is hammered by Father Roche's final line just seconds before. the ridiculously rushed end. <br /> <br /> "Who knows Milo? Maybe one day I can call on you to defeat the Antichrist." <br /> <br /> I'm sure you'll put Donald's call in any day.
