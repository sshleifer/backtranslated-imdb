This movie looked like it was composed very quickly in both plot and graphics. My two daughters were ready to go 30 minutes before the end of the movie, which seldom happens if we go to the theaters. It was a Nickelodeon production and it would have been better if they did so station. The animation itself in some parts was etc. but the plot was terrible. A classic story of a boy trying to fulfill a father's expectations is used in many children's films, but the animation or graphics should really be good to keep a child's attention. This was not the case with this movie. There were also awkward elements between the main male character and the main female character who could have done the plot without.
