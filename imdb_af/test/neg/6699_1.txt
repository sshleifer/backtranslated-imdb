Being a US service member believes me when I say that this movie in no way reflects the emotional state of our Soldiers / Sailors / Airline / Marines from implementation. <br /> <br /> This is said. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great steaming stack of clich√©s. The frightening (with the exception of the girl) is the background of the character weak and laughing and the plot is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad, I made an account with IMDb to just warn someone with half a brain away. <br /> <br /> Canadian writer / director Francesco Lucente really should really be ashamed of this movie. If he does not disagree with the US foreign policy, he must write a letter to the US government, not punish the entire English-speaking world with a monumental crap film.
