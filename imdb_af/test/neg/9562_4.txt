The reality of the mafia environment is absolutely dog ​​food where a gunman will be killed to show any sign of weakness because it becomes a liability. I have no problem with the human side of the goose's portrayal, but Bugsy is too far away from soft, comic men. The film is nice but just light entertainment and not a biopic of a man who, although exciting, was extremely dangerous and frightening. <br /> <br /> The play is all good and the direction very solid. The places and time are very well represented and the themes are very interesting. Did Bugsy Mussoulini really want to kill?
