Okay, I'm sorry for the team and the crew for this review, but this movie is by far the worst I have ever seen. First, the play was right. It could be better (especially in some parts), but it was "okay". Then there was the cheapest video camera (which they used). The violence was pretty good. If it passed faster, it would be great, but they didn't (* suck *) ... scared. The scares were well written (in writing) but not done well. For example ... (SPOILER HERE!) In the loft is a girl halfway in and the other half is in the dark, bottom of the barn, then she gets it. The monster throws her off and then you hear someone's guts to snatch out. The scarecrows could have been better if the music hadn't been torn from a cheap watchdog CD. The blood effects were pretty good, but the blood was like that of "Kill Bill". K. G. pulls it down because it was meant to look like old kung-fu movies, but if the crew can't tell the difference between red and pink, it's sad. The torn bodies in the movie were good, but the scarecrow costumes were something you would see for $ 25 at a Halloween store. Don't let the cover fool you, suck the costumes! My overall grade is a 3/10. If you are interested in independent movies, it is easily satisfied, or just 3 dollars burning a hole in your pocket, going to Blockbuster and seeing the horror of failure.
