What to say about this movie? A married couple has more than one another. After playing for a while, things become more serious. A difficult choice must be made: continue with the old situation or begin to follow everything through the heart. Guess what happens at the end. <br /> <br /> This movie looks very low budget. But a good story doesn't have to be expensive. It looks like a play that has only been converted to a movie using more cheap places (at least very few people visible) more than just the stage in this one. From the first minute, future developments are clear as water. Nothing unexpected happens. Sometimes you think you are watching a soft porn movie, in which case you know there is no story beforehand. <br /> <br /> I find this movie disappointing so it explains the voice (4).
