This love story between a US journalist and a Eurasian lady doctor does not contain much conflict, as she is largely recruited (studying in London), or any fireworks, as she wears. What little interest the story manages to collect is further down by their wooden dialogues. They are supposed to be two cosmopolitan intellectuals, but speak as if the words are put in their mouths by a Hollywood hack that is not much of a self. The movie also suffers from an incredible lack of realism - a completely deserted beach in crowded Hong Kong, overwhelmed by a million Chinese refugees? And a supposedly completed American journalist in his 40s who doesn't know what a hysterectomy is? Hollywood ideas. Finally "the song". Having heard it about twenty times in the movie, starting with the credits, it tends to lose its emotional impact, sorry to say.
