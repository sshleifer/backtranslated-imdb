The most fertile man in Ireland turns to Eamon Manley, who is 24 years old and still a virgin. He lives with his mother in Belfast. He is also a very shy man towards women. Everything changes for Eamon when seduced by a woman (as far as I can remember a neighbor). It's not because he lost his virginity, but he discovers that he has a superpower. Despite protection, this neighbor becomes pregnant. He is told by the doctor that he has very high sperm counts. His mother comes brilliantly with an idea that shows us that the babies come with gems in the end of the movie. He started helping women in both sides of Belfast to conceive babies. First, voluntarily, with the help of his colleague, there is a business out of it. The most fertile man in Ireland has his funny moments, but had to get better jokes and a better script. I couldn't help thinking that it gave me the impression of a TV sitcom rather than a movie. Kris Marshall is another name on the silver screen, but does not shine as a star. It's more like the guy you've seen in such a movie. As if he was actually in love (I think he was very funny in that one). Well, it was okay to look, but couldn't help going from time to time. ** from *****
