I watched hundreds of kung fu movies and I heard a good thing about this movie, so I decided to try it. What I saw was one of the worst exhibitions of movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can't help but feel the director wants every muscle man in Hong Kong in this movie. Everyone persuades to the point of stupidity. Even Conan the Barbarian had some courtesy. This movie only has half-developed men screaming in every scene and stupid women who have no self-respect. The narrator's character has to be killed for so much sucking ... she really didn't deserve to live to the end. The whole movie was a melodramatic mess, with terrible acting, bad directing and bad action. They just have to rename this movie to 'The Dumb One-Armed Caveman with a Blade'. Here's a question ... why do some directors use quick cuts for some action movies? Answer: To hide the shortcomings of the actors. each scene was close and fast cut without any form of flow. The film tried so hard to show intensity, but it was almost laughing. Please keep away from this movie, you have any taste in kung-fu movies ... or any taste in movies.
