I'm sorry, but these enthusiastic reviews on this prestigious site about this movie "Respiro" are very strange to say the least. Is craziness picturesque, I ask and did not find an answer. Of course the movie is beautifully filmed, in part it is almost a documentary. But then it is the fact that for women Grazia indicates every sign of a deep illness and I wonder the whole movie how she has the pain. Her behavior is absolutely worried and the (shocked) citizens of the village are very right to send her to a proper institution to see what can be done about her condition. She needs urgent treatment! Behavior like hair is inferno to everyone around her, her husband, the poor children (especially) and the fellow citizens. Let's not be fake romantic about this! I hated this confronting portrait of a mental illness. WHY, for God's sake, should the man not heal her or at least try to do it? Why the horror of going to Milan (surely a big city, but many possibilities of skilled people to heal her)? Narrowmindedness? Irresponsibility? Anyway, I inspired myself on this site to rent the movie on DVD and after seeing it, I had to put it to others to make their opinion about it. Frankly, I understand why the movie didn't get beyond an INDICATION after the Cannes selection ...
