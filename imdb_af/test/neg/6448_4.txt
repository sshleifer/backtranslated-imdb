Amanda Bynes is a very talented actress, and I really enjoyed all her roles in the past, especially in the fantastic "She's the Man." For that reason alone, "Sydney White" was a great disappointment to me. The real reason for my dislike of this movie is the poor use of characters. In a good fun teenage comedy, it's perfectly good to have a throw of all pretty reality-based teenage characters. In "Sydney White" this idea is thrown out of the window. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes makes a fine Sydney, but she lacked much in what usually makes her shine as an actress. I blame it on the screenplay, which makes her character tiring and held, and on the hair / makeup section that gives her a detestable plastic look and an irritating hairstyle. The seven "dorks" that Sydney finally befriended are far worse. They are so brave that it is impossible to keep them or even respect them. They are essentially repulsive gag feeds. Just like the story of Prince Charming, which is totally unbelievable in character, it's about as cheesy as it can be. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the movie's biggest star-to-be (with the possible exception of Amanda Bynes) is Sara Paxton, who is actually very good at conniving Rachel Witchburn. It's just a pity that the authors no longer made her gray or black. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically that of Snow White. What makes it deadly is that it is too blunt and obvious to think again. The connections with "Snow White" are thrown so much by the film that they are ultimately annoying and overwhelming. Prince Charming is unrealistically charming, the "witch" is too wicky, the seven "dorks" are too brave, and Sydney is just too pure of heart. Now, that's not to say the movie is bad. Although Bynes is forced through the writing, she still has her moments. Just like Sara Paxton, who brings physical comedy to the maximum in her scenes. Sydney's roommate, "Dinky", is also fun as a character. It's a somewhat funny movie on parts that are just too cheesy and clicked to recommend.
