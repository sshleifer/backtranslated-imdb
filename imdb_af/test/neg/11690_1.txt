Remember the terrible war movies your grandmother forced you to watch 25 or so years ago on your old VHS recorder? "The Fallen" is just a badly executed remake of those movies! The story is horrible, the direction is terrible, the editing is terrible, the music is terrible and makes everyone an unbearable nightmare. <br /> <br /> It's also very slow! Very slow! I tried to sleep while I saw it, but I couldn't do it because I had nightmares. <br /> <br /> Please don't see this movie! It's so bad! Ten lines are many, so I don't know what to say yet. <br /> <br /> Press the eject button NOW and you won't regret it!
