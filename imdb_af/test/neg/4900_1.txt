To start, I am not a person who judges movies I have not seen and I am not a person who reviews movies 1 if they do not deserve it. This movie was really so bad. The basic plot was extremely formative, and while it was not good, the plot deserved to be 5. The part that really bothered me was something that refers to swimming in the movie. I made a brief list of things misconducted with the swimming aspects of this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. No character development. 2. No sense of time. 3. Completely inaccurate swimming scenes, which include: a. A team of six swimmer referring to something calls both "Nationals" and "regional" without mentioning how they qualify. b. The same team goes to what hell encounters, without swimming at any time in the movie. c. The competitive program goes back from a high school to a club team to a high school and then a club team again. d. In the scene where Ellis interviews a job, the banners show high school winners and placements at nationals, but the team consists of anywhere from 5 to 12 swimmers, depending on which of the 3 encounters. e. A team of 5 guys and a girl wins subjects / regions. f. This girl wins a man's 100 butterfly event. g. In this race, the girl says two guys from a team the previous year was in the top three in the country. h. The presenter changes a race of the 200 breasts to the 100 breasts back to the 200 again in the team in about 45 seconds. i. In the final relay, the 4X100, swimming in a 50-meter-long swimming pool, sees one swimmer doing two rotational movements. j. In this same relay the teams anchor swims out and steps off the blocks, which speaks an inspiring pep, which lasts about two and a half minutes, or about 3 times as long as the leg meets a national caliber . k. The movie starts in July or August, assuming Ellis has applied before the school year, and the swimming pool had to be closed within 3 months. So, if these things were both valid, the swimmers went to not swim. To win subjects / regions, in less than two, because the pool had to be cleaned and the kids didn't practice for a while. l. I'm sure there are a few hundred more, I'm just trying to get them out of my memory. 4. During the movie there is no single mention of a swimmer's time. 5. If you are a movie about swimming, it's a good idea to rent extra that knows how to swim well. 6. The scene where the child was kicked underwater is physically impossible. <br /> <br /> It was said, all the swimming scenes were too slow, swimmers had terrible technique and the idea of ​​being able to qualify for a national encounter within three months after learning to swim , is just offensive to swimmers everywhere. <br /> <br /> OK, if you don't believe me, let me say that this movie is one of the 5 worst movies I've ever seen, and it comes from the man Gigli, Soul Plane, Manos possession: the hands of the lot, skullduggery and any other total piece of crap placed on film. Please do not go!
