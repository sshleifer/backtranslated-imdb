I had the misfortune to watch the BBC last night, I expect I was the only viewer. From the beginning there was something completely wrong about the movie, after a few minutes of viewing I managed to figure out what it was. THE FILY WAS BAD! Not bad in a good way like Wolfpack or a Seagal movie, but just old, scary bad. <br /> <br /> Why was it made in a movie? I saw a few episodes of the TV series and thought it was good, but I only saw repetitions because they made it. <br /> <br /> I spent most of the movie trying to find out what the story was and by the end I wasn't the wiser. At some point I seem to remember a character, maybe Farina says the Mod Squad can go into places that regular police can't. The 'place' seems to be a 'club', one of the most difficult places to come in, maybe it was student night? At this stage I lost the plot of the plot or maybe there wasn't a plot and the movie was just hacked from various remnants of other TV series remakes. <br /> <br /> Was it an action comedy? I don't remember any laughs. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie lacks the real acting-power of someone like Seymour Hoffman as the bad guy. With him, Ribisi would have had someone to refuse.
