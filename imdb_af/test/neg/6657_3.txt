This plot had more holes in it than an OJ Simpson alibi! <br /> <br /> I noticed two Star Trek references in the movie and yet, <br /> <br /> we played a major character by Andy Garcia <br /> <br /> who is the antithesis of the Vulcan philosophy of "The <br /> <br /> needs of the many, heavier than the needs of the little or one." <br /> <br /> Let's just say while trying to save his son from cancer, he puts most of the rest of San Francisco at incredible risk. Michael Keaton's character is almost like <br /> <br /> unrealistic. He fails to kill on many occasions and yet he is angry when Garcia attempts his / her <br /> <br /> immediately to kill a lot of police. The child's doctor remains in charge of her faculties, even after being held hostage <br /> <br /> last night, but <br /> <br /> puts her on a wide range of 5 stories and she lost it. <br /> <br /> Andy Garcia's child is something of an anemia in this <br /> <br /> movie. He is the most sympathetic and real character, one of the movie's bright spots. He also carries out a line, which must be due to serendipity, with regard to combating cancer that is consistent with Keaton's motivation to escape. All in all, the movie was not a <br /> <br /> waste (see Van Dusk to Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money <br /> <br />) but disappointingly saw the talent at hand.
