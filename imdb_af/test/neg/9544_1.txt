I would not recommend it to anyone except theater-goers who like to laugh at a movie, not with it. <br /> <br /> Completely a promising premise and set actors are getting increasingly worse about a movie ending with Perhaps the worst end ever seen in a movie. I won't spoil it, but basically the most overused set of movie slips gets bad and half-hearted for the most disappointing last five minutes for any movie. <br /> <br /> The movie also includes the most frightening scene ever, attempting to have chemistry on the screen between the two main roles when we offend Angela Jolie's love of Denzel Washington's finger give. It may be the only thing he can move, but why the viewer treats a hem of Washington's finger is surrounded by the kind of muted lights and music suitable for a sex scene is beyond me. I laughed aloud and shook my head. <br /> <br /> The direction of the storyline lends much to Se7en, but here it is very simplistic and far-reaching. To call it an armman would be an understatement. It's actually nothing more than a TV movie, and even Jolie and Washington's best efforts can't convince them it's a cash movie.
