I always try not to be difficult to criticize what I don't like, but after watching this mini-series, I was so disappointed that I couldn't help my irritation. On the one hand, it is true that the series remained true to the novel and of course I found it very nice, but on the other hand, terribly decisive, poor acting, especially of key characters ?? Like Funny Price, the impression of stage play, I mean that the play of acting irritates you from beginning to end. I'm sure with this budget, even if it was low, something could be done much better and worth it. It is up to you to watch this series, but personally I do not advise you to spend your time on this disappointing squirrel.
