What ever happened to performances with united parental figures? The parents in this show are almost as irresponsible as the kids. Instead of punishing the youngest child for manipulative purposes, they got her murdered. They can't ever agree on an action path when it comes to dealing with the children, and instead they do nothing. Yes, good plan. Examine their behavior just because they are "cute". This show tells both manipulative preteness that it sees the "split and conquer" technique as the best way to get their parents to "cave". The oldest children are constantly running amok and getting themselves into all sorts of impossible situations, but there are no consequences for their actions. Yes, good television is right.
