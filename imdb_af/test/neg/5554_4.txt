what a bad movie, took me 3 times to complete it. The thing I didn't have the most was the childlike sense of humor. jokes made by a 10 year old child. not funny. A bit annoying, for example, when the detective doesn't get a place at the bar, he shouts: "She takes everything off" and then they all run "fast forward" slapstick kinda 'rush. so stupid. And also a man sitting at the bar smashes fruit to work out his post traumatic stress disorder. on the bar! and the barman supplies him with more and more fresh fruit. It's supposed to be funny? and i mean ... i love good o 'exploitation gore flicks, and have seen a lot of terrible movies, but its one is simply bad. and also the "gore" is not so exciting. Don't bother. I would not recommend it.
