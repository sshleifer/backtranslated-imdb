Play a lot of fiction as if it were factual. Tonight I watched the Birdman of Alcatraz. Robert Stoud was not a model cute prisoner and he was in jail because he was busy and a client did not pay. After being in jail, he was so uncontrollable that he spent most of his time in separate delivery or in prison hospital. Also a few people in prison murdered. This movie reminds me of the Birdman or Alcatraz, but even worse. Robert Stroud wrote books and contributed to society. And the BOA had some tips from Stroud's lunacy. BUT this man, Henry Young, who is Murder in the First, was supposed to be, was a well-known bank robber who took hostages and defeated them in more than one robbery. He was not a poor guy who stumbled into a grocery store, who just became a post office and took some money. This man was a hard core criminal. He also died a person 3 years before going to Alcatraz. He killed another person in jail, not because of the lonely delivery that ended in a year before the murder. The true story of his life would have been interesting. They didn't even get the money done. You can't be employed at the same time in 3 different prisons. And through all the accounts, the custodian in the movie was a nice uprising than the governor. Plus, if my math is right, the Warden played by Karl Malden in the BOA is supposed to be the same observer in this movie. O Boy. Not only that, in this movie we must think that poor Henry committed suicide. And he wrote the word Victory. Not true. He can live now. He was sent to Springfield where Robert Stroud was also a medical center prison, and when Walla Walla committed another murder and when he was released and jumped in 1972, he was never found. Maybe he's hanging out with the CB Cooper man who jumped that plane out of Washington state after he committed a bank robbery. Now the play was very good. Kevin Bacon is in those class actors, including Jeff Bridges and Dennis Quaid, the largely underrated actor club. Gary Ouman, they can only partake of the ward so he can play it, because he was wonderful. Christian Slater sounds somehow like Jack Nicholson, I don't know if it's a good thing or not. Bacon's wife, Kyra Sedgwick, was in the movie I just think because she is his wife. I love her already, but not in this movie. For some reason I felt this movie when it first came out as a special project for Kevin Bacon. I feel that he can take from a person who is really a victim of the criminal system, there is probably enough of them and a little bit of light on their fate. Others then choose a psychopath to show as a victim.
