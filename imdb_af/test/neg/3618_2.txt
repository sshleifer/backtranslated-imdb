I usually like movies about animals or reptiles that are turning against the average old people who threaten their environment, but I have to say that the Snake Island was a big fall. <br /> <br /> The point of departure is interesting, a group of people, including a writer played by William Katt's tricks, go to an island, called, duh, you dug it "Snake Island" and wonder how the island lives by its name. This is one thing I will give this movie, there are snakes, LOTS and many snakes of all sizes and types. So that part of the movie in fairness lives up to its name, but the writing, acting and direction are SOOOOOOOO lam. It's almost painful to go through. <br /> <br /> The characters are so unattractive. I begged the snakes to finish off these terrible people to put us all out of our misery. There are a few scenes that are so surreal and ridiculous that they are seen to be believed. --- Snakes that lead to really terrible disco music, while 2 women dance together and a scene with a snake that keeps a little dialogue with one of the actors, it is out of absurdity. I think the writer was trying to be funny, but it came just like a strange LSD journey. <br /> <br /> Years ago, I remembered William Katt when he played in Carrie, what was he? .. not that he was ever a big star, but to reduce this rubbish, I feel for him. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like the plague unless you really are in movies that have lots of snakes and really horrible people.
