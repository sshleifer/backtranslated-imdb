Nishabd means wordless. This must be the condition of the screenplay before the shooting of this movie has started and therefore this whole movie screams for content. Wherever you go is an unusual love story between a 60-year-old man and an 18-year-old girl and what you get is very normal, many common events that aren't excited or surprised. So what we were left with was scenic Kerala locations brilliantly shot by cinematographer Amit Roy and camera-friendly histrionics of the new Jiah Khan. It does not cover the lack of a concrete script. Producer director Ram Gopal Varma, who has such a good record of movies, has to pick up his socks. What Mr. Bachchan, I don't want to discuss him in the context of this movie. <br /> <br /> As I reviewed it, I felt the loss of words. I'm speechless, rather wordless! <br /> <br /> Personal opinion: This movie can be compared to an equally bad movie released at any time, called BLACK. I don't see the difference between the histrionics of main characters in both films. What did you say now? It was a world-class bios blah blah, and I have no taste. Well, take a step. No, I don't mean literally, but the real thing to the theaters that show this movie. Because in this case you might find this film an Oscar-level material.
