This movie was nothing more than exploitation gay cheesecake. It was not an "art" film; just an excuse to show you several free, exploding, over-the-top screens with extensive male genital nudity. There was a dressing room scene involving more than a dozen naked men. The camera zooms in on the men's asses and penises as they are portrayed for a few minutes with their full-screen dicks. There are several scenes in this film that show penis to penis. It becomes superfluous REAL fast and makes it impossible to take this movie seriously. I wondered if I accidentally watched a Playgirl video. If these same plays are filmed by women (for example: completely naked and repeatedly their vaginas), it will be dismissed quickly as only softcore and an excuse to show many eyeballs. This is all this movie is. Any artistic merit came down the drain of the gay ghetto mentality. The themes of class examination, homosexuality, longing, etc. Was simple and superficial; No more developed than you would expect from a first-year philosophy student. Just cut and chase a gay porn.
