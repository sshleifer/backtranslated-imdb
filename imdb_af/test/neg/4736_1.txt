I'm not even willing to vote for a single star for this crap, but IMDb doesn't have a zero or grading option ... the worst movie I've ever watched. Movie's story 1. Predators ship crashes on earth 2. One stranger and a few facials are released and they are killing people. 3. One predator comes to earth and he begins to kill aliens and humans. 4. Then a human ray drops a bomb and kills man, aliens and predators. 5. Some people find the shoulder gun of the predator. 6. The End Directors should consider repaying money to viewers. If you still want to watch this movie, download from a torrent website and thank you for saving your money. All the movie is filmed in a dark dark corner of the earth, you only see dark shadows, even in action scenes. too much violence. I didn't expect it from a fox movie
