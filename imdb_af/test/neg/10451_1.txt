I thought I could see something good, but I was tired after seeing this movie. I don't know what I hate most: the writing, the play, the FX or the music. Try to portray the worst Power Rangers episode and will still be kind of. I saw better FX in FPS Games (The touch with the leg sword or his breath that makes people disappear into a green smoke is a touch of genius) and the music is evident from a spaghetti western. I was hoping the women shouted in the car when the "monster" drove around (even if she was looking the wrong way). So give yourself a break and don't look at this thing, at least call someone to watch a horror movie with you, trust me that you will eventually play a monopoly for some kicks.
