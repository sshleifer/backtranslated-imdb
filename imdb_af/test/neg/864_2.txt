This movie was produced by the largest producer in Costa Rica. Although their writers shout about it as a biggest film ever made in Costa Rica and their actors even dare say they did not receive an Oscar nomination because of its political relevance to oil. , it's all a lie. This film is supposedly based on a book written by Carlos Salazar Herrera about a love triangle (super cliché soap opera-like topic) and the secondary story is about an oil problem on the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica with an American oil company that wanted to explore oil deposits in the region, but eventually it was never approved by government. Now it may have a good picture about the beaches, but it is; nothing bigger than that ... it's all in the camera. Most actors are common except for two or three. The rest lacks meaning for what they mean: they dominate most of the time. The story is quite general and cliché, after which a cheap Mexican soap opera is worthy. Because the crew advertised it as a protest film about oil, but 80% of the movie is based on a stupid love triangle. The writing is nothing impressive, it's very simple and the dialogues aren't much thought of. It also has some editing problems on some scene changes ... but besides, it's pretty decent. The director did a good job, I mean, he is not like a Oliver Stone, but he did his job with the resources he was helping. I would ask him why instead of using Costarican actor, he spent most of the money on foreign children. After all, I mean they were a 100% Costarican production. This is what you at least expect. Final the end is not well done, there are errors and details that are not matched or useless. In addition to the most extensive film in all Costarican history, I think it's mediocre. You can make more interesting and better pictures with less cash. Never heard of "Pi"? Anyway, if you are curious about Costa Rican or Central American movies, this one will do, but you will definitely miss nothing.
