The girls can be more beautiful if you have their companion or a $ #! + - face viewer. What I am saying is that it will take special circumstances for a non-white response to this effort. The delivery of many lines seems distractingly unnatural to some actors. Lighting also seems to be a problem, although the lack of eyes struck me regularly. And if you look at this movie, be open-minded enough to accept elements that will not reject a zoo or circus: They are the upper and underground creatures that fed dozens of campers near an empty Louisiana cottage. It's the discovery of a trio sent from their print media to investigate the deaths. Then two of them disappear, and the survivor is part of another trio who takes the hunt. Eureka! I just realized which one of those "special circumstances" would be - unconsciousness.
