I hate to comment on something I haven't completed, but if I save one person I spent nearly an hour before turning it off in horror, it's worth it. <br /> <br /> I decided to look it up with an open mind, knowing it was under 100. <br /> <br /> Bad idea. I usually like raw humor or at least tolerate it. I love so-called "black" comedies. I'm also not easily offended. <br /> <br /> It started well and went downhill quickly. I laughed a few times (for example, when the main character was holding the airplane toilet), but it was and didn't compensate for the strong dislike I felt. <br /> <br /> I didn't laugh when the dog was sucked into a jet plane. I don't usually see the humor in animals that die (except in Animal House). I also didn't laugh much more about the nastiness. I switched it off after an incident with a blind man and a baked potato that I didn't care to repeat the details, just that the wave of nausea hasn't yet passed me. <br /> <br /> Simply put, it was dirty and simply not funny with hardly any plot. It's one of those times when you don't have something nice to say, you have to get the word out. <br /> <br /> Don't say I didn't warn you.
