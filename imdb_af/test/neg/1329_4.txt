With all its technical flash, the 1993 Stalingrad movie is very disappointing. Before I watched it, I read non-fiction accounts of the Stalingrad campaign and saw many documentary footage and photos of the actual battle and its participants. I don't think any movie can really succeed in portraying the titanic struggle and suffering that actually took place, but I still wanted to see how a relatively recent German film production would be. Although there are some good elements of this movie, it's a failure. To me, the worst thing is that it includes considerable anachronisms, and also some very confronted and cleaved elements, most sharp in some encounters between a German official and a Soviet woman. <br /> <br /> There are also ideological elements in the film that result in many distorted perceptions, including a caricature of a German chaplain, some overlaid class war messages and problematic portrayals of "good" counter "bad" Germans. Certainly, the German armed forces of World War II included men who could maintain some decency in the war and others who did very bad things, but the efforts in the film to show this contrast are very simplistic and childish. I give "Stalingrad" credit in the sense that it does not completely portray German troops in the simple demonic quality, it is the stereotype that many people now have, but the film includes stereotypes of its own as being almost too good. a true baboon who holds more in the 1990s than the 1940s, and two completely evil infantry and a back-echelon officer. <br /> <br /> Some recent movies like "Stalingrad" and "Saving Private Ryan" are regularly commended for their "authenticity" in portraying graphic scenes of battles, but these same films are deeply flawed and distorted in their images of the attitudes, values ​​and behavior of 1940's soldiers and civilians. "Stalingrad" and "S.P.R" lacked large and minor characters who lacked the subconscious stoicism of ordinary people during World War II. Surely soldiers in history are already notorious for their regular and occasional cynicism, but the self-absorbed, talky and touchy-feely characters in both movies are different and much more common in our world today than what they were the 1940s. While many people today deny war videos from the 40's and 50's that offer more patriotic messages and aren't so graphic about battles, many of the previous films like "Battleground" are far more accurate in their portrayals of typical soldiers' "attitudes, and they is often successful in showing the terrible effects of the war in more indirect ways. <br /> <br /> One well done part of Stalingrad is a struggle between German infantry and Soviet tanks, which is a reasonable job To capture the horror and confusion in such a fight. <br /> <br /> "Stalingrad" does a bad job even if it is the general appearance of the leading soldier. of the difficulty of finding thin, haggard-looking extras in our pampered and well-fed America and Western Europe today, too many of the German troops in the movie do not wear their uniforms and equipment properly, and do not show the professional carriers commonly found in German Wehrmach t occur even during the years of German defeat. If you want to get a good idea of ​​how the real German troops watched, I recommend the following documentary containing the Stalingrad campaign: "The World in War", "War of the Century" and "Russia's War." Also the books "Operation Barbarossa in Photographs" by Paul Carell, "Stalingrad" by Geoffrey Jukes and "Stalingrad" by Paul Carell contain a large number of useful photos. Books written about the struggle by Antony Beevor and William Craig are also recommended, and the latter are particularly good at common soldiers and civilians on both sides. <br /> <br /> Relatively recent movies that I think are much better than "Stalingrad" and "Private Private Ryan", depicting the attitudes and characters of people during World War II, and the general feel, look, horror and the war is "Der Untergang" ("The Downfall") and "Talvisota" ("The Winter War"). While "a bridge is far too far" and "the longest day" covers events on the western front rather than the east, it is also excellent war movies, and is very close to factual accounts. The latter two movies are missing from the grit that is more prevalent in more recent films, but they compensate for the lack of their other strengths, including truth.
