Hmmmmmmm - cheerleader massacre. Let me think - high school girls are cut, except that the cute one survives. Have this. Next movie. <br /> <br /> I was actually surprised this one was made in 2003. I really thought they stopped making these movies in the 80's. It was truly your run of the Mill Mill Slasher movie with teen-eye candy, stupid male horn dogs, even thicker male adult and hot teacher. It remains on the list of dark and stormy night and deserted cabin in the woods. We've seen it before. <br /> <br /> But this one has some interesting plot twists that place it above normal my-to-slashers, so if you have a few brain cells to braai for 2 hours, kill - you can do worse.
