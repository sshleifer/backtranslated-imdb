Warner Brothers' social responsibility at his most hammered hand, with every five minutes sermon on how we Americans are, we do not run out of trouble, we face our responsibilities. It also indicates that if you are willing to protect yourself to protect your family from clear deadly gangsters, you are non-American. Walter Huston, who is bored, is the frustrated DA, and the "average American family" includes such familiar faces as Sally Blane (much like her sister Loretta Young) and Dickie Moore as an alleged courage. Both are regularly beaten by Chic Sale, just 47, but play an octogenic civil war veteran, jumping and "amusing" closer to Prohibition Hooch and moralizing on how Americans are, nabbit day. His St Vitus Dance cute display is tiring schtick; It is as if Walter Brennan based his entire career on it. William Wellman is efficient and quick, much like his previous "public enemy", but he and the scriptwriter neglected to show what happens to this family after the happy suspect - ie they will probably be recruited by the Mob.
