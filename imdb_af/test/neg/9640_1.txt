I find it very ironic that Hollywood wing still secures its commitment, making these terribly lukewarm films that do not condemn or embrace the war on terror. <br /> <br /> If you're a Sixties survivor and a dedicated pacifist, and you're hoping for a convicted conviction like a birth on the fourth of July or the entire west on the western front, this movie will really feel like a rip. None of these soldiers claim this war, or any war, or the idea of ​​war. They only understand how to do another tour. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you are a patriotic American who wants to see a tale of courage and honor, this movie will really be a finishing touch. . Neither of these soldiers loves America or even loves the service. The way they make pout and such, makes them more like suburban teens than blue collars difficult guys. It's not we were soldiers, and it's not Iwo Jima's sand. It's not even ceaseless action, and war styles are less RAMBO and more BUFFY. <br /> <br /> Ryan Philippe can't quite carry this kind of movie. Although he is devastatingly sexy, in a rough trade, men's room, bisexual type, it's hard to portray him as a slow-talking Texas boy who wants to get up and count. It's not Sgt. Croft in Mailer's THE NAKED AND THE DEAD. He is more like Joel in Truman Capote's OTHER VOICES, OTHER ROOMS. He can't sell you on the idea that he's in the fight and she's done a bit, or wants his wife and wants her now. He fizzles on the battlefield and in the bedroom screens, and looks as if he prefers to bend and take a good stiff attack from behind.
