The Time Machine started in 1899 in New York where Professor Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) introduced his beloved friend Emma (Sienna Guillory). Unfortunately, they only accept after being attacked by a mosquito. Emma was shot dead and died in Alexander's arms. Jump forward 'Four years later' and Alexander built a time machine that he used to go back to the night. Emma was killed to save her, but she was still killed, just another way this time. Alexander realizes everything he does, but he often goes back Emma will always kill somehow and he wants to know the answer why he is traveling so far to discover the truth. But after destroying the moon, two new races developed on earth, such as Eloi and the monstrous Morlock's who eat Eloi. Alexander decides to hold on and save the Eloi. <br /> <br /> Directed by Simon Wells, who is actually the great grandson of author HG Wells, who wrote the original The Time Machine book on which the original The Time Machine (1960) film is based and that's actually the 1960 movie John Logan's screenplay is based on here rather than Wells's original literal source. While all three share the same basic story and ideas, this remake adds the subplot to Alexander's fiancé Emma who is being killed, so he finds a time machine rather than just being smart and capable. The script is a mix of sci-fi, action adventure and drama. None of that really grabbed me or made me so busy. There are some nice special effects, some nice action scenes and the moment Alexander's question is answered. he can't save Emma is actually quite intelligent and makes it really never really conquered me and I was never really moved by it. The Time Travel aspects of The Time Machine feel very much like Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1992) in the sense that you cannot change the past, but at the same time the future is not fixed. The Time Machine is not near Good a movie as Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The character is good, although I thought Guy Pearce just looked too young to be a good scientist who could figure out a time machine and there is never a real explanation behind it's mechanics, because it's like one moment there is no time machine the next thing he invented and made no one and it works perfectly. I reckon the Back to the Future Trilogy offer offers much more excitement, laughter, excitement and general entertainment value than the Time Machine ever does. Although I will stop calling it a bad movie, as it moves at a decent pace, a fair story says and it is moments that I wouldn't call it brilliant or even very good. There is also a terrible reference to the book and original film, both of which were subsequently checked. <br /> <br /> The benefit of this modern version of the original is the development of special effects and especially CGI that leads to fast-moving scenes by Alexander in his time machine, with large buildings being built , new ridges, canyons and mountains are formed and an extensive pan back that eventually comes into space as we see passenger rockets orbiting the moon. The effect work is good, there are one or two moments that look slightly lower, but the effects are generally good. I saw The Time Machine on the telly and the station played it badly and stretched, so the left and right edges of the frame were cut off the screen and therefore switched off part of the year on Alexander's time machine so I didn't really know didn't have what year he went to Apparently director Gore Verbinski had taken over the last eighteen days of filming. Wells had a severe exhaustion, while the IMDb said the time machine itself was the biggest and most expensive push ever made for a movie. I find it hard to believe & Guy Pearce broke a rib under a battle scene, but behaved like a trooper. <br /> <br /> With a so-called budget of about $ 80 million, production values ​​are high with a lovingly restored era. New York and good effects work although amazing The Time Machine was nominated for the Best Makeup Oscar, but disappeared for Frida (2002). The play is mixed, Jermey Irons gives a good performance in a terrible makeup work that looks like a rejection of a Lord of the Rings movie while singer Samantha Mumba makes her big-screen debut here and is just awful although Guy Pearce is fairly good and reasonably similar. <br /> <br /> The Time Machine is not a particularly bad movie or a particularly good one, just a somewhat imperceptible one that is viewable and is about half an hour, but not much different. Look again at the future (1985).
