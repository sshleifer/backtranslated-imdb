I was looking forward to joining my Independence Weekend to a good movie about Jefferson. This movie wasn't. It was rather long, exhausted, dull and unbalanced. Too much time has been spent exploring Jefferson's relationship with Cosway and not spending enough time on his relationship with Sally Hemmings. The lady that Sally, Thandie Newton played, was absolutely terrible. Her acting was so bad, it was like an A1 airplane trying to recite Shakespeare. Her constant moaning grumbled the nerves! Nolte's emphasis makes Jefferson sound like an ignorant man, rather than a genius. Jefferson's relationship with his daughters and their feelings about slavery was also underdeveloped, but his eldest daughter's uprising (Patsy) is a major event in the film. The film was too long and the writing had no energy and excitement. On the positive side, the costumes were pretty, and Greta Scacchi played the part of Cosway well. If you want to watch a movie about the revolutionary era and / or Jefferson, then look at 1776, it's much better than Jefferson in Paris.
