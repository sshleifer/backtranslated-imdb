Mixed group of "experts" (explorers, divers and scientists) dare a mile underground and go underwater for another 2.5 kilometers to a more remote place, where they are salamanders, giant albino moles (?). And a few big, razor-captive, winged, computer-generated creatures that turn around. The cave is closed by a rocky strip and then the monsters attack and start killing everyone as they search for an exit. And that's all she wrote with this low-end that doesn't even combine action, science fiction and horror at the most elementary levels. Imagine someone giving the people on the Sci-Fi channel $ 30 million to make a monster movie. This is exactly what the BIG is; almost staggering in his reluctance, full of clichés and almost entirely dependent on the special effects to entertain. The only difference is that they have more money to build sets, more money to clean the monsters and more money to hire so-called professional actors, which in any case gives terrible performances. Otherwise it is as usual. Some of these movies are still fun to watch. This one is not and there are many reasons why: <br /> <br /> 1.) It takes itself too seriously and has no sense of humor. That way, you get a completely unpredictable and predictable movie that doesn't even recognize how original and predictable it is. <br /> <br /> 2.) The opening sequence serves no purpose other than to kill a few minutes and add to the discharge. <br /> <br /> 3.) Unoriginal looking CGI creatures impress no one in this day and age. <br /> <br /> 4. Using Shakycam and quick cut editing for your horror scenes is simply lazy, unbeatable movie-making. And why does the action darken further by making things too dark and adding annoying distractions such as fire and bubble explosion? This not only makes these scenes difficult to see but also impossible to enjoy even at a no-brainer level. <br /> <br /> 5.) Although it wants you to take it seriously, the writing is full of clichés, the dialogue is awful and there is no attempt to characterize it. Pouring 25-year-old model types into roles as brilliant scientists and gruff veteran explorers can offer a bit of eyebrows, but it completely kills the credibility of a movie that is otherwise straightforward. Sorry, you can't have both of them. <br /> <br /> 6.) There were two exceptions to the model rule, as they decided to throw an old guy and an average Joe. These were the first two characters killed. <br /> <br /> 7.) For a bit of diversity they also cut into a black man and a Chinese man. Oddly enough, not much of a voice is given in this movie and it is basically in the background as whitey discusses what their next move will be. Offensive. <br /> <br /> 8.) Also, how many movies should be made where a black character ultimately sacrifices his life to ensure that Hot White Female Lead and Hot White Male Lead end in the end? Ugh. Give me a break. <br /> <br /> 9.) Many of the plays were UNDERSTANDED. Cole Hauser's performance was completely laughing. The other male lead looked as if he had just walked away from the Set of Soap Opera and used the patented muted-smile-make-all-ladies swing technique, which made the PG-13 gender changer equal to my size. -brush-making-all-the-guys-sweating technique often used by ladies in R-rated movies. Anyway, his performance was completely phoned. Daniel Dae Kim (of the TV series "Lost") and Piper Perabo also hit the room with their dotted and monotonous line-up. <br /> <br /> 10. Was the end of a joke? Totally terrible. Please, God, we don't need a sequel to this garbage. <br /> <br /> So basically I won't save this one unless you've never seen a monster movie or you're just really desperate And the only other thing is "The Simple Life." The sets were good, the blue-colored photography is good and some of the actors (Lena Headey, Marcel Iures ...) tried their best. Therefore, I decided to increase the rating to a "2".
