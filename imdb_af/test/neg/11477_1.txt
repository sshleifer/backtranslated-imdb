It's absolutely the worst comedy I've ever seen. It's hard to explain, because (unless you've seen it), I'm sure you've never seen a comedy that wasn't good or bad; It's just there (It's the original part, not good or bad, right there)! <br /> <br /> Let me say that I have seen every comedian appearing in a lead role and as they all look. It makes it such a mystery. The supporting leads actually work (although the dialogue is bad). The only character that is pretty good is the one John Goodman played. He does a very good job with what little dialogue he has, and actually has one funny line (I won't spoil the only funny line in the movie if you decide to look anyway. It involves a pancake. ) The great mysteries are most important. I won't call them characters because no characters have been developed. This script is so youthful that they don't even give the leader's fictitious names. They all use their own. They don't even seem to act. It is as if they all read aloud for scripts sent to them by the local junior. I actually wrote such a newspaper to my English class when I was thirteen. It wasn't funny either. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, don't bother renting it. It's not funny. It doesn't even have the kind of bad dialogue you can complain about. I just sat there staring at the whole thing. It was so boring, I couldn't even get upset about how bad it was. I can't imagine how it even gets a score of 4.
