* Some spoilers * <br /> <br /> This movie is sometimes titled "Live Eternal." It is often taken as a reference to the final scene, but more accurately describes how dead and buried this one-off series is after this sloppy and illogical dispatch. <br /> <br /> There are "hey kids, let's sit down at a show air" about this telemovie, which can be mocking. Some fans will feel like insiders as they enjoy finding out all the different cameo appearances. Co-writer, co-producer Tom Fontana and his pals tackle the go-up with friends and favorites from other shows, as well as real Baltimore characters. <br /> <br /> It's on top of virtually all of the <br /> <br /> There has always been a cricket quarter, quality-conscious executive, Barry Levinson, Fontana, James Yoshimura and The rest of the Creative team against budget-conscious NBC executives, who simply wanted another moronic police procedure like Nash Bridges, who regularly beat "Homicide" in the ratings. The pressure said the show jumped between the sounding realism that had crossed its form, and sleepy sensation that dampened it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for this movie, Fontana, co-authors Yoshimura and Eric Overmeyer and director Jean de Segonzac throw in the towel. They took the most ridiculous story out of the series, filled it with an unlikely and artistically barren new plot line, and laid the burden of carrying the whole mess on one of the weaker members. <br /> <br /> In short, some time has elapsed since the last episode of the show. The former heart of Baltimore's murder department, Yaphet Kotto as Lt. Al Giardello, is now a Kurt Schmoke-like candidate for mayor, and Schmoke himself makes a cameo appearance. But this promising start right away and is unlikely to take a tragic turn. <br /> <br /> The spotlight moves to Giancarlo Esposito as Giardello's son Mike. A fine man who did good work elsewhere was Esposito one of the beautiful faces that was brought in to relieve the TV series. But the question for viewers was always: is Mike uncomfortable as Gee's son, or is Esposito so uncomfortable? <br /> <br /> To be honest, Esposito doesn't get the chance to play the main story. without interruption. This is because the authors are choosing to revive another storyline that speaks to the intelligence of the show's loyal voters. <br /> <br /> An apparent snuff stream video has been promoted, and it looks like it's actually on the internet. After some red herring, the detectives arrested an apostate suspect. But Zaljko Ivanek's ravaged and overworked deputy lawyer forgot to lay in time, and the suspect was released only to be murdered later. <br /> <br /> Let's sum up: he forgot to lay the paperwork, because it wasn't the most sensational case of his career, because the mayor, the attorney general, the governor, all of Maryland- Legislature, US Attorney General, NBC, Court TV, BBC, AP, Reuters, People, The Sun, Washington Post, The New York Times, the LA Times, Time Magazine, The Times of London, The Economist, Johannesburg post and guardian, L'Osservatore Romano, Le Figaro, Paris Match, L'Equipe and Computer World do not call every 10 minutes. to ask about the status of the case. <br /> <br /> But the old gang detectives and associates are back to Baltimore to help. There are quite a few talents on each other. Unfortunately, with the limited amount of dialogue to share, some of them are just on the screen. <br /> <br /> Two of the strongest actors, Clark Johnson and Melissa Leo, are criminally underutilized while wasting time on Jon Seda and Michael Michelle can be better spent on advertising. The authors seem to be satirizing, with Jason Priestley as the newest major detective. On the other hand, they provide easy access, Michelle Forbes, a very influential scene. <br /> <br /> There is another grind, with real Lt. Gary D'Addario, the centerpiece of the show, has yet another detective. Guests come from other shows, such as Whitney Allen who does her dead, and clueless "Miss Sally" of the children's show loved by the prisoners at Fontana's "Oz." Dina Napoli of WBAL TV appears as herself. <br /> <br /> Even when entertained, these guests can be distracting. Ed Begley Jr. actually promotes the story in its short appearance, and plays dr. Victor Ehrlich of Fontana's "St. Elders." He is still a lively character and fits into a hospital setting. Then remember, did St Elegius not become an autistic boy's fantasy? <br /> <br /> The most useful cameo reflects corporate synergy. This movie was made when Court TV bought re-run rights to the series. This network contributed to the legal representative, Helen Lucaitis, who questioned the murder team and later on "Oz." Appeared. The TV correspondent does an efficient work that summarizes the news, it's plots for late arrivals. <br /> <br /> Although she is so thin that she disappears when she turns sideways, Lucaitis also treats a little physical comedy with Esposito. He shows more juice in his scenes with Lucaitis than any of his regular colleagues. Perhaps the two had to do a devolution. <br /> <br /> As the movie winds, the cream goes down from the roll. Although they are put in a ransom writing, Andr√© Braugher and Kyle Secor overcome it. Their performances are reminiscent of viewers who have made him a major abuse, for considerable stretching, the best air performance and one of the best television productions ever. <br /> <br /> It is nice to look at top objects that are doing well; It's just a shame that this movie no longer gives them a chance. Dead fans may see this movie, but you can live without it.
