I must say I'm not a massive fan of Troma movies. Admittedly, I saw only three of them (or four including this one), but two (Blood-purifying Freaks and Mother's Day) are widely regarded as the best that makes me believe that everyone else is not worth it. see. This will certainly be the case with Graduation Day, which is a Troma on the over-popular eighties. While the movie is never very bad (given the type of movie), it is never very good either; And by the end, I could just consider, "Why did I look it hard?" Anyway, the plot sees a girl die on a racetrack, and shortly thereafter; more people are starting to die. Of course there are some possible suspects; But it is hard to really care about anything that happens. Of course, a slasher term; That's the most important thing, and given Troma's record of red things, I expected buckets. There are some decent screens, and some of them are stingy; but it is never very shocking, which actually only makes another brave treasure based on a festive event on the American calendar. It is noteworthy that there is a small role in this movie for sleaze queen Linnea Quigley, but the rest of the cast is not worth mentioning. The direction, plot and execution thereof are all very common; and I will say if you are not a big Troma fan or someone who wants to find everyone who ever made it. Don't struggle with this movie.
