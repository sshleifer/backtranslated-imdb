It was only when I saw Sidney Pollack in the picture I had ever committed to this movie. This is his worst possible movie. Absolute drink. The dialogue is wood and incredible, the plot is incredible. <br /> <br /> Kristen Scott Thomas is wasted in this movie. There is nothing about her character that makes you even believe in this story. <br /> <br /> Harrison Ford is like Valium. There is no life in his eyes. <br /> <br /> I blame Sidney Pollack for the failure of this movie. The writing is terrible, and he is too clever not to see it. So it smells of some kind of money, whether it's a studio obligation or something else, but it's just BLOODY ROTT!
