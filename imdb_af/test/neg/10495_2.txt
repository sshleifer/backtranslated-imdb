I give this movie Vampire Assassins a "2" rating mainly because it has no sex or nudity. Other than that, I'm not sure why it's ever been made. It was more like an exercise in how to make a movie with a very limited budget. The characters Derek and Slovak were the best actors. They were followed by the "biker dude" with the Pleather pants and silver belt. He was also OK. Most of the movies were filmed in a sort of distribution warehouse. If you are tired of watching the kung-fu boxing sticks, check out the Scott tissue, Windex and other cleaning products packages. You will have plenty of time to do that, trust me. I almost started making a list. The dialogue and kung-fu stunts were extremely slow. They talked slowly, fought slowly, etc. I do not know why. At least with the extra slow delivery of the actors, you could hear everything very clearly. I'm trying hard to find good things about this movie. We watched it to the end to see if it was better, but it didn't. We could never decide whether the actors really knew or just acted like they knew. You can see yourself and decide. My favorite line was something like (vampire talking :) "what are you watching?" other man responds: "your bad dental work."
