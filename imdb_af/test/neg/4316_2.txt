About the spoiler warning? It's not "may contain", it contains spoilers. Readers beware. <br /> <br /> Well, first, I need to know I'm not basing the actors. They only work with what they are given. The problem was the writing. It was terrible. There was nothing credible about it. Certainly, if you have a movie based on a murderous hitchhiker, it will be the bad mistake here and put you in the horrible, frightening, movie-worthy situation. But these girls just made a stupid decision after it was stupid. The only girl smart enough to ever call the police was the girl who was added at the end because he had killed one and hit the other with a car. Talk about hitting her with a car ... why did she try to run a truck rather than running to a normal person? Also, did the one who wrote the script honestly believe in God that the police were not investigating a door in blood? Honestly, it wasn't stress either. The only tension I felt was the frustration of how retarded the girls were. Well, this rant has gone much longer than I meant for such a bad movie, so I won't bother ending up, except it is unrealistic and lame.
