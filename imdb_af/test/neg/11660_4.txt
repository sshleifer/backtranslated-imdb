Like most musicals of the era, one has to check reality at the door. Broadway MELODY of 1938 is not remotely credible or plausible, but in its strange way fun. This movie is really just an excuse to perform the talents of the stars. Some screens just happen to be in a review, not a plot-driven movie. <br /> <br /> Judy Garland shines and it's unfortunate that she has so little to do unless many are left on the cutter floor. <br /> <br /> One of the most unpleasant events is the way Eleanor Powell plays a leading role in a Broadway show and Robert Taylor says it will work, work, work from dawn to dusk. Several scenes go through and there is no work, no rehearsals. Nothing. She needs money to win a horse in an auction. She has no money. Isn't she paid while rehearsing? Taylor needs to borrow money to help. He's supposed to be a big time producer. He has no money ??? Anyway, these are just two elements in this strange story. <br /> <br /> The music numbers are pretty great, saving it from a total loss. Broadway Melody of 1940 is much better, like Broadway Melody of 1936.
