I just don't know how this dumb, crap, junk, garbage and good for nothing movie is a hobby. It was so boring with a very, very poor (or no) story line and was not even a bill. The movie was about 135 minutes from just a paragraph of the story about Prem (Salman Khan) is a love guru and helps careless and romantic Bhaskar (Govinda) to get the girl he wants. I'm not saying I didn't have the movie because it wasn't funny or anything, I would accept a movie that is not funny but has a decent story. The only two reasons I can say it is a super hit are: <br /> <br /> 1. Salman Khan & Govinda are together, but for the first time in Salaam and Ishq was a flop, so it can't be. But it was a very good movie. <br /> <br /> 2. Salman Khan's name is Prem and all the movies with that name are a hit, including Maine Pyar Kiya. So it's just luck. <br /> <br /> I've heard it's a remake of Hitch, I didn't see it and I'm glad I didn't. Music is OK, the only good songs are Want to be a partner, You are my love and Soni De Nakhre, but what is that in a very bad movie, even if you have someone like Katrina Kaif who has two dance left feet ? She's completely crap. Neither she knows acting language (her voice is always called her), dance and always fails to impress. I don't like her one thing, she was even disappointing in Koffee with Karan. Overall Partner is a disposable movie with a disposable actress Katrina Kaif. It's better off being kicked out of Bollywood and never coming back.
