You know, I'm sure the boys were sitting at the office one day, saying, "HOW CAN WE MAKE MORE MONEY?" They made every possible variation of toys they could make with their current characters. So they decide, let's steal the star war idea, A PREQUEL, and we can make all the new characters and sell them as toys. Incidentally, something they did in puppet master 3, but who cares? In any case, they choose a while before the first movie when Toulon is still alive, he and the dolls sit around and a wooden head rolls on the floor and the dolls want to know if it's a dead relative or something doesn't matter. So begins the story of the puppet master descent. It's long, it's boring, no body cares. <br /> <br /> The funniest part is, they tell the origin of these new characters in the movie, but don't give clues to their fate. SO GUESS WHAT, once the revenue from the new toys is paid, they can fund a new (and 4 straight rotten) successor, called "PUPPET MASTER 8 THE SEQUEL TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE DEATH OF THE DEATH RETRO PETS!" hold your breath!
