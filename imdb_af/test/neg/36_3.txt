This movie, which I rented under the title "Black Voodoo", should be avoided. I expected a blaxploitation / horror flick; but what I got was a very dull, standard "ghost extract". In this case, the ghost was that of a religious cult leader who tried to refuse treatment, but whose plea was ignored and he died in an operation. The result: his spirit appoints nurse Sherry and forces her to commit acts. The only voodoo connection was one of the three black characters, in this case a blind former soccer player, whose mother practiced voodoo. The film is very slow and very boring. There is a very standard end to be provided for excitement, followed by a terrible stupid end (warning: SPOILER) <br /> <br /> In which woman she actually controls herself at murder cost by saying she is in possession. This movie is slow, and bad in a non-funny, just unrelenting way. Avoid it at all costs.
