iCarly is about a teenager named Carly Shay (Miranda Cosgrove) who lives with her artist brother, Spencer, in a loft in Seattle. Carly has a website that gets millions of views and makes a lot of money every year, so much money she's not even a real number. Her best friend is Sam (Janette McCrudy) who is as predictable as they come! She says "normal" things and knocks Carly's neighbor, Freddie, in charge of all the technical stuff for their web application. Carly shouts every word and looks like she doesn't have emotion. Sam chases Freddie and Freddie screams. In one episode, Carly and her friends shoot Lewbert (the gatekeeper) in the elevator and he survives. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it at all unless you like teenagers screaming, hurting people and having fun.
