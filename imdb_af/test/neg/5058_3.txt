It's not a horrible movie, just unsatisfactory. The plot is deeply flawed and indescribable. It tries to be a number of genres and fails at each one. It fails as a comedy, as a thriller and as a horror movie. It's almost like science fiction. The direction is uninspired and Katie Holmes, a cute yellow-faced she is, must model against clothes, not acting. The only thing this movie likes to be a 1 out of 10 is Helen Mirren. Her performance is incredibly scandalous and is (almost) worth experiencing suffering through the rest. Her ability to transform from imperative to faux, sympathetic to destroying and controlling her prey, shows mastery. Unlike Marissa Coughlin's beautiful Exorcist version, Mirren is the only reason to watch this movie. A fixed 3.0.
