They set you up and carry you to death with a constant cat and mouse hunt. The main characters are involved in a constant stance where they threaten each other, every five minutes or less. And I would like to see the police force that one of their police can let go. It's like a local police that runs Charlie Manson out of jail to fetch a cup of coffee. Get Really!
