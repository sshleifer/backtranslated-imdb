The short existence of The Sex Pistols and making this film after the controversial, pioneering English punk band's breakup, both happened before I was born. However, in 2003, when I was a teenager, I started listening to their only album, "Never Mind the B * &% @ # & s, Here's the Sex Pistols," and quickly became a big fan. I didn't see the "Great Rock" a Roll Swindle until 2006, but saw it a few times. It was pretty good (definitely not good, but pretty good), even though I could just remember it a bit, and didn't see it all connected. To see it a third time, almost three years after the second, I didn't deal much with it. I'm not even sure what I found so good in the first place (can't remember). <br /> <br /> This movie is a mockumentary, in which the Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren tells her about the story of the band and its members; guitarist Steve Jones, credited here as "The Crook"; drummer Paul Cook, credited as "The Tea-Maker"; bassist Sid Vicious, credited as "The Gimmick"; and John Lydon (ie Johnny Rotten) credited as "The Collaborator." McLaren claims he created the band (and even the genre of punk rock) as a scam to make money. He tells much of the story to Helen Wellington-Lloyd (including Helen or Troy), in different places where they go together. It's basically a boost of McLaren talks, Pistols songs, live footage of the band, fictional scenes (often stupid, funny), various cartoon sequences, etc. All in one movie, the Pistols driver's side tell the story. in a bizarre way! <br /> <br /> It is well proven that McLaren is a liar, I know many have already pointed out, including band members themselves. He was not the driving force of the group, he did not create them (nor did he find out punk rock, and The Sex Pistols was not even the first punk band, although they were unique). The group members were the ones who made the group what it was. "The filth and the rage", a much more credible film about Julien Tempel's band, which made this film, is told from the point of view of the members that contradict McLaren's claims. However, the dishonesty of "The Great Rock 'Roll Swindle" is not my biggest problem with it. If it were actually entertaining (which I thought in some cases), I could think of it, as I was naturally used to. During my third show, apart from Sex Pistols songs, some live footage, and at least one rare amusing cartoon series, it was pretty boring! I'd rather find the "Who Killed Bambi" song amusing, but it made me very tired. <br /> <br /> Is this cartoon worth watching for Sex Pistols fans? It seems a good number of fans would say it is not to learn about the true story of the short-lived but pioneering 70-punk band, but for entertainment. It was once my opinion of the "Great Rock and Roll Swindle". After the first time I looked at it, I couldn't remember anything that McLaren said. By the time I saw it the second time, I was aware of what the Pistols manager used to mean this movie, but still couldn't remember anything I heard him say! It was clear that other aspects of the movie I found impressive were clear. Now, after my third show, I can definitely remember what McLaren says, but it wasn't 100% clear yet. Like most of the movie, I think his words are not so memorable, probably because of the way they are presented. If you are a Pistols fan, I think it won't hurt to try a "Swindle", but to me it is just an incoherent, boring mess trying to be funny, but failing.
