In addition to the DA (James Eckhouse) and a short display woman who is convincingly sympathetic to Ellen Gulden's (Renee Zellweger) fate, Ellen herself is the only convincing character - and similar character in the movie. She is the one, not her dying mother, who should be and is the one true thing. It is not only in the role, in Zellweger's acting, but also in the plot itself. Until the plot turns against itself - and the mother makes the one real thing in the eyes of her weak will, shallow man who can do nothing for his wife or daughter. The daughter sees what the viewer observes, but such intelligent perceptions must be relieved by the man's level sentiment poured out on both the realities of his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> To begin, the one powerful scene in this whole movie, when Ellen confronts her father's cruelty, the lie is given to the end. Ellen is just another young strong woman who is matching a crybaby father. A very flawed film - so flawed that it is called a drill and not worth the time.
