This show shows the depths of the British TV pre-watershed drama. With these dull scripts, mediocre acting, poor plots, terrible dialogue, one is forced to see a DVD of any old ER episode to see excellent hospital drama. <br /> <br /> None of the actors working on this show seem to be acting! <br /> <br /> If you want low quality but easy to absorb soap opera style TV, this is the show for you. Personally, I like something with more meat on the bone. Unfortunately, like all other UK licensees, I fund this foam.
