It's a terrific recurrence of a very good movie called "Up In The Air" with Frankie Darrow, Mantan Moreland and Marjorie Reynolds. I could only stand about 20 minutes before I switched it off. Almost all the lines are identical, I have no idea why they will do the movie again. I totally disagree with a previous post that does not like the songs (the same too). In the original, the song is the first time, I don't know if Marjorie Reynolds actually did her own song, it's hard to tell since the choir was usual. added later, and the songs are very good, surprisingly in a "B" movie. If you get the chance, see the original it is available on DVD. You will be pleasantly surprised.
