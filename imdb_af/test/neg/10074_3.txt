Number 1 was very nice summer popcorn. These were the modern Jaws. <br /> <br /> Number 2 is best summarized by Jeff Goldblum in the movie to be the stupid idea in the history of stupid ideas (or something). <br /> <br /> Number 3 is the deadly notice ... JP has achieved everything he will ever do. <br /> <br /> After realizing they didn't have fresh ideas, they just had to sleep. <br /> <br /> That said. Movie is good if you don't mind, because you've seen it before. <br /> <br />
