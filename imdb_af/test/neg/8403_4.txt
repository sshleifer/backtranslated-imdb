A disturbing movie, as it climbed with an intimate reunion between a naked man and his young son, but in his confused structure, it contains a poetic imagined visual exploration of the innocence of an idealized amnesia. <br /> <br /> The plot follows two wires, the weaker of which is the gradual revelation of Graham / Pablo's condition. This is a beautiful description of his condition, and his winding path to a partial awakening, driven by his relationship with Irene. <br /> <br /> The relationship is the strong thread, while the details of the Plot are borne by a seemingly designated collection of characters: Graham's best friend, who can reveal the cause of his condition in a flashy flashback. his manipulative boss and his comic book of the bad scientific psychologist: anyone interested in losing and dependent on him. <br /> <br /> The failure of the film lies in the conflict between the two threads. One is visual, tortuous and sublime, while the other is structured like a careless, all display dialogue and unresolved patterns of symbolism. <br /> <br /> However, I enjoy Novo. It flirts with the abyss of the taboo and hides in something beautiful, like in the quarry, with the bass guitar and the two women, when a set-up for a scene of cheap pornography becomes a segment of peace and rejuvenation. I'm still not getting the tooth. <br /> <br /> Odd, clunky and narrative failure, but with an almost redeeming beauty.
