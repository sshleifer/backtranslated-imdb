Well, the movie starts well, but after half an hour it gets boring and stupid when all the plot about Karen's (that was the name of the girl right?) Pregnancy. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie It's really thin and the characters are really stupid. <br /> <br /> I don't know who is more stupid than the girl because she came back with her old boyfriend or son for the way he was used to her. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my conclusion is this: definitely not the best eighties comedy, just another movie like many others with nothing special, they can do better, but they ruined it , if the plot just took a different way, but they keep the pregnancies and they are definitely ruined, so final conclusion: I don't like it.
