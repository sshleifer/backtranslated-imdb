Avoid this one! It's a terrible movie. So, if it's very exciting? All it is is just senseless murders. And the whole thing with Thorn and Michael's curse, it was the absolute worst thing they could possibly do to the series! Why can't they leave Michael's story a mystery? He is supposed to be the Boogeyman, not part of a silly cult !! Ugh! Thanks for the Halloween H20, which wiped out Halloween 3-6! They all sucked! But anyway, if you see this movie, you no longer expect senseless murders and gores.
