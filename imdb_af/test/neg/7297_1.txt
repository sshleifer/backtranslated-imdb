Looking for a movie for your Turkey Film Festival? THE ROLLER BLADE SEVEN is on my list of the ten worst movies of all time. The plot, the story of a post-apocalyptic roller blading Samurai warrior, is a winding hodge-podge of movie references of everything from STAR WARS to SEVEN SAMAURI. Acting fluctuations range from slim to abysmal. The scene where the villain upset the old master is embarrassing to the point of pity. Frank Stalone's Black Knight reminds one of John Cleese's Black Knight in MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL. (Word of advice, Frank: If you're going to do a movie like this one, your career is over.) I struggled on this small stink bomb on a low-end cable channel and I couldn't stop watching. It's like watching a train swing, you just can't look away.
