This film made me laugh with the actors who kept the film in all kinds of crazy directions. If you like suggestive language and sexy looking gals, they were all in the picture and gals and guys all look out before graduating from high school. There is one scene where the teens drive their car into a very fake deer and then continue to throw it into a lake or ocean that is repeated over and over. There is no horror for this movie, except the word Horrible for the whole picture and Arnold playing a plastic man is really a sick character. Please do not waste your time viewing this movie.
