The only reason I rented the movie was to see Jeri Ryan in it! OMG this was the most boring, pointless movie I have ever seen !!! HOW LAME !!! I mean, really, give me a break! After Voyager I hope she'll get better roles! <br /> <br /> If I were one of the last people on earth, I would NOT be in a travel cart in the dessert !! It's just such a bad movie !! The thing about the Indian tribe and how it compared it every 10 seconds has really grown old. Poor Jeri, better luck next time!
