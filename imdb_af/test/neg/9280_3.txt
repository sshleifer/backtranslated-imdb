The 3rd and last big screen turns off the popular ITV sitcom of the early 1970s. BUSINESS HOLIDAYS are every time as tough and rough as the previous two attempts. From a three and a half year point of view, what constitutes the plot surrounds the adventures of Stan Butler (Reg Varney), his conductor Jack (Bob Grant) and their cute autocratic inspector Blake Stephen Lewis) after their retrenchments of their regular jobs at the bus depot. They all find work in similar positions at a holiday camp with Stan's family (Doris Hare, Anna Karen, Michael Robbins). <br /> <br /> British cinema had an earnings and substantial reputation for high quality in the 1960s, but many of these were due to US financial support and guidance which unfortunately ended when the 1970s began . Subsequently, remarkable homemade titles (GET CARTER are among these very few exc eptions) have become so scarce as Mick Jagger in a stable marriage, and the British film has gone on the road of cheap budgets, messy and inexorable sex comedies (The CONFESSIONS series, COME PLAY WITH ME) and flabby, extended celluloid versions of various TV shows, mostly sitcoms (this is one of many boring examples). Only DAD's arm and PORRIDGE were fairly respected in this regard: the striking success of the first ON THE BUSES movie (it was the biggest turnout hit of his year in 1971, nonsense to think right now!) Led two further prosecutions . <br /> <br /> To be honest, the TV series itself had a cheerful, mature, non-PC vulgarity about it that was fairly acceptable in half-hour-sitom, but stretched to three times that it surpassed patience. It is ironic that HAMMER FILMS produced this effort, as it almost looks like a horror movie in literal sense, with old words, chopped, poorly timed folding stick and terrible, cunning production values. <br /> <br /> An opportunity to send the cheese ss from the British holiday camp is totally wasted here in favor of the above elements, and it is bizarre, if not horrible, for the obvious 50-something Varney and the Winding, long-running Grant saw instantly charming women scarcely in their early twenties, while constantly laughing at their own bravado and lame jokes. The presence of Wilfrid Brambell (of STEPTOE AND SON) who entertain the elderly Miss Hare also helps and even though the film lasts about 1 and a half hours, it draws to an interminably depressing degree. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, this was the last movie in these tough movie trilogies, and the TV series itself ended. a successor (do not drink the water, which is criticized by the critics and ignored by audiences). In 1975, most of the leading role players were not seen much, but the worst was Bob Grant. Challenged with depression and other mental problems for many years, he said suicide in 2003. A sad coda to a sitcom that was the most popular of its era (it also wasn't too well-aged), and had to remain so rather than the three financially successful but artistically hopeless big-screen hybrids that have thinned. the happy memories and occasional merits of the TV counterpart. <br /> <br /> RATING: 2 and a half out of 10.
