I love rejecting this movie. My peers always try their best to defend it, probably out of love for Quentin Tarantino or Harvey Keitel, but they will never convince me that this one should be. Here are some great reasons why: A: The plot goes from abduction road trip film to vampire inhabited strip bar slasher flick with no intention whatsoever. Suddenly something is really turned into something very fake, which is like sitting the audience to a thanksgiving party and then exploding with dynamite. B: The undisputed Juliette Lewis is in it. C: Excessive ideas abound such as real torso and leg guitars, brothers with the surname "Gecko", bad vampire makeup work, Cheech Marin playing three characters (?) And a cross-based gun that only burns when "upright" and belongs to a man who goes through "Sex Machine". If Robert Rodriguez didn't try to be pathetic to be so innovative with his violence, I might have struggled with this obvious popcorn movie. The whole project is as he got the ideas by playing with action figures. The only thing that is still close to my favorite scene is George Clooney's laugh-out-loud cheesy monologue after killing his blood-sucking, horny-for-kids, terribly working brother. I swear I think they thought it upright. This movie is insulting and insulting those who want the offense. Horrible movie.
