A great gangster flick, with brilliant performances by famous actors with great action scenes? Well, not this one. <br /> <br /> It is quite surprising to see such wide-ranging actors of well-known actors, who have very good movies in their movie films in such a movie. This can undoubtedly be one of the worst things they can possibly do. <br /> <br /> First, the plot is as you expect from your average gangster biography, nothing new, nothing fancy in it. The way it is told makes the movie much longer than it is (when I thought the two hours were almost over, I was quite surprised that only 45 minutes passed.) <br /> <br /> The action scenes look much like those from the 80-year-old TV series - the A-team, for example. It's just that in the 80's (especially with the A team) the scenes were much more sophisticated than those in "El Padrino". It's especially nice to see the guys show their guns in the air and get something else (not to mention people who take cover behind the car doors that later appear to be shot). <br /> <br /> The acting fits nicely with the action. Either you get the same reaction to everything that happens (Dolph Lundgren style), or it's so crowded that you might think it's a parody (but unfortunately it's not). <br /> <br /> My advice is to stay away from this movie, any other gangster movie is better than this one.
