A typical old b & w movie. The dialogues are sometimes good, but too often - especially in the second half - they become naive, sometimes very naive, sometimes close to the point where they are inadvertently comic. The first third, with its background information on Ladd's Gatsby, featured with a series of interesting flashbacks, is the best part of the movie. But as soon as Gatsby moves into his new villa and makes his moves on Betty Field, the movie becomes melodramatic. The end is another exchange end; I don't know if the novel itself contains this dumb, clumsy end or whether the film's manufacturer has changed it, but I have always considered that car accidents are a bad way to add drama to the end of a story. I've seen this plot device a million times (or if it's not a car, then it's a horse's fall); The author does not know how to end the story, but he knows he wants it to be dramatic, so he adds to a car accident. Lamb. And to make matters worse, the accident is excessively coincidental and progressive, both concise and timely; plot-wise because Field's husband's mistress (Winters) is murdered by Field and the fact that Winters storms out of the street as if she had never seen in the years she lived there was a dangerous road across her home - and of course, the moment she came out, she saw Ladd's car and missed it for Field's husband's car and then shouted: "Here I am! Shoot me over and make the end tragic!"; timely because Ladd and Field are accidentally involved in an accident when they are preparing to tell Field's husband about their relationship. In fact, in this accident, there is just too much forced and artificial irony. It also does not help this film how Winters's husband, Da Silva, will do a revenge mission to kill the man who ran over his wife. he basically does it by walking around like a zombie, looking for a car, looking for scratches and working really badly. Both Da Silva's acting and his character's behavior in the film are terrible and confusing respectively. <br /> <br /> A few times, Scott Fitzgerald was upset about how his novels were adapted to screen by Hollywood writers. And though he had been dead long before this movie was done - he might complain to judge the film's naive writing. Or maybe his novels are even cleaner and more naive than this movie, and are actually enhanced by screen customizations. Or, the movies are almost like the novels. Of course I can read this particular novel to find out, but I just can't bother. Fitzgerald's name doesn't exactly tell me to read any of his books (and I don't mean how his name sounds.) He was definitely not Heller, Clavell or Twain. More like Hemingway ?? much noise about nothing.
