It's the worst movie I've ever seen. Initially I thought it would be good because I was interested in the Bermuda triangle, but it was terrible. All that did was a bunch of lame explorations that didn't make sense (if the time was different, how did the woman come, and her son was aging quickly) and had a terrible juicy end. The next time the guys who made it to Bermuda have to take all the copies of this movie. Everyone agrees to this movie, so it can come on the worst movie list.
