While it's not really terrible, this movie is still largely a waste of time, and an amazingly inaccurate and revised picture of Beach Boys history. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie would believe Mike Love was the brain. behind the band and Brian Wilson was just a pathetic psycho. In fact, none of the characters is further developed than a one-dimensional parody, but it's a TV movie, so what do you expect? Mike Love's dirty stench is across this turkey as he attempts to rewrite history with himself in the role of band figure and resident genius. Yes, as if ... <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the music is excellent. Unlike the previous Beach Boys made-for-TV bio-pic "Summer Dreams", this movie actually contains Beach Boys music rather than anemic cover versions. It also contains a surprising number of Beach Boys-related rarities and rarely -Hard songs - The Sun Rays "I Live for the Sun", but one example. <br /> <br /> This movie was originally shown in two parts on US network TV. Part one is the superior of the two and documents the boys' early days and rises to the top. By the time part two rolls around, Brian Wilson's character has become a mere cartoon and apparently the actor is playing laughing - but how can anyone take this shit seriously? If you are not a fan of Beach Boys, you will probably not get much from this movie, except for a very distorted and one-sided view of the group's history. But then again, why would you see it if you weren't a fan?
