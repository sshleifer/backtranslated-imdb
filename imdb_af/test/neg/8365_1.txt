If you come to this movie to learn about depression, forget about it: you will learn nothing but how not to write a script on the subject. I understand the intention was to show how serious depression can change an average person into a complete wreck, but the result is the most one-dimensional character I've ever seen in a Hollywood feature. Christina Ricci as Elizabeth spends the whole of this movie screaming on top of her lungs, maliciously insulting someone, bursting into tears or a combination of the three (the only exceptions are silence and end). There is not the slightest hint of what she may be, WITHOUT depression. Not the finest shine of any other aspect of her personality. She didn't scream. At one point her roommate tells her, "Lizzie, you're such a fun person to be around if you're not depressed," and my response was, "She IS?" It was strange that the authors would include these comments without giving us examples, but this script is a lesson in incompetence. It has no observable structure or flow; Instead, it consists of a series of uncomfortable-cut scenes from Lizzie who screams, then ends. Character development? No ... Scenes of her everyday existence, ie are you going to classes, which might be important details? No ... Shout at maximum volume? CHEQUE. It's not enough, I'm scared. 10/01.
