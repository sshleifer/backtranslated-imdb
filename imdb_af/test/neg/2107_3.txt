For their credit, this is one of their more capable bits of trash, which is because there are considerably good gores, and an interesting approach to jumping a snake on a plane. But if there is another example of the inconsistency behind Asylum's latest coaching, it is the two characters who are initially illegal immigrants and cannot understand whether English speaks to a Texas man hitting them across the border. Yet they get on a train and meet a friend, they start to understand and speak English. <br /> <br /> Besides being a pretty bad portrayal of a Hollywood formula, "Snakes on a Train" are quite boring. At least, with "Snakes on a plane" we got the chance to look at actors who were cucumbers and tried to be interesting remotely. The Mallachi Brothers installment features some of the most boring characters I've ever seen, from an electrical engineer (give, I wonder how he'll come in handy later), to a few stoner surfers, to our two main characters who is trying to fight From the snake curse hiding in the man's wife. <br /> <br /> "Snakes" are never entertained, and even when it's very good, it's never been as good as it has the chance to be, because "Snakes" could have been a funny short film and instead, he just takes it too seriously and never places it at any moment. Instead of taking their small budget and making original movies that can set a precedent, they rather force their small budget to work against them in these knock offs. While the Mallachi brothers seem to be trying, the train looks incredibly artificial. <br /> <br /> It almost looks like a stage play with this inconsistent and terribly bare set of desperately descending pieces of train, while shaking it every time, the background of the windows is blurred and the sound effects are occasional to let us know that they are actually on a train; Not to mention that in such a vast train it only appears to be about ten passengers. And beyond the train fight, and a prolonged sex scene, we are forced to be subject to a plot that makes no sense. And even the directors can't work the fact that the "deadly" snakes going on this train look far from poisonous or dangerous. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie just stumbles over a minute of snake carnage and a bad subplot of an ex drug agent is trying to molest a passenger. All this dull outline ends with a very ridiculous climax in which a poor computer-generated snake (I saw better animation on the Super Nintendo) completely swallowed the whole train and then poured into a method that had to be exercised from the beginning. Asylum scores again. <br /> <br /> Asylum scores again with a chopped, lazy, terribly directed and boring rip-off of yet another better movie. "Snakes on a train" take themselves too seriously and therefore it is never entertaining or memorable.
