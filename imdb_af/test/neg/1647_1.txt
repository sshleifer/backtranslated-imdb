On his recent maligned reality show, Mr. Shore concedes that his cinematic oeuvre is best enjoyed. No, he had to say looked best. While a healthy token can see you through the end credits, there is a pleasure to be found, except some sporadic chuckling on the photo, not with it. Titular interface absence is the least grievance. Other hyphens, healthy Tiffani Amber Thiessen (I dare you to say that the "Saved by the Bell" patina of purity) is false as a rural vamp; she is too round of face for betrayal. Mr. Shore, sometimes showing the strange talent for mime (I thought I got a Jimmy Stewart there), but it's never used properly. The quick fish-out-of-water formula still needs to be delivered with less grace. Our hero, Crawl, has a little bit of money to believe that he will quickly charm his agrarian antagonists. Eventually I had to announce that it was fixed: THE SUCCESS MOVIE NEVER. P.S. As another fish, Adam Sandler fared better with "Mr. Deeds". It can take a Shore to appreciate a Sandler.
