If you thought NBC's 10.5 was stupid, you'll be glad to hear that the FX got into the intestines of the TV hell and cut the fingers into this pseudo-9/11 poop. Not only was the plot stupid, it was a complete ripoff of 24 and a bad ripoff with it. The filming style was the now-used docu-action look, complete with cuts to grainy B&W rawcore material. I'm not quite sure what that means, but it sounds like something the DP said to the director before filming. I don't know where they went here, but it reminded me of the man at the office who thinks Powerpoint offers with "fly-ins" and "animations" are "cool". <br /> <br /> The story is that 6 "terrorists" take over a nuclear power plant in southern CA. That's right, nuclear power plants, where hundreds of people work, where there are security measures against the ying yang. For the sake of reality, they placed 2 unimportant CHiPs in the mix. Because they could stop 6 people, right? Six. I think even Bruce Willis had to attack more terrorists at the stupid Nakatomi building. <br /> <br /> Leslie Hope (TV's Teri Bauer) plays a CHP officer who has difficulty talking about the phone after she is shot in her bulletproof jacket. Her voice sounds like a Sally Struther's TV ad, whiny and monotonous. Her character is just a plot device, and once she has done her one small duty, she is immediately disposed of. Yes, Teri Bauer is dead! <br /> <br /> Bruce Greenwood stars as FBI S.A.C. Tom Shea, who constantly shows how he is facing foreign diplomats. His boss is out, so no one left at the Dept. or Homeland Security believes its prediction of the situation. He is the prudent one in a group of paranoid public officials who are afraid of blaming any kind of disaster. He's calm, he's strong, he's busy. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing to reconcile or entertain about Meltdown. All right, maybe, Mrs. Teri Bauer died, was fairly unnecessary and funny. Other than that, nothing redeeming.
