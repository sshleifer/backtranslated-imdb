After reading the most glowing remarks about this movie, I decided to rent it despite some TV movie suspicions. I had to follow my instincts. <br /> <br /> I tried so hard to warm up the movie and earn it but I couldn't. The story never pulls you in, whether the rings are true and the acting is at best perfunctory and lower in the worst. Everything in this production is amateurish. <br /> <br /> Always a joy to watch, Mary McDonnell may be the only artist to escape this disaster without damaging her career or reputation. I won't even check the name of the leading man. Hopefully he will be advertising again. <br /> <br /> Even Vanessa Redgrave, whom I worship and respect, channeled Katherine Hepburn all the time, as if she were really swollen in the house. Maybe she needed the money. <br /> <br /> If I can save one person to waste 100 minutes on this trip, I feel fair.
