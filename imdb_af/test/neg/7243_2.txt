No budget directly after video story of aliens in Arizona regarding military and escaped prisoners. <br /> <br /> Not as bad as that, but rather the role and the crew going through, instead of selling it. . It's as if they knew they were in a grade z movie and want you to know they know. Then maybe they just can't get it together. <br /> <br /> An abuse of a Grade Z movie that could have been something if someone cared - and had skill. Why should low-budget filmmakers insist that they don't actually try to make something good, rather than just making a product. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 because nothing comes together
