This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. It was a total waste of money. If I wasn't in the theater, my two young cousins ​​(who also thought it was disappointing, but not as horrible as I thought) were leaving the theater. There were two points in the film that I almost laughed at, but the rest of it was boring, ridiculous or painful. I thought it would be a spoof on all superhero movies (which I love), but it was basically based on Spiderman, with a few oblique references to other superhero movies such as Fantastic Four and Batman. I really can't think of one good thing to say about this movie. Don't waste your money on this movie - there are many other better movies out there!
