To name this movie, disaster will be an understatement. I don't even know where to start! However, I have questions and many of them. I want to know who was identified with this script? Who gave them money to make this movie? Who was in charge of casting and costumes? They must all be sued! I saw this movie in my local library's catalog and I thought "Hey! Great!" I just saw the two FOG movies that Hollywood produced and then realized that Bollywood had a version. Not known to me, that it would be a complete and complete shit! <br /> <br /> Dhund - the mist is a movie about four friends (actually just one of them, but you need to know there are four friends), one of them is a beauty queen (played by India's 1st Mrs. World, Aditi Govitrikar) and the director are not saving any costs. The writer even claims that she (Simran's name) has Aishwarya Rai eyes, Kareena Kapoor lips and Rani Mukherjee hair. Feel free to barf if you want, at least at this point you haven't seen the movie, other than poor I. : * (<br /> <br /> Anyway, Simran one day gets a death threat from one of the participants' uncle, who says she must drop the game so that his cousin can get a better chance Simran's boyfriend does not allow her to do so, so she takes part in the spectacle and wins, causing her former college classmates to come to her, but with the help of her cousin Kajal, Simran drowns the culprit and they both task their boyfriends to get rid of the body, which is difficult, but they eventually get it done. <br /> <br /> In a Hollywood scene loan Diabolique, the pool where the dead body is hidden, is only drained to reveal that the body is missing and it begins an abundance of Whodunit and Where-is-it? movie successful scenes from 'i know what you did last summer i still know, Scream 1, Scream 2, Scream 3, Murder wrote his episodes and not to get engaged, Columbo and Scooby Doo! Shamelessly, I tell you! <br /> <br /> Inconsistencies and problems within the movie include, but are not limited to: <br /> <br /> 1. A sly dressed Simran answers three times her phone calls from her killer. The camera shows her lets the phone off the hook, but the phone can call each time and she picks it up to answer. <br /> <br /> 2. Tanya tries to kill herself because she doesn't win the beauty contest? WTF? Even ten times more beautiful Aishwarya Rai did not attempt suicide when she did not win Miss India. <br /> <br /> 3. In the pool scene, the children who come to the ball that dropped into the pool disappear as soon as the police arrive. And the ball also disappears. <br /> <br /> 4. The clich√© blue contact lenses of the killer change from blue to brown in the drowning scene, but when his body rises again, his eyes are blue. <br /> <br /> 5. No one dying in the movie is mourned (strange, especially for Indian society). <br /> <br /> 6. When Vikram jumps into the dirty swimming pool, an underwater camera shows us his actions and miraculously the pool changes to Olympic size and is clean and clean. <br /> <br /> 7. Sexy belly dancer performs a pseudo-orgasm-drenched song and dance number over the coming age. It would have been for some bachelor's parties, but they won Simran's performance! Hello !!!! <br /> <br /> 8. Kunal, Sameer, Simran and Kajal cannot dance properly or Lip Synch. But don't make them guilty, just assume there was no choreographer for the dance numbers. <br /> <br /> 9. Nothing in the movie has been choreographed, it was as if they had just told the actors to show up and do everything they wanted. <br /> <br /> 10. The movie played as if there was no writing. Either that or the director was tall and drunk when he filmed this litter! <br /> <br /> 11. When Simran's photo was published in a magazine without her permission, she flew to the police headquarters to arrest the photographers, but she has death threats and should not leave the police do not warn. <br /> <br /> To name but a few of course. This movie was a painful experience for me and I encourage everyone to skip it in every possible and possible way. Bollywood should be terribly shy of this kind of movie.
