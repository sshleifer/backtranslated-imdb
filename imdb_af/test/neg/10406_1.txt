And of course I didn't see it! <br /> <br /> But look at the role and see that Doug Masters is back from death, I now know to avoid it like the plague! I hate it as Hollywood, producers, writers, directors or all of the above believes that audiences are foolish that they will not detect any continuity errors. A deadly dead Doug master coming back is a huge giant, wouldn't you say? <br /> <br /> And I can't believe anyone like Louis Gossett, Jr. would return like that. <Br /> <br /> Did Jason Gedrick really refuse it? Well, I hate to say that, but even if he played the role again, it would still have had the same continuity error. I'm sure (if he really turned it down), he had to be incredible, as his character died in the second movie. <br /> <br /> I will probably accidentally get it on a late night air on a channel, but I'm not going to rent it or buy the DVD!
