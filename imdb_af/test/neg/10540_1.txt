The best thing about the movie is its name, as it describes both the plot and the scene. At least they can't say they didn't warn you. As the button marked, "Don't push it". <br /> <br /> Segal must run out of things like planes, trains, and ships, but the plot remains the same. Under cover man who is slow fighting, but still knocks like 40 mercenaries and doesn't even shine when it's done. What astonishes me is that Segal is now as big as a barn and the bad guys still can't hit him with a machine gun and 50 ammunition cuts. Where are all these bullets going? The only redeeming feature of this movie is watching Nia Peeples pound Ja Rule. (Real name Jeffrey Atkins doesn't sound that punk) in the floor. I can spend days watching that woman kick her foot over her shoulder, especially with an outfit like that! It was just a bonus to watch what Jeffy got, was * kicked, and fun, one of those kicks actually landed. Sorry, it's just time we get stupid. Wannabe, tough guy can't react from the movies. PLEEEEEASE! Who came to the idea anyway? I'll have the chance of being the person who decided to succeed Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore as a ghostly athletic Angels. <br /> <br /> The only surprising turn in this movie is that they don't do the politically correct thing and have Jeffy in and save the day. No doubt whether Snoop (otherwise known as his mother like Calvin Broadus, who doesn't sound as cool as you refer to him as Cal), was in the movie, he threw some signs on her and probably saved or saved Segal's life something.
