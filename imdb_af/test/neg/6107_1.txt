The film is a gross misrepresentation of Orthodox lifestyle and practice. A Jewish court will never enforce a divorce between childless couples. Although the concept exists in Jewish law, the conditions are too much to actually take place. Childless couples find it difficult to handle their childlessness in a community where children are a very important part of life, but nowhere are they "rejected" by their community as depicted in the film. They are treated with extreme sensitivity. In fact, very large rabbis lived their whole lives without children and never separated. <br /> <br /> The portrayal of Yosef, a horrible person, is meant to - perhaps unaware - the behavior of a typical orthodox male. In fact, it is as typical as a violent drunkard rape typical of secular society. Both exist in their own worlds and both are contemptuous. <br /> <br /> It is amazing that so many people form their opinions on a society based on a MOVIE (by someone who is personally biased against a community). I have always thought that it is only the Orthodox, because of their meticulousness and distinctive lifestyle, which all secular people judge by the violence and immoral behavior they read in newspapers or in the movies.
