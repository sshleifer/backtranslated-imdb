When my six-year-old had fallen asleep in the theater, it was the confirmation that I needed this movie to be a stinker. It was boring. The scary parts were boring. The maudlin parts were boring. Even the funny parts - with two minor exceptions - were boring. And predictable. And did I mention predictably? Examples: 1) The abomination but loving father who welcomes his brat from a child. 2) The abomination, but loving father who buys the farm (while singing a song?!). 3) The brat of a child who decides to cut and run, but thank his friends, keep things out because they need him. 4) The brat of a child wins at incredible odds. 5) And a sassy character pronounced by an African American actress. Gotta credit these filmmakers for that little originality and for the survival of that stereotype. I called two funny pieces. In both cases, contributed by minor characters. The mouse reflecting on the farmer's wrist was funny. The farm dog who had victims of his doggy weaknesses while being a leader was funny. But the rest? Painful. Someone tried to make a hip-thru committee movie and make it even better by making it a computer-animated movie, and that was the result. And why do the Coyotes Batman villain stupid by monologuing with their victims, rather than just eating them? Oh yes. No blood needed in this movie for children, and is already concentrating on ridiculous alcohol consumption, devastating behavior and potty humor. And the fuzzy thing-in-a-box? What exactly was that? A pig? Tasmanian devil? What, besides a very silly plot device to help Otis help the Cow win the Mother of all battles? Barnyard is a bomb. And I didn't even need the udders.
