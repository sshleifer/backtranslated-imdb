It may be weird, but I only saw the first movie (The Emperor's New Groove, yaddayadda) a week ago and just because of one episode of the TV show. I just love Kuzco's character, but Kronk is not that bad either. Anyway, eventually I decided to watch the second movie, just so I would have seen it. Hope it will be as good as the first, but ... It's a shame to tell it, but the more humor the American has become, the more I grew. I agreed with Kuzco when he began to cry to see all the cute footage. <br /> <br /> Yet, younger children and probably also veterans will love this movie (if they enjoy the old school's moralizing Disney), but I just had expectations that were a bit unhelpful, much higher than what they should have been. Kronk is a lovely character, with good heart and dumb everyone, but it was Pacha and Kuzco in the drag that woke me up at the end of the movie. (I'll ignore Rudy ... as far as possible). <br /> <br /> Anyway, a good movie, just not my style and as they say, you should always be your groove true.
