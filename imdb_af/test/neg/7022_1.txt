Lucille Ball was a powerful force in television in the 1950s and 1960s, but she still made an occasional film, especially the long, long trailer and the facts of life. Although her television track remains strong, the movie career began in the 1970s, but Ball was determined to have one of the last big flashes of screen. The project she chose was the 1966 musical MAME. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the role was tailor-made: based on the popular novel that gave rise to two different Broadway plays, Mame Dennis is a wacky, wild, undisturbed woman who is her orphan cousin Patrick "inherits" and leads him on a wild tour of life's possibilities, bouncing off one comic spree to another. The music, which included such songs as "Open a New Window" and "If he walked in my life today" was under Jerry Herman's best work. The supporting role Robert Preston and Bea Arthur included was the best of the best. Expectations were high; opening night fanfare was great; the movie was a disaster. Critics were terrified and audiences struggled. <br /> <br /> No matter what hardcore Lucy fans can say, MAME is a fake, so much that it's hard to know where to start. It is badly directed, poorly filmed, poorly performed, and there is Lucille Ball in the middle of it all, unable to dance, can't sing, and grins like a waxworks dummy while turning incredibly bad choreography around her . But the disaster is rare for her to make alone; supporting cast rates not better. Bea Arthur and Jane Connell recreate their stage role of Vera Charles and Agnes Gooch; the former is stagey, the latter is bleak. Robert Preston succeeds in singing with a smile, but he is much on his own and clearly not too happy. <br /> <br /> The DVD brings the widescreen movie from the VHS pan-and-scan release, but it just means there's more horror to see. Everyone loves Lucy, but only the least critical fan could love Lucy's MAME; while I wouldn't say it's bad enough to let you go, you might have had it. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
