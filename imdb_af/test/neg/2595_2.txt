Have you ever seen one of those shows that has become so popular that it could eventually get away with a crummy nonsense and repetitive half-hearted gimmicks that its creators can get away with? If you haven't, then you've never seen Family Guy. <br /> <br /> Fans of the show seem to be so greasy, edgy and offensive. This is not one of these, but it is dull, repetitive, insulting and uninspired. <br /> <br /> The humor of the show comes from two sources. <br /> <br /> 1) Irrelevant idiot. The show often flashes back on things that have nothing to do with the plot and is mostly absurd and useless. And then there are the random movie references in which the show characters reenact a scene from a popular movie without effectively parading it. . . or parody (which is not fine!). <br /> <br /> 2) The same crap that is in each episode. The one guy is a sexual disorder with STD's, AHA HA! Isn't it funny? Hey, you know what's even funny? Make the same joke about him anywhere between one and fifteen times in a single episode. And don't just tell a single episode once, make sure you drag it out so a whole scene is dedicated just to tell the one joke. Now imagine the same routine being used over and over for virtually every character in the whole series. <br /> <br /> The horrible "un-PC" humor is not as "un-PC" as you would think, mostly they just say what morons think about the latest newspaper headlines, politicians and peers. <br /> <br /> The series has moments, but now I think it's time to just take the show off. and do with it. <br /> <br /> You know what's funny? I still like this more than Nausicaa from the valley of the wind.
