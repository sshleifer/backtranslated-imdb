This film is about meeting 7 couples at Hampstead heath in a sunny Wednesday afternoon. It shows 7 different kinds of couples: married, divorced, a relationship, homosexual, older, blind date and escort service. They are not interconnected except the geographical location. So it's a disappointment. The film is a collage of conversations without any noticeable plot. The movie jumps from a few to another without any logic. I find this movie boring and aimless. The only redeeming feature is the good weather in the movie. It's sad that talents like Ewan McGregor and Sophie Okonedo are being wasted by this movie.
