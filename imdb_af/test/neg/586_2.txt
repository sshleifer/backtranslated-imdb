Very funny script by Cameron Crowe (following on the heels of his "Fast Times at Ridgemont High") has little inspiration and flies away at stupid gags. At least "Fast Times" had a fair share of satire and sensitivity behind his stick (for the sake of a good director, Amy Heckerling, and Crowe's unmistakable fondness for capturing a letter-perfect teenage talk); Here, Chris Penn (Sean's brother, natch) is the goof-off that makes life hell for straight arrows Eric Stoltz, and the filmmakers seem to think he's hilarious. Jenny Wright has a few good moments as a carpenter, but Illan Mitchell-Smith is lost in a scrapie subplot about a teenager apparently abandoned with a scared ex-soldier. Queasy, confused nonsense given a shiny luster and a soundtrack full of pop rock songs, but characters that one would want to avoid. Supporters Lea Thompson, Rick Moranis, Lee Ving, and Sherilyn Fenn are wasted in stupid roles. * of ****
