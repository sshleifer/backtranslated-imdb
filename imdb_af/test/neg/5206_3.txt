I like the movie, it's just that the characters are walking around without really showing off their madness. As I said, poor goat. The goat was nahing while the man pretended to grind. I would like the rape zone to be more graphic (not the one with the goat). Jane Ryall, who only played Celia, did this one movie. She was very naked these days. This crazy couple who murdered and tortured many people ended up in their rightful places. I almost forgot about the gay transvestite couple who are also chosen as sinners. If you love the wall, it's your movie. 10/03
