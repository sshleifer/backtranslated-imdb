I don't like Himesh Reshamiya. I also don't like his singing. But his songs are a craze in India, especially among ordinary people. Now when he dared to become an actor? it was a great joke! What he should sow as much as possible in his first time. I never wanted to see this movie. But one thing changed it. The movie becomes a super-duper hit! After 2 weeks did Monkey Ka Saroor raked box office collection of 14 crores? compared to Apne who collected 7 crores in the same 2 weeks. If I can sit by Apne and Rajnikant's absurd Sivaji? I also have to try this movie to understand what this movie has made it such a big hit? The story is about real life singer Himesh Reshamiya (HR) who goes to Germany for a concert and falls in love with Riya (Hansika Motwani). A German lawyer Ruby (Mallika Sherawat) loves Himesh. Now, Himesh has been arrested for a murder. The mission of Himesh (in the last 40 minutes) after leaving prison is to prove himself innocent and find the true killer. <br /> <br /> Let me say that Himesh has nothing in him to become a hero. He tried hard but failed. He's pathetic. I thought what made the movie so much made? Let me find something positive. <br /> <br /> First, the saving grace of the movie is the writing to the point that Homesh drove away from prison. (But then the movie nips into unbearable silly boundaries) Secondly, the songs of the movie are good, catchy, crowded tractor numbers. Third, Mallika Sherawat ?? she looks beautiful and also acts well as the second woman. I think Mallika's fans are coming to see the movie just for her. Fourth, the movie of the movie is pleasant ?? especially the German places, is a surprise to look at. Fifth, most of the story is a love story between Himesh and Riya ?? with clich√© dialects that are likely to be linked to young crowds. Sixth, director Prashant Chadha has done a decent job of covering the pathetic acting skills of Himesh as much as possible with shots that Homesh doesn't need to do much. <br /> <br /> The heroine Hansika Motwani looks like a little budget movie heroine. Raj Babbar is wasted in a small role. Overall, the movie is a lower average. <br /> <br /> I thought throughout the movie ?? What if the same script with Salmaan is done as the lead. I think it would have been a much better thing. Maybe I'll have given the movie 6 out of 10. But now? (Stars 4.5 out of 10)
