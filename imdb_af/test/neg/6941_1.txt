This movie basically uses squirrel rape as one of the most important comic devices. Now I switched it off when he literally connected her to the bed and raped her, but I can't really imagine how it eventually turned into something that was engaging and funny. This movie not only scraped a wonderful cast and was consistently unfunny. It actually managed to be rather brutally disturbing and misogynistic. How many people seem to be a lovely family flash is beyond me. "I liked collecting the apricots last night." It is not a funny joke when you know it refers to an unwilling virgin who forces you to have sex with you in the hope that she will eventually learn to enjoy it. To see a look is not family fun. I feel honestly worse because I watched half of this creepy "comedy" and I'm totally amazed by these positive reviews.
