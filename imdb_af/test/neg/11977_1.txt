It was a disgrace to the game FarCry. I had a lot of expectations, but everything ended in a nightmare. In addition to the badly acting visual effects, the plot dumbs even the humor used in the movie was an absolute flop. The movie is not worth watching at all. The funniest part was when the girl came and gave Jack a coffin to give him the key to the cuffs. Guess she has the keys to handcuffs all the time. I hope a good director will one day make a remake of this fantastic game. And I'll invest them some good cash to get the visual effects right and the screens right as well as the acting right. But until then you shouldn't waste time trying to watch this movie, as it will surely make you crazy if you are a FarCry lover.
