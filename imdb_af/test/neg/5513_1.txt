A Roger Corman rip-off gather for what seems to be virtually zero budget. All of the special effects were originally used in "Battle Beyond the Stars", and I suspect a good number of props, costumes and sets were also used by other sources. The story seems to be written around these elements, so it's not really a movie as much as it's a recycling project. Third-rate "Star Wars" junk was then not needed.
