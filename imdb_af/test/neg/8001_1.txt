This movie simply has no redeeming features. The story is incomprehensible, and the writing is gross, sadistic and stupid. The sex scene is a joke, just like the inevitable car hunt. The music is terrible. The acting is largely limited to growling and smirking. A half star dud. Shame on DirecTV to place it on pay-per-view. In a theater, people may be thrown on the screen.
