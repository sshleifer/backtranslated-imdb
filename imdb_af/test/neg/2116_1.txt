I think this movie can be called the movie of Wrong Rage. <br /> <br /> The characters of Joe and Bob were relics of World War II generation who didn't quite understand their children. rock and roll. But I think their true anger was the fact that America started her long decline from the heights over which the war left her. <br /> <br /> "Joe" himself is a lower-rent Archie Bunker who has desperately lived his life of silence until he played with Compton, a man who raised him the hippies wanted to compensate for what his daughter had destroyed. <br /> <br /> Honestly, most of the movie looks stupid, the characters are worse than one dimensional, they are laughing. Peter Boyle could do better.
