The story in general, though very graphic, is actually decent and fairly interesting to readers. However, the movie was absolutely terrible. The story was good, but the acting was terrible. I cry all the time because I knew I could never get my time back. Don't see this movie. If you do, bring a gun with a bullet in it, and a few bullets when you go with friends. I feel sorry for everyone who has had something with this movie. I also feel sorry for everyone who had to watch the movie. Avoid this movie at all costs, and if your mom forces you to watch, kill her. Hahahahaha! See! I'm now a psycho! IKWTCBS changed me into a psycho !!
