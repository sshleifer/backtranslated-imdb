As much as I hated the movie that follows this series, I can at least say that Zangief was amusing. The animated series is probably one of the worst things ever made. The animation is often inconsistent, although it remains consistently bad. The shape of a character's face is even capable of drastically changing into the same shot. The screenplay and voice show also leaves something to be desired as most of the role-players look as talented as the film of a third-degree drama play. Characters such as Cammy and DJ are so forced into stereotypes of their nationalities that episodes they contain are almost physically painful to watch, not that the series is not painful anyway. Episode plots seem to try to reach new levels of lame with each turn and are so full of plot holes that surprised me that they had time to show ads. Surely it surprised me anyone paid to advertise during the show. In addition to a bad series, it's even worse off Street Fighter. Many of the characters maintain the failed movie adjustments. Examples are Ken and Ryu are idiot con men (although Ken is supposed to be rich), Blanka is Guile's friend Charlie, and Chun Li is a reporter. It takes talent to make something as bad as the movie and make it worse.
