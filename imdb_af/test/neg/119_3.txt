Technically I'm a Van Damme Fan, or I was. this movie is so bad I hated to waste those 90 minutes. Don't let the name Isaac Florentine (Unchallenged II) be deceived, I had great hope for this one, depending on what I saw. (Undisputed II). Man .. was I wrong? all action fans wanted a big return for the classic action hero, but I don't think we'll be able to see it soon, as our hero is still at that (go-to-a-front-far-away-town and-kill-the-bad-guys-like-return-home) movies I mean for God's sake, we are in 2008, and they insist on doing those disappointing movies on every level. Why ?? Do yourself a favor, skip it seriously.
