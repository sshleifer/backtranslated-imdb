Why on earth do five US repeat this one? the title actually says it all: the plot is as clear as a book that is read in a language you have never heard of and which does not look like anything. <br /> <br /> You will see ninety minutes changing places, most of them will be inflated later in the movie. In the beginning you see a pretty little place typical of the Berry, which occurs in the movie near Paris, but it doesn't survive the "transport" to the island de France very well: it explodes 1 minute later. There are also two gangsters who have no tongues, as if it would make sense in the world of SMS and internet, let alone pencil and paper. <br /> <br /> It just so, nothing makes sense in this story. My only credit goes to the cameraman, the camera is excellent.
