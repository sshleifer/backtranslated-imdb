I'm really surprised to see all these positive reviews for this movie. Don't get me wrong, it's not that I don't like these movies. <br /> <br /> While enjoying a good, unconscious Hollywood action blocker like Die Hard 4.0, I like the 'Dogma' kind of movies, or 'real life-as-it' "Movies, just as much as they are good. <br /> <br /> A good example is Festen (1998): no music, no dramatic camera angles, no special fx, no fancy places. Just a good story combined with great acting and the result is an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> Are Nine Life without dramatic camera angles, special fx and fancy venues? Yes. Is this a good movie? I'm glad you asked. <br /> <br /> The answer is: Absolutely not. <br /> <br /> First of all, everyone is crazy about acting. I'm sorry, but you can do everything you want, but if the story and the dialogue aren't credible, the act immediately falls into the background. And this is exactly the case with Nine Life. <br /> <br /> Not once did I have the feeling while watching "Nine Life", that I watched real people who had a real conversation. I felt I watched actors trying to come across as 'real characters' while saying things were never a real person under the circumstances. <br /> <br /> You can hardly call it a SPOILER, but there are some dialogue extracts below. If you think reading ten lines of (ridiculous) dialogue will ruin your movie experience, STOP READ HERE. If you want a good laugh, keep reading. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was often so ridiculous that it was tragic. You want examples? Lots of those in 'Nine Lives'. <br /> <br /> EXAMPLE 1: <br /> <br /> Picture this. Couple visits their dirty rich friends in their new home. Woman sees this castle from a house and tells her husband: <br /> <br /> Woman: I can get used to it (which means the expensive house). Man: Don't. Woman: Why not? It could be. Man: No. They are who they are and we are who we are. Woman: I like the sound of it - we are who we are. <br /> <br /> Does she like the sound of it? Her husband is like a push, but she likes the sound of it. Then an elderly couple walks past them with hands. So the woman arrives: <br /> <br /> Woman: Look! They are like children after school. They lived so much. It shared everything. I love you. <br /> <br /> Are they like kids after school? And then the most overused clich√© lines you've ever heard? Finishing with "I love you"? She says this while her husband is a while for her? Yes, very logical, very realistic, NOT. If anything, this kind of dialogue made me falter, some of the characters in the movie say these terrible, horrible things. <br /> <br /> EXAMPLE 2: <br /> <br /> Elderly mother, father and younger daughter at a funeral. Dad: I didn't realize Andrew was religious. Mom: It's for comfort. Daughter: It's for power. Mom: Life is fleeting. Dad and daughter BURST OUT LAUGHING. <br /> <br /> Yes, this one-liner breaks me anytime, especially at a funeral! Sorry, I've missed the joke here. <br /> <br /> And it goes on and on .... <br /> <br /> How's the camera working? Don't go there first. Boring would be a compliment. It would be supposed to be 'realistic'; Instead, you miss half of the actors' facial expressions (the only thing still to be in this movie), while half the time the camera is aimed at someone's back or side rather than the face. <br /> <br /> Conclusion? Well, don't say I didn't warn you! It's a good movie to rent if you want to make a movie or date with your date, because you won't even mind playing the movie after the first five minutes or not. <br /> <br /> Overestimating and getting boring than seeing grass becomes just as good.
