I can't remember the last time a movie was so boring that I walked out. The weatherman and the island were both so bad that I thought about it, but I even stayed to the end. This movie was incomprehensible, not funny and just went on and on. Like some other commentators, I wondered if parts were just French humor I didn't get or if the characters were serious. I finally just gave up and tried to sleep because I didn't want to disturb my husband if he enjoyed it, but he noticed and let me know that it was OK if I wanted to go and we got it. He wants to know how it ended ... if Denevue lived or died ... (I don't even care).
