Another legally crippled and senseless low-budget sci-fi TV show ?? but actually its kind of amusing ?? kind of ?? in a fitting, indescribable way. Am I soft? I don't know why they come up with these titles. Yes, there is a komodo. And yes, there is a cobra. But what is the deal with 'versus' in between? Sure they come to blow? In only two rows (one revival of an incident and the other is the dodgy climax) and rather boring exchanges I can add. The emergence is the same old routine of a scientific experiment that comes to an end on a secluded island (no dinosaurs left), and some innocent bystanders (environmentalists who want to avoid animal testing) are trapped there. It sees a komodo dragon and cobra being massively in statue with the government that will soon destroy any kind of evidence (including witnesses) of its existence by blowing up the island. So let it race the survivors against time to find a way. The prominent staples consisted of horrible video game CGI, hack script, some dingy sets (although the tropical island environment was easy on the eyes), throwing characters (but I found the performances turned up), lifeless toughness (that's for somehow used to use the same repetitive shot of the victim, just stand there in the scare which means i wait, eat me now, i'm not going anywhere and finally they are completely swallowed? It seems that you are always a second gulp to cut them off or just to spare them by dumb pressure and a very hysterical edge with some ominous message among surviving deeds. Director Jim Wynorski is always on cruise control. Michael Par√© is delighted with his turbulent talks and Michelle Borth added much-needed sparks. Renee Talbert is also very successful there.
