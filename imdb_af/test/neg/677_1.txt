It is by far the most lethal, idiotic, frenzied silly scene ever in the air, and it comes from someone who remembers "San Pedro Beach Bums". <br /> <br /> My wife likes to watch reality shows. - and there was one episode of this drift where the wannabes had to develop. The end result was straight from the sketch of Monty Python's "Ministry of Silly Walks" sketch. I couldn't laugh hard enough. <br /> <br /> And then there is the ubiquitous Mrs Banks (as in all the way to the ... laugh). She has to be the most annoying self-serving woman on TV, as Rosie O'Donnell has left "The View". As if modeling did great things for man. Please. I have never found her attractive, and I do not find her now intelligent, because she has the gentleness to open her mouth. Someone should tell these human hangers to eat a healthy diet and actually look like real women.
