Is it supposed to be serious? I hope not. It's one of the most pathetic hilarious movies I've ever seen. Because I chose it for a buck on the "Bad movies" shelf, it certainly lives up to its place in the store. What can I say, the gore effects are splashed all over the place (pun intended), some really look real, some look like a teddy bear who had a bottle of tomato sauce accidentally. The music is one of the most terrible things I've heard, the acting is one of the most beautiful elements ... should I continue? Don't bother unless you've seen all the other pathetic horror movies in the store and that's all that's left.
