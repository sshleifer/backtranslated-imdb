This is a terrible repetition of the French movie Ma Vie en Rose (http://imdb.com/title/tt0119590/). The only scenario I can imagine in what someone (Sinise?! Assets?! Butler?! What were they thinking !?) agreed to be associated with it, MacLaine, who sees the original, is justly impressed and " a friend (with no writing credits - or talent! - by his name) to translate the themes for American audiences - whoever they agreed, is stupid, stupid, stupid. Then she encouraged other friends to sign up, and they did it as friends - certainly not on the merits of this pathetically-confronted, all-but-kitchen-sink-writing. <br /> <br /> I'm not a knee-jerk fan of the French movie, but Ma Vie and Rose are a subtle, thoughtful and thought-provoking treatment of sensitive cultural issues. I would like to see it become a greater exposure among English-speaking audiences - and if that means an American repetition, it is. But puh-leeze! a little respect for the issues AND the intelligence of the audience - and better direction for the actors, who could not decide whether they worked for Tennessee Williams or Jerry Lewis!
