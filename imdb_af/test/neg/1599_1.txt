It is supposed to be the story of the life of a man named Wirey Spindell from age 8 to 36, telling in the narrative by the character at every age point in his life. For example, if he is eight, it is the eight-year-old's voice that does the narrative; when in the junior high, it is the one who does the narrative, etc. It's about the only interesting thing about this movie. It seems that every actor playing Wirey is a distinct character. Not only do they look like, their life experiences don't seem to meet them. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like a bad cold.
