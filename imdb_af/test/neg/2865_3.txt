I enjoyed many movies by Gerard Depardieu and expect me to enjoy this movie a lot more than I did. The biggest reason was that I didn't find the movie very interesting or funny, so it didn't interest me. Also, although he does not sleep with his head daughter, the idea is that she is lying by telling everyone that he is older, but just icky! Yes, I know there is no incest and I know that no one around them knows he's really her father, but I found that any child left her father because her sexual paramour is too yucky and the movie isn't really funny . In addition, I really didn't really love this little brat. Apart from her lies, she was very ill and self-centered. I would have preferred if she somehow got her "coming-up" and somehow punished, because I just didn't like her.
