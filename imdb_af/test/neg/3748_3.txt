First of all, if you want to make a good movie, don't bump your exhibit in the last 10 minutes. The viewer is expected to be confused for almost two hours, just to explain Margo's father very late in the film. To make matters worse, the scriptwriter decided it wasn't enough to solve the basic riddle, but added in a completely unnecessary murder we didn't know (Alex's dad!). <br /> <br /> There are some serious motivational issues with characters as well. Margo's dad's choices don't seem sensible if the movie is over. Why didn't he kill Philippe's dad and do that? Instead, a complicated plot to obscure the truth is concentrated, but one that ensures that everyone will be physically obstructed for years (including the completely innocent photographer murdered by Philippe's father's murderers). Although Alex is a doctor (one would think is relatively bright), he chooses to flee the police, endangering not only his own life but those in a nasty pose. highway. Why was Margo's friend so keen to keep her promise to Margo as soon as the crap hit the fan for Alex? And are we thinking that Margo's father would rather kill him than go to jail? What about his wife? Did he consider her wishes? These are some of the main issues. <br /> <br /> Then there are nasty details, such as: why was her father there the night of her fake death? How did he get the kiss's body in a short while and quickly get back to bury it with the other two? Alex's friend Bruno seems in vain to be part of the chaos in which he and his friends have to kill Alex, despite the perceived guilt he owes to Alex to save his son's life. What good will Margo's photos do? They do not imply Philippe at all. And why would Margo have the wrench useful to her that night, would kidnappers be taking? Did I miss other things? Probably. Minor irritations from me include the fact that while Alex is a doctor, he smokes like an enemy. This made his marathon run even more impressive by the police. Also, when driving in the convertible with his lawyer, they do not wear a seat belt. How clear can they be?
