The Mama's Curse is the latest in the series of Kharis mummy films, and it seems that creativity has gone a little dry by the time they made this one. Kharis and his mother, Ananka, end up in the Bayou or Louisiana, and on his resurrection he is looking for his beloved princess. How they end up in Louisiana is not becoming quite clear, but with many people trying to find them, the viewer can be assured of a few mummies. <br /> <br /> The Mama's Curse was vigilant, but it really wasn't. It's nothing special. I had the feeling in the movie I saw it before. Honestly, apart from the original The Mummy with Boris Karloff, the Mummy movies are not my favorites under the old Universal horrors. They are not bad, but they get a bit repetitive. <br /> <br /> There are some big scenes in the movie (the scene with Ananka, for example, coming in the swamp), but overall it hasn't. do a lot for me. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing if you want to be the best and see all the mummy movies, but otherwise you might want to surrender this one.
