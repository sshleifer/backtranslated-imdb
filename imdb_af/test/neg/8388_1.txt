To date, it's still the worst piece of garbage I've ever seen. So bad, I even complained to Blockbuster to hold it on the stocking. Some friends and I hired it after thinking about the back cover that we were in a good horror movie. The plot line seems to change during the film and there was a lot of irrelevant wrist work. The movie ends pretty suddenly, I suspect they ran out of film. Sound quality was severe and the first female character had a very thick Spanish accent, although she was extremely unclear in any case. The man gave a brief bit of eyebrow to his bizarre attempts to kill. After throwing in depth discussions about the workshop and his numerous power tools, he decided to put a plastic bag over her head. In short, with the second thought, I think you should see this movie to actually believe it exists.
