OK, I wanted to see it because it had some good reviews, but this movie was terrible ... Just awful. The characters were 1 dimensional and nothing the actors could do could breathe any life in them. The story was uncomfortable ... The wind ceased to be a plotter halfway. It's just forgotten. The visuals while cool, were so drawn out ... 5 minutes from a man crawling on the ground, 3 minutes from a girl sitting on her makeup. I don't know what this guy is trying to pull off ... it's like he had no plot with no dialogue and the movie just had to run so we couldn't change scenes. Foreign films are great for creating a story without using a lot of dialogue, this movie makes me think there is no way to ever do American cinema. I want to stop watching movies completely ... Bad Bad Movie!
