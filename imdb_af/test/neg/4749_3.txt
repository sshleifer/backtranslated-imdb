I was only fourteen when I saw the Alien movies for the first time and I immediately came to love it. Original, scary and classic. Sigourney Weaver was the perfect choice for the female hero character and she would have earned a statue for her act. In 1979 something was born forever as the immortal series continued with no less legendary film than the first. Alien3 was a different point of view, but I think this part was the most stressful and unique of all, it was my favorite. Unfortunately, the latter was a failure in several ways. It was tense, illogical with full meaningless carnage. I didn't like it at all, but I never thought a worse part would ever be made in the future. Well, as it turned out in 2004, I was wrong. Alien vs. Predator was a bad break, and it had to be appointed by a more talented director or never had to be made. But when I saw Alien vs. Predator Requiem, I was totally shocked. When I sat down and decided to look it over, I never even thought that such a bad movie could be made. Without a script, without a director and without actors, I don't understand how a movie can be made. Because this movie misses these three terms. What you get is a nice bloodshed without a story, but with many annoying and boring dialogues. Waste of money and waste of time. This movie is rather impudence, as honor to the fans of both sides (Alien / Predator). Shame!
