I have a lot of respect for Mr. Argento's work, but this film does not have many of the features that make his films really unique. The opening of the movie is great, and set you up for the possibility of a very scary horror movie. As far as the rest of the film is concerned, there is no structure or purpose and does not build much. However, there are good achievements, and lots of atmosphere. The end of the movie is poor considering everything it builds up. Where there is a large climax of large proportions, you rather get a very typical conclusion that too many other bad horror movies are used, and make them feel like they just needed to wrap them up. A few scenes are very memorable for their images, but eventually the film doesn't laugh at making a very good movie. Unless you feel you have to see everything that this director did, I suggest you surrender this one ...
