This is another Sci-Fi channel original movie staring Rhys Davies, where it is difficult to decide what is worse, acting, or writing / directing / producing (John Sheppherd helmets all three.) Basic story: Obsessed exobologist catch chubakabra monster, smuggle it into a container aboard a vessel escape and start the massacre. Clich√©d sci fi cast from the solid captain with the beautiful daughter, handsome hero and mad scientist. Captian calls in a terrorist warning for the ship (since of course would not believe a monster story.) No dramatic helicopter drop from the navy seals here. Budget is only allowed for a full power of eight stamps to get into a fiberglass fishing boat and to drive a ship's ship. Puleeze. Also cheese computer animation of the ship you can do better on your computer. I also loved when the Seal Commander glanced through standard ten-mile binoculars, saw three people coming off the ship. If the Sci-Fi channel continues to be original movies, I hope they realize the audience is not nursery school and buy better scripts and directors. If it was live on video, you would find it in the 99 cents bin.
