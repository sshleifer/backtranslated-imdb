If this movie was just outrageously, it would be good, the problem is that it is very serious. To make it short, a few points: <br /> <br /> - There is no story, no focus, no lead whatsoever and all the questions asked fail to find an answer. Overall, the film is extremely repetitive and boring (I've stayed in Africa several times, and has all the urgent need for local misery and hopelessness to watch but still no sense). <br /> <br /> - Questions raised are pure manipulation and the truth is that they are no questions, but statements. <br /> <br /> - I'm not a doc filmmaker, but what is the point, for example, to remedy the weapon smuggling, if the only element brought to the audience is a local reporter's statement? The director didn't even bother to show us at least a sequence where he would wait near the airport to leave heavily loaded trucks, leaving the area just after a plane landed. <br /> <br /> - The story of the fish takes up less than 5 mn, and is only supported by a sequence where the director films a documentary document shown at a local conference. Did this guy do any work ???? <br /> <br /> - Objective poverty is being shown all the time in endless rows, but where is the point? One can go almost anywhere in Africa with a hand camera and unfortunately shoot the same images. Where's the big news? <br /> <br /> - Filming of prostitutes to watch and cry about images of their murdered friend and co-prostitute is worth the worst emotional manipulations they can see today on a thunder and real TV. <br /> <br /> - The parallel between the famine that devastates the country with more than two million famines and fish exports is absolutely useless, dishonest and doesn't make sense, but viewers in typical anti-globalization and manipulate anti-Western feelings. <br /> <br /> There is an interesting debate in France after an academic published a very detailed commentary on the film, which for many years brought journalists into Africa to explore a little further on various details. It seems that: <br /> <br /> - Sun-dried fish waste collected by some local people is not supposed to be eaten by humans, but is being collected for pretty good money for animal feed purposes. I think I'm not the only one who had the impression that the director suggested the exact opposite. <br /> <br /> - Smuggling is a reality (but again, where is the big news?), but not how this film explains the matter. If the empty planes that land in Mwanza land in smuggling, they actually load their consignment to another location in Africa, then go to Mwanza to pick up fish not to leave the voyage empty (meaning they actually land empty is Mwanza ...). People eat local fish, as opposed to what the film suggests (about 40-60% of what is taken from the lake) and thousands of people live with it. Good for them! It is a private enterprise of the kind that will one day take African countries out of poverty and not Western groans and endless foreign aid. <br /> <br /> I can't tell how shocked I see the success of this movie!
