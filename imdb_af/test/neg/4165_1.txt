I was initially excited about this movie and expected it to be a combination of Equilibruim and Farenheit 451. Unfortunately, I was constantly disappointed by the lack of depth and interest of the plot and subplots. Halfway through the movie I played in the characters and played with the characters to prevent me from turning it off. I enjoyed the prospect of a future with merged cultures and separation of the seas and did not. What could be an art and intelligent look to the future is in a plodding, semantic sci-fi channel midnight movie with horrible plays, cheap sets and a final free shot of Tim Robbins vagina. Maybe he should stay with his socialist political ranting - it's been down since Shawshank.
