Well, Anne is far too old. Wentworth looks younger than she and he shouldn't. Louisa is too young and too happy Oh, sister, Mary, is too beautiful. She is supposed to be average, not pretty. When this actress is the way Maria complains, I just think she's too good to be a complainant. Lady Russell is too old. This is crazy. If you read the novel, she's Anne's older older friend, maybe as old as Annes's mother, who will be about 18-20 years older than Anne - about 50 NOTE 70! It's crazy, don't fit. How come Anne, is it so happy in the beginning? She smiled as she said, "Oh, the worst is over, I've seen him now, the worst has passed." Yes right. OK if someone saw the 1995 Roger Michell version you can't compare these two. That one is right on it. This one is far away. Read the novel and you will know what I mean.
