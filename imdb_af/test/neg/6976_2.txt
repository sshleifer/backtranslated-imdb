I agree with one commentator who says it's really impossible to review Glen or Glenda? objectively. In doing so, the film on its merits should be considered rather awful given the hilarious, intricate dialogue, generally mediocre to poor-acting by the cast as well as the zero-production values. Yet, such an assessment does not capture the absolutely sounding experience of watching this movie as it unfolds. This is not the fact that the subject of the film is transvestitism and that it was a controversial lifestyle choice in the 1950s. It is not even the plea for the tolerance of people embracing alternative life choices that are not just a historical relic. <br /> <br /> No, what makes Glen or Glenda? Another fascinating film after 50 years is that Ed Wood uncovered his psyche in a way that so-called author directors such as Hitchcock or Godard, in spite of their superior talents, never did. In Glen of Glenda, Wood is not afraid to reveal his own deep-faced feelings about a transvestite, despite the film's plea for tolerance. Indeed, the conclusion of the film suggests that Ed Wood's Glen character can "kill" his Glenda female counterpart by conveying the feelings of love and love. Glen has his wife for his future wife, Barbara. The psychiatrist even assures Glen and Barbara that Glen, as Glen makes the psychic transfer, will disappear. So, while Wood may be pleading for the tolerance of transvestites in general, he was not so sure about desiring it for himself. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, Wood was not afraid to throw anything else that went over his head. screen. He did this with whatever stock material he could get his hands on. If it didn't stand, so what? What the viewer saw in Glen of Glenda was especially Ed Wood's imaginative world in all its fundamental strangeness. <br /> <br /> The only comment I would like to make in my comment is that my two-star rating is based solely on the objective evaluation criteria mentioned in the first paragraph. The oddly memorable effect the movie has despite its technically horrible features I don't think can be pointed out.
