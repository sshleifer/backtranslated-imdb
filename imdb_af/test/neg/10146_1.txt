In my opinion of this movie the whole video part of this movie was absolutely messed up !! But the sound card used contains the music of a huge heavy metal rock band. I recognized the music as a band called Firstryke and the album was 'Just a Nightmare' and it was very well written !! and I'm curious to see what the rest of your movie buffs are out there, if I can remember that far, I'd appreciate the feedback, I am collecting old movie and obscure movie soundtracks. It is a very time-consuming hobby, but is very rewarding. I watched these bands selling music in Germany on the net for about fifty dollars per album. Not too bad, Hugh?
