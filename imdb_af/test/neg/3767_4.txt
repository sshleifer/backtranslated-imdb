Rocketship X-M should be seen by any serious movie buffalo for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) It's one of the first - and the few - movies not to have a happy ending. This is undoubtedly the effect in post-World War II America, if it were today, but the sadness ends with the message of the movie. <br /> <br /> 2) It is also one of the first movies to deal with space travel in a serious way, using space as a valid drama setting. Despite the lack of scientific background, the movie is on its own as dramatic. It is not so much a space radius as it is a drama in space. <br /> <br /> 3) The anti-nuclear war message is being delivered seriously which is not lost in sfx which is great locusts, men, or animals. The effect of the Martian society on nuclear destruction is strongly and honestly presented. The fact that survivors from the expedition land and as such cannot preach the lesson learned on Mars adds another element of sadness to the tragic end. <br /> <br /> Sterno says drive on Rocketship X-M.
