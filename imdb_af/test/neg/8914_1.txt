TDY is probably the only worst piece of trash to hit straight to the video selection. They take a play from The Order with Jean Claude Van Damme and it scares me because Van Damme is a personal favorite for B movie comedy. Segal has done a lot of good work in the past, but he has left a lot of books in my book and he will probably never stick out or be marked for death unless he is sitting down and a very good brain storming himself has. <br /> <br /> It also annoys me how he didn't do much of his own stunts as he did in previous films. To conclude all these things if you are prepared to see a movie suitable for a trash or woodcarrier, rent your death today.
