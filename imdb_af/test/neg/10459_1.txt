Like other posters, it was a very bad movie (keep it child-friendly). FX was low class, they had to spend $ 1 on a coke. As with this D-movie, most victims die and leave a mystery, except for one happy soul and, of course, the head. Hope the money for Boxleitner was worth it, really great, step down from Babel 5. Nice to see what happened to Buck Rogers, but damn it was even lower for him. "It was so bad and on the older actors you could even think they thought it was bad too. Don't watch. <br /> <br /> ***** Warning Spoiler below **** <br / > <br /> This thing has all cut down, it was afterwards and yet Boxlietner got away was pure BS and the end? How did the kids in hell come to him?
