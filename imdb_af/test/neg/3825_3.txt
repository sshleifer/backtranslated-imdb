This film was one of the first, from the 70-year-old women-in-prison genre. This movie was incredibly violent, with very sadistic torture inflicted on the prisoners. The film takes place in the Philippines, which looks like a terribly ugly country. The producers undoubtedly used this factor to their advantage to emphasize the gruesome situation in which the prisoners were. <br /> <br /> Blu-ray movie movie queen Pam Grier starred in this movie. She plays Blossom, an apostate who is thrown into the dirty women's prison, on trumpet charges. Her boyfriend, played by Sid Haig, is trying to save Blossom. He and Blossom are part of a political guerrilla faction, and Blossom's imprisonment is orchestrated by the corrupt, Philippine government. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier and Sid Haig stand out under the otherwise light role. The film itself places too much emphasis on violence against the prisoners. Their prisoners only used them as objects of their sadism. It has become boring really fast. This movie could use more interesting plot lines, and subtly. It's not one of Roger Corman's better pictures. The many women-in-prison films that this one followed were much better everywhere. I would recommend the Big Bird Cage, just for Pam Grier fans.
