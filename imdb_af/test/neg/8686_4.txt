Max Cash a charter boat captain who works from the Caribbean island of San Sebastian, is hired by Sarah. He is looking for a legendary boat, El Diablo and his stolen treasure that sank into the reef in the 17th century. But something seems to be protecting the ship's place, as people who knew about it were killed. <br /> <br /> I have to agree with those who were under the impression that this would be an abomination. Instead, we ended up with a low rent, b-grade late 80s, taking the deep-sea adventure movie 'The Deep' in 1977, but with astonishing supernatural origin and an injection of mystery. The story is an easy muddle (so many conflicting angles don't make a lick of sense and promote a speckled fit) and the technical side is clunky. Nice exotic location and underwater photography already. While the carefree performances were not bad either. A horror Wayne Crawford is nice face and June Chadwick is right next to him. Sheri Able is pretty much eye candy. There are some bizarre developments that entertain and one or two evil rows. However, there is a real lack of cohesion. Most of the deaths die on screen, except for the bloody, fit opening death done by something unseen. Again, just something that leaves you high and dry. The music is generic with its dark clues to warn us of getting impending danger and the POV shots are working out well. Tatty, but viewable.
