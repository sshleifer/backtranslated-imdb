The Monkeys "Head" is one of those peculiar phenomena I have noticed - that when something doesn't make sense, people will try to read things in it and give it very deep meanings, which their creator never meant. This is the case here. <br /> <br /> The movie is a stream-of-conscious spectacle of The Monkees featuring in and out of various sketches, blackouts, pieces, etc. Like those on their TV show. But while the TV show was playing for the laugh, it doesn't look like anything other than a kind of deep, trippy, pseudo-intellectual state that yields this brand of psychedelia. All in all, it's The Monkees doing the same sktick, but now it's "raising awareness" because the lag track is being removed. There is no sense of humor or meaning to the whole thing; it just drank with colored lights. <br /> <br /> The music in "Head" should prove to anyone, beyond the shadow of doubt, that the Monkeys did not have a scrap of songwriting. The songs are mostly rubbish; The only one that is even listenable is "Porpoise Song", which opens and closes the movie. But the thing is, it was a Gerry Goffin-Carole King song, and while being above average for the Monkeys, it is below average by Goffin and King standards. It's like hearing one of the old Peter And Gordon songs Paul McCartney wrote for them. You might think it's a nice song, but then you find out what it has composed and you realize it's a throw away. Mike Nesmith's song may be acceptable, the rest is worthless. Davy Jones, I think, suggested the filmmakers as the "big number" in the picture, as it is the only song that Show Biz is presented and not cut into a movie montage or dream sequence, but it also falls flat because the song is not good. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I've always kept the Monkeys, so the movie is a real disappointment. Sure, they were cheese, but they were so happy about it. <br /> <br /> They knew they were cheesy and they were cool with it. But then they became ambitious. In "Head", they actually joke to be a manufactured puppet, but the truth is, they wanted something more. They wanted to be great musicians and taken seriously as artists. Maybe not like the Beatles, but something that approaches it. "Head" proves that they failed at all points. 1 * out of 4
