Plodding, maybe it should have been the title. Bad dialogue delivered in a snail's pace. All the characters are one dimension except one. Unfortunately, the character has some of the worst lines and doesn't look like this clich√©-ridden two-hour drag. This film grew in the 1970s, lacking in detail, atmosphere and authenticity. Surprisingly, it was manufactured by Kelsey Grammar, someone who has to recognize a sharp dialogue and a consistent story in a script. Cameron Richardson is about the only element that relieves this movie. Robin Trower's music is also a welcome addition.
