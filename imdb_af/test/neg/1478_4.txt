Nevertheless, I seem to be the only person on the planet Earth who is able to criticize Japanese films before 1970. "Fires on the Flats" (1959) is another in the seemingly endless line of "classic" that gets all sorts of praise for no apparent good reason. As much as I love to generate all these idols and psychoanalysis, which has such an abominable taste in film, it is almost impossible to rationalize why anyone would ever think poorly crafted fluff like this is a kind of "masterpiece" "must be proclaimed. What I find really ironic is that fans of "classic" derivatives such as "Brande op de Vlakte" focus so much on "inside the box" movie-up (orthodox grading standards such as writing, acting, camera work, etc.) always seem to The highly revered "classic" most flawed in these many standards. For example, one of the laziest copouts for a movie maker involves forced verbal exposition where characters basically explain everything to the viewer, even when the constructed scenario is completely artificial. Surprisingly, the first scene in "Fires on the Plain" uses these indolent tactics to the limit. <br /> <br /> After a funny head bang, the next useless dialogue strikes the viewer: "Why can't you? We landed in the west under heavy fire to strengthen units at Tacloban. We have two-thirds Our artillery was sunk in transit, we tried to reach the Burauen airport by crossing the central mountains, but without artillery it was impossible, and the enemy's counter-attack forced a fanout over the valley. You know it. "So why exactly is one character telling another character what he already knows? Oh yes, that's right, the creators of this movie are too lazy to think of more natural ways to communicate this information. You see, a quality movie will actually show that these events are happening, or at worst it will involve a dialogue that includes one character that has no knowledge of those events. Heck, even an opening summary in viewer-shaped paragraph form, would have been better than shown here. <br /> <br /> Such poor quality film production cases are maintained throughout "Fires on the Level". where this movie feels it was written by imbeciles for imbeciles. For example, the main character stumbles on some skeletons wrapped in Japanese clothes. Instead of the natural thing like? o I don't know ?? To give a depressing way, the character darkens "Japanese soldiers." Thank you friend, but I could have found that one for myself. <br /> <br /> Worse still, this movie is saturated with overstatement. The most ridiculous scene involves a few boots. Suggest this. A soldier walks along and finds some worn boots. One would think such a find is completely useless, but it seems that the soldier's boots are in a worse condition, so he picks up the worn boots and leaves his SUPER-worn boots behind. All right, I got the point. The soldiers are in rough form ?? A fact that has already been highlighted with their worn boots to begin with. The scene is ridiculous, but I was ready to let it go until the second soldier came! You see, he finds the previous soldier's SUPER worn boots and notifications ?? get ready, because here it comes? that his boots are SUPER DUPER-worn boots! Lucky man, he picks up the SUPER-worn boots and leaves his SUPER DUPER staves behind. But you see, it's not all? because the THIRD soldier then arrives! He finds the previous soldiers SUPER DUPER worn boots and inspects them, along with his own SUPER DUPER worn boots. Since both pairs suck, he puts them both aside and smiles as he goes barefoot. At this stage I was ready to throw my television through my living room window. The heavy craftiness, over-rhythm, and the main absurdity of this series is beyond the bad movie. This is SUPER DUPER bad movie-up. <br /> <br /> There are a number of similar, completely silly moments to have. Like the time when the main character asks someone, "Hey, are you dead?" As the man will answer "Yes" if he kicks the bucket. I will also be the first to condemn the under-performance of the lead actor, who is the distinctive poster child for artificial reaction. I laughed hard at the opening, where his headgear was back in place with this stupid, goofy expression on his face. <br /> <br /> The fact that this trivial fluff piece gets an 8.4DDb average score while a certifiable masterpiece such as "Two Sisters Languages" (2003) only gets a 7.5 is the height of mass stupidity. And to think that some people are actually deceiving themselves into thinking that "AToTS" doesn't make sense. Well, not every movie can have absolutely outrageous SUPER DUPER worn boots on its side.
