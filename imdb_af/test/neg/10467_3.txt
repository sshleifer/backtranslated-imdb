Now before I tell you the synopsis, it's a non-spoiler review. Bone Eater's point is to be the worst movie of the year. I don't know how these movies come on DVD. If I saw it in theaters, I would be very upset. Bone Eater is about these people digging an old cemetery and finding legs. It's the Bone Eater and the more legs he eats, the more powerful he gets. <br /> <br /> First, I thought well, the DVD artwork looks slim and it sounds screaming. When I rented it and watched the DVD label, it was scary. But when I played it, I could agree on one thing. The title 'Bone Eater' is better than the movie itself. Tell me what's stupid? A legter who just attacked by throwing a leg, ate you and you disappeared? Don't worry, it's not a spoiler, you see it happens in the first 5 minutes. Or is it more stupid that 'Bone Eater' has a horse? You know what I think is the stupidest thing? The whole movie. <br /> <br /> The CGI is terrible. Yes, I thought the idea of ​​'Bone Eater' was creepy, but once you see the real thing you think, it's a kind of action movie or just a cruel, mean joke. The movie felt longer than Titanic and it was half an hour. Once the film has its moments of tension, it just stops. I admit that the acting was not the best, but was actually decent and the violence was not over, but everything is a stinker. <br /> <br /> Overall Bone Eater is a movie that you can oversee. If you want interesting movies with good creatures, CGI, and 'Bone Eater' is a movie to skip. If you like bad movies, no matter how cute it is, then 'Bone Eater' will meet.
