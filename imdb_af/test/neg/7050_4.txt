I haven't seen it in many years. The acting was as good as I started this time, I thought, "Great! Another movie that I have condemned as a foolish young man." But then the theme became clear and I felt the same way. <br /> <br /> It was Hollywood, the chair of shine; so the concept shouldn't be a surprise. But it's so transient a concept I feel like I have to shower after watching it. In short, it tells us that even physically ugly people look beautiful and even attractive to each other. <br /> <br /> Dorothy McGuire is like the domestic heroine. She seems to be filmed wearing minimal makeup. Robert Young was injured and feels scarce in the war. His parents also can't bear to look at him. He looks as though he has all his faculties, and partly the concepts of disability are obsolete. <br /> <br /> Herbert Marshall is on hand as a blind pianist. His character speaks is silence and is omniscient. <br /> <br /> The best performance is provided by Mildred Natwick as the title house owner. She is bitter and dour but not made of ice cream. Her story is much more interesting and credible than that of McGuire and Young.
