I recently watched many Asian horror movies, but this one has to be the worst so far. It started off interesting enough, but lost the momentum after the first 15 minutes of the movie. The additional "drama" scenes, flashback series and serious plot holes made me hang out. What really happened in the tunnel? Just "something terrible" ??? Who started the murder if it wasn't the ghost? What did she want back to her ????? No answers whatsoever! Overall, not frightening at all and the filmmakers have to come up with much better ideas on this ... <br /> <br /> One positive was the cute actress, but it's about it. <br /> Not recommended.
