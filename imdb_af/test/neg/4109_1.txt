I wish I could use the time travel machine to jump back to the moment I considered watching this movie and instead making other plans. I saw a free view of a thunder sound, so I can't complain about the prize, but I wish I could pay back 103 minutes. The acting was mediocre and the special effects were deplorable. People shouldn't make movies about dinosaurs if they can't afford to make the prehistoric creatures as good or better as those in Jurassic Park. Spielberg spoiled us. Edward Burns as Travis Ryer was the only saving grace of the movie. I noticed that women under the age of 18 are the movie's highest, and the only explanation is that they've been beating Burns all the time. The entire long 103 minutes. This movie had to be over in about 80 minutes. It just dragged on and on. Don't waste your time or money on this rushed movie.
