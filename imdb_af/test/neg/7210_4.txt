This in-name only sequel to the classic ROADHOUSE has a DEA agent (John Schaech) to save his uncle (Will Patton), when the uncle is beaten by a local drug addict, led by that Wood Indian actor Jake Busey. The gang wants to take over the poor man's bar for ominous reasons. Patrick Swayze is greatly missed here. Schaech is an indifferent actor and not convincing as an asshole judge. The battles here are intermittent and not as strong or fierce as the fights in ROADHOUSE. The final is equally weak. Some beautiful women keep things down for a bit. There is a tremendous battle between a Daisy Duke type that seems to be useful with both fists and weapons, and a nasty babe Busey who is handy with sharp implements. There is also a thinly dressed gal who is a co-agent of Schaech's, but unfortunately she never comes back into the movie. Sorry. She did a short lap dance for Schaech who enjoyed my full attention. If there is nothing else, ROADHOUSE 2 will come with a strip club scene that comes close to what a real strip club looks like, a rare circumstance in any movie. The rest is snooze time.
