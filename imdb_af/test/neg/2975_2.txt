Okay, so I'm Singapore and I want to say it's time to stop stereotyping Singapore and making movies. Some of the actors / actresses actually have talent, but unfortunately it is not shown much in this movie. I rushed into my seat when I saw it, and when my parents were quite young, I dragged myself to see it. Honestly I can say I'm going to fall asleep. And there was this arrogant western boy who came just to my nerves. Overall a boring movie, and a general waste of actors' talent. I've seen better Singapore movies than this. Chicken war was good. However, I can't believe this one will be considered a better Singapore movie. Sorry, I wouldn't recommend it.
