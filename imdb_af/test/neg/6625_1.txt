That's what they did for the first feature film of the comic comedy Carrot Top. <br /> <br /> A stray surfer (root child) inherits an old kahuna R&D company (Jack Warden). Things are less than swimming, but are getting worse when the company is threatened with a hostile takeover bid by corrupt corporate raiders. The most indisputable thing about this movie is that this girl, Courtney Thorne-Smith, will find this redhead stepchild in the least (but then he inherited millions). 'Classic' moments include the comic Larry Miller who drinks sweat from a plastic cup. <br /> <br /> Funny comedy? Try UN funny toilet humor, and that's exactly where it belongs - in the toilet ... rinse twice.
