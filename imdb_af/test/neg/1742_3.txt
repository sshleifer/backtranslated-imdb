I thought it was weird and just sorry, not scary. I saw some of the Japanese horror movies, Ringu and Juon, and loved them; but this movie was a disappointment. It has never explained anything about the curse. I just didn't see any horror. That didn't scare me at all. All the time I watched I wait for Kirie to discover the secret of the curse and why it happened now. If it were some old curses, didn't it happen before Shuichi's father? And that never told us what happened to her father. I was waiting for someone to tell us the meaning or reasoning behind this curse and then it just ended. I was very disappointed.
