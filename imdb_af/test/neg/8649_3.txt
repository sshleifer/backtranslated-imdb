If it is film noir, noir should be French for glacier slow. Take a throw of totally untouchable characters, give them nothing to say, sign the whole thing with free ultra-violence, and you have the formula for a worse Dash. Can be subtitled. "Sleazy Hollywood types are trying to make money out of Chinatown rip-off." Bruce Dern's one-minute part is better organized than anything else in this movie. By the way, I didn't like the movie.
