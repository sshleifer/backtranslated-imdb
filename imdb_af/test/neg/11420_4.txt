There are rumors that a fourth Underworld is going to happen. If so, the third part, which is also a prequel, will be in the middle of the franchise. With prequels that pass the original movies, you always ask yourself in what order you should watch the movies, so it makes sense ... <br /> <br /> In this case, I don't think it matters much. The third Underworld movie is not the same as the other two. They also had their obvious flaws, but this one does not have a few things and it feels like a cash. It doesn't seem like a full acceleration, it's a pity because the actors probably could use better material to work with. <br /> <br /> The story is good, but it's nothing special. A nice movie, but Rhona Mitra couldn't fill the shoes of Beckinsale (yes she plays a different character, I mean the void, that Kate B. left) ...
