Esther Williams plays a romantic unattached water ski secretary who longs to stop running on the water and to be a man's wife; From Johnson and Tony Martin are her potential choices for a man. Despite fine aquatic rows filmed at Florida's Cypress Gardens, this romantic comedy is outdated. As it is launched by director Charles Walters, everything here is deliberately rendered harmless, which does not teach the picture. Even Esther's great moments in the water are not quite to the surprising leaps of her other swimming vehicles, although they are preferably on the side of the men, both of which are colorless. Carroll Baker, in her film debut as Martin's unlucky ex-girlfriend, is the liveliest of the bunch. Soon things, indeed. * 1/2 of ****
