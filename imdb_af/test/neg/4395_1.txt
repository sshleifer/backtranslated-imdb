Worthless film. An utter waste of time and nothing I expected to be. The packaging makes it look like the American Pie genre (it's not). rather, it is a ridiculous queue with coincidences that seem more like a writing exercise. (Let's try to see how many mix ups we can write to make a bad SNL shit into a full length presentation). What is remarkable is that the director (based on their comments on the DVD) takes himself seriously. I was a big fan of the movies that Nasionale Lampoon left his name, up to and including Van Wilder. With this one I feel completely deceived. In fact, I feel DUPED. I was expecting a Van Wilder like a farce to relive my college days, but instead it was an hour and a half rubbish. What leads to my ultimately unfulfilled expectations? Well, to start with, the fact that the cast remains naked (with an enormous sausage to be covered) on the cover of the DVD. Add the images to the back of the story as well as the description and you mislead people into thinking it is a movie it is not. To make matters worse, the movie begins as it can be expected with half-naked drunken students, without trying a stunt, but it has nothing to do with the movie. In fact, I didn't even realize that the people in that opening series probably had to be the characters in the movie until I was told by the directors in the comment. Don't get me wrong, I love plot twists and are surprised by movies, but I hate the fact that this movie is trying to break it down as something it isn't. Ultimately, it itself makes a great disservice (artistic, but probably not financial) because it puts its audience on confusion and disappointment simply because it fails to deliver what it advertises. <br /> <br /> In short, do not rent this movie based on what you see on the case. It's not your usual National Lampoon movie. The only thing that is funny is the fact that many of the actors have appeared in other movies and TV shows that make their engagement here entertaining.
