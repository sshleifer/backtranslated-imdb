I was very disappointed in this movie. The director, in his other efforts, showed many talents, but it was just filler. There may have been a profound meaning to it, but it seems to me nothing more than a director who has access to some toys. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend his other works to people, but certainly not this one. As I watched it, I kept thinking that it would pick up after an initial slow period, but it never did. At the end of the film I was not entertained in a new way. I could only say to myself, "What was that?" <br /> <br /> There were some very striking parts of the movie, but not enough to fix it again.
