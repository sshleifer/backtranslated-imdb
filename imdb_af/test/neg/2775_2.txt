It is a cheap-o-film made by Al Adamson - a man who may have been the worst movie maker ever - possibly even worse than Ed Wood, Jr. Adamson has in the 60's, 70's and 80's and with such titles as FIVE BLOOD GRAVES, HELL'S BLOODY DEVILS, SATAN'S SADISTS and LASH OF LUST it goes without saying that he didn't make Shakespeare !! His movies all have rotten production values, sensations, gore and amateur acting. <br /> <br /> Here in BLUE OF BLOOD, several supplies of Adamson actors (such as his wife, Regina Carrol, Zandor Vorkov and Angelo Rossitto) are the ride and appeared in Adamson's previous film, Dracula VERSUS FRANKENSTEIN. It is fortunate because the previous movie was so horrible and so poorly executed on every level that BRAIN OF BLOOD can't help but looks good! Certainly, the makeup is laughable, the plot stupid (it involves the ubiquitous brain transplant scheme) and acting is level Z, but it's even better than their last movie! <br /> <br /> The only positive thing about this movie is that aging supporting actor, midget Angelo Rossitto actually had a better part than usual - with more dialogue and more important role in the plot - and there is actually some degree of danger and tension at times. As for Ms Carrol, she still looks like a stripper and the rest of the scroll slipped through this silly movie. However, it's bad enough that it makes a good look for bad movie friends - you just have to look up the man with sour burns as well as the jet gun that is made out of an old tail light!
