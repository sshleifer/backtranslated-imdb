My mom and I rented this movie. I mean, we love those kind of Sci-Fi flicks, whether they're big Hollywood movie or Indy movie. <br /> <br /> But oh we were deceived !! Two journalists are investigating a UFO kidnapping in a small Texas town. Halfway through, all the sudden things all get Christain on us. My mother and I believe in God and Jesus and the Devil, but the way this movie preached it made it annoying. All I really have to say is that we are Christian, but even we want to have fun. So don't blame Christians as a whole, just blame the Christians who have to struggle with this movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, you can clearly understand the directors' attitude to UFOs, and that is, he believes it's all demonic. Now I can say a few words, but I won't. All I will say is that it doesn't see this movie unless you feel preached. In fact, many times it says that we must be perfect to enter heaven. Well, the last time I checked in, the only perfect person died on a cross.
