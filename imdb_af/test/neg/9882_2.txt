The only reason I didn't delete this movie after 20 minutes is because we've been wasting it for 20 minutes ... <br /> <br /> the only one and I repeat the ANY effect they've used is " a strange cape (from India?) Jump on a half-meter wall / trash can, I mean, effects don't make a movie, but ... sheesh .... me and my friend hoped the whole movie for any real effect (a great wolf? something!?>!?!) but noooooooooooooooo ... everything we have is a leap! On a 0.5 meter wall + did they use pharmacies ... and they found guns?! in the pharmacy?! I mean what hell? Oh I forgot, there was another effect - contact lances as green eyes! every 10 minutes we shouted: "The only thing that can save the film of shame is a giant wolf that kills them all! In addition, the writing was so terrible that you didn't know who you were going to die first. pray (and I mean BID!) that the "good?" guy will hopefully die in the beginning. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favor and send letters to remove the movie from every archive in the world .
