(Note: multiple spoilers) <br /> <br /> Someday, a post-apocalyptic film is being made that doesn't stink. Unfortunately, the POSTMAN is not that movie, although I have to give it a try. <br /> <br /> Kevin Costner plays someone credited only as the "Postman". He is not a postman, just a wandering mule in the wilderness of a Western America destroyed by some unspecified disasters. He deals with isolated villages through Shakespeare. Suddenly, a band of bandits put down the Holocaust, the self-declared warriors of the West, in a town visited by Costner, and their evil leader, General Bethlehem (Will Patton), attracts Costner. After many misery and numerous attempts to break Costner's mind, he escaped, thus ending a long section of the movie that could better tell in a three-minute glance. <br /> <br /> Finally we get the major premise: the escaped Costner finds a deserted truck and delivers the letters to the nearest village and hopes to get food under pretext to be a postman. A number of townspeople led by young Ford (Larenz Tate) want to come into this postman act, which doesn't sit well with Bethlehem and his bandits, and Costner finds himself the ignorant and unwilling leader of a group of postmasters in the war. with the Holniste. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​The Postmen versus The Bad Guys is not as ridiculous as it sounds. The Holocaust depends on their livelihoods on the fact that the villages on which they are planted are separated from each other; The Holocaust can destroy one village, but cannot unite against all their victims. To unite, the villages have to communicate with each other, and a work station system will therefore be a big step to putting the Holocaust out of business. So it makes sense that Bethlehem will get medieval on our heroic post carriers. Unfortunately, the ultimate defeat of Bethlehem is not the result of the villages uniting him, but rather your old standby cliché, the one-on-one noise between him and Costner. There is also no real effort by the communities to use the post to work together to solve their problems; all the mail looks like the standard "Hi, aunt Debbie" toy for maximum sentimental value. <br /> <br /> The POSTMAN is one of the predictable movies I've ever seen. Now I'm not trying to destroy movies for myself by trying to find out what will happen next. But here we are talking about the kind of predictability that no effort requires; I just knew what was going to happen, whether I wanted to know or not. After a lion has been prominent in eating people, a Holistic bandit seeks out the escaped Costner after a noise in the bushes, and then we are "shocked" when the lion eats him. A bunch of uninhabited villagers are rounded off and shot by a fire pit, and one of the villagers sings a few Famous Last Words just before they are shot, to my great lack of surprise. A covered statue is revealed to show exactly what everyone knew, there was: Costner bowed down to a letter from a child we saw earlier in the movie. A man tells Bethlehem that it's not sir, you can't just take my wife; Bethlehem runs the unsuspecting sweet, though he is the only person in the theater who is unsuspecting. <br /> <br /> But it's a rank that causes sentimentality that the POSTMAN really withdraws. Olivia Williams, who plays Costner's lover Abby, is worst served. She throws her heart in the material and gives her a lot of effort to make it sound natural and sincere. She tried so hard, it was heartbreaking. But no one could ever have made the lines: "I have a gift for you, Postman ... You give up hope as if it were candy in your pocket." Sounds like the gruesome pap they are. Another example is the scene where a mounted Costner thunder passes over a little boy and ignores his tasteful letter, just turns around, stares at him, because it looks like five minutes and then thunder to pick up the letter. Why didn't Costner get it for the first time? No real reason; It's just an artwork we try to give a sense of excitement by keeping the child's hope and then restoring it. <br /> <br /> Schmaltz and predictability unite at the end as the image of the Postman is announced. I sat and thought, "Please don't tell me they're going to show the image and then cut it back with the snooker child. It's probably saccharine, too obvious for this movie." Then the music swore and we actually cut back to the dreaded boy who smiled, because his letter to his girlfriend was beaten, and I kept my head in my hands and thought, "Someone shoots me." It feels as if thirty pounds of apple pie is trapped in my throat. <br /> <br /> Gen. Bethlehem is a more human villain than normal. Your default problem post-apocalyptic villain is the most common, most difficult S.O.B. in the valley. Bethlehem is shown to be a bit of a man inside, trying to make himself feel important by beating others. Although some threats are being sacrificed, Bethlehem is credible in a way that most villains are not. Unfortunately, Patton will persuade. And although we were told earlier, Bethlehem destroyed his last challenger in five seconds, hand-to-hand, and Bethlehem's real-life fighting skills at the end of the movie are absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The acting is otherwise pretty good. Costner did better, but his Razzie was an over-reaction. As mentioned, Olivia Williams is very impressive. Larenz Tate as Ford does a sincere and credible job. James Newton Howard's score is skillful but short of the epic standards that the movie is going to. But it's not enough to save this movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 from ****.
