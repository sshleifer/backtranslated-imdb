The film's executive producer is none other than the messenger of peace through transcendental meditation, David Lynch's father's father. I wonder what David's guru, His Holiness Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, would have thought of this production. The hypocrisy here is just as offensive as the movie itself. It is a safe bet that Samuel L. Dieteman, Phoenix's serial killer and dedication to recreational violence, loved it every minute. <br /> <br /> I doubt if this film will be guilty of filmmaking; at that level it is pretty good. But on a moral level, it's the most humiliating film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> SPOILER COMING <br /> <br /> I think it's the phoniness of the thing that saddens me the most. Moral-Feeling Generation Xers learns a craft and a little postmodern aesthetic theory at art school or film school and then becomes involved in the arts and entertainment industry; And here's the result: a movie that leads to human suffering, injustice and massacre, many of which are seen by a nine-year-old who brutally murdered her whole family by some recreational violent killers who eventually descend into the sunset. <br /> <br /> NO MORE SPOILERS COM <br /> <br /> Who are movies like this produced for? Narurally, sadists are going to worship it - why wouldn't they? But who else? As I mentioned above, here are very good film art here, but good craftsmanship can be applied to any subject. Why does it fit on things like this? The movie is also very exciting, but it is not because of the graphics and coarseness of the violence; It's exciting because it's well-directed and well done. I'm sure Alfred Hitchcock's ghost can explain it much better than I can. <br /> <br /> So what is here before us? And above all, why? <br /> <br /> Yes, our world can be an ugly, dirty and equally evil place, but shouldn't we contradict when an artist makes it his business to rub our faces? Or worse, to keep it in the faces of the nine-year-olds who will somehow see it on the DVD? <br /> <br /> I hope people will not see this movie by their children. Yeah, well know - dream up, baby ...
