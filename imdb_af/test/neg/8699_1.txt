The reason why this movie sucks, did these people even read a bible? Everything in the movie was about mosses, God stayed out of it. It did not happen! God directed everything, He told them where to go and what to do. The people have also wandered 40 years after arriving at Canan and betraying God again! They didn't go astray for 40 years, then it was suddenly found. It was a punishment for their doubts. Perhaps if the people who made the movie actually picked up a Bible, they would say: No, we tried it wrong. Everything in this movie was about Moses. They made God look like a while that swore to Moses all the time. NO NO NO NO NO !!!!!! God was them all the time and he wanted people to see he cared for them. How dare they say otherwise, not even near the passage. And Moses was held out because he was angry with the people and disobeyed God! He did badly and said he would not be allowed to go for it. When did muses run and shout for God for everything in the Bible? NEVER !!!!!! Really read your story before making what you think is a good idea. Even this whole God mostly stayed out of it and made them do it themselves, that's not true !!! God did everything for the people, He provided them in every way for them, and God told them where to go. He was there all the time. The whole thing we have to do ourselves is true in some ways, but then it's not how it worked! Yes, today he doesn't work for everyone to see, but he actually killed people after the golden calf! God worked directly with the people. Read the Bible Next Time Echo Bridge or Don't Make Another Bible Movie!
