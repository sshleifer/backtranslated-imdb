Detective Burt Williams has been on the trail of the infamous Poe killer for nearly three years. Burt's daughter, Kris Williams, a murder agent for the FBI, along with her partner, Sean Michaels, takes over. Burt reluctantly pulls out of the case and goes out. The next seven months, "Poe Killer" continues his murderous rampage until Kris discovers that the killer is using internet chat to seduce his prey. She smiled as Annabel Lee and was quickly caught by Poe Killer. It's time for Burt to release the sadistic and free his daughter before it's too late. Amoritous and pure braindead horror flick with no tension and a bit of nasty gore. The acting is horribly horrible, the characters are painfully stupid and the killer is not threatening. However, I've seen worse in horror flicks .3 out of 10.
