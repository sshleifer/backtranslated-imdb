I just caught "Wild Rebels" on one of the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" archive collections, and this movie was so bad, even the MST3K team couldn't make it entertaining. There are a few MST3K targets. These were films whose concepts were so foolish that they might not be good movies (like The Green Slime), and others whose basic sites could be made into really entertaining movies as their movie makers They didn't block them in execution no. Wild Rebels is a movie whose basic premise DID made a good film three years ago, when Don Siegel directed his remake of The Killers at Universal. Both films deal with a failed driver driven by a femme fatality to drive the breakaway car in a robbery manipulated by the woman's boyfriend. Only in "The Killers" was manager John Cassavetes, the woman was Angie Dickinson and the criminal master brain. (popular but successful against type in what seems to be his final movie) was Ronald Reagan. Steve Alaimo, Bobbie Byers and Willie Pastrano are quite a comedown! But what really makes "Wild Rebels" is a terrible movie, going towards William Gref√© (note the accent on the final "e", which is present on his screen credit), which has absolutely no sense at any time. run at least half as long as it takes to make his dramatic point. It's just a pity someone didn't make a cartoon on this movie (in 2009); the comparison between Steve Alaimo's hairstyle and Rod Blagojevich's would have been irresistible!
