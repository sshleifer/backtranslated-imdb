I decided to watch this movie to fall asleep. It kept me awake, so it was interesting; However, it was pretty vague. <br /> <br /> The acting was good. I don't think any of the actors did a bad job. Mickey Rourke can be as credible as an over-the-mountain hit. The dialogue in this movie does not provide much opportunity for these actors to show their full potential, but they still shine. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere was wonderful. Music was good and colors matched the mood the director wanted to paint for the viewers. Even the weather improved the mood of the movie. Everything is well done. <br /> <br /> The failures of this movie are in its story development. The storyline with the mafia against Blackbird doesn't get enough attention. The storyline for Carmen and Wayne's divorce is not explained. The FBI looks particularly fast here. Isn't there any paperwork for all these processes? Is it really that easy to dig your brother's body out of his grave, burn the body and identify it as you? There are too many loops in the storyline for me to give this movie a little higher than a 4 out of 10 rating. I would not recommend this movie to people unless they were really bored and smoked a very good weed. Even if WoW is down for maintenance, find something better to do than watch this movie.
