normally I would say I loved this movie. Not for acting, though it was OK. Not for the script. It was so-so. The reason I usually loved this movie is for the intense action that starts to get going and doesn't end up with the final credits roll. But the problem with this movie, and I felt it was a big problem, was the terrible CGI. It looked like they were running out of money and couldn't complete the consequences. shots. many of the effects are lime they are in their very rough form. Because it was clear, they didn't have enough money to finish the movie. They should not have released it. It doesn't matter if a decent end product is made for the consumer. If it wasn't, I'd give this movie a much higher rating. My vote for Air Panic is a 3/10
