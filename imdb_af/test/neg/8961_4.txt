A lot of unpleasant city dwellers arrive at Le Touquet for a week's holiday. Stories spoiled, characters fight, make friends, deceive each other, sex ... <br /> <br /> Blanc has created a stellar role for his adaptation of Connolly's book, but to little use. What needs to be hilarious, instead of bends is annoying and annoying. All the characters are pathetic or unpleasant or both, and finally, despite the dangerous nature of things, this viewer still cares little about what happens to any of them. <br /> <br /> Credit to the always wonderful Rampling, plus Bouquet and Viard, but that's it. And Dutronc looks like he's rather overblown about the nips and tucks, if you ask me ...
