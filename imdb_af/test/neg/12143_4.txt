I need to give Billy Dee credit to try it out. Knowing this was a blow-up movie, I started my DVD with a certain expectation. I knew it would be a low budget ... the acting subpar ... but hoped some jewels would sprinkle through. If any diamonds or jewelery are sprinkled in this movie, they are buried successfully under tons and tons of coal ... or maybe too much. As an actor and filmmaker, I often clipped when potentially striking moments were devastated by horrific appearances. Yet I have to admit that I couldn't look away. I don't know if it's like a car wreck, you can't eliminate your eyes or a mysterious power in the movie that kept me there. This movie is a good thing for an excellent story that has been misrepresented. If Walter Kronkite were to tell the "Aristocratic" joke, it would be a total flop, though the joke itself is hilarious. Let Dave Chappelle tell it, and we all roll on the floor and laugh. This movie needs a "Chapelle". Now, with that said, if you have the opportunity to buy this movie for the dollar I did, do it. It's worth the money to appreciate. Maybe I'll take another dollar, buy the rights to this movie and reconsider it. Who knows ... it may not be better, but it may not be worse.
