Although he first made his debut film in Australia and went to Great Britain and America to continue his career, Australians will tell you that the biggest movie star they ever made was Errol Flynn. I'm not sure he ever returned to Australia after his success in Captain Blood. Yet I am writing this film to the well-known Aussie irreverence to hide the reputation of one of their own. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem of telling Errol Flynn's life story was that he told enough long stories in his life. To the end in his memoir, My Wicked Wicked Ways. I could see that much of the film was based on it and on reading between the lines of that book. <br /> <br /> His mother's infidelity to his father was not written, but could be deduced from reading my wicked Wicked Ways. He did not know the woman in particular, it appears from a few sources. <br /> <br /> I wish the movie dealt more with his New Guinea adventures, which was the most interesting part of My Wicked Wicked Ways. As far as his street fighter in the Depression is concerned, I tend to convince it. Even if he succeeded, I assured that there would be enough of his appearance, and he would never have had a career as a leading man. <br /> <br /> Still, people under Sydney's atmosphere during the Depression are well-captured and Guy Pearce is a charismatic Errol Flynn. American audiences know him best as the sincere but honest Lieutenant Exley in LA Confidential who came out the same year as Flynn. <br /> <br /> But LA Confidential was a much better movie.
