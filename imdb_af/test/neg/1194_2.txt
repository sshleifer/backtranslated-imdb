I saw this movie in the theater in Edinbourgh, along with 3 other Americans and our friend from Manchester and we all thought it was a waste of time. We would rather spend an extra hour seeing a fleeting dialogue of Star Wars III playing in the hall as all that. <br /> <br /> Starting with one of the worst jokes I have ever dedicated to celluloid on the big screen, it didn't pull off with a bang. Throughout the movie we had the feeling that the jokes were just trying too hard. The authors thought so much about setting up that you could see the joke 2 minutes ahead of time. When it came, it was so unclear that you couldn't even smile; I call the giraffe cum-ming as a good example. <br /> <br /> The plot itself makes me some interesting thoughts, which make me much more entertaining than on the screen. I think much more could be done with that angle (the two different worlds, the fish-out-of-water experience of the characters, the confusion and surprise as people try to distinguish and distinguish the characters and writers from each other.) But too much time is wasted to push this painful plot to the end with so much 'bizarre' and 'goof' as humanly possible. <br /> <br /> And to say the 16th-century characters show any extra talent from the writers, is an insult to intelligent writers and editors who might have thought this film a worthwhile 40 minutes. but no, it's a full-fledged film of infertility. <br /> <br /> As we left the theater, which laughed very little about it, I heard the young, hip-electro-clash British couple behind me saying, "It was pretty good, wasn't it. " You never really knew. what was next. "And the girl responds" yes, quite surprisingly. "And that was it. If it was the intention of British people to watch a comedy: don't laugh for 90 minutes, but a little communication between two lovers At the end, this movie was successful, but I have more faith in British life than that. <br /> <br /> I haven't laughed so hard at a comedy movie since American Pie II.
