I told a friend about the time my grandfather actually scratched this horrible piece for us to see at the theater one night. He has never again chosen another! It was so bad! Anyway, my friend told me that her father did some of the writing for this garbage. I thought she was joking. It seems she was serious. She never really saw it, and she said it quickly stopped her father's writing career. I told her not to waste her time. But if she actually breaks down and looks, she'll see in the fury minute why it ended her father's days as a writer. I mean, even for the 1980s, this crap is out of the box. I mean, Joe Frazier as Terrible Tucker? And why in the world would two police once care about a house full of ghosts? And the movie poster? A ghost with his tongue hanging out? What is it about? Nothing about this makes sense. Well, I told my friend that this crap didn't just end her father's writing career, but it ended the careers of everyone involved. Or, at least none of them ever recovered to be in the garbage of a movie. Let's just say I will insult my friend forever to reveal to me that her father was a writer for this movie! It just has to tell you how bad it is!
