Well, there are a few things about this movie. Everyone should see it. You see the nation of Iraq, as you have never seen it by the media, and shot from a perspective almost considered by most Americans, where the movie heard its most important. But all the glorious things in mind leave a few other facts out of the movie. There are 150 cameras handed out to the Iraqi people, all of whom regard the occupation forces and subjugation as a growing pain for improving their nation. And compared to Saddam, it's just a bad scratch on the skin. Netflix as its main distributor advertised it before the fun election we just had by sending a large email to his entire timetable to watch the movie. Much of that, which should be marked as opinions expressed as facts listed by the interviewed Iraqis, is wrong. If one had to review the Red Cross records of Abu Ghraib torture, it was not Saddam's henchmen who were tortured. It was a good mix of 80-90% innocent citizens and 10-20% lawfully kept people. Never was it known that any of those 10-20% were Saddam's Henchmen or curfew offenders. In addition, the Arab world has never listed 'democracy' as one of their opponents. More correctly, it is the US $ 6 billion a year for Isreal, our military bases in Saudi Arabia and our interest in oil. I agree that the media is a complete distortion, but this film shows the same distortion. I'm afraid the Iraqi people representing this movie have been edited to speak with a Yankee voice. Yes, it is true that Saddam is a puke, and that his removal is very good. It is true that some Iraqis actually pay a good wage. Just as it is true, no Iraqi people have control over their most valued oil and US companies. It also does not mention that 20,000 civilians have died exclusively from American artillery. However, 15% of the country once had running water and electricity. It also mentions that from 1993 to 2003, UN sanctions were envisaged and written by the US government to kill more than 200 000 Iraqi civilians. It also does not call it Democracy when people decide the government, not a massive war machine that sends the message, becomes "murdered or obedient." I'm afraid that the floor of the cutting room must have a whole lot of Iraqis who aren't so happy with the appeal. Just as the vast majority of the world was not for the war. In fact, America, Britain, Spain and the rest of them are not carriers of democracy, they turned their backs on when they saw how full their bags could be. Hurray, Saddam is out of control, but I'm afraid no Iraq is still in control. Corporations are in power, the media is in power. Read, do your own research, and don't let them blind you.
