The story is not very strong. Don't expect some kind of "Bourne Identity" movie. It started with strong, Tara talk Russian and it even sounded credible. (Not that I am the Russian language expert.) Moscow has seen that darker depressive that has given this film potential, I still believed in it. It took about half an hour to see they really missed the place. Acting was poor, perhaps because the story itself wasn't very strong. There's this part in the movie where Gordon Patrick (Nick Moran) talks over the phone with the C.I.A, as you listen to a Chinese synchronizer. W.T.F!? Bad, the author didn't even bother to give the main characters depth. Also, a bit of a cheap and easy end. <br /> <br /> Plus point is almost every scene in which Tara Reid is in. Not that she's acting so well, she doesn't. But she really looks good in this movie. Overall, it was a bit of a disappointment. Rental equipment ??. Maybe.
