Negative figures are not available to tell you how bad this movie is! Woodworking along with a story line that has been repeated many times. Everyone in this movie should attend Anonymous overactors. You would think an original story could evolve from the general concept. Young men at a preparatory school are holding on to the bombing of Pearl Harbor. It raises interesting questions, but the way it is transmitted makes it more of a joke. The typical characters were present, including the zealous jock and nerd (including glasses). I could no longer be interested in the wood dialogue and clich√© characters. After the film I had to throw the DVD in the trash. Stay far away from this dud! You won't get the 90 minutes of your life back!
