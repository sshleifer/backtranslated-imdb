!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> With the exception of THE TERMINATOR and TOTAL RECALL, I don't think Arnie's action / adventure films are too much. They are probably better than his comedies, but it hardly says. The problem I have with all the action block busters is that they are moving over and lacking in any kind of morality. <br /> <br /> Morality? In my review of TERMINATOR 2 I mentioned the scene where good man Terminator blows the knees of the SWAT team. Do we have to think that because the hero makes people work instead of killing them, will we admire him somewhere? This is the problem with ERASER, when James Cann's character is revealed as a traitor in the US Marshal. Arnie's character John Kruger goes on with a witness he protects, but in several later rows Kruger kills a fairly large amount of swamp that works with the villain. Did we take them all the traitors? Certainly, many of them were honest men trying to stop Kruger because the bad guy told them Kruger was the traitor? It is a little uncomfortable thought that Kruger killed several people trying to keep the law upright. <br /> <br /> In spite of a hundred million dollars, however, the special effects aren't that impressive. Look at the scene where Kruger leaves the aircraft wing and stirs up a parachute. Clearly, the action is intervening that it is a stuntman who does the free fall while Arnie is in a studio in front of a blue screen. ERASER is also a film that contains unnecessary CGI with killer alligators, not just unnecessary CGI, but also non-convincing CGI. There are also some plot holes as in the opening scene where some witness protection is involved with people who have caught the crowd. Kruger opens a car trunk and pulls out a few bodies and starts a fire and throws the mood of the scent. Next time, Kruger will rearrange the dental records by the couple's computer that he has saved. It would be logical to do so, but will all the couples keep dental records on the computer? Most importantly, we believe that the US Marshal Department holds a body of freezers for such events. <br /> <br /> So they're going to you, a typical Arnie thriller long on unlikely pieces and short on intelligence and it's interesting to note that ERASER didn't make much of the profit at the box office, since the production cost weighs almost a potential audience figure heavier. After ERASER, Arnie didn't do much more at the box, except TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES that was an event movie and it would be interesting to see if he would rather be remembered as a film star as a politician.
