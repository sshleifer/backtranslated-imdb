This movie is frankly the worst piece I've ever seen. it is slow, plot less and boring. the filmmate deserved to be shot. There were several aspects of unintentional comedy, one of which was Jared strange. Many laughs, but also a lot of gift. don't look with anyone anywhere. If you hate someone, they recommend buying or renting it. great waste of time and money. Thank you Gus Van Sant ... not. I can't think of anything else to say, except don't see this movie, it'll let you out of a cliff. Hope Gus and his friends read this comment before it's too late and he makes a sequel or another catastrophe with what was shot with a camera phone.
