Kristy Swanson is playing an elite hitwoman who is supposed to beat a TV rep for a group of bad guys. But once she sees these poor fellows at home playing with his children, she decides to litter the whole project and the TV reporter's life is spared. . The hitwoman's life is at stake, because the people who wanted this reporter to kill now want her death not to go through her mission. So is the basis for a movie called Supreme Sanction. Time is more like that. We see Swanson's character beat, pummel and kill men much larger than her. And she's always one fifty-two steps ahead of the group of murders that can't break away for some reason with this super hitwoman. . If one woman runs away and hits all these men, the movie is gay. It's too predictable as soon as you figure out Swanson's character will win anyway and make the movie boring and inactive. <br /> <br /> Kristy Swanson is a decent actress, who in her younger days was always sexy and easily e eyes.Supreme Sanction, however, is not one of her better efforts.
