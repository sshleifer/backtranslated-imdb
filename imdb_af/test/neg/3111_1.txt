I bought this movie for about $ 2.5 at a local flea market. I thought with the role played in this movie (Ice-T, Rob Lowe & Mario Van Peebles all right), it would be pretty good. Boy, was I wrong. This movie annoyed hell out of me. Almost every scene is dragging too long. The scene where Rob Lowe watches this girl singing and dancing in a bar lasts forever! It was one of the worst scenes I've ever seen in a movie. The rest is not a picnic either. My guess is when they finished the movie, they only had 30 minutes of film, so they made everything 3x longer. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: The current 1.9-score here on imdb is right on the money. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Look for some paint for 1.5 hours instead of watching it! <br /> <br /> If you want to make a better movie through this director, see 'Mean Guns' (with Christopher Lambert & Ice-T) or 'Postmortem' (with Charlie Sheen) instead.
