What a crap that movie is. The writing is simply not existent. The movie sometimes looks like a music video. But it can't even be because the soundtrack doesn't really match. Pathetic way to combine action and rap. One might think it's a recipe for a successful movie ... here it fails miserably. Dialogue in this movie just killed me. The scene when Harlan is questioned by a policeman is just a pity. In general, recent Seagals films are barely observable. What happened to the man with the man? I know he's old, but can't he get "Hollywood" to drop him a decent script or something? Does he go out for dough for his escape to India to accept something they serve him?
