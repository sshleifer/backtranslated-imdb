Ever gone on Youtube? Well, the definite question about it is YES. Do you see the bootloads of ICarly and Nickelodeon rants? No definite answer. <br /> <br /> Many people think ICarly is a dull and idiotic program, and others think it's the best program on Earth's face. I saw many reviews that were in the head and some gave it a bouquet of roses. According to me, Icarly is for the kids, but the show is just terrible. <br /> <br /> If you haven't read the last review, there are reasons 1-8: # 1: Sterootipes # 2: Goofed-Carly thinks she's nice, but she's mean # 5: Anyone about the drinking age is stupid # 6: Sam is petite but strong? # 7: No real companies # 8: Means teachers <br /> <br /> # 9: The webshow exceeds 3DFX. Just look at the website to understand what I mean. # 10: The webshow also wastes personal information. # 11: Almost every familiar thing is insulting. Icarly insults the Japanese race, Solitare, Mercades-Benz, and Pac-Man, to name a few. # 12: There's too much repetition of jokes (Sam's obsession with meat, Freddy's computer, Gibby pulls off his shirt, etc.). # 13: The video games based on the display suck. # 14: Freddy lacks masculinity. Why? It becomes original. # 15: The show is aimed at a female audience. I also hate shows aimed at a male audience, so I prefer to be for both sexes. # 16: The words "nub" and "no chiz". # 17: Overuse of lag tracks. <br /> <br /> Part 3 comes early in spring! Just break in time for spring!
