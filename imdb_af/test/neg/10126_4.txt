For a series inspired by Kolchak, it is ironic that the X files' first attempt to place a vampire section on the ass. 3 always surprised me and - with the danger of sounding like the terrible Hans Keller - I have often wondered if I miss the point. The story feels like a puzzle that has bits that don't fit the box. The result is that you spend a cozy evening through the fire looking for air that is really sea. This incomplete feeling doesn't matter how many times you repeat the episode and no matter how much attention you give it. I know this review puts me at risk of being dragged by Whitby by teenage girls who will drink my blood while listening to Busted, but this is a risk I am prepared to take. I've always been a werewolf man.
