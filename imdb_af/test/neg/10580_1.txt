I hired this movie with my sister hoping to watch a wonderful entertaining movie, it was humorous, but my expectations were dropped. This movie was beyond disgusting and rebellious for a PG-13 movie, it had to be rated R for the many adult references made in this movie. I would not recommend seeing a 13-year-old teenager. <br /> <br /> Even if nobody under the age of 17 watches this movie, beware of a really silly movie, there is no humor in the movie, just a bunch of disgusting sexual references, including a little bit of pedophilia, something that shouldn't even be bothered. <br /> <br /> Want to know what happened to PG-13 movies, which was actually safe for a 13-year-old? It is beyond a regrettable movie and needs to be reviewed.
