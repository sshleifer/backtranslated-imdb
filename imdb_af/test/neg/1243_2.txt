First of all. I saw better acting and more realistic makeup in porn movie. How bad was "Chris Moltisante" as Stewie Ungar? On the Sopranos, Chris is not taken too seriously and can be considered a comic relief. And then throw in "Bobby Baccala" as one of his Vegas cronies. It's just too much to take in a dramatic movie. No actor can handle a serious role and is better suited as a second banana for Tony, Paulie, or Uncle Junior. And I want to know who made the makeup for this disaster? I want that person to be MY People in the next 25 years so that I will never age a day. So that's all I will write on this movie because it's not worth wasting too much of my time. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know Michael Imperioli and Steve Schirippa are their REAL names.
