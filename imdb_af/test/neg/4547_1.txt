When I decided to watch a movie about cryogenics, I didn't expect much. That's exactly what I have, and even less. In addition to a shortage of special effects (squibs?) And a serious shortage of any play, The Chilling also plays the absolute worst script I've ever seen in a movie. I had to stop the band several times during the first 45 minutes to repair the damage done to my intellect for the evidence of such a horrible dialogue found here. <br /> <br /> Also, the collection of characters is as formulaic and one-dimensional as it is ridiculous: the corrupt doctor; his assistant, played by Linda Blair (we know she is his "assistant" because he repeatedly referred to her by that title); the recent widowed businessman with a heart of gold who develops a romantic interest in Blair's character; his criminal son; the Blair character's alcoholic, abusive, unemployed boyfriend with whom we are introduced to the most motivated use of a retrospective; and of course the rough, difficult, bearded security guard who becomes the hero. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the conservative fluid that some cryogenic laboratories use on its bodies is highly conductive, which, of course, causes disaster when all laboratory containers end up outdoors in a remarkable sequence of events during a lightning storm (on Halloween night, no less). As for the zombies themselves, if you like watching people in green latex masks walking around in aluminum foil packs, then "The Chilling" is the movie for you. The zombie action is very poor at best; The zombies' primary killing method seems to grab people by shaking their shoulders and shaking them. The businessman and the security guard do most of the zombie combat, including a highly-stressed scene to freeze the dead with liquid nitrogen. Let me tell you, the steel mill in "T2" has nothing on "The Chilling" in portraying an enemy frozen in its tracks. <br /> <br /> How Linda Blair finally got trapped in the middle of this piece of liquor is indeed a mystery. In fact, her career wasn't exactly in the 80's, but this movie is an embarrassment to her. The writing does not even have the decency to use her for any good use. Most of what is given to her character is things like "Here they come", "Do something", "Hurry!". The only thing I can find is that poor Linda was compensated for her work on this movie in food rations. The hero is played by Grizzly Adams himself, Dan Haggerty. In this photo, he faces solid acting competition from his beard and the security dog, and he does his best to better perform both of them. <br /> <br /> The only scary part of "The Chilling" is the introduction that reveals the factual elements of cryogenics and suggests that "the movie you're about to see in your own community can happen ". While counting the number of times, some of the names in the closing credits are repeated, I was sworn to see that Lucasfilm is being credited. Fortunately, it was just for the film's sound production. 10/01.
