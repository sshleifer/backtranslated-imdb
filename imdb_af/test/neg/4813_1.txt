Make "Invasion USA" look like "Apocalypse Now". This one can only be recommended for American skinheads, John Birch supporters or militia members. The message is very simple: let's all shoot - gooks, commies, latinos, everything that's not American. <br /> <br /> In addition, it was poorly acted, poorly written, poorly interpreted, incredibly stupid, but not fun at all. This movie can be used as a magic device by CIA torturers. Oops, sorry, there can't be American martyrs, because they're the GOOD
