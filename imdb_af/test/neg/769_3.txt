Dumb is right: Tom and Jerry achieve their goal of an uninterrupted flight to Africa, but then worry about interference with the Natives. They sit on a black plane, fly the plane, try to survive on an airplane wing floating in the ocean, and then survive the wild animals as soon as they arrive on land. <br /> <br /> After reading some reviews before you see it I knew what to expect. It was simply these two guys doing their Amos and Andy / Stepin 'Fetchit impressions. Offensive to blacks? Of course, but it's the 1930's for you. Some of their lines were funny, some were stupid. The main mistake I had with this cartoon was the sound, because it was often not easy to understand what these two guys were saying. <br /> <br /> In all, curiosity, but don't stop the racism you can't check. At least it gives you an idea of ​​how times have changed .... for the better.
