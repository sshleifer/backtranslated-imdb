I thought it was hilarious and it was at best mediocre, the only funny character, believe it or not Andy Dick. The timing was just terrible for most jokes and gags and the writing was bad. I mean I know it's supposed to be like blaxploitation, but it just worked. In addition, this entire genre has already been beaten to death, with all the austin powers movies and undercover brothers, it just looks old, it also feels like a frost of undercover brother (who wasn't hysterical, but much smarter than this). Also, for a comedy / action movie, the direction was vague. I don't know if it will be released in theaters, but it's definitely made for TV.
