I was so looking forward to seeing this movie that I really couldn't understand how I got the impression I would enjoy. I'm afraid it's really a yawn party - every single patron in the movie I went regularly and fidgeted throughout the film. It's a shame because it's a fantastic story - I tend to think it will make a better reading. This is not helped by the principle character that once shows its teeth - and that was because of the camera angle. As the story unfolds, it becomes easier to understand the main character's dilemmas. However, the tension and drama that made it a most popular movie was completely spoiled by the dull treatment. Deaf as a half-baked documentary!
