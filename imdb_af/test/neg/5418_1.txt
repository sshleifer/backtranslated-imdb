One of the worst movies I've seen in the 90's. I often use it as a benchmark when I watch other movies; "Anyway, it wasn't as bad as Caro Diario." Three absolutely useless segments, all with the director who plays himself - and he's not that interesting. An entire segment about this hypochondria goes to the doctor. Another one who knows him to ride on his lap around the countryside. For three interesting minutes and another fifteen bad people. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming factor was that the scooter scene was based on Keith Jarrett's "Koln Concert". Asked me to go home and rediscover that great album. The best thing you can say about the director / actor / selfish is that he has a good taste in music.
