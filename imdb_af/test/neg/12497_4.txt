Plot Overview: Los Angeles in the future. Core is brought under control by Core Trackers, Android killers sent by the United States computerized judicial system to execute the perpetrators. Secret Service Agent Eric Phillips prevents an attack on his boss, Senator Robert Dilly (the USCJS man), by the Union for Human Rights, a group of anti-machine activists. Dilly is trying to put Phillips in his private circuit, but the SS agent goes on the run after killing Dilly an UHR agent in cold blood. Dilly sends Core Trackers to him. Phillips joins the UHR group and helps them discover a conspiracy with Dilly. <br /> <br /> "Cyber ​​Tracker" is the first of a number of sci-fi / action hybrids by Richard Pepin, co-founder of PM Entertainment, a motion movie house of action films during the 1990s. Other Pepin films include "Hologram Man", "T-Force", "The Silencers" & "Dark Breed". Pepin movies typically start with a big action series that lasts about 10 minutes before the plot can kick. The script for this movie has some plot holes? It is never clear what the conspiracy that the heroes are trying to stop is actually. Regarding the acting, Don "The Dragon" Wilson can be difficult, but can't work for beans, with little charisma. His fellow stars are much better. The movie's best bet is the action scenes, which throw an impressive firearm on the fire, a huge body part and not one, but three moments where a vehicle flies, flips and hits the ground and explodes. The visual effects border on the cheap side and the musical score is low-key & shrill.
