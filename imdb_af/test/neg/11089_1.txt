Very strange, it looks like a very average movie for me, if not slightly less. It was brilliantly shot, but along with the performance of R. Lee Ermey, it is about the only redeeming aspect I have found in the movie, consisting of two separate parts. <br /> <br /> The first section covers the basic marine training that emerged in 2007, such as something I've seen in dozens of other films and series before, and it's not particularly poignant. After 30 minutes I got the idea and wish they could just do it. The chest transmitter is about the only credible character while everyone looks like they are just cardboard cuttings. The general acting is staggering and the screenplay is nothing interesting and consists of a little more than the sergeant shouting. The boys make it through their training and finish in Vietnam. Oh, and the fat weirdo shoots the sergeant (which is a surprise ..), probably in the wrong conviction that it was actually the scriptwriter. <br /> <br /> So, one hour passed and nothing was worthy. Nothing ... <br /> <br /> Then we have the Vietnam part. <br /> <br /> It opens with a stacking scene where Stars and Stripes reporters are bored and small talks succeed. the time. Initially, I thought they had a few movies from old movies that sounded bad. But no, they actually mumbled their writing lines. Then the camp is besieged. About 20 Vietcong enters the camp through the main gate. Bad to them they are dropped like flies because they simply walk in several manned rifles, without any cover. Is this normal behavior? Were the Vietnamese all suicidal? If so, how did the US not win this war during the first two months of engagement? The rest of the movie continues with even more completely illogical war styles. <br /> <br /> The whole plot is completely useless. None of the characters inspire much sympathy and the story is honest, unrelenting. It shows little more than some war reporters who join a platoon, while some guys are shot because they are disobedient morons and who also seem to think that somehow a gaping hole in a wall will protect you from bullets. <br /> <br /> What was the message of this movie ... that people died in Vietnam? That people are animals in war situations? If you really want to have stupid people, are you sending them to a war zone? Or that concrete can actually burn in Vietnam? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but if this movie earns an 8.3, Apocalypse now earns a 38.3. <br /> <br /> 5/10
