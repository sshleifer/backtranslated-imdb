Even John Wayne fans will have to admit that this movie is a mess. Wayne's character, John Tobin, was, after the gang killed his parents, led by half Apache, half of white-backed Pandro Zanti (Earl Dwire), who was a Mexican. <br /> <br /> There are almost too many crazy plot points to count, but those who stand out include Sheriff Williams (Jack Rockwell) who captures a captured Zanti around his boot. All that Zanti has to do to get free is removed. his boat! Tobin's friend Dusty (George pre-Gabby Hayes) puts a cast knife in the back and returns well as new to the rest of the story. In a chase scene, Tobin glances through a drainage basin surrounded by log walls in the middle of a desert, and misses his mark, chasing Zanti on foot through the desert. Zanti is looking for relief and drinking from a pool of water, but OOPS !, he didn't see the plate above the waterhole that says, "Don't drink poison". As Zanti falls into the devil, Tobin falls again to the rest of the gang and takes the whole lot by blowing a rock wall that seals a secret area in Dusty's cabin - no matter how convenient. <br /> <br /> In the closing scene, the new sheriff Tobin is seen on the phone and speaks to the new mum. Tobin (Sheila Terry), Dusty's daughter Ruby, who was a kidnapping target of Zanti's gang earlier in the film. Apparently, the studio was planning to get Wayne the girl into almost every movie they made with him, as this type of end is predictable for almost all the Lone Star movies.
