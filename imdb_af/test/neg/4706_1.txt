Well, Dude Where's my car, it can be at least a novelty as one of the few Hollywood movies that seems to be written, thrown, filmed and edited in less than a day. I honestly can't believe it was made (or that I allowed my friends to put me through the whole thing). The jokes are too stupid and predictable to be "silly-funny", and the actors involved don't seem to be able to pull out any kind of funny if the script actually provided it. Strangely, unlike most inexorable slapstick comedies, this movie actually has too much plot - every scene looks like it's a new moronic and uninteresting subplot. Of course it goes for moronics, but it doesn't work at any level. There is only one aspect of this movie I enjoyed: Donkeylips from the old Nickalodean show "Salute Your Shorts" has a very small role. This is the role that will change in the next Richard Gere, but you don't look ...
