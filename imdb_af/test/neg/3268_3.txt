Caddyshack II is NOT compared to the original Caddyshack. But there are legitimate reasons for that. (1) Rodney Dangerfield would be the bait of this movie, but he didn't want the script, wanted to change it, his request was refused, and he didn't do the film. (2) It was low budget, Bill Murray grew to superstar status. Ted Knight died in 1986, and Chevy Chase could not have been the "supposed ace" of the first movie (although it was Rodney all the way) for no more than 5 minutes because it would cost too much to pay him. BUT you had Dan Aykroyd, Robert Stack, Randy Quaid and Jackie Mason, all serviceable substitutes, who didn't have their best performances.
