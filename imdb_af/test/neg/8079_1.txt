When I watched this, it reminded me of the title of the movie BRAND, which is the place where this garbage falls into a fire. I don't even know what to say the acting blow, the fire looks really fake, Andy the chicks aren't exactly supermodels. And finally, I don't know what you're complaining about, I have this damn movie, yes, happy birthday for me. Well, I think it can be worse, I can be left behind. And to make things worse, I put the whole set on DVD fire, volcano, earthquake, avalanche. All I miss is the wonderful tornado movie I hear balls suck. <br /> <br /> Well to my next crap movie peace
