I want to return the 99 minutes of my life that was messed up with this pathetic excuse for a movie. The acting was terrible! I was a fan of Cameron Diaz and Vincent D'Onofrio. I will never look at them again. Keanu Reeves and Dan Aykroyd were not a surprise. Everyone knows they can never act. Fortunately, only Dan then tried to get an accent. His accent was a disaster as expected. I think he was either confused about the location of the movie or never actually spoke to anyone from Minnesota. I hope this review helps someone who is unpredictable about what to do with their precious time. The only reason I could read the whole movie was because I was better off looking or reading somewhere without something.
