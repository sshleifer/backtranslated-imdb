"Catchfire" or "Backtrack" as it is sometimes called is not very good. That is, it's bad. Jodie Foster has already won an Oscar. Why did she agree to do this? I do not know. <br /> <br /> The hostage / kidnapping relationship is not credible, even though it is a common psychological phenomenon in real life. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, this movie is a scene where Hopper and Foster drive a boat under the Fremont Bridge (a bridge in Seattle), which meant traffic had to stop so the bridge could open. I had to wait for that bridge to go many times, almost all on the bus. It's not a nice wait. This movie has caused unnecessary bridges and the world is a worse place for it.
