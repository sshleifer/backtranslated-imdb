It's really awful, the sweetest attempt to customize a comic strip ever dedicated to film. Every possible thing about this movie can be bad. Music, acting, lighting, sets, "special" effects ... about the only positive I can find is that Sue looks cute in her blue pants and that the Thing makeup is almost over (only face). That's it. Zip. Don't bother finding that bootleg copy; It's really not worth your time. Even the filmed "Captain America" ​​movie of the early 90's is far less ominous than you sit in the chair while trying to endure this mess.
