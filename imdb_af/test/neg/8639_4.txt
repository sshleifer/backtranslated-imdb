Once upon a time, Theresa Russell made some half-way decent movies. So I hope one of her efforts over the past decade or two will earn a score of at least 6 or 7 (out of 10). However, DARK WORLD is just the latest in a series of disappointments. The first 90 minutes are very hard to watch. The lines are performed by the main actors as if they were being read during a first rehearsal or even a decisive session (in which the actors did it for the sake of their agents, but didn't really want the parts for which they were perfunctorily reading) . The sets and props look somehow "down" (what kind of police department will allow a detective to have a whole lounge wall, with "The screen constantly messing with meaningless time and data, which without rhythm or reason now, now that the scriptwriter is standing here after the lights of a movie festival show, they will undoubtedly crow on how all these shortcomings are VERY smart clues to the plot in the last five minutes in the last five minutes to turn in. Well, for the audience members whose only other movie experiences are TV: THE MOVIE and SURFER, DUDE, they may be bamboo to nod their heads in. But it's hard to believe that someone is 10 or see more movies in their lives - and not a close friend or family member of a DARK WORLD movie or crew - can fall for such a parachute, despite what the DVD box can lead you to believe , this movie has about as much resemblance to SUNSET BOULEVARD (dead narrator) or Hitchcock (schizophrenic main characteristic device) as a drained Jim Beam bottle filled with urine!
