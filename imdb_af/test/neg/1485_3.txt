Yes, the film was so boring and rude. To some point I wanted the crocodile to eat these people, just so we could get the movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is that three Aussies take a fishing trip on a river in a small boat, where the fishing belt is popping on a rifle. He says he does it only for insurance purposes, all the crocs have been driven out of that river. He is immediately eaten by a crocus. The trio then gets a tree, and is picked by the reptile in their attempts to escape. They spend most of the movie about the best way to escape. <br /> <br /> Predictably, one survivor finds the tour guide's gun and shoots the crocodile. Aww, they killed the movie's only lovely character! <br /> <br /> Where are Paul Hogan or Steve Irwin when you really need them?
