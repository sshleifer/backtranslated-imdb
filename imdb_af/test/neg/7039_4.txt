Poor story of an evil fairy seeking a centuries-old satanic Bible so that he can make Lucifer's bid by withdrawing creation. Hot in the pursuit is the 17th Centrify bounty hunter named Redfern and his unwilling sidekick Kassandra. Sounds like a cargo bunk? It is. <br /> <br /> This drive of author D.T. Twohy gets the superficial treatment it deserves from director Steve Miner (who has the romantic nonsense "Forever Young" clear). Of course, twohy knows nothing of true evil. <br /> <br /> Julian Sands just flies around and tries to look angry, while Richard E. Grant just wipes his rich talent. Lori Singer's career also had a nosedive with this one. <br /> <br /> Special effects crew have a lot of fun, and Jerry Goldsmith offers a score that is better than his topic.
