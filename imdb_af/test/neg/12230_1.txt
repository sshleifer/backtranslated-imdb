Does all the movie need pure stupidity and lack of any kind of intelligence at all? Is there even a single really FUNNY parody movie? All I see is zero-quality movies that look like some stoned high school students who one day got bored with a video camera. These movies aren't funny, they're not smart, they're not entertaining, they're just useless in every way possible. <br /> <br /> The return was a movie that tried to hide its boring level of garbage. by not calling themselves "Sports Movie". But that's the same thing. There are a few different authors for these films, the Wayans did some, Freidberg and Seltzer did others, and I'm sure there are a few more. I can't even say the difference in direction or humor to be honest, the same people seem to have written and directed them. I can't tell if the Comebacks were done by the people that Scary Movie or the guys who did Epic Movie or someone else, it's just the same jokes of all the others. <br /> <br /> If you have any taste or taste for humor, don't see this movie. If you have self-worth, you shouldn't see it. If you have any respect for filmmaking, don't even look at it. Don't see it in a demolished, in vain scene it can still carry, don't rent it, don't order it on Netflix or Pay-Per-View, don't make it Redbox and don't even look at It is free at OD. Avoid it like the pest. <br /> <br /> The only conceivable reason I can see watching this movie is as follows. <br /> <br /> A. Masochism. If you have tortured yourself, there are very few better ways. B. See a good example of why avoiding something that says "Fox Atomic". C. You are paid a lot of high amounts of cash. <br /> <br /> I really didn't want to see the whole thing if someone offered me $ 100 to do it. It is merely senseless, spiritual collapsing torment. <br /> <br /> You can look at Zohan as well.
