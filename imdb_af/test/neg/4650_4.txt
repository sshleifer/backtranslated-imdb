It's a surprise for fans of Z-grade movies. Here you will write and observe what is bad enough to ever produce anything Ed Wood. Veteran bad movie actor Cameron Mitchell is a former make-up of "Paragon Studios" who after a nasty acid-on-face incident at a social gathering becomes a bitter Mad Scientist (TM) with a rubber scar on his face that takes revenge by kidnapping Paragon actors and making them into live images in his secret lab (tm), conveniently located in the local wash museum. Or are they zombies doing his offer? He's not sure. <br /> <br /> Luckily, many of your favorite movie clicks are here. Check out the villain's lab! Are those mysterious steam barrels fluid? Test tubes of colored water with no explanatory purpose? Yay! And how do we see firearms and legs that look so nice on a wooden shelf? Absolutely! Surprised by the bumbling detectives acting straight out of Plan Nine! Now, enjoy a stupid, easy car hunt, and hear more dizzy bimbo screams than you might want. Raise an eyebrow on the helix, make it even more opaque through the completely meaningless end that apparently has no connection with the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Cheesy trash and lots of fun for the bad filmmaker.
