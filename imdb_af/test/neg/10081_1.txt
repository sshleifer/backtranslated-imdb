When I went to see it, I thought, I kept the first two and thought they were very exciting so this should be good too. WRONG! There was no tension and they didn't explain the new dinosaurs! When I did that, I lost all respect for Steven Spielberg and Michael Crichton, but it turned out that it was not spielberg directed, or written by Michael Crichton! This movie went through the "movements". I thought this movie had no plot and I thought no one should waste their money to see it.
