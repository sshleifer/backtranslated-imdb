I watched this movie so you don't have to! I have great respect for Kris Kristofferson, but what does he think? He did it for scale? <br /> <br /> At least the movie's title disappears in advertising, as people and objects disappear routinely through the movie and add to the confusion. Kristofferson in his comment states that even he was not sure whether Genevieve Bujold's character really existed. It's not good for the viewer to follow the story! <br /> <br /> The "making" feature was much more interesting than the movie itself. It examines the difficulty of co-financing for an indie, even if the film is shot. <br /> <br /> It's credit, this movie is visually pleasing and in no way looks like a movie made with just over 1M. Unfortunately, the money was not spent on a better project.
