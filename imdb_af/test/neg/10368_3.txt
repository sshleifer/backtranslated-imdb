So I decided to watch the whole Puppet Master series, and I only watched 1-3, which I thought was EVERYTHING excellent. They had a unique charm for them, and a certain intelligence I greatly appreciated. About a year ago I even got Puppeteer Vs. Demonic Toys, which was of course bad, but still a terribly guilty fun and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of this movie I knew it was in trouble. The stingy Power Rangers style Egyptian skull cork that looks at the Puppets 'Rita Repulsa style' through its pyramid glass, came straight out of the left field! All the additions to this franchise in this story were completely absurd! Suddenly, we have a huge variety of all kinds of new and random characters and plots that are far from the first three movies. I seriously doubt that when the first puppeteer was recorded, the authors had visions to one day see an Egyptian Power Rangers villain, totem monsters, annoyingly twenty somethings that can't seriously act (and are supposed to be brilliant scientists, but never to say anything intelligent), and a crippled "Decapitron" puppet whose head can come into the ghost of Toulon. <br /> <br /> Another thing that disappointed me a lot in this movie is that it totally ignores what happened in the last entry (Part II, since III was a prequel). Suddenly, the dolls are back at Bodega Bay Inn, back in their case (little Blade), and Toulon is for some reason willing to help his dolls (he betrays them in Part II for his love for Elsa). It is not completely explained ... and thus, and all these other rubbish thrown in, I am no longer amused. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of ridiculous B movies, a connoisseur if you like. I even collect laser discs from rare B movies you can't get on DVD. So it takes a lot for me to say that this is one of the most absurd movies I've ever seen in my life. I still love the dolls, the original, Blade, Tunneler, Pinhead, Jester and the rest, and if they just held on to what they had rather than trying to fix something that wasn't broken, well, the Series can still be alive and in good health. That being said, although the reviews aren't that good, I'm really interested in checking Puppet Master Retro, sounds like an interesting one that pays homage to the original themes.
