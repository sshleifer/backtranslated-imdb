I read a few months ago about the Left Behind series and made a mental note to investigate as I was interested in the way religion is used to control people in our increasingly hate-filled world. Imagine my surprise and joy when I found a copy of Left behind: World at War in my local library, which was innocent under the big budget action movies. <br /> <br /> Now, as a movie, it's extremely poor. The play is straight from a primary school production and the "special effects" would look dated in the early 90's. Being the third part of a series, the story would be incomprehensible to anyone who didn't see or read about the other left behind movies, and even with my previous knowledge, it was quite nice. <br /> <br /> On the religious front, I don't think anyone who is not already filled with the spirit of the Lord will find something in the movie to convince them to change their ways. How should you fear the Antichrist if he has a comedian Russian accent, and the worst of his forces is a little deceptive CGI? <br /> <br /> But my biggest problem with this movie is the blatant effort to try and push people to believe it's a big budget action movie. When I picked up the box and read the mirror, I immediately noticed something remarkable ... nowhere on the package was there any mention of the true nature of this movie. For someone who is not in the know, it would seem to all intent and pretend that Left behind: World at War was no different from the latest Tom Clancey. Also on the copy I rented, it said it was the third in a series. <br /> <br /> Considering the whole premise of the series is that the Antichrist has deceived the whole world, I find it extremely hypocritical that the filmmakers misled me twice before even getting the counter! If you are so strong in your beliefs, why not be honest? <br /> <br /> The simple fact is, it was not a "Christian" movie with the built-in fan base that goes with it, I seriously doubt that it would ever have seen the light of day. If Cloud Ten hopes to see the mistakes of my ways and give myself to God, I am afraid to say that I would die of boredom and / or laugh at myself before I ever had the opportunity.
