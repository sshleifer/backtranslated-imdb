In this follow-up to The Naked Civil Servant we see the last years of Quentin Crisp's life in New York. John Hurt is again Crisp (who else can play the role?) And it's a role he occupies to the point of disappearing. To me, Hurt Crisp and I have always found it very difficult to take the man himself because Hurt was more of him than he was. His masterful performance. His equal is Denis O'Hare as Phillip Steele, Crisp's long-time friend and trusted. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film outside the show recommended little. To be sure, the movie gets the details right. Filmed in and around New York the movie that looks and feels like New York and its surroundings, but dramatically its kind of inert. His crisis speaks to people who are meaningful, and tries to talk to the world as it is (he eventually regretted some poorly chosen words about AIDS) and coped with the weaknesses the older parent had. Quentin the man is always interesting, but his life as depicted is really not. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed with the movie. I always admired the man and his unique position. I just wish he was better served by this movie about his life.
