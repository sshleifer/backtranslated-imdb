I was pleasantly pleased with the end. I saw this movie yesterday, and go off, but change my mind. It was not the direction I thought the story would end. That's about all the positive things I can say about this movie. All actors are nobodys, especially starring. While she is an attractive young woman, she will never make it big. The writing, direction and acting are wooded, similar to what you would see on daily soaps. The filming stations were very smart to make you think it could be anywhere, instead of being conspicuous in Canada. As it was shot entirely in Canada, I assume the whole lot was Canada, which is not quite bad, as some recent Canadien TV productions: "Cold Squad", "Stone; Underover" were very well done.
