The story was clear and concise, but the film never saw my interests. Mr. Ghengis Khan has historically had a very interesting / epic life, but the film did not capture it, but rather focused on small screen shoots as a youth and a love story I think I have disguised in a lot of other movies. I never had sympathy or empathy for the lead - yes he had to overcome slavery, but he seemed to have had an easy ride to khanplunder, kill and double cross. The one who was redeeming quality was photography. The landscapes definitely helped the dark atmosphere of the movie, unfortunately combined with the darkness of the story. I left unaware and disappointed.
