This movie starts the way each movie should start, with a bunch of warm babies in a dormitory that walks around in their underwear and / or topless. Some of them take showers. I love it so far! Unfortunately we meet or head characters. They just do not love. Usually in these movies the actresses do not really play, they give many "natural" performances, and they are very sympathetic, fun and fun. Not here. They don't have much of any personality and I don't care much about them. <br /> <br /> Some of the girls go on a camping tour for school. On the way they stop at a baking station and meet a biker gang. The biker gang really had to be left out of the movie - it was rather cheesy, but now it's just stupid. The head cyclist looks like an older man dressed as Halloween for John Bon Jovi. The girls go to the forest and later the biker follows them. <br /> <br /> I don't really know what the heel is after. There are a lot of things around the world that end because it is the end of the millennium, then some of the bikers are killed by a mysterious Indian dude who disappears. Someone is eaten by a cute Lock Ness Monster thing while swimming over a lake. Some guys in dim makeup are apparently a druid, and he has to sacrifice some girls to prevent the end of the world. Or maybe the end of the world, I'm afraid I'm not paying much attention. First, he dressed up the girls in an animal lingerie. <br /> <br /> It could have been a very cute movie, but the epicenter devastated the atmosphere and the plot was so scattered that it didn't even. meet my grade Z schedule expectations. They had really eliminated half of the platinum elements and focused on only one or two things. Instead, it's all over the place. Overall, if you're looking for late 80's, I think you might be worse. If you tried very hard. There is a lot of nudity in the beginning, but the characters are kind of crumbs and the plot is too stupid to be even the least bit satisfying.
