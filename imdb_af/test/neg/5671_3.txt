I won't say the show is bad, because there are a few funny parts, like Spencer, and some random incidents. But unlike this, let's look at it, it's just another dry lounge where children buy. <br /> <br /> Miranda Cosgrove was cute and funny like Megan on Drake and Josh. Honestly, she's mediocre in ICarly and is just not as funny as she's trying to be. The actress who plays Sam mostly seems to be asleep, and her fiance is so clicked to think of them. They are not funny, just annoying. And Freddie is okay, but not that interesting. <br /> <br /> Of course, the situations are unrealistic, but it's not bad. Some are tricky. Here are some: <br /> <br /> 1. The girls are 14, and have a web show that has given away too much personal information, with a weekly audience of 27,000 (WTF), with little or no advertising , and they can still continue with their lives not being attacked by crazy people. <br /> 2.The website gets too much praise ($ 100,000 annually to advertise shoes, a free trip to Japan, Plain White Ts performance, and so on). Honestly anyone over 6 will not find their "comedy" entertainment. <br /> <br /> 3. How are they so "average" but they own a three-story loft, Spencer does almost nothing and can still afford many basic luxuries and they have all the equipment for a web application? 4. All adults are idiots. All of them. <br /> <br /> 5. No 5-foot-tall girl, no matter how stupid and stubborn, trained police can take down unless she is muscular. Sam is slim and small. <br /> <br /> 6. No one can move and live 9 stories in a lift. <br /> <br /> 7. Children can find out about criminals better than police. <br /> <br /> The show is stupid. Really, we seem to be harmless, but to make children think they can be against their parents lives alone in Seattle when they are just 14 with an irresponsible moron, and just give personal information wrong. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed to say that my cousin, who is 3, enjoys the show. What happened to the cartoons when I was her age?
