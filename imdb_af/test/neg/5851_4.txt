The advertisements for RAT RACE made it look too youthful for me to enjoy, but since my boyfriend worshiped this movie (and the soundtrack), I got it tonight and looked at him. I let him watch David Lynch movies and all kinds of obscure things (I recently forced Urran on him), so I felt I owed him an innocent Hollywood product. <br /> <br /> I didn't want his feelings, so I saved my bitch for y'alls. Yes, RAT RACE has its moments, but it made me very annoyed. Let's start at the beginning. RAT RACE was marketed as a "family movie", so I was a little surprised to discover that the first scene around a porn movie is centered. (I can hear it now: "Mama, what does AFRO WHORES mean?") This scene has no purpose in this movie, except to make a little dessert in a PG-13 movie. <br /> <br /> And while we're still on the segments in the casino, it's pretty convenient that all the characters have happened within the same time frame, the slots that kept the gold coins. What would have happened if they didn't? Will those millionaire players just move around and wait? And how did they first have the gold coins in the slots? <br /> <br /> But I'm writing a plot point needed for the movie to exist, so I'll print. About Whoopi and her long-lost daughter: They meet for the first time, but in their whole trial they don't talk about themselves. Why do their relationships make such a presumably complicated one? Couldn't they just be a mother and daughter on holiday? Why adopt the business for a long time ago? And why does the girl play as a hard-working woman connected to her cellphone, who never needs contact with her business again? Did the screenplay just forget about this subplot and traits? <br /> <br /> This illustrates the main weakness of this movie - the characters are inconsistent and interchangeable; It is tiring when everyone is equally and without identifying features. And another thing - the events are not acceptable. Oh, sure, the characters can do some strange things, but the characters themselves must be credible. Take the NAKED GUN (for example a Jerry Zucker movie). Frank Drebin has a few exaggerated moments, but everything he does is in theory possible in his world. (Jane is also funny, but it's another kind of funny thing that makes the difference.) A character in RAT RACE that violates natural laws by jumping a fast train destroys any likelihood the movie may have; it is clearly not real people, so why do I care about them? <br /> <br /> Another problem I have with RAT RACE is a moral one. The characters get their vehicles almost completely by theft. I know, it's just a foolish comedy, and the same action didn't bother me fifteen years ago when I saw MILLION DOLLAR mystery, but there are many legal proceedings in RAT RACE, and that makes me difficult. And I will not move into the entire airport sabotage empire, except to wonder if the authors have not considered the real implications of such action; was the scene funny before 9/11? <br /> <br /> I'll beat the insatiable bits of the heart, the stupor of your family and the Nazis (whose build-up and payout worked better in an episode of Seinfeld "), and continue to Rowan Atkinson started irritatingly and ended up impenetrable, I don't know when I had a comic character, and the three Oscar winners needed new agents, Whoopi did the best, but she didn't have much to work with (love the copper perm and purple lipstick though); Kathy Bates's part was shrill, but graciously short, Cuba, was ... o man, Cuba, babe, please kindly fire your agent! CHILL FACTOR, this is your third strike (be glad I didn't see PEARL HARBOR or SNOW DOG) - it's time to give your '97 Best Supporting Actor Oscar back to his rightful owner (Edward Norton, for PRIMAL FEAR). An actor of your stature has no business running half-naked through the desert checked by a transvestite Lucille Ball mimic. Do you read the scripts even more in your movies, or do you get into a bag and randomly pull out your next project? <br /> <br /> There are other small issues that bother me (how did Grisham and the hooker get it? to the loot so fast?), but basically, RAT RACE is little more than your basic group of types typed by arbitrary Obstacles on the way go to a rather inconspicuous and inexplicable end. They give the money to charity? What kind of end is it?!? Yes, it's the "noble" thing to do. Never keep in mind the likelihood of cross-promotion / license holders Smash Mouth (do they ever say no to sell out?) An inexpensive concert in the middle of the New Mexico desert, but who would be honest? Yes, they say it's the trip, not the destination, it makes the trip worthwhile, but there is no trip without a destination. If there was ever a "wrong happy ending," it would be. What a bummer ends on a movie I enjoyed, despite my nitpicking here (I confess that I enjoy the little with the cow and some of the Lucy stuff with the character with the piercing of the tongue - speech would set me up a wall, but he became my favorite). <br /> <br /> But as far as my boyfriend knows, I found RAT RACE very funny and charming. <br /> <br />
