** Possible Spoilers ** Three youngsters on the wrong side are given the opportunity to turn their lives around and become useful members of society by staying in the Mod Squad, a resurrection of the hit series of the? 60's, directed by Scott Silver. Given their fewer than star backgrounds, and by whom they are and the people they know, Julie Barnes (Claire Danes), Pete Cochran (Giovanni Ribisi) and Lincoln Hayes (Omar Epps) can go places where other police can't get by Captain Adam Greer (Dennis Farina) embarked on infiltrating a creepy night spot that is thought to be a forerunner to a prostitution ring. For a start, Julie gets a waitress there, while Pete and Linc just 'hang' to find out what they are allowed. July is quickly recognized by an old boyfriend, Billy Waites (Josh Brolin), apparently involved in drugs tied to the shade that goes into the bar. Before it is over, the "team" is in their necks while also running a bunch of wrong police involved in the drug and consequently joining in with their investigation. From the start of the movie there is a feeling that you are coming; as if you're supposed to know what's about the origin and operation of the team. All you get here is short cup-shots-bios of the three that give you nothing more than a glimpse of their past; There is nothing about how it all really happened. The thought was probably that it would lead into the story as soon as possible so that things could move. Although true to some extent, a few additional backgrounds would have made the texture of the story a little more interesting; The way it is done here forgets just the credibility of the whole proceedings. The plot is marginal to start with, and any time spent on character development would have been worth it. What is rendered, and quite unattractive, is a less than compelling story filled with one-dimensional characters. The performances are satisfactory, but the actors don't get any help from the script or apparently from Silver. Danes, Ribisi and Epps come close to Julie, Pete and Linc, but with the time they have allocated, coupled with the lack of support, they still fail to make these people live. Farina, a good actor who earns better than he gets here, comes out as nothing more than a caricature of the 'good policeman'. There is a feeling that everything is given once in this movie; A little detail and nuance would have driven the stock considerably on this one. The supporting film includes Richard Jenkins (Detective Mothershed), Steve Harris (Briggs), Larry Brandenburg (Eckford), Lionel Mark Smith (Lanier) and Sam McMurray (Tricky). It's a pity to see the acting talent involved here being wasted; A lot more thought and planning should have gone into making this movie. As it is, it comes across as poorly understood and poorly executed. Danes, Ribisi and Epps are like the great Leaguers who have stuck to all the marbles at the local sandlot; Instead of getting a shot on the title, they all hung to dry. As Terry says in "On The Waterfront," "You were my brother, Charlie, you had to look at me. "Well, it's obvious that Charlie doesn't look out for them, and after" The Mod Squad "they can only hope they can get better next time. I rate this one 1/10.
