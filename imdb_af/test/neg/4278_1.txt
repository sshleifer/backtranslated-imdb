For anyone reading this book, Fanny Price ends with her own wife, a beautiful woman ... with a brain. Le Touzel seems to be on medication. Terrible acting, she just ruins it! Henry is a little long for his character. He is too small. Mary Crawford is brilliant. Edmond is a little too old. Mrs. Norris is hysterical. OK, this decision decision works. Rushworth is also perfect. Yates also look slightly. But, Le Touzel is simply awful. It's not a good character for her. Poor Fanny! I will only recommend this movie because it contains an almost complete text account of the language Austen uses in the novel. The 1999 version is much more fun, but terribly incomplete. If they could repeat this version with a more suitable actress for Fanny, it would be fantastic!
