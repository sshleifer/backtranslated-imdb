I caught it on HBO under his category of "Guilty Pleasures", and I would agree I felt guilty. One, it's trash, and really dirty trash. Two, the plot is slow and predictable and once you learn "who did it", you think, "So what?". However, I have to admit that I am enough to have a male chauvinist pig who wants to sit through what is, of course, a poor film, than to for no other reason than to see Peta Wilson quite a few times completely become bare. Do I feel dirty because I watched it? Yes. Am I sorry I watched it? No. There is a discrepancy between a good movie lover and a female anatomy lover, even when in a poor movie. Sigh!
