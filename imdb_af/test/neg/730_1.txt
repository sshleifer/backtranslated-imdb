It's an absolutely terrible excuse for a show. People say its spiritual and intelligence? I don't see how? Maybe because the characters use fancy words? Perhaps because they are snooty, use dry humor and have 2-dimensional personalities. I went to an Ivy League school and no one was as stupid as these characters did. In fact, I met someone like them, I would probably strangle them! The men act like little emotional pre-teen girls and all minority characters are based on stereotypes ... The characters are NO AT ALL AUTHENTIC. Simply put, they sound like a trailer family trying to be rich and sophisticated. This show is just another cookie cutter hit that eats the brain-dead first-time viewers on a regular basis.
