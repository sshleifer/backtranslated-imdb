This movie is very convincing. It's a low budget, poorly written, a piece of senseless rubbish. But on Saturday afternoon, I stumbled across it on TV, but I've always kept in mind as one of the most entertaining I've ever spent on television. The bad thing about this movie is epic - maybe not Ed Wood epic, but close. The premise is hysterical (men are banned from being too dangerous and captured in the!! Soccer stadiums), the pseudo-dyke culture is bizarre. There is an underground sex trade with women who dress like men to serve deviants. "" and the "last man" of the title is a pitiful reincarnation of Rocky from Rocky Horror Picture Show. I have not seen the end of it, what I have to accept was so drowsy with syrupy "which we all learned ? nonsense it will get the urge, but everything in the first two thirds was so memorably bad, even though the last third seems to be a pale imitation of the rest, it's still worth it for anyone kicking get out of campy, stupid, brainless sci-fi B-flicks.
