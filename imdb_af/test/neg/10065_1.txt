The adventures of Hercules must be one of the most fun excuses for a movie I still overflow. You will have to look far and wide to find anything that approaches the level of uncertainty displayed in this movie. Acting? Not bad. Edit ?? Not bad. Direction ?? Not bad. Special effects ?? Bad and Laughable. Complete ?? Not bad. Lighting ?? Not bad. Kinematografie ?? Not bad. Costume design ?? Bad and Silly. Everything else? Not bad. Watching the adventures of Hercules is about as enjoyable as a root canal. Even for a fan of bad movies, it's a true endurance test. It's one for masochists or Lou Ferrigno finishers (if any). Eight things I've learned to watch The Adventures of Hercules: <br /> <br /> 1. If you don't have the budget for the right special effects, the rotoscope can be a scene from the previous movie. It will look good - trust me. <br /> <br /> 2. When looking for the repair of Zeus thunderbolts, take time to stop oiling your body regularly. It worked for Ferrigno and his two Amazone companions. <br /> <br /> 3. Any sword fight, use of magic, and just about all other daily activities in ancient Greece, created a sound that is very much like a game of Pac Man or Asteroids. <br /> <br /> 4. Some of the ancient Greek gods dressed like extras from Star Wars. <br /> <br /> 5. If you need your crappy movie's run time, extend the title line by adding Star Trek style credits and throw in some avid music. It also helps if you have a previous movie to pull out scenes. <br /> <br /> 6. Fight scenes move much smoother than the bad guys Hercules one at a time attack. <br /> <br /> 7. William Berger did anything for money. <br /> <br /> 8. I didn't think it was possible, but The Adventures of Hercules made the first film, Hercules (1983), resembling an Oscar winner.
