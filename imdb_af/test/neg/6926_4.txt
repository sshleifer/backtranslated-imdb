I looked so much, a big fan of the book. But when it came out, I remember it was one of the biggest money and time I ever had at the theater. <br /> <br /> In principle, the acting, the sets and the music were excellent. , and is the main reason why I evaluate this 4. <br /> <br /> In this version, Sara is a bit too self-sacrificing for my taste. There is no way she deliberately lied to Miss Minchin just to stop her from rebuking the other girls; In the book she makes a point of describing lies as "not only wicked, but vulgar." <br /> <br /> There is also too much of a Disney party ending for me; Sara's father comes back from the dead and everyone caresses off to the Indian sunset. While the book is happy (and critics may be equally unlikely) end, don't let that think, "Oh puh-leeze." <br /> <br /> The only things the book was about were: <br /> <br /> 1. Sara's father is a soldier 2. The lines between Sara and her father ("Do you teach me of heart? "/" No, I know you heartily. You are in my heart. ") 3. Sara's friendship with Becky, and her" adoption "Lottie (although the last one is not so much developed) 4. The change from her room by adding several luxury items. That part was done wonderfully. 5. The basic core - a rich girl who is suddenly thrown into poverty, is there, but it's all about it. People can say that this adjustment is more for the younger audience. Possible. All I can say is that I have two cousins ​​- 7 and 12 years old - who were great supporters of this movie until they read the book. <br /> <br /> If all you want is a 'feel good' family movie, then deliver it. If you're looking for a movie that actually tells the story of a little princess (if you've read the book), don't waste time with this one. It is such a shame; with such a role, if they had at least kept the basic story, it could have been fantastic. <br /> <br /> I read 'read the book' and read the book a bit too much? Most likely. But if someone tries to fit a book - especially such a classic - into a movie, then they must have done the same thing. Preferably more than once.
