Early Jackie Chan movie where there is no sign of the Chan persona we know. It is full of traditional revenge stories of the kind cloned by many producers and studios cloned by Hong Kong Taiwan and China. It's a very serious story that shows nothing of the humor and warmth that Jackie Chan would take to superstorms. It's also clear that he didn't see it if he didn't have a chance. We would never know him, because his career would have been painfully short. As a film on its own merits, it is a beautiful but beautiful, imperceptible film. I watched it, in the midst of an everyday marathon of martial arts movies and it would merge with every other movie I saw that day I didn't notice Jackie in the movie. Honestly I don't think the movie is really worth it (there are too many other better variations), unless you are interested in seeing Jackie Chan start.
