It was a 1970s-type irreverent comedy, poker fun at the psychiatric profession and at Beverly Hills. I didn't do that, but I objected to more that marriage and religion irregularity: two topics that secular filmmakers (meaning everyone in Hollywood and elsewhere) can't stop. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau plays a crooked character, "Donald Becker," walking around with a spiritual collar, insulting me, but when did Hollywood ever worry about Christian offense? <br /> <br /> In any case, despite the nonsense, the film has its entertaining moments and even a few charms for it. Dan Aykroyd is good to pay a goat and Donna Dixon ("Laura Rollins") is a knockout. I'm sorry she didn't have a bigger role.
