Danny is sorry. <br /> <br /> He still keeps the same mistakes and is no longer interesting to look at. Initially I could feel him as an addict himself. My heart went out at the beginning, and somewhere along the line he went over the line. It is almost as if he is continuing this behavior to hold the show, and at the same time his life is seriously dangerous and the welfare of his family, especially his children. It is hard to be sorry for the poor boy. I think he should watch this show, maybe he might have a chance to save this marriage. I can't understand how Gretchen lives with him, and I wonder how much is just for the show, and how much is love. Danny, get a life - a new one! ... and don 't mind me. Gary didn't start. What's with him and his face? His skin looks like it is stretched to the maximum. In addition, it doesn't seem to matter, but it doesn't seem to be particularly impartial. I also think he likes it for his own money and often not in the best interests of Gretchen or Danny. These people are little confused and each one reminds me of a dog pursuing its tail. sad, very sad. Come, get along.
