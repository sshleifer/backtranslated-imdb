I'm very disappointed because I expected a real ride as promised in the many reviews. The writing is very bad with many holes and the direction too. The director failed to develop every violent scene with excitement and excitement. It is very difficult to follow a wannabe thriller. So I had to see how each bullet was spent without giving me meaning. I always asked what kind of movie I was watching. Then I didn't like that she smoked one cigarette aggressively, but perhaps the role was partly supported by the tobacco industry. The end is also very disappointing. I can't understand how Jodie Foster could be nominated in the worst role of her life for the Golden Globe. Jodie, that's why I love PANIC ROOM or FLY PLAN. It's definitely one of the worst things I've ever seen. 10/04.
