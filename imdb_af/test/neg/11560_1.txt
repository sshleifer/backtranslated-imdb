Some movies are just plain stupid, beyond the explanation. This is one of them. Words can't do justice to the woodworking, silly plot line, and predictable outcome. About the only thing that makes this movie halfway worth looking at is the slenderly dressed women (and the dumb guy for your ladies) in it. The leader of the warrior women and Valeria are quite attractive to the eye. But it's all about this movie going for it. <br /> <br /> Some foolishness in the point: One scene, when they start at the Dark One camp, runs away from a supposedly destroyed land. But we clearly see an 1980s New York behind them. About 2/3 of this movie looks like it has been filmed in a high school cellar. The deadly socks look as scary as a sesame monster. I have to agree with Latronic because the evil films of many 1950's b-movie did better work than that. The only one I can think of was not teenagers from outer space.
