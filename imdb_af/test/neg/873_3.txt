* Warning: 1 small insignificant spoiler * You are right. It was not Bridges or Madison County. Once the lonely woman and Richard Gere looked at the big empty hotel, it was a finished conclusion, something that would be fun. The question is: how will this happen? The answer is a few stupid connect-the-spots stories that aren't worth going through. In a supposed tire experience, they become drunk and clean the closet of old cans. (It was my spoiler.) And the next day they held them back. LOL It wasn't fully compelling. I'm an old married lady like the one in the movie and MY friendships are more interesting than her romance with Richard Gere. LOL. . . This had the advantage. You walk away and go, oh brother. . . even I could have written something more credible than that. I think my life is not as dull as I thought it would be if I could spot a romance with Richard Gere. LOL! And that friend inherited the completely contemporary, probably computer-generated cottage, resting half in the ocean, from her grandmother who built it after civil war? Maybe her grandmother is Oprah and it was WAY after the Civil War? And yes, WHERE was the epic? What alternative universe do these people live in? I never want to see another movie that pretends we don't have email, and Facebook, and text messages. And okay, maybe these people have a horrible aversion to delivering news on the phone, but don't let me believe in this time of direct communication that someone just falls into your life without calling first.
