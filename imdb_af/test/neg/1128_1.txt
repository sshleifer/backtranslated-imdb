It must be the worst piece I've ever seen. Randy Quaid is funny as a supporting actor in the original, but not as the foremost. Too much Eddie. The original is a classic. Like the original, the supporting actor performed the show. Ed Asner was very funny. He is the Eddie or Christmas Vaction 2! How Snots still look the same after all the years and everyone in the original looks 14 years older. After 15 minutes watching this movie, I don't believe I've laughed. The island thing just didn't work. If it wasn't for the beautiful South Pacific female guide on the island, the movie would be a total loss. I sat on this review for a week and yes, I still think the movie should never be made. Let's hope there isn't a THIRD! <br /> <br /> Shawn Gearin
