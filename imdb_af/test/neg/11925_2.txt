Critics have begun to call it the Oscar Winner club, understandable. What after Halle Berry won it for Monsters Ball, then go straight to the diabolical Catwoman. Hilary Swank triumphs in boys. Don't cry and follow it with The Core. Jamie Foxx takes a nosedive as a pilot in the dull Stealth after buying a gong for Ray. Now it looks like Hollywood Starlet has made Charlize Theron all about her "Monster" Oscar with this one of the worst Sci-Fi glasses ever made. <br /> <br /> The movie loses its audience interest after just 20 minutes, meaning the only one. The thing that is worth staying in is the fact that, despite the film, Charlize Theron is an exceptional actress making the best of a rough and laughable premise. Nieon is finally Æon Flux flat but for an action movie it's really really boring. It will actually only appeal to comedy fans and Horney teenagers, who seek Theron's 90-minute half-note idea. Flux only really succeeds in the failure. <br /> <br /> Against the 2011 virus killing 99% of the world's population, and in the last city on earth, Bregna, the survivors, about four hundred years later, in the year 2415, remains in the Goodchild -dinastics, the name of the scientist who developed his drug, continues to live. <br /> <br /> Though not good at this utopia, it is not what lies beyond its high walls that binds its citizens to the never-ending jungle, but binds unspoken, unwritten taboo that holds this unwritten taboo keep and bind these unlucky ones, which lie within these walls of paranoia, conformity and indisputable obedience. It is a story against a totalitarian state, a walled city, where its peoples are no longer able to reproduce, and it is ironic and filmed in Berlin. It is a sinister and most secret plan of how it lives. <br /> <br /> Æon Flux is the assassin assigned by the underground rebels to change the course of humanity forever. This is the story of her struggle for justice, freedom and revenge. <br /> <br /> Æon Flux has combined lousy narratives, ropy pacing and truly lethal effects. Look more like an unrealistic video game rather than a movie. The only thing that is happy with the failure is that there are no prosecutions in the works. Flux may just be the start and end of what could have been one of the worst franchises in history. Thanks for the lousy box office takings. <br /> <br /> My final verdict on this truly common feature? There's really no story here, just Charlize Theron jumps into a black suit like a grasshopper. The play is very wood-moronical and emotional compared to the other theater that is there today. It tries too much to be like an adaptation and doesn't really take much of the cartoon. That's what I expected. The only thing half done right, giving tribute to the cartoon, was the fly in the eye scene. Avoid at all costs.
