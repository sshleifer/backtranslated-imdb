A friend and I went to see this movie when it came out in 1980. It was in a big theater and we were the only two people in the place. It lasted two days in the theater before they stopped showing it. It was so bad we laughed about it completely. Since then, we've been filming Kill or Be Kill movies as the worst movie of all time. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's so bad it's funny. It's not worth getting a second look. I can't just give it more than a 1, because I don't think the makers of the movie are meant to be that bad and I can't give credit for an accident. Sorry.
