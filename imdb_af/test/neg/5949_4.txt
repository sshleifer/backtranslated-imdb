Anthony Perkins and Sophia Loren are absolutely beautiful in this ca. 1840 "West". However, this alone does not help a ridiculous story, with countless historically wrong elements. Byrl Ives is convincing as the 70-something tyrannical patriarch, an egoism swearing to see his 100th birthday. His wild dance at a festival he gives his neighbors will let someone know (this man is sixty-six). Bible verse always mumbles, he demands respect, moving away boys and friends with his self-righteous rations and emotional atrocities. <br /> <br /> The love relationship between Perkins and Loren only looks absurd, but becomes credible near the end. There is a lot of drama, but not enough to feel good. This story is clearly written for the stage, even when filmed. Perkins flutes "My Bonnie" in the 1840s, although the song was not compiled until 1882. <br /> <br /> Critics who beat Sophia Lorens's command of the English language are quite small. I found her English flawless and completely audible. As a Neapolitan, Loren speaks a clear dialect that is often dubbed in "proper Italian". However, her "accent" doesn't affect how she speaks English. As a first generation German American, I can appreciate those who learn English as a second or even third or fourth language. <br /> <br /> "Desire Under The Elms" is a drama (or even a tragedy) in the Classic Sense. For my enjoyment, a logical story and a complete down payment for the time invested are missing. Fans of the stars will not miss it, but others vote at their own risk!
