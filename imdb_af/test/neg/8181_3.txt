After watching Avalon (which was just fit for the very good digital fx), and several anime movies written by Oshii, including Jin-Roh (which is fantastic), I decided to watch the Oshii theater trilogy set . As the Red Spectacles and Stray Dog are related, I will comment on this. And let me tell you, it was one of the biggest waste products I spent in a while. I first watched Stray Dogs and then The Red Spectacles. I'm sad to say that these movies are probably the most boring two movies I've ever seen. For just about 10 minutes in each movie, you get some action among the characters just dressed in the Panzer Cop outfits for some fleeting scenes. For the rest of the time you will see some very select scenes filled with dull dialogue in some less than impressive places. I do not understand the motivation behind these two films at all. I love the Wolf Brigade outfits and the idea behind the plot, but the movies leave much to be desired. I suggest NOT watching these movies, and definitely do not buy the box as I did unless you enjoy wasting money. Oh, and if you're wondering what I think of the 3rd movie in the set, Talking Head, I couldn't even see to see it before I deleted the box of my DVD collection via eBay at a $ 20 loss no. If you want a cool Japanese lively action, look back, or Ichii the Assassin or the Zeiram series.
