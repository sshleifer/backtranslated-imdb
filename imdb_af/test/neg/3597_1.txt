I don't understand the humor in this movie. I also found it offensive about how Koreans were portrayed in that movie, despite the fact that it is just a caricature of Koreans in those areas. First, the actors are Japanese, and they make the most rude expressions of Koreans in that movie. It conveys me about how these people are expressed. I felt anger just watching that one scene and how they were so bad in the movie. The humor only lasts for one laugh, and then you do not understand why it is even funny. It is rough humor with the most disgusting representation of society there. I found it was an attacking movie overall ... Maybe it was just because I never lived in the hood or seen a "hood" movie, but I'm not going to do it either.
