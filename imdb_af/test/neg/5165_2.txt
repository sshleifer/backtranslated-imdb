For all his wonderful images, for all his good intentions, it just comes down as another disgusting one-sided, glorified, self-propagating propaganda. <br /> <br /> The message is simple, "All Japanese Fighting on the Kokoda track was sadistic, malicious f-sticks that kept every last Aussie gang busy. They cut their throat before they "Kokoda not only fails on Gallipoli's only fault (that the enemy is faceless, nameless and apparently inhumane), but manages to prove the opposite of Weir's masterpiece. Instead of giving us a perfect movie with one mistake, we have a horrible mess with one redeeming feature. <br /> <br /> Let's start with this: we are without any comfortable adaptation to the characters who are apparently completely laid back, two-dimensional people we will never ever ... sympathize with. We are kept so far that even when we relate so easily to the characters, they find a way to keep us away. This alone is a sickly feature, as it drives us off the plot, helping the terrible pacing to leave us with a lasting impression, and making it so much easier to contrast between an open sentimental end and an otherwise slender body of a <br /> <br /> In other words, it drags us through a painful journey (not just for us, but apparently for them) and just as it ends, we become in another Eye roll of a skirmish ending faster than it started. So, for the still ignorant: when it ends, it starts again, just to end when we expect more. S ***! It's just a confusing and confusing fit! <br /> <br /> What brings me to the ultimatum: It is meant to educate us on the events of the Kokoda circuit. It doesn't come close. Not only does it describe a very small, insignificant part of the campaign (a bit of "mateship" on top in the effort to make it relevant), but it manages to do the one thing that makes a movie so important as it should, It doesn't mind us. <br /> <br /> Honestly, my eyes are constantly glued to my watch all the time. The audience around me, all proudly Australian, has come to visit when they come across how big the movie will be, moaning, moaning and knocking in disappointment, because each of the painful ninety-five minutes gets drunk (for a short while , it felt like Apocalypse Now: difference is that Apocalypse It was now a good movie and deserved the three hours it got) and to the point where suicide wholeheartedly would be an alternative, it should be mandatory for this movie to see. <br /> <br /> However, considering how much the TV has placed this waste, I would say it is compulsory, in a subliminal sense. <br /> <br /> See if you want nice images. Although you will look better at The Constant Gardener or Gallipoli, as they have superior cinematography and real estate. <br /> <br /> Overall: *
