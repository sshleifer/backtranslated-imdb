This successor is quite terrible to be honest. I'm a fan of kung-fu movies and it's by far the worst thing I've seen. Bride with white hair 1 was pretty good and that is a big disappointment. BWWH 1 was somehow brilliant with a unique, bad bad old bad ball. <br /> <br /> The first film couple played a small role in this movie. Instead, the movie revolves around a bunch of uninteresting characters seeking revenge on their fallen clans. But there is no opponent in this movie, so revenge is dumb. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie is the kung-fu or lack thereof. They literally had a knife fight against street style. The character at the end refused to fight because there was a lack of choreography.
