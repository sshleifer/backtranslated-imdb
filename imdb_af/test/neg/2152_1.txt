I simply can't believe the people who made and performed in this movie really took it seriously. The sketches on SNL look more real. Everything was legally false. The goofy gunfights, the ridiculous fist fights, the dialogue, the juicy background music, and even Bo's blind eye. If it was charged as a comedy, it would have made even more sense, but it would still be bad. I can only see it as entertainment if you get a room full of stoned college kids who see it as rocky horror picture show. Imagine some of the things you saw on Blazing Saddles, like Mongo knocking off the horse or the old lady gettinf stomach punch. Imagine now that the producer wants you to take the scenes seriously and you get the yeasts from this disaster.
