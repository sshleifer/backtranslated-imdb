It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. They said it was the man's answer to waiting to get out. All I'm going to say is that we didn't respond at all. I couldn't believe it was actually made. The director has to choose another profession, because he can't make a movie. The writing wasn't good. It had no sense and was very messy. Bet movies are much better than it was, and I was terribly disappointed to see the talented actor Terrence in this bad movie excuse. If I could turn back the hands of time, I wouldn't go back to Media Play to never buy the movie, but I would just put it on the shelf instead of wasting my time.
