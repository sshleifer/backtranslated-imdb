I'm a big fan of surreal art, but this movie by Bunuel (with some Dali ideas) left me cold. Bunuel had a lifelong resentment against the Catholic Church and was pleased to insult Catholics in a reasonably quiet way. This is one of those silliest; almost like you would expect from a smart-aleck 18-year-old in movie class. The last few minutes of the movie, which has nothing to do with anything else, is a final nose on religion. <br /> <br /> If you read the "scholars" about this slow, sometimes amusing movie, it's all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual oppression. If that is indeed the point, Bunuel is pushing it into the most round mode. The central male character is a nasty brute who loves shoe dogs and knocks blind men in the street, and who mentally changes billboard advertisements into strange sexual fantasies. Is this behavior the church's fault (to interrupt its love interruption), or is it just a while? I agree with the latter. I think Bunuel had had many personal hang-ups and chose the Catholics as theirs. <br /> <br /> There are a few moments where you can cry, "Aha! Surrealism!": A cow in a bed, a giraffe falling from a window (a poor model), a man who flashes a spring cushion, a woman who rinses a toilet while we see pictures of a lava lava (or a mud pit ... hard to tell in B / W). The rest is forgotten self-confidence. Unfortunately, Bunuel still pursued the same pursuers for the rest of his career (Viridiana, Discreet Charm ...). If you're interested in seeing surrealism on the screen, check out Jean Cocteau's early work.
