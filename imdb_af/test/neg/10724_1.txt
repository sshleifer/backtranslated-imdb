What a terrible burn. Not just the title, but the idea is the same as the Jane Fonda, George Segal's several decades ago. Why? I wonder if someone with the luck of Jim Carrey will not only star, but also produce this tired, ugly, useless excuse for a comedy. He can take comedy at a whole new level, but rather go for what he can assume as a safe territory. Money, money, gross, Christmas. But I'm sure this awkward mess will have very short legs. I call it uncomfortable, because that's how I felt. Be aware of the desperate efforts that are being tried on the screen to be funny. And failed. It could have been an exorbitant, politically wrong, mirror comedy of the post-Enron days, but no, it would be too high, too risky. What a pity!
