First, I want to explain that I considered this one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I watched it almost 10 times, just because I wanted to distribute the nice tasteless interiors of this movie to other unsuspecting victims. It has the fascinating essence of a hand-camera distant cousin's seventh birthday. It has been writing a WWE game. And most importantly, it has the consistency of a face scraped off a sidewalk. This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with an almost instantaneous mutilation of three drunk teenagers in the desert. This scene convinced me that I was on something great when I selected this movie from the DVD shelf (signed to the box due to the graphic version of a velociraptor shouting the word "RAPTOR" on the front). The scene contains such treasures as tomato sauce, spaghetti bowels, vain humor and rubbery dinosaur dolls that are repeated in the course of the movie. This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The movie contains erratic backgrounds and stuffs that cause man's thoughts to melt at the thought that someone can be as little as shy when it comes to creating a movie. An example is when a truck is parked along a cliff wall in the middle of the night. The next day they found it in an open lawn. The driver couldn't have managed it there, as he cut off his face through an nameless two-headed carnivore (I'll explain why it is second to none). So, my only guess is that either the velociraptor managed it, the cattle that the driver transported, did it, or Jim Wynorski didn't think very much of his viewers. Hell, in one part, they expect me to believe that they walk in the main street at night when the road does not have gutters, the fire hydrant is placed next to a phone cabin and there is only one street light. Yet I still feel compelled to watch and watch this movie just so I can get more stuff that will giggle me next time. This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Directing this movie is terrible. Long extended breaks. Strange cuts to characters who were not even in the general environment of the conversation. People talk unconditionally while facing the camera (and in turn they face the wall). They can't even give the dinosaur a cohesive species, while calling a baby dinosaur and using a rubber velocirapto (distinguished by the intense long, fat, disproportionate claw). This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Editing is prominent on this movie. It's not a good thing. I am well aware that the film is a collection of scenes from other films, masterfully made in a piece of crap, but there must be a limit! Subplots end up as suddenly as they started. Explanations for the sudden disappearance of characters are not limited to, and not at all! And an end that felt like driving a muscle car in a brick wall without a seat belt. You never know what is going to happen, because the film does not follow a coherent structure. This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Now I'm just going to call a single scene (the biggest one) near the end. It's a spoiler, but not really. The final scene features a show between Tyrannosaurus Rex and Sheriff Tanner. It's like the show between Sigourney Weaver and the Alien Queen in Aliens, except without all the emotional power / budget / epic struggle. It consists of Tanner rattling the dinosaur with a piece of construction machinery. A white bobcat. In a few minutes, the director managed to watch the white bobcat in a yellow forklift / crane. Now, as I said, I know that this film is made from screens from other movies, but which two films justify a t-rex demonstration in a construction vehicle? This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> This movie gets a 1/10 for the quality of filmmaking, but a 10/10 for how much it makes me laugh and enjoy.
