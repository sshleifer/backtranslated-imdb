The child was born delayed. It moves in half-dozen directions, features dialogue and action that is being lifted from many older and better-known flops, and maybe it's funny. If the writers just know funny, Disney got things. A lot better in the last few decades, but don't be fooled. They had to give the child a wide cabin, it sang a lullaby, then let the train run into a ravine. Grace dead.
