The original "Psycho" (1960) is widely regarded as Alfred Hitchcock's best work and definitely, in my opinion, one of the best movies of all time. The decision to shoot a shot through a school kit is therefore somewhat surprising. <br /> <br /> The original movie was flawless, so the role of this remake has lived a lot. Vince Vaughn and Norman Bates were not a good choice for the head. He is too much of a beautiful boy and is not very convincing as assets. I think actors like Mark Wahlberg or John Turturro are doing a much better job. Anne Heche as Marion Crane does a deserving job, but one keeps her wise to Janet Leigh. Julianne Moore is a much better actress than she shows here and Viggio Mortenson just walks through his role. The best of this new cast is William H. Macy as private detective. <br /> <br /> Although director Gus Van Sant is doing an acceptable job, he can't build the tension that Hitchcock has done. And why did he change the scene in the basement of the house? In the original, the atmosphere is dark and damp and covered, while in this version it occurs in a brightly lit laboratory-like environment. And I think the black-and-white photography of the original has a definite advantage over the color version. <br /> <br /> Perhaps another mistake might be the fact that most moviegoers have seen the original and know what is going to happen and when. <br /> <br /> All I can say is if it's not broken, don't fix it. <br /> <br />
