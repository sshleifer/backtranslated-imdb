Terrible movie. Not terrible. The beginning of this movie is like something from a bad woman in prison. Then it's a B-movie version of Aliens. B-movie in this case means adding free sex scenes and women in lingerie. Oh, and many of the footage is exactly the same as that used in two other films by the same company (including women in prison schtick). The only thing to save this 1/10 movie is that I actually saw worse movies. Not much, and not much, but worse.
