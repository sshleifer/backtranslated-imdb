I'm sure any lawful interlocutor would send out on the USOS Seaview (yes, SOS ...). Why play perfect basketball in the torpedo room, it's so big. And how about the bay windows in the arch, the better are giant flowers or myths out of nowhere? Did I mention the colorful junk food with the parrot on his shoulder? And the admiral's porch with what seems to be a loft? Big shining sub ... <br /> <br /> OK, OK ... it will never win any authenticity prizes. And if the sub is ridiculous, the plot is even worse. Somehow, the Van Allen bands of radiation, "hundreds of miles in space," "fired," the global warming will look like a ween-roast. Pompous Admiral Nelson (Walter Pidgeon), along with his sidekick Lucius (Peter Lorre, who does not really look uncomfortable) make a scheme to fire the fire by firing a missile in his waist. <br /> <br /> There are many intricacies along the way, with a surviving survivor (and his puppy too!) two "ladies" who can never leave enough, a pass of "red shirts" "that can be exhausted and holes big enough for Godzilla to walk through. Excitement to the Seaview is being rushed to what looks like another sub 60 km per hour - no need for advanced sonar when you can follow 100 feet. <br /> <br /> The movie goes from one rock hanger to another; The payout is so anti-clumsy that it is senseless, certainly not the 1 hour and 50 minutes wait. <br /> <br /> The technical consultant for this shipwreck had to be a 14-year-old boy with a stack of Popular Mechanics magazines. Worth to watch, rather than just reefing.
