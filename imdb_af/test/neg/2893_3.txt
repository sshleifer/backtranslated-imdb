It's a really really bad movie. However, it is good to laugh at the terrible ideas and "special" effects. The plot centers around an EU space agency that discovers a 10th planet that orbits the Earth. They send a manipulated mission (they were to Mars and have not yet discovered this planet? Is there anyone who is foolish to attack?) On the planet and can you believe it, this is the mirror image of the planet from which they came. Most everything is predictable from that point. Right from the title of the movie you can just guess just about everything. The only surprising thing here is a controlled space program run by Eurpoeans :) There can really be no excuse for the plot concept or execution. So it's good for a laugh or maybe if you're in a changed state of consciousness.
