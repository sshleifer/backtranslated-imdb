OK, a movie about a movie that makes a crack in the movie can be entertaining. Can be, should be, funny, edgy, even controversial, or at least interesting, and yet ... This movie is the bizzaro negative version of it. Hamlin was entertaining as a B-film producer. Shatner went crazy crazy, but nice and has all the best lines. The rest of the characters were boring, predictable, boring, underdeveloped, boring and boring. The production value was lame. You will actually see the tree come down in one scene. The sound was terrible in some of the screens. Hey I'm a big fan of Shatner's and Hamlin now, but their talents are wasted here. At least the story ended with a clich√©d.
