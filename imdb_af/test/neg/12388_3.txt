Oh, Yawn. Not another girl where the men are all pigs and the women will even get the abuse they suffered. The only difference is that everyone in this movie is a pig or brain. I hated this movie for the moral issue of why it was right to send a man to jail for a murder he didn't commit. It is a more unfair act than its abuse and despair. This movie shows all the situation ethics of poor writing. I saw it on the CBC's "Best of Britain" series. If it's Britain's best, it's not surprising that the British film industry is in trouble. <br /> <br /> The only light spot in this movie was David Tennant. He plays his character so despicably that I probably spit on. The next person who speaks with a Scottish accent. Kate Ashfield tries to play the victim, but eventually comes out as unfair as David Tennant's character. They deserve each other. <br /> <br /> The parents see nothing wrong with the obvious psychotic Brendan. English policemen are so incompetent that they are incapable of issuing tickets. The British Policeman's Union has to bother the makers of this movie for slander. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth taking the electricity to run your DVD to watch it.
