For those of you who don't remember movies - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080120/ - it came out in 1979. (I think enough time has gone so far. Nunzio thought he could just do it and say he wrote it - yes right!). <br /> <br /> The acting in this is a little overboard. The "tough guys" walk around with their shoulders brought forward to give the impression that they are bigger than they actually are. The "hero" is also a passion to sniff and roll his eyes in a bug-eyed way to express anxiety / anger to the celluloid eye. <br /> <br /> There is some sort of racial message here, from the Sicilian perspective (do you think it's about the 3rd generation of the line ... the original "wagons" came after the war and during my childhood arrived in OZ - I'm an Aussie. "is very thin - they even sound like blue-blue Aussies - not a flash of the" dago accent "anywhere (there's another snake for you, Nun!) > <br /> Maori's with sunnies (sunglasses) at 4:00 - should be cool to be sunblind in the middle of the night and it looks like Redfern ... it's at this movie's boring end. to copy the scent of the Warriors but left too many holes in the story How to coincidences <br /> <br /> The warriors had a gang of baseball guys wearing bats, with white facial makeup Chase the heroes to a station and fight them - Nunzios gang is being chased by a gang of track, stick wielding guys wearing whitish face masks. accused them of shooting / killing another gang member. Nunzios gang is wrongly accused of raping the sister of the great Maori gang boss. The warriors are being lured into a room by a gang of girls attacking them. Nunzios crowd wants to come to a friend's house, populated by a gang of girls. There are almost too many copies of the Warriors to keep over here. <br /> <br /> I'm sad that people don't want to see other movements of OZ because of these trips - how about Mad Max - Commander and Master of the World? Not all movies are made by so bad actors, they have to finance their own movies. <br /> <br /> As for the other actors in this show, they seem to have the "Nun", as they are all as bad as each other - don't wrestle with this movie! I can't get my money back - so save yours!
