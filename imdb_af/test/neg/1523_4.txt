The first time I heard from Paridiso Guest House was in the ... "laundry room" after just seeing Fight Club. In each urinal a small, round black circle is deposited. When the circle comes in contact with moisture (to put it delicately), it has produced a color photograph, with photos of the two stars and the brand series "You'll P *** Yourself Laughing". When you finished your hands, the circle dried again and turned black and waited to surprise it on the next "victim". <br /> <br /> Well, maybe the punchline wasn't very sophisticated, but you have to admit it's innovative. In fact, I think I can honestly say that I have never seen anything like it in my life before, and the days of more than a century's theater and marketing, it's a real achievement. It is a pity that the movie that came with it did not meet the promise. <br /> <br /> I hate Guest House Paridiso, and I am guilty of Rik Mayall (Richard Twat) and Adrian Edmondson (Eddie Elizabeth Ndingombaba) for many years laughing at their attractive television series, this is the invention of The Young Ones (1982-1984), the lounge plays Bottom (1991-1995), or even solo work, such as Rik in the New Statesman (1988-1993). In fact, it would have made a hilarious 45 minute TV special. Unfortunately, it's a 89 minute movie. <br /> <br /> There is definitely some merit to be had, and I constantly laughed at the protracted final, which exuded and involved the Exorcist and Raiders of the Lost Ark. , you should see that little bit for yourself. Still, the pace is often loaded, and a sterile atmosphere is always present. The two stars (Edmondson taking his regular back seat, this time due to the fact that he is adequately regulating), never really comes into the first gear, but Mayall only occasionally shows the dirty mouth we leave on the small screen of him love. Indeed, the authors' presumption that we are already familiar with the characters leads to subdivision of the audience. The light hints of depth seen in the series (Richie's effeminate, failed social climb) are not here, and instead we are left with parodies of parodies. <br /> <br /> The Fawlty Towers accusation passes water, complete with drunk chef and invisible, called-for waiter "Pasquele", who rumbles with Manuel. Some of the ideas, such as a hotel next to a nuclear reactor with a child's swing hanging over a cliff face, are very, very funny, but eventually the frenetic rate is stolen. The two are constantly looking for a studio that has not been heard Two decades ago, all the "dead laughter" areas were accompanied by additional "comedy" music dated two days ago in a Carry On movie. <br /> <br /> Paridiso's brand of puerile, sadistic, perverted humor is funny, and I feel it will make you laugh ... just as often as it belongs.
