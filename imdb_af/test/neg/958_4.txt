This review contains a partial spoiler. <br /> <br /> Shortly from the beginning, "D.O.A." start at least as if it were a smooth, entertaining piece of nonsense, like Fincher's "The Game". It's the central character (Dennis Quaid), suffers from a nightmarish series of events that seem to be a twisted and cunning thing. But the plot stumbles on too high a pace, resulting in a dramatic turn not halfway through, when the character learns that he's poisoned and only has 1-2 days to live. And it's just too big to make a story to add. Once that has happened, the film's only chance of success if it deals with the psychology of someone in this situation than its principal, indeed, is its only subject: but "D.O. continue as if it were just a normal revelation like anybody else you might normally experience in a thrill. The problem is twofold: First, Quaid's actions do not convince as someone will be his situation; And secondly, even if they were convinced, it is difficult to worry about what happens next when the main point of plot has been resolved early. The rest of the movie is a fairly standard fare for a movie of this kind, but is more annoying than usually by the character's slightly-treated trouble, which makes the events that the movie is interested in. Dennis Quaid, starring, doesn't convince Don't be a burnt out professor or as a man destined to die: Meg Ryan is so often and annoying. Another negative feature is the ugly 80's soundtrack. See 'The Game' instead, which remains of similar roots stiff and character-driven, while 'D.O.A.' drives in developments that only undermine its own tenet. Since the premise is quite interesting, it is a pity to see it drowned in a surplus of boiled plot.
