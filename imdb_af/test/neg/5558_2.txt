Of course, all this nonsense begs the question "Does a genre as self-referring as the teenage comedy really need another parody movie?" The furious 'Scary Movie' (II and II) went as far as it could go. "Not another teen film" really has nothing or intelligent or shocking to add to. <br /> <br /> The plot, based mainly on 'fairfloss' She's All That, runs a shaky line between parody and tribute ('John Hughes High School'). Everything from 'American Beauty' to 'Varsity Blues' is mined for referrals. The result is ultimately an unfinished viewer experience. The disadvantage of giving us a copy of a copy of "She's All That" is that we all know where it is going. And if we didn't, the jokes would be meaningless. <br /> <br /> There is very little to recommend here. The token-eradicating scene (an erupting toilet) looks poor from the place below all the "good-good" references. There are moments of humor - the song is funny enough and the strange good line is the audience's way. It stinks, don't look at it.
