Yes, this bizarre feature is written by John Sayles. Shot in Toronto, this is another 80's era feature about the dangers of urban jungle, where police fear to go and the homeless and criminal classes are the only residents. In this blend comes the myth of Wild Thing, a wild young man who was raised by a businesswoman after his parents were murdered by a dirty police officer (Maury Chaykin) and Chopper, the local criminal (Robert Davi) . Stir local governors (priest Sean Hewitt and clueless social worker Kathleen Quinlan), and you have a recipe for some rather unconscious action sequences. Davi is the forerunner of the film, and the film maker Rene Verzier does a good job. Otherwise, it's a lumpen action spike that won't satisfy action fans and will relax the Sayles fans.
