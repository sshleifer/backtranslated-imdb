Like the previous poster, I come from Northern Vermont, and I was inclined to keep this movie. However, not since "Red Zone Cuba" I have seen such a confusing plot. The things the people to play don't make sense. Two of the gangs cross the border sending a second party to a car. Uh, why? Then they meet two others, and drive at night to the bad man's hideout in a luxury Packard. - Don't just make two people in a flat truck make more sense? Then, parked outside the garage that holds the targeted hooch, the four fall asleep! When they wake up in the morning and pick up the whiskey, they are, of course, noticed and shot and lose their precious cargo in the process. Then two of the smugglers put the whiskey in a boat and drove it across the border. Again, why? I am told of someone whose big uncle really smuggles in the area. All that was needed was to drive a vehicle that could run like the US Canada Border Patrol, which had a breakdown of resources at the time. <br /> <br /> Don't get me going for the last half hour, it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about the movie is that Kris Kristopherson has actually grown some charisma over the years.
