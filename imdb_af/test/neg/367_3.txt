I'm so disappointed. After waiting for 3 years for repetitions / the DVD of the original masterpiece series "Darkplace", I couldn't wait for this series. The first episode just ended and I'm terrified. Everything that was wonderful about Darkplace was hardly erased here. Worst introduction: canned lag. It removes its original point and just makes it unshakable. (A joke about Garth's eyes fertilizing the audience was good ... the rest I almost can't remember ...), feels like a poor quality. "Know me, know you." I hope it will improve if the series goes on, otherwise I'll be seriously disappointed. back to "Darkplace ..." <br /> <br /> "You're the most compassionate man I've ever known. And I know God ..."
