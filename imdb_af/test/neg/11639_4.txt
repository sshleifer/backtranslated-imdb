A man in the black country lands in a spaceship and meets a girl living in a monkey-type hut. He hooked her up with a phone, and she taught him how to go to Charleston. Then they fly into the spaceship and leave the monkey behind. In this way, this short film makes no sense. I think it's the plot, but I'm not sure about a long shot. You can't say it's Renoir at work, despite its distinctive humanism. Good use of slow-motion, though. Can be found on the NY Film Appendix's series of experimental video videos, no. 18, I believe.
