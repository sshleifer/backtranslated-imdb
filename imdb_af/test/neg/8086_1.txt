This film, literally, does not have one reasoning feature. The characters are one-dimensional, split, incredibly misogynistic and stupid. The disc looks like it was made up of 100 other movies, the play is awful, and some of the "brutal" humor made me feel uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Gregory Poirier, for thinking any of these would be funny or interesting! <br /> <br /> The worst movie I've seen in several years.
