This movie came as a great disappointment. The anime series ended with a relatively stupid plotwending and the rushing launch of a nice, lame villain, but I expected Shamballa to tie all the loose points. Unfortunately, it didn't. It added more plot holes than it was solved, and more confused than it was explained. The animation and voice action was great, but with an idiotic plot, a dull setting (most of the film does not even appear in the dim WWII, but also the Alchemy world) and disappointing ending (Ed is useless For the rest of his days in a world without alchemy, and he was Winry?), it was quite slim. Do yourself a favor - ignore the last half of the anime as well as this movie, and read the manga.
