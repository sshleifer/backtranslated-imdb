Like most of you, I watched many movies; Among those who we often also voluntarily or accidentally also find those movies that are so useless that we think of reasons why someone would make it. That's exactly what I can say for the dead's abundance. <br /> <br /> The least I can do is try to "warn" some of you. If you enjoy a movie because of the story, acting and intensity you might want to choose. Now it's not bad. In fact, all you want is creative movie editing and unique angles, along with the original music environment you might think is OK. Being a filmmaker, acting and entertained by a movie, is the truth that I thought this movie was so terribly past words. I could easily find it on my list of the worst movies seen in a while. <br /> <br /> With the fact that Val Kilmer is in it, the truth is that he is probably being favored by the director; As a fan of some of Kilmer's films, I can't understand what his motive was for. The movie is part of the western part of the romance ......... In the end, I'm sure most of you can agree with me that it's just a rude waste of our time. If you didn't see this movie, I'd recommend avoiding it completely.
