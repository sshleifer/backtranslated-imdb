As a child I never understood this person would see this very crazy show. It was pretty stupid and I always wanted Spridle and Jim-Jim to come in some fatal accident (they were so annoying). Now, almost 40 years later, I have a new attitude on the cartoon. While I still think it was a complete crap, it's just about the American version of the show. That's because I read an anime book and found out that the shows we've seen are quite different from those originally shown in Japan. You see, the idiots in charge of the syndication of the series thought it was too violent so they cut it out of the episodes. It's bad enough, but what else they did is beyond belief - they actually cut the episodes apart and split them to create programs that were nothing like the original! For example, one episode may consist of parts of episodes 3, 6, 18 and 27! As a result, I really don't know if the original show was really bad - it could have been brilliant. But who can tell what to look at is this manipulated mess!
