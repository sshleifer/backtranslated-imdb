OK, it was a "risky" move to rent this movie, but I thought I had nothing to lose. Well, I went wrong. It's next to "Blood Surf", the worst "horrormovie" I've ever seen. Crappy actors, crappy technical output, crappy story and so on. However, the soundtrack is not bad. That's why I give it a 2 to vote and not just 1. And of course the cats are a positive surprise. By far the superior actors in this movie ..... Don't rent or buy. Stay away from it and hope that this horrible, horrible movie will disappear into a dark existence and not become a "cult classic". It certainly doesn't deserve recognition.
