Imagine: a high school. Apart from being a hostel, the children do not have parents. Oh, and this is in Malibu. And the kids are all thin, white and beautiful, with the exceptional token minority or fat child playing the "strange" one. And there are no reasonable rules, such as living together, nuclear weapons in their dorms, coffee sticks, a sushi bar and a free laptop per student. <br /> <br /> Here's the story: A girl, Zoey Brooks, attends PCA, a former college. Absolutely perfect in every way, she is smart, beautiful, thin, athletic, creative, and everything a perfectionist wants. Almost all the boys in the school want her, and every girl wants to be her friend. She is the one who comes for advice, the one who saves the day with a simplistic plan, and is just wonderful. Nothing of this makes her likeable. <br /> <br /> Do we believe that if we don't even get close to Zoey's perfection, are we bad people? In the show nothing is her fault, and if anyone contradicts her, they are portrayed as the bad man (Logan). He may be a while, but at least he has a brain that thinks for himself, rather than just voting with the princess. <br /> <br /> Her loyal group of blind followers is: Chase, the average stupid ass who has a secret loved one on her, Michael, the token black man (and the only decent actor on the set), Lola, " a wannabe actress and anorexic, snobbish airhead, Quinn, the clever but clueless girl when it comes to teen stuff, and Logan, the rich jerk that has a soft side. Yes, this show basically boasts stereotypes. <br /> <br /> What scares me, however, is that they all pretend to be ordinary children. They complain that Logan gets too much money while they have to work themselves, although they are already going to a special boarding school and have relatively nice things that many teenagers cannot afford. They drink coffee and eat sushi regularly, have almost homework and sunburn almost every day. Wow, they have a hard time! Any other issues? I'm too beautiful, rich and stress free! I think Zoey 101 (what is the 101, anyway?) Is Nick's attempt to portray teens realistically. Except they got a glimpse of the reality, they didn't like it and decided to give the kids the asses on The Hills. <br /> <br /> But hey, at least the set is beautiful.
