This movie is bad. Really bad. It's so bad I want to shoot in the forehead. I hated this movie. First, the plot is absolutely nowhere and anything shocking about this movie has been seen in the 30-second trailer. Secondly, anyone who saw the original in 1979 knows that it's also a bad movie and totally unworthy of a remake. By far the best part of the movie is the house in which it takes place. That doesn't say much for the real movie. There were parts in the movie when the music became very exciting and you were positive someone was around and it turned out to be the girl or the cat, but if someone was really around, it was impossible to scare even because you expected the movie. So save yourself the money, save yourself the time, save yourself the headache and just look at the trailer. There is absolutely no point in seeing this movie, not in the theater, not on DVD, not on TV.
