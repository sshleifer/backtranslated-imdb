That someone could understand this nonsense and then found it is incredible. The fact that it is actually broadcast on television and advertisers are actually paid to work with it is indignant. This unpleasant excuse for the child's programming is almost too dirty to comment. I burned - yes burn - any Barney tapes that people gave my son. Finding this awful programming in my library was an unpleasant surprise. And where do you tell me, do they get the smarmy actors? Do their parents have no sense? Those kids will be on drugs before they are teens. Geez. The last insult is that I have to add this extra line to the review to get it on IMDb.
