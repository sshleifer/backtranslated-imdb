too predictable for spoils, but I will not be underneath, so do not read it if you care. <br /> <br /> A few dull writing writers join in for mid-afternoon, and even then they run out of ideas. So let's start with a criminal being searched by France ... no matter what he did, we'll think about it later (they don't). a few seconds of tension, but not too much, and nothing unexpected, because it requires Art. needed half an hour to complete the movie; I get it: let them rob a jeweler, and take a lot of time to avoid alarms. Everyone robs jewelers in movies, just me, it's bound to work (not). No humor, no character (ok, Yves Montand gets it a bit). And everyone is talking in a silent death-stamp that is supposed to make one of noir think, but just make the actors sound depressed. If they are silent, it will make them look grim - but also save us to write their lines. We'd better add something to staying with the housewives who are going to watch these things, so let's have something to encourage them with their husbands (we forgot to put women in the movie). got it: a boy on marijuana (grab) - oh, and let him for no specific reason commit suicide (shame? his father is a mafia boss to cry out loud, but the audience will feel his paternal care.) . Oh, the crooked cop was a classmate of the man who eventually found him; wrenching, eh? Let's kill everyone at the end, or we'll never finish these things. is it in the tin? Right, it's over, thank you. who will we get for director?
