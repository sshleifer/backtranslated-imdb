I saw this movie coming out and not waiting to see it. I must say I was very disappointed with that. It would have been better than a mini-series. The whole show rushed a lot. They didn't explain things clearly. In the end, they showed John Paul II, alive and well, and the next scene was dead. Never have any explanation about what happened. (We all know what happened in real life.) I think ABC has dropped the ball into something that might have been good. In everything I think this movie was a blur. It seemed like a drunken monkey jumped from one point in John Paul's life to another point and never explained how or why things happened. As his older brother left, it was never explained that his brother was a doctor and therefore he went home. Even when his father dies, all we see is his father lying on the floor and that is it. I was very disappointed with the movie.
