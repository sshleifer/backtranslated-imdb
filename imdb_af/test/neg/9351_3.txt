A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away (known known), water has become the most precious product (it must be known) and a small minority controls its distribution (which is a surprise, has just heart attack and die of that surprise). A group of ice-pirates (water descendants ?? wet bandits? ... oh wait, the last one is used) Try the route to an incredible amount of water with a beautiful but spoiled (Druish?) Princess and drag and drop a group of idiots ??? ?? contemptuous villains in pursuit. <br /> <br /> This movie has the potential to be a very big comic parody ("Star Wars", David Lynch's "Dune"), but was just not handled properly. It's about, I believe the term is "low appearance" humor. It doesn't really matter to be all that funny, it's a pity because it has Angelica Houston, Ron Perlman and Robert Urich (thus the three stars) who don't exactly fall into the acting department. <br /> <br /> Definitely a rental and definitely a drink straight.
