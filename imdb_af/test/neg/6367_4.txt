This year's Eurovision was a great disappointment to me. I have selected the Eurovision Song Contest since 1986 (well, this is the earliest one I can remember, and I was just 2 right now). Like any other year, this one contains good, bad and terrible songs - nothing new there. But this year's performance was the worst I can remember. Only very few good songs and lots of terrible songs. <br /> <br /> Turkey's winner song "Every Way That I Can" sounded like a rip-off of Turkish singer Tarkan hitting "Simarik", sounds much worse. It didn't deserve me to win from my point of view. The Belgian song "Sanomi", which comes second, was a non-language song. Wondering what's next? Animals sing? Nevertheless, the music was tough for the song, and the song was a kind of dream-like feeling, after which the "lyrics" were appropriate. One of the better songs, but it doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> After one of the closest games in Eurovision history, Russian duo t.A.T. in third place just three points behind Turkey and behind Belgium, with Ne Ver, Ne Boisia (Don't Trust, Don't Fear). For me t.A.T.u. was one of the few highlights of the show, surprisingly just about everyone by being some of the most covered girls of all female participants. They let their song speak and if we ignore the fact that they didn't help the first choir several times, let them talk the song very well. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise when we came to the scoreboard was Austria. The bookmakers here in Denmark had the greatest chance of the song - a song that was indeed over - but ended in 8th place. Could it be that the lap of his cheek is shaken to the rhythm of the song? This show was the one that made me and my family laugh most, not because it looked good, but because it looked so stupid that it was actually fun. <br /> <br /> Sweden has done what they do best; ABBA. In 1999 they won with "Take Me To Your Heaven" by sounding like ABBA. In 2001, they made the top 10 with "Listen to your heartbeat", which again sounds like ABBA, and again this year they did this ABBA style, which ends in the top 10 again. <br /> <br /> England were ultimately punished for making absolutely horrible, non-catching songs, that they have over the past year. <br /> <br /> Ireland won the 2000 winner, "Fly On The Wings Of Love". And I can continue with the bad songs. <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for the Aussies, who finally get the chance to see the Eurovision Song Contest this year. They earned better than that. <br /> <br /> However, I was not surprised by the show. The Eurovision from 2000 to me has been one of the best in the past year. 2001 was pretty good, but not so good. 2002 was good, but definitely not anymore. This year was simply disappointing. <br /> <br /> Let's hope it'll be better next year. If it's not for us, then at least for the Aussies. <br /> <br /> 4/10. One for AT, one for the nearest race, one for the pour and one for the rest.
