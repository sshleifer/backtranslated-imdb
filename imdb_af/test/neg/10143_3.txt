Does anyone think "Reba" is basically a ripoff of "Roseanne"? Just look at the characters of the two families, Connors (Roseanne) and Harts (Reba); the blonde kid's older daughter (Becky Connor and Cheyenne Hart), who are married to a moron (Mark Healy and Van Montgomery), the sarcastic brunette, younger daughter (Darlene Connor and Kyra Hart), the little brother (DJ Connor and Jake Heart) the strange family member (Jackie Connor and Barbara-Jean Booker Hart). <br /> <br /> And of course there is the biggest deal, Reba Hart and Roseanne Connor. "Reba" tried to copy the sarcastic and tough love-style mother without giving her the same lovely features as Roseanne. Or, perhaps, they also made her * enjoyable, because Reba Hart seems to guard between mean and scary (hence Van's line to his wife, Cheyenne. "I'm not afraid of you, I'm afraid of your mother! ") and be sweet and caring with little transition in between. Roseanne managed to get it right that she was cruel to be kind, since she was always significant and sarcastic and when she tried to open it was difficult for her. So contrary to Reba's character, it's hard for her to be credible. <br /> <br /> But even if the characters were not completely ripped off from Roseanne, nothing could save the recording of sub-par in the plot area. The authors are trying to give the show dust, but they really can't give the funny jokes long enough to make any impact. And you'd better think the jokes are stingy; It's as if they were written by a 12-year-old who thinks a joke is screaming. While they sometimes come up with something funny (I don't pretend I didn't laugh at a few episodes). These jewels are too few and far between "Reba". <br /> <br /> Overall, "Reba" is a very mediocre show with obvious ripoffs of "Roseanne", sub-par suddenly and sub-sub-par humor. The performance may be a bit better, actually, if they have replaced all the actors, especially Reba himself, which is more community theater quality than the primary sitcom quality. <br /> <br /> I give it a 3 out of 10 just to be honest with the good jokes it makes.
