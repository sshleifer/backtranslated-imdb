SILVER CITY (2 + outta 5 stars) As a big fan of John Sayles's work for many years, I feel safe to say it's the worst movie he ever did. That said, the movie isn't exactly * terribly * ... just very uninspired. Sayles throws well-known elements from his earlier films (corrupt politics, illegal immigration, the sale of youthful ideals), but fails to bring them new or meaningful. Even the dialogue (usually Sayles's strong point) is disappointing this time around. Sounding clicks and forced into virtually every scene. The movie looks and looks like episodes of a TV series that didn't pass it past its third episode. There are tons of big stars on hand ... and they try their best to make their little parts alive ... but the material is just not there this time. During the filming of a campaign spot, a governor-hopeful (a poor and obvious George W. Bush booth) fishing a dead body from a lake. An investigator is being used to try to warn people who have deliberately set it up to discredit the candidate ... but he soon finds that there are deeper and darker (and more clicked) secrets to being discovered. Sayles has made similar movies so much better in the past ("Lone Star", "Matewan", "Return of the Secaucus Seven", "Men With Guns"). It's a pity he once went too much to the well and came with infected water. One good line, delivered by Richard Dreyfuss: "Danny, you're a loser. It's already been undoubtedly fixed. Just try a good one, okay?"
