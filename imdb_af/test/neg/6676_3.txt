Unlike one reviewer, it is NOT a ripoff of Magnum Force. In this one, Lieutenant Hal Holbrook has set up his own small group of academy newcomers to send repeated offenders. In extreme justice, this operation has sanctioned the higher options of the LAPD. How far they sanction the exact methods used is open to questions. <br /> <br /> These Special Investigation Groups are pretty much the refuge for the deceptions of the LAPD, those who forgot their first duty are protection and service. That's why Scott Glenn believes Lou Diamond Phillips, a detective with more than his share of beef in internal affairs for excessive use of violence, is perfect for the group. <br /> <br /> What had sent him from Phillips is the fact that he has a good life-in-relationship with a reporter, Chelsea Field. This one definitely threw me into this movie, you'd think Lou would be the last man he wanted to recruit for his team. <br /> <br /> And what his team is, is a death group. Their target offenders follow them and wait to catch them in action. Then it's open season. <br /> <br /> Extreme Justice has gone a long way to trying to make a point. There would certainly not have been a wait to wait for a gang of bank robberies to complete the robbery and take them out. No civilians were hurt when the citizens of Coffeyville did it to the Daltons. Or wait until three rapists finish the job before moving in. This is what is being asked to believe here. <br /> <br /> And honestly I couldn't buy it. Many good players are really messed up in this one.
