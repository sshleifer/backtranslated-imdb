Sorry if I disappoint someone about what I'm going to say about TV movies. But I paid for the movie and turned this movie into a disaster. The direction is really terribly bad. But after searching for her information, I realized there might be reasons for the low quality of directing and manufacturing. Maybe they don't have budget, but anyway, Ang Lee's Sin and Sensibility also have little money, but it has become a hit. The director in this movie really did badly to tell the story and the movie couldn't even stop a rational continuity in itself. It keeps me from acting. Maybe someone should work hard on story line / board. The confronted sound is also very bad. My god .... Usually I would appreciate every movie because behind it lies ideas and imagination of an individual. but this time I'm just crazy, "I really want to hit something difficult." ... Just don't do the job if someone can't do it best. Bad arts (it's not even art, what is it?) Hurt many people.
