I almost found it impossible to empathize with Ricci's character in this film. If she's supposed to be depressed, I think writer writer and director neglected to investigate depressive research before making this movie because Ricci's character is more a portrayal of a self-centered, worthless bag as a victim and survivor of depression. /> <br /> The forced attempt at introspective narration was as ridiculous as the painful interactions between her and the people around her. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but I couldn't buy it. It is straight to video lock. I'm glad I didn't pay to see it.
