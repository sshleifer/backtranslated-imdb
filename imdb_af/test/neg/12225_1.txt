It's the worst movie I've ever seen. If I didn't watch it for free, I'd never finish it. The creators of this movie should be ashamed of themselves. It seems to be a movie in the year of Scary Movie and Date Movie (a horrible movie, but 10x better than this one), but failed. The only jokes in this movie seem to be slapstick. A man falls off, someone is hit by a bus, etc. None of the ideas is clever, basically the worst point of departure for a movie ever. The plot (or lack thereof) is completely delayed. The plot seems to center the trainer and his family, but there are so many other things going on in the movie, it is completely ridiculous. Terrible, terrible movie.
