This show is just terrible. I liked watching Drake and Josh, who were good, and before the The Amanda show, also funny, but it's just AWFUL. In my opinion it felt to see it --- films of Seltzberg, painful and unclear. These are about 3 stupid @ $$ children who make a crappy web show (while stealing the hole Ithing) while making their delayed brother sculpture (he has no life). The movie is shit, Megan van Drake and Josh are scanty (AHHHHHH!) An ugly Bchk is Sam and a kid who pulled them off the street, plays Fred. everything I've seen here is random "jokes" that include the brother who makes a clay film. He also played an arcade game called PAC gear (genius). Sam and Carly are delayed on their web application, and Fred is a fool. the only episode is a saw (can't remember the title) where Fred gets bad luck by not providing an email. I find videos on youtube funnier than this junk. and why hell gets their youtube jack @ $$ fred, get AVGN to cancel the show with its pot mouth. Just skip this view.
