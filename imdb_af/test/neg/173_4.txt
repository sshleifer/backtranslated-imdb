It was really necessary to include embarrassment of non-participants in a documentary. And why are all the silly dog ​​screens, and then repeating all the same silly dog ​​screens? This film begins with a great promise - to expose international politics and the wine industry. It started well and included all the right characters. But the production is a mess. Points have started and developed most of the way, and then it is never finished or with a clear end. Very poor and disorienting camera work and editing. They had used subtitles for Christie's British mumbler. <br /> <br /> Too much fluff and not enough fact for a documentary. <br /> <br /> Probably honored in Cannes because of the American bashing (though in my opinion there were too few of them.) <br /> <br /> We left at 2:00 am - I didn't an idea how long it will last.
