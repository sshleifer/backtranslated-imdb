"House of the Dead 2: Dead Aim" (2005) is the sequel, though you really don't need to see the first "House of the Dead" to get this movie. That said, the production value is definitely here, with great zombie effects and it's reasonably edited, with a very effective sound design. However, it said, it's about everything that's good here. <br /> <br /> The story and the writing are terrible. . . There are blatant plots everywhere. It's also funny how the soldiers don't care if they get blood on their faces (other than in 28 days later where blood in any part of the body will infect you). Also, realistically, there is little order with the soldiers here, as opposed to the usual US military discipline. <br /> <br /> A 4 out of 10.
