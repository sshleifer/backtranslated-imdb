I'm relieved. The later reviews have become sour and read all the positive feedback. I started to worry that my understanding of movies (and life) is completely different from everyone's worldwide. Everything in this movie made me fake ... the characters, the dialogue, the manipulative soundtrack, the cricket story, everything. As every scene unfolded, I thought, "People don't do that." It is relentlessly heavy-handed and maudlin. In a way, I think the movie is about satisfying, or pretending to enjoy it, because it is serious and about real people and confronts problems. But man, it really doesn't work for me.
