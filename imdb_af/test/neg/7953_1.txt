Perhaps you should be a former hippie to fully appreciate it, because apart from some dated fashions, music and dialogue, it doesn't really have anything to do with it. <br /> <br /> Four fun college art students enjoy carefree days to paint nude models and ride on motorcycles. They take acid in one scene and go to a zoo. A sign flashes on the screen that says: "Don't feed the animals", and suddenly they are in a cage that laughs and hangs from a chain swing (?!) A vicious artist (Larry Swanson) tells art career is almost ruined by a paralyzing hand disease. He sends black-clothed zombie towels to kidnap people and then spray them with a serum that twists their faces. He tries to create a new form of abstract action (I guess here, the given details are a bit vague, to put it mildly). Meanwhile, Jason (Ross Harris) dies the day after his friend Scotty (Chris Martell) was killed and kidnapped his girlfriend Janet (Eugenie Wingate). I thought the zombie makeup in ZOMBIE MORE was terrible, but wait until you see it here! It is by Douglas Hobart, the star of DEOD CURSE OF TARTU. A small role is played by Brad Grinter, director of the Z classic BLOODFREAK, which is much more enjoyable than this deadly dull turkey (aka NIGHTMARE HOUSE). <br /> <br /> Indifferent trivia note: The 1984 Regal video release features the wrong cast (for the BRIDES WORE BLOOD) printed directly on the video label! <br /> <br /> Score: 1 out of 10
