Rent this one by accident and think it was another movie with the same title and realize that I've been renting it for quite some time. <br /> <br /> Quick plot line. A couple consisting of an artist and photographer hiring a studio apartment in Los Angeles from Joe Estevez, still cursing the fact that his brother Martin Sheen can work! They found a bed in a forgotten room, but the bed was haunted by a nasty, serious 1930s killer and his last victim. Their ghosts live the couple, first improve their sex life, but are later threatened. <br /> <br /> Whatever is cheap is R-rated sex scene, cheaper voltage and kind of waste.
