First Out, I'm a big fan of Robert Blake, was always. <br /> <br /> This movie came to Movieplex on 10/13 last night, and the title interest me and of course the star. But after watching it, I was more confused than I was before it started. There are a few good scenes, and I thought they'd go somewhere, but they didn't, it turned out to be an "anti-cop". "anti-girl" "anti-hippie", pretty much "anti-everything movie", with a very confusing plot that has never gone anywhere. <br /> <br /> Robert Blake is great as the head, as good as anyone can be with this bad movie, I'm still a big fan of Mr. Blake and loves his acting even in the crap like this ... But this drug went down 70's. Well, better stay away from this one ... And that ends, what a piss.
