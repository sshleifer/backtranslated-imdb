The combination of Dan Haggerty (Elves) and Linda Blair (Exorcist) is enough to make any horror fan excited about this movie. And as soon as you see the cover art of this movie of a frozen zombie from their cryogenic room, you'll think you were in B-Movie Horror Heaven. At least this is the way I approached this movie. But boy, was I in for a shock <br /> <br /> I love horror movies. I also love B movies. Nothing makes my day more than a cute little movie about zombies, monsters, killers, that kind of thing. But to say that this movie is missing is an understatement. This movie was pure trash. You might think the zombies will look like the front page art of the box, but you get actors with masks that are clearly sold at any Halloween counter. Furthermore, the writing is beyond regret. Our main character, Joseph, suffers from the loss of his wife and son and seeks comfort in the warm-hearted Mary played by Blair. Not once do you see any sign of sadness or discomfort on the part of Joseph's character. Instead, we see the head of cryogenic labs, a man called Dr. Miller, who wants to get the bodies and experiment with their organs. There is no emotion or something to make you believe you should give a damn about everyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> Everything and everyone, very disappointing. All the elements to make a big horror movie were there. You had your zombies, your decent actors and your story. But the lack of good writing and little or any sense of direction screwed this one straight. Overall, 4 out of 10
