I love oddball animation, I love many Asian movies, but I don't love this particular product from Japan. The Fuccons are supposedly an American family (they are all mannequins) who have moved to Japan, and are somewhat of a 50-year-old sitcom-type family, with sometimes more modern feelings. The DVD features several very short episodes (like less than 5 minutes each?) And I didn't find it funny or entertaining, even in a strange way. I'm not sure what the appeal of this is. I picked up here and there on a satire, gosh, who didn't want to, but satire is usually somewhat humorous, isn't it? And nothing I've seen or heard, even a little smirk. I picked it up and it certainly had a call, but I think I miss the point if it's just plain LAME. The box even says it's torch-hilarious, right there in front, but I ask to disagree. 2 out of 10.
