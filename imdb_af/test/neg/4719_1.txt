this film is what happens when people see this one blue gate project like this one and say hell people walk around with cameras, acting drama documentary theme no problem, i can do it and start with a lame idea make a terrible script and Get a lot of talented actors and start shooting a movie. One plot is that in Africa there is a half jump like a human being, hunting and killing people. The residents think it is a devil or an evil spirit, but our wild forest is in Africa to find evidence. no need for more words on the plot this movie gets a 1 out of 10 and i am trying to find something good to say about this movie, but after a long time think nothing nada zero null.
