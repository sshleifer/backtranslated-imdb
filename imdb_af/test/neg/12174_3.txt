I'm totally surprised at how overwhelmed "Cemetery Man" is among horror fans! Now I usually have movies that mix two or more kinds of genre styles in one, and I love every zombie comedy I've ever seen. To my dismay, this Italian cult classic, really didn't show me much. I pumped too much. It follows the unusual duties of a full-time cemetery caretaker and his delayed male child, Curly Joe's search assistant, as they seem to be mostly disposing of the dead of death who fall out of the ground seven days after their initial death. He met a widow he "wasted" with a funny grave atmosphere and developed a fast romance, which soon had sex with her on her dead men's grave. The man's looks are alive and biting her, causing a series of events that resemble the rest of the movie. "Cemetery Man" attempts to include every element he can, such as horror, romance, comedy, action, and failure in the long run. It bumps together, never able to focus on any aspect that is long enough to make it interesting for the viewer, such as the relationship with a live cut head, a motorcycle zombie launched from the ground random people on the pavement, etc. This thing is so complicated and boring that it is almost impossible to take it seriously. Sure, it is stylish and often "elegant", but even the most artificial kind of films need the right kind of line to make it meaningful. "Cemetery Man" next door, which can't focus on anything for more than a few minutes, which becomes very exhausting after a while. People argue that "it's a more sophisticated zombie movie". Frankly, when it comes to zombies, I don't want anything more sophisticated than Romero. There is a bit of gore and nudity - mainly in the screens where it wants to play horror movie, but not nearly enough to make up for its uncompromising lack of structure. Terrible movie.
