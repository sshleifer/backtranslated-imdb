This review took longer to write than I took to watch this movie. It's just bad. The plot is awful compared to the TV shows. It's flat, indecent and boring. <br /> <br /> Clearly, the LoG runs out of ideas before this movie was green. Viewers should read it as an example of not knowing when to stop. <br /> <br /> Bad editing, bad music, bad acting. Zero dynamics, silver chemistry. <br /> <br /> A film that doesn't know what it is, makes a mysterious end without any love that makes you feel depressed and so angry that so much money is wasted. br /> <br /> Of course, the LoG was an offer they couldn't refuse, or their egos just got the best of them. This is a fraudulent marketing pressure that might have been better if the LoG was more and more inspired. <br /> <br /> I knew when to stop, though, and got it. <br /> <br /> Please! Someone is trying to convince me of the finer points of this movie!
