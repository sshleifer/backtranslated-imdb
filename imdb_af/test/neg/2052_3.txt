What on earth? Like looking at an episode of neighbors after drinking two bottles of cough medicine - nightmare and not at all. I waited for the smart part where everything fits in and saves the movie. Maybe it was there and I just missed it, or lost it to me. <br /> <br /> My strongest suspicion is that it is a thinly safe attempt to market a new drug that beats the streets. I won't say "look," but I'll say it's pretty poor on every level. Swipe. Unless you drink two bottles of cough syrup. Then it's not dandy.
