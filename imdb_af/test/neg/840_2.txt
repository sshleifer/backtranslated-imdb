I honestly don't know where to start when a movie is pathetically reviewed as Ernest Goes to Africa. Apart from two or three good layers spread throughout the film, there is nothing positive about this hour and a half of time and life. It's amazing that someone is a group of people who are willing to act, edit movies and change this piece of waste, and even more amazingly, that this is the eighth installment in the Ernest series. <br /> <br /> During the opening credits of the movie, we see Ernest along several African objects such as wood masks and African animal heads, making faces and gestures likely to make most 3rd graders laugh. This opening scene gives the viewer a taste of Ernest's regular attempts at humor, showing how his comedy falls flat 95% of the time. <br /> <br /> The first thing that really touched me about this movie is how bad the acting is. Everyone in the movie is a typical C-movie actor, but Linda Kash is extremely horrible. She is an indication of persecution; All her lines are delivered with shockingly inhumane enthusiasm that you just play in a middle school. Most high school theater students probably replaced these actors and delivered a stronger performance. Jim Varney shows a bit of comic every time, but for most of the movie he works just like a complete slow-down, trying to be humor by making silly faces and talking in different voices. <br /> <br /> Ernest Goes to Africa starts in Africa, where an archaeologist stole two precious jewels from an African tribe. The jewels then return to the United States, where an unknown man is seen walking from several henchmen through a flea market. He hides them in a bucket of "two for a dollar" items, and then walks off the scene. Ernest is looking for a gift to buy for Rene, a waitress he likes, so he goes to the flea market and, of course, buys the precious jewelry. He later took them back to his home, painted them, and put them together to make a yo-yo. He gives the yo-yo to Rene and she explains that they can never be together because he's just an average shmoe, and she wants an adventure man. Rene and Ernest are traced by the henchmen, and are then brought to Africa to be detained as prisoners. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie doesn't really make sense. Once Ernest is in Africa, he falls out of the truck to transport him into a river. In the next scene we see him as a Hindu servant named "Hey You." His skin is dark and he wears a loin. Initially, I thought Jim Varney had played a different role in the film, in addition to Ernest, but I immediately recognized Ernest's idiot. Hey, you started talking. <br /> <br /> Another scene that sticks out in my mind as being completely ridiculous is the African hunting scene. René and Ernest took an ostrich farmer's truck and were followed by henchmen. Already driving about twenty miles an hour on a fairly straight road, both henchmen shoot at Ernest, which is in the back of the ostrich farmer's truck. Ernest, on the other hand, throws ostrich eggs to the henchmen and their driver. The woodcutters have never been beaten once in five minutes, but Ernest can fend off by hitting them and their driver in the face, flying their car out of the way and exploding in a giant column. I must also add that Ernest flashes the eggs, two at a time, from a large bra. <br /> <br /> The set design is also incredibly poor in this movie. There is a large part of the film in which Rene and Ernest roam Africa and are trying to find civilization. During their hike we see them through lands and jungles, which could probably be shot everywhere in the United States. The fields are simply grassy fields, with no indication whatsoever to be near Africa (at least they could have digitally had some African trees in the background) and the jungles look like the forests of rural Connecticut with paper mâchè skulls, vineyards , and thorns hanging from trees. According to IMDb.com, the movie was actually shot in South Africa, but I don't believe it at all. <br /> <br /> The movie goes on and on, Ernest jokes at Ernest's joke. The rest of the movie doesn't really make sense either; The African tribes all speak English for some reason, and Ernest is later challenged to a "Battle of Truth" by the main hunter, who is suddenly dressed in a ninja-like outfit, but also looks a bit like a slavery submissive. The farmer has a table of axes, swords, knives and maces in front of him, while Ernest has a table with a sandwich, a teddy bear and some other worthless items. However, Ernest wins the battle and somehow ends the day. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is painful to watch. I couldn't handle it in one meeting; I had to keep halfway and do something for a few hours productively to compensate for the brain cells lost while trying to appreciate Varney's humor. They should really put a surgeon's general warning on the box to let people know that they will actually be slightly more delayed if they finish this movie. I will have to say that out of all the movies I've ever seen, nobody comes close to being as agile as Ernest Goes to Africa.
