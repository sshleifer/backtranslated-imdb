I am a collector of movies with me. Weaver, so I just bought it because she was in it. I find it very strange that her early career is filled with so many terrible movies. She started with incredible promise in Alien, but then had some bombs. These bombs include this movie, Deal of the Century, One Woman of Two and Half Moon Street. She also appeared in The Year of Living Dangerously, which was not a bomb, but her performance was less than significant. In the time between Alien and it's the successor of 1986, Aliens, the only movie she did, was something Ghostbusters was worth. Before the release of strangers, I'm sure everyone thought this woman was coming out. Luckily she wasn't. <br /> <br /> Back to Witness though the movie is boring. It does not create tension. William Hurt looks like a cardboard stand, and the atmosphere is just too dry. Sigourney is decent but worth not remembering. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you need to, but don't fit in with any expectations of a decent movie. Look better at movies with these two stars like Unlucky Tourists and Working Girl.
