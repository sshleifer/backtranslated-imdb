Rarely and congratulatory are the moments in filmmaking when greatness as a defining monument stands for the rest of the industry to measure themselves and deepen us in that glorious moment. <br /> <br /> Some stories rise their time and strive for the lofty reach of a classic and legend. Throw in the refined skills of an ensemble cast of the Thespians who are at the top of their game. <br /> <br /> "Where did all the originality go?" It is here, like this story, and it is thrown by a plot and story that not only educates but also entertaines the most seasoned of Shakespeare / action / love storytellers. <br /> <br /> I can't start thinking where the authors dreamed this extraordinary story. Where does genius get this kind of inspiration? I now have hope for mankind, knowing that this kind of talent still exists, giving me the hope that we will make it to the stars and beyond, perhaps to the gates of heaven. <br /> <br /> I dreamed of greatness like others before me. Although I did not write this movie, I saw it and because of this noble magnitude of this movie, I feel as if I am elevated to a higher level of being, a higher level of spiritual wholeness. <br /> <br /> It is no wonder this kind of glory deprives most of us. What would become of our world if we could all reach this level of wonderfulness? We will probably be consumed in a white fire of super-nova glory as we develop into trans-dimensional spiritual beings capable of universal creative power. <br /> <br /> The most important thing to know, with your whole heart and the essence of your being, is that "Tomcats" is nothing I talked about. "Tomcats" is the antithesis of everything I mentioned. This can destroy our world very well. Because as some reviewers evaluate a movie on a star system, that is, 1 to 5 stars, or even zero stars, I'm going to rate a black hole 'Tomcats'. <br /> <br /> I'm willing to donate money to put an end to these kinds of atrocities that seem to be amok at box office. I'm not even harming the use of nuclear weapons. It must stop. How much more can we take in front of aliens from outer space, come here and blow our planet because we have so much stupid, scratchy, vulgar, imaginative and humiliating movies from Hollywood? I won't even condemn this movie by naming someone's name that made the stars or manufactures. I'm not even going to waste my time describing the story, since we've seen it a ba-zillion time, and all previous versions were at least a few times better. <br /> <br /> By the way, my head almost imploded during this movie, but with the greatest selfless effort and luck I survived to warn the public. You're warned.
