The worst part of all is the poor essay that leads to superficial acting. <br /> <br /> Dreyfuss's character is intensely repetitive and annoying, and Dreyfuss himself has the annoying face to suit. <br /> <br /> Holly Hunter's character is exaggeratedly self-centered, and Hunter gives herself a serious offense. <br /> <br /> Brad Johnson was wood. John Goodman made the best of it. <br /> <br /> Since then, the whole death / ghost cause has been somewhat exaggerated, and now looks lame. <br /> <br /> Barely visible if you want old planes.
