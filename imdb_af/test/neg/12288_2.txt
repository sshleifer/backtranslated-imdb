Okay, I watched this movie when I was very little and the day we cleaned the cupboard, I saw it! I thought, "I have no idea how this movie was," I continued and put it in. . THIS GOD !!!!! This movie is so bad! I never thought this movie could ever come as close to my least favorite movie as it did, but I laughed because all the jokes were so funny and ridiculous. , not funny !! So many things in this movie were funny because it was so blunt !! This film is not good anywhere. I will have to say if you want to see this movie, you should definitely not expect it. Anything great and if you've seen it, trust me, I feel your pain too !!
