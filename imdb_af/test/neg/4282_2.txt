The animation is wonderful, I will admit it. But Disney has continued every stereotype we have tried to overcome Alaskans over the past two generations. And the names, I mean, come on ... Sitka, Kenai, Tanana & Denahi (cheese-like take-off from Denali)?! These are real places where real people live! And the real people to whom these real places were named are probably struggling from the Earth looking for revenge on this sad movie. Disney, you're from California and Florida, right across the rest of the states we still treat like a foreign country. If you can't stick to what you know, you should at least hire and / or work with people who know what area you're trying to caricature. Maybe it won't be so offensive! :(
