Lazy movie made by a lazy director. The characters are grotesque. Despite the tragedy of this war, there is no emotion in the movie at all. Symbolism is artificial and ineffective (and the old Bosnian woman who gives a picture of her son to Arbor will show her willingness, will wake the super-mother in her, a corpse eaten by worms to show the abomination of genocide Many are sometimes worse than not enough. <br /> <br /> This movie is just an advertisement, an empty elegance for a woman who is not a hero. She worked for the United Nations. Remember that the UN did not protect civilians at Srebrenica. Who are the true heroes of this war? A Canadian judge who leads after-mortem trial for atrocities that mostly happened because her organization could not prevent them? Where is the criticism in this movie?
