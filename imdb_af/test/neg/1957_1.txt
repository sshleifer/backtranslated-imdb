It's the worst movie I've ever seen. From the thin, dimly-lit sets, to the ridiculous acting, to the childless plot and turbulent, protracted action sequences, this film is so bad, its hilarious. For about ten minutes. Then you will reach the remote control or the power outlet to end this movie non-experience. Although apparently tied up with the entire production and acting staff's collective tongue in the cheek, I found Jack Frost 2 so horrible that it wasn't available more than fifteen minutes. If you didn't have enough of this, you should be drug abuse.
