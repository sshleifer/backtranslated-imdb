A man comes to the office of the psychiatric dr. Sammael (Joan Severance), who claims the devil Asmodeus (Kane Hodder), the martyr of the 13th level of hell, and he wants to tell strange things. He says that he made an agreement with Lucifer to become human again. He had to kill his virgin Mary Elizabeth (Alison Brie) on the day their mother died and she had to kill six people and save the Antichrist, and then he would escape from the pit and be born again. When Mary Elizabeth conceives, her stressed and abused sister Catherine (Denise Crosby) does not believe she is a virgin, but their father and former midwife Albert Martino (James Callahan) examines his daughter and sees her intact hymen. Meanwhile, the Church is discovering the truth about Mary Elizabeth's pregnancy and sending the priest and former military father Anthony (Eddie Velez) Maria Mary. She is dominated by the fetus and forced to kill a truck driver, Lars (Jorg Sirtl), who is the lover of her tenant and friend Jennifer (Azalea Davila), and Jennifer herself and eat their hearts and drink their blood, but she believes she has nightmares. But during the ultrasound she realized she was carrying a monster and she asked her father to stop her pregnancy. But it's too late. <br /> <br /> The horrible "Born" is a B-movie (actually a Z-movie) that believes it is a good movie. The result is a pretentious and disappointing production, with a coherent and absurd story without humor and horrible acting and direction. The plot is a complete mess: there is a priest who is a hit and former soldier; A demon in an existential crisis goes to a psychiatric; a father investigating the virginity of his daughter; two female demons (succubus?) standing naked like a statue with both hands covering their generations; a character who is a slut, and only exists to expose her beautiful body. There are many scenes with free and cheap nudity. But the worst is the play: the unknown main actress Alison Brie is histrionic, with ridiculous voices and grimace. Sorry, Mrs Alison Brie, but I hate your annoying performance. I didn't recognize Joan Severance, who has a good performance, as I still had the image of her youth. Denise Crosby plays a hateful character and, like everyone else, she gets older, but she is still a good actress. I believe that if the author and the director included some dark humor and accepted that this movie is a B-movie, the story could have worked better and better. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Anti-Cristo" ("The Antichrist")
