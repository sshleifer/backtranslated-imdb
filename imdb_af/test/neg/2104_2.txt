O. Good. Grief. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie title in the TV schedules and thought, "I have to watch this movie, cut it off at night on a plane, it will be terrible, but hopefully laugh too. Sounds great bad. " Well, I was half right. <br /> <br /> This movie is eye-catchingly bad and unhappy, even unintentionally, hilarious. It's just bad. Worse still, it takes almost an hour to get to anything that looks like action. For the first half of the movie we have to endure a few mumbled foreign languages ​​(Mexican or Spanish, apologies for my ignorance) and act terribly as a woman raises live snakes for reasons that we only find out later. Then we have to endure even more horrific acting, and we find out that those who are in the foreign language can speak English anyway, since the snakes eventually come off the train and move the things from the sedates to the ridiculous. <br /> Low budget doesn't always mean bad, but in this case it is. What we have here is a movie that has given no thought, a terrible writing, a bad cast and not even the sense to capitalize is very little strength. I give two points for some decent special effects and a messy end, but it still feels a bit too generous. Avoid if you can. <br /> <br /> See it if you want: Stagknight, The Wicker Man remake, horrible CGI.
