When I first watched this movie, I didn't get the title. I realized it had Chevy Chase in it, with the same name he had in Caddyshack, so I had an idea that it was Caddyshack 2. At the end of the movie when I found out, it was Caddyshack 2. I was disappointed. They could have done better. Dan Akroyd I thought it was bad. The whole story was bad. Call this movie with a different title, but don't call it Caddyshack 2. You give that big movie a bad name. Jackie Mason's daughter when I first saw her looked like his wife. How old is this girl? Geez. How about making this movie a bit credible. I thought Chevy Chase was good.
