I usually like Sion Sono's work, but this movie is completely delayed. But unfortunately, not delayed enough to make it entertainingly slow. I just sat, mouth agape, wondering how it would end. The plot just makes a whisper of sentence. I think it was meant to be camps. I mean, ghost hair extensions - how can it not be? But the humor, as it were, fell flat. Not funny. Not scary. Not sorry. I might say Sono was a hired hand on this project, but he also seems to have written this boring trash. I still need to fill some lines, what else to say? I think I can finish by saying: Good luck next time, Sono-san.
