Wow ... as a big fan of Larry McMurtry's western stories and especially the Lonesome Dove series, I was looking forward to Comanche Moon's s-o-o-o. What a great letdown. Perhaps my expectations were set too high because of the everyday excellence of Lonesome Dove ... the story, the characters, the cinematography, the music ... it all worked. <br /> <br /> Compared to this, Comanche Moon is like a bad Saturday Night Live shit. The characters are completely colorless, the dialogue is chattering and the plot is unconscious all over the place. The actors seem to read all of TelePrompTers. I couldn't relate to any of the characters, good guys, bad guys, not even the casual characters. David Midthunder's performance is particularly prominent. It seems to have been picked from an eighth grade middle school performance. I'm sorry, I'd like to find something positive about Comanche Moon, but I just can't do it. There is nothing there.
