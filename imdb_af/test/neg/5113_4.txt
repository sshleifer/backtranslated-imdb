Orson Welles' 1974 documentary "F for Fake" investigates deception and fraud, mainly on two men who have been exposed as fraud. Clifford Irving is a biographer who wrote the allegedly fraudulent Howard Hughes autobiography, but at least it seems his innocence. The other major of the film is artist Elmyr de Hory, a man who has spent his life-dyed fakes of famous masterpieces, and sometimes sells them to museums as real works by original artists. Between these stories intervened where Welles did magical tricks to illustrate points, and he also speaks of the fact that his career started as a fraud when he first lied to his CV and then a radio sensation with 'War of the Worlds' "<br /> <br /> I wanted to love this movie and find it deep, because I'm such a Welles delegate, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. Part of the problem Lied by the fact that it was not only non-linear, but it was completely scattered, while appreciating sincere editing and quick jumps and zoomers, especially when used in an unusual format like a documentary, there was simply Too much of it in "F for Fake." They've created a distraction as opposed to the lending style. If the story was more clear and comprehensive, I think the editing might not be so annoying. made more unpleasant by the fact that it really interesting subjects were Elmyr de Hory. His artistic fiction brings up the subject of fraud in the art world, and who is truly capable of determining the authenticity of certain works; And if the works are not authentic, what does it say about those who admire the pieces in museums? This is a documentary I would say to give at least a shot, but don't be afraid to turn it off if you don't enjoy it. This is definitely the most discombobulated documentary I've ever seen; It is a cross between a documentary, an art film and an experimental film, none of which is properly represented or isolated. I have no lesser opinion of Welles after I have seen it, but I do not think it is a glowing example in his oeuvre. 4/10 - Totally
