I just watched it because I saw some good reviews about this, so I expected at least a half-way movie. Toybox doesn't even deliver it. There are so many problems with this movie, that I don't even know where to start, so I will list some main issues. (Again, spoiler warning. Just read it, it will save you trouble watching it later). <br /> <br /> One of these films starts with, and often calls, the mythical folklore of both Celeste Noir (a witch, who claims to be the main character she is the reincarnation of), and the middle people ( or something, an evil man with a big smile who opens people with hooks and sells them inside pies. I liked it, it was a cute concept, anything to do with pies is simply enjoyable. But then you look at the movie and it's all about this idiot girl and her boyfriend (And what was the deal with him? Was he psychic? Did he have powers? Why did he see faces that even the so-called 'Witch' didn't? ?), and they meet their mad family. Not really insane, they argue a lot. This is what most of this movie is arguing about, and they never touch the suspected myth again, except in some confusing scenes that you can't make head or tail. <br /> <br /> In one scene, Berenice (The Chief Witch-Related Character) walks down and does a kind of ritual by candlelight. It seems quite important, but nothing happens after she does. It just wasted more of my time. <br /> <br /> Who was the guy with his dog? You see him from home from the movie with that evil reddish dog, and then he finally gets there and is killed? What the hell? Was he the middle man? Was his dog in possession? Did anyone kill the dog? They never really showed it. Also, any scene in which the Vicar was involved was completely useless and only served to explain the lame end poorly. It was as if they had all these interesting character ideas and they all went nowhere! The boyfriend, who of course had some kind of power, but never explained it. The grandmother, who also had some kind of gate force, never used them. The Vicar, which ... Well, never, there really was no point for his existence. And then there was Berenice and her stupid amulet. Could she really do magic or did she just use it to reflect light and blind people? It was a total waste of time, and the only reason I gave it two stars is because a) Berenice kinda is cute, and b) It called tomatoes. Save yourself the money to rent it and dearest god, don't even think about buying it unless money is wasting, is a new whore.
