While being credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, it's not the cat-and-mouse team, but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off pointing to Africa and avoiding itself in the stereotypical Burn cork makeup to try to mix. While the dialect humor is mostly paralyzed, there is a short music series that includes "black skeletons" that were entertaining. However, I have to ask how can Tom and Jerry still keep their make-up even after they have been plunged into the water a few times? One of the many entries made by the Van Beuren Corporation for distribution by RKO Radio Pictures before RKO signed an agreement with Disney. It's just worth seeing if you're an animated buffalo or interested in how certain ethnicities are stereotyped as a way of entertainment.
