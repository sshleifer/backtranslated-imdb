Martha Plimpton did some sought-after movies working with River Phoenix and Harrison Ford, but she could never extend her limited, drunk appeal in the same class as Molly Ringwald. This film, which is almost released, is just an extension of her late 80's / early 90's to find a screen saver that can be identified for filmmakers, and this represents another failure. Plimpton plays a troubled young woman who, on her 21st birthday, finds out she was adopted and - worse than that - left her as a baby on her parents' doorstep! She goes out to find her biological mother and father, but the viewer doesn't have an idea why she wants it (would simple curiosity give her so much determination?). Unattractive material given sitcom handling; it starts on the wrong foot and never restores. Plimpton gives a sour performance, but Hector Elizondo and Mary Kay Place are fine like her adoptive parents. * 1/2 of ****
