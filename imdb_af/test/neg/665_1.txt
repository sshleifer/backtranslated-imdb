After watching this movie, I have nothing less than contempt for any of those involved in making this tired movie. For one, as a general remark, the storyline was literally incredible and filled with incredible clich√©s everywhere. The same goes for the dialogue going to the lowest common denominator and it offers absolutely zero unpredictable original lines. The play was also terrific with Kane showing at least 3 distinct and distinct emotions throughout the movie. Even the use of modern special effects failed, as each prop could easily be distinguished from its real counterpart. Overall, I wouldn't recommend anyone to even think about reading this feature, as it will surely waste 83 (not even 90!) Minutes of life.
