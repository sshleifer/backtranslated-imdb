It was the worst Wrestlemania in history. The only good games were Ricky Steamboat vs Hercules Hernandez, and the tag title game between the British Bulldogs and the Dream Team (this one is on classic borders). Everything else was poor or terrible. The idea of ​​having three host cities was unnecessary, confusing and wasted the flow of the show. The well-known guests were terribly commented on, especially Susan Saint James. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the middle of the WWF, you are better off renting or buying Wrestlemania 3, or just about any other PPV case.
