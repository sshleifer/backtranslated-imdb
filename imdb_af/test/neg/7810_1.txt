I was intrigued by the nasty boss character, since I myself was one, and the real boss's daughter was attractive and it was interesting to see a younger Ashton Kushner, but this movie is so insane that I had to turn it off. It was a waste of time to see it. When people started looking around the lounge, it was too much to look at. Painful, terrible crap movie. If they just showed it a little. Are there really people out there who find it funny and like it? I was relieved to know that IMDb readers considered it so low. The career side of the story was intriguing, as well as the young man trying to get a promotion and win the benefits of the boss. I kept that part. Also the opening scene with colleagues on the train was cool as I like his colleagues' characters. If you can stomach non-sensible movies or you are fairly young then it may be one you can stomach.
