I rented this movie because I'm a big Dudikoff fan. I thought it couldn't be that bad. Boy was I wrong! At the 15-minute point I was looking for the other to rip the DVD and flee it back to the rental shop, but they refused. They swore it had to get better. <br /> <br /> They were wrong! This movie lacked everything. The actors delivered their lines with as much emotion as a comatose rock! The plot was ridiculous and I was offended by Hollywood assuming people were stupid enough to enjoy it. None of the characters worked very well together. Ice-T gives one of its worst performances here. <br /> <br /> After I looked at the image of the wrong plane, bad guys got up to be shot, and clipped and missing clips I screamed and scared. head on concrete. The film got its plateau of ignorance when people at the space station used a lift to travel. Space suits are not needed and there is gravity in space, no matter what true astronauts may say. <br /> <br /> I didn't complete this movie and hated it. I don't want to finish this movie. It's slow suicide. I can feel my cerebral cortex planning to avenge the torture I penetrate.
