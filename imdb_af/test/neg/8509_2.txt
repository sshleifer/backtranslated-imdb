If you didn't read Tolkien's masterpiece; Prepare yourself for the best movie experience ever! However, if ... after reading the books a few times, I have come over many years to love the characters and story, and feel I know it intimately. I have my own personal vision of The Shire, Hobbiton and the Character Gallery. So for me the movie was a disappointment. Why? It dictates the appearance of the characters (inevitable), it changes events, it removes important storyline, it removes so important storyline. Large pieces that the Lord makes of the rings that are, are simply ignored. Even 2001 special effects cannot do Tolkien's (and your own) imagination. Peter Jackson made an honest effort against the impossible, and I don't think anyone else could have done it better! But the fact remains, I'm sorry to see the movie. The next time I read the Lord of the rings, Peter Jackson's limited vision will jump forward, not my own.
