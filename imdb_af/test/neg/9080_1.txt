This is one of the few films - perhaps the only one - haunting me for years. It was the first thing I ever saw people tortured, so much so that blood from their mouths flowed from their teeth and shouted. It was brutal; the worst thing I've ever seen on film. <br /> <br /> Dr. Clement Molloch, played by Joseph Mayer, is still one of the worst characters I've ever seen on film, and I watched thousands. He was so sadistic that I would never watch this movie again and I would not recommend it either. He makes Hannibal Lecter like Mr. Rogers. If people are tortured, it's not your idea to have fun, then stay away from this movie. <br /> <br /> I know there are many sick people out there, many of them professional film critics, who probably enjoyed this sordid. , sick story. Anyway, it's a "B" movie, with a dull dialogue and some wood acting by Charles Bronson. This is not one of his better efforts. Even if it was, there are so many terrible scenes here that you don't want to see. Trust me on this one.
