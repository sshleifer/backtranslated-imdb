First, I will say that I will be as subjective as I can. <br /> <br /> There will be some potential spoilers ahead. So be careful. <br /> <br /> I never see movies, but this one in particular I felt I had to revisit. This movie Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children, based on the ultra popular RPG (Final Fantasy VII) for the ps1, has long been in the works. After years of hype and the dozens of trailers (of which I have never seen, I only saw quietly). This movie has the legions of fans really excited about seeing their favorite characters on the big screen. I played and completed the game a few times as a good fan, and I was very excited about such a movie freak. So I thought to myself, "WHAT CAN TRAFFIC?". <br /> <br /> Well, the movie started in the first 20 minutes, but then things get out of hand while the movie progresses. Without a doubt, this is the best looking CGI animation around, but it won't help a poor plot, undeveloped characters, and remaining action scenes. <br /> <br /> Here's the story basically. Those three silver-haired Nancy boys in leather who have nothing to do with the game are presumably clones of Sephiroth (he is the villain of the game that all his alleged clones supposedly killed) trying to disrupt all the children to one Or why didn't it really explain that well, probably an army (of children)? Also create some of the story on a child named Denzel, I don't know who this kid is or what his point is, he just seems depressed all the time. So the sephirot clones are also involved in a type of scheme that has a disease called geostigma, which only affects the children, this disease seems boring and causes small amounts of skin discoloration. <br /> <br /> Now the cloud should save The day of these guys. Apparently, Cloud and his fellow teammates learned the ability of flight, I felt a bit insulted that these characters were wandering around a city that carried a dragon and its feet there constantly. Perhaps if the movie wasn't that over, the view relaxes and then they can be surprised by something incredible. The real problem of this movie is logic. Now I know what you're going to say, "But it's called FANTASY! It should have those ideas in it!" Well, it's a foolish way of thinking, the game has itself grounded in some reality and the movie has to follow in that context. Context and logic in this movie is contradictory, I can explain it all, but if I did, I would start writing the script. <br /> <br /> Also, some scenes in this movie were extremely confronted and thin. like when all the characters from the game only appear at the time of their compulsory screen time, so they may not upset the fans. They come up, do a little bit and have nothing in the story. <br /> <br /> If it's too long, the simpler review - <br /> <br /> visually astounding the first 20 minute top-notch cgi animation action scenes <br /> <br /> the consulative about indulgent action / unbalanced action (leaving the viewer on the climax) poor plot super human characters = no tension of the j-rock soundtrack / score (what happened to the band?) Terrible end <br /> < br /> BIG TIME SPOILER- <br /> <br /> Now the end of this movie has really disappointed me. they could have been the very cool and sweet ending where the cloud died and in subsequent life gathered with aeris, but after the big battle at the end the cloud was shot in the back, the kind of wound where the bullet blew through the chest. then the cloud had its 100th flash back in the movie and then awakened in a pool of life stream. (Now I remember the flow of life in the game, but it didn't get upward features. If they did, they would have made Aeris alive again, making a whole different story). So cloud is brought back to life and everyone has a party and dives into the pool and we have an ultra cheezy feature / life-like moment. <br /> <br /> not that movie doesn't have it's moments. it is worth seeing for his visuals. but that's all. <br /> <br /> Unlike that, it's not really a good movie. It is strict for blind fans of the game. not for people who care about plot and character and storytelling.
