Nothing can be more appealing than the idea of ​​a good love story with Kristin Scott Thomas and Harrison Ford. The cool, refined English beauty and the warm-blooded American male - which could be more enjoyable? Well, it's not that movie. They immediately ruin it by throwing Kristin Scott Thomas as a US Congresswoman. It's like throwing Hugh Grant as Babe Ruth. Or Colin Firth as Al Capone. Kristin Scott Thomas is exactly the kind of woman you can't handle with greasy ex-junkies in dirty slums, or in smaller crowds and kissing babies. She would have been much better than the English-born widow of an aristocratic Senator, the kind that belongs to the hunting club and goes to flower shows, but has no idea how the other half lives. <br /> <br /> Then there's Harrison Ford as a regular man cop. Certainly, he's tough enough for the role. But the idea that he is going to romance is this beautiful, high society beauty that is difficult to swallow. Why couldn't he be a difficult, affluent, blue-tabled reform politician who inherits the senate of Kristin's Senate Senate's place? The two of them were initially pretty cool to each other, but Kristin was warmly welcomed to him, and he began to show her some of the rawer side of life - things her husband had protected her from. Her political awakening coincides with the jolly passion of a newer, more blue collar, lover - one who appreciates her police and refinement much more than her aristocratic husband. Now it's a love story! Instead, however, you get an empty, meaningless "thriller" where the action is dragging and nothing happens. Well, there's a ghetto-style "drive by" scene where Harrison is almost killed, but it is so sudden and inexplicable. It's really more like a welcome comic relief. <br /> <br /> The air is always gray in this movie, and our refined, sweet Kristin always looks a bit chilled. When thinking of passion, she looks more like dreaming of a wool blanket and a cup of tea! She also looks mostly sleepy, as she really wants to go to bed than to screw Harrison Ford. <br /> <br /> All the things I'm considering say you can't blame her.
