I can just about laugh at anything, but unfortunately there is not a single one found in this stink bomb. I watched this movie from start to finish and didn't even tear a smile. I'm shocked that Sandler, Schneider, Spade, etc. Their names will be placed on this piece of crap. Worse than the worst that ever came out of the worst ever came from former SNL players. What else can I say? How can such a tasteless, extremely fearless fool come from such a pool of apparent talent !! Maybe I lost my sense of humor (not probably), but I can't remember a movie I didn't like for so long. What a waste of 2 hours I will never return.
