Summary: A wage warrior who lives in the desert and acts as an agent for other swordsmen, remembers how his life seems to be. It started that the woman he loved chose to marry his brother so he left his hometown. One of the swordsmen is Huang, who is himself in the middle of a complicated love story, where a woman wants to kill him because he ran away from a promise to marry her younger sister. But the sister wants to hire a sword fighter to have Huang protected, and everything is brought to the brink when the woman and her sister are really the same person. <br /> <br /> Comment: I released the Redux version. in 2008 from the original released in 1994. How the two versions differ, I can't say, but the Redux is very stylized in the way of Chinese Wuxia action. It is a pity that the style has forgotten one of the most important elements of a successful and entertaining film. An understandable story. But where is his style and visual elements much more important and much more in the focus of author and director Kar Wai Wong. Therefore, there are many colorful, very beautiful scenes that are completely unrelated to the story. <br /> <br /> The editing and timeline of the story is also abused. Many are left out in the scenes, the timeline is broken down and rearranged in a confusing way. Very slow and quiet scenes are suddenly relieved by surprisingly brutal and seemingly unmotivated battles, just to relieve themselves of something else and unrelated. The result is a confusing and very uninteresting film. <br /> <br /> Thanks to these cruel but very few battles, the film is placed in action genre. The poster and pictures also imply it, but can be considered almost as false marketing. Just a few minutes out of the 90 can be seen as anything like action, the other can't get away from it any more. The film as a whole is very slow, boring and therefore very boring. Not even the rare action-packed scenes help, as they are so disconnected from the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I can say that I'm not a fan of this Chinese style, as they often suffered from the same problems, most importantly the visuals are more important than the story, but Ashes of Time Redux is maybe the worst example I saw. <br /> <br /> 3/10
