I thought "dolls making crutches" were pretty low, but I don't think Carlos Mencia's show even qualifies as a comedy. His main goal is to make the audience incredibly uncomfortable while using the word "beaner" as many times as possible. I have never been forced to write a review explaining the horror of anything on IMDb before, but I really hope that this show will never be renewed or rearranged. <br /> <br /> Mencia is trying to be the next Dave Chapelle, and maybe he's just hired through the network because they hoped he would fill those shoes. It's clear to the frost of Chapelle's intro (blues guys vs mariachi band). However, Mencia has absolutely no attitude and does not dip into the popular view of the Spanish culture to get a creative pussy about it every time. Instead, he puts a small number of shocking nicknames for his fellow Latinos and jokes about immigration. He will use the light darkness of his skin each time to enjoy someone else, such as Middle Eastern cultures. These jokes consist mainly of the repetition of every joke or stereotype made against the culture, and perhaps some incredibly old topics (such as 9/11), in a dimmed stand-up style while wearing for himself laugh to cover the audience's style. I think he is too scared to really offend anyone, so it just makes the viewer uncomfortable. He also kills jokes. If you've ever seen, "Why is the f *** this news?" You will know what I'm talking about. It's funny at first, but he just gets on and off at a stage Captain Obvious. <br /> <br /> It's a train track that's purely painful to watch.
