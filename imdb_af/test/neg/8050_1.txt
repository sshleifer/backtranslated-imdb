"Son, you have to stop the experiments I started!" Badly, no one also said this for whom green this project has eased !! I was almost literally dragged into this movie by a friend of mine for a midnight show when we were in high school. Now, on a Friday night, a midnight movie in high school, you don't expect much, but c'mon !! And when I see it again year after year, I stand still in my original opinion. Great special effects, but so what !! Certainly one of the worst movies ever made. Unless you enjoy blood and guts and see some Hollywood veterinarians (Steiger & Hunter), they make a fool of a goat. Bah !!!
