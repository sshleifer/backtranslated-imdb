The worst movie I've ever seen! 90 minutes of ominous movie-up. All the ingredients to make this movie a real CRAP work. Bad acting, bad directing, bad storytelling, bad makeup, bad dialogue, bad effects and bad reasoning behind certain actions taken by the characters. It also threw a very naked shot from a stupid blonde, and a breast shot from a stupid Asian girl. Both attempts were scary, as these girls are ugly. Some good horror movies have come from the 80's, but this can never be considered one of them. Kevin Tenney also committed one of the greatest sins in storytelling. He introduced characters at the end of the film (An Old Man and Old Woman). I will vote for 1 out of 10, but the voting system doesn't work that way. From the title order I knew it would suck and I would return my DVD, but Best Buy doesn't pay DVDs or consumables as they call it, or so my receipt says. I did "The Dunwich Horror" and it was really god-horrible, but I still feel that "Night of the Demons" (a clear Evil Dead RIP-OFF) was much worse than Dunwich Horror. It's just like "The Howling," how in hell can follow, get milk from this anorexic cow? Save your money and get the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (just don't get his prosecutions) or "The Evil Dead" or "Dawn of the Dead." "Night of the Demons" is a very, very, very bad investment. Every second of it was just malicious, ominous pain for the audience, because the whole movie was terrible! Do yourself a favor, don't see it! You will save some brain cells.
