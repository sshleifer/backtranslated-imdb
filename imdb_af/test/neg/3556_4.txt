The Ealing Comedies form their own specific subgenre in the history of the film. They were furious, mad reflection on British life in the late and early fifties. They are always amusing, but I feel it is misleading to characterize them as comedies. They are weak and good-natured, rather than laughing out loud. The best of them, however, is nailed with a submerged satire and shoots with an occasional dark stripe (especially friendly hearts and coronets and ladykillers). <br /> <br /> I have a love for everyone, but the Lavender Hill Mob is probably the one I have the most trouble with. Compared to the others, it looks slightly perfused. For me, this is a sketch for a movie, but one that needs a lot more time in development before it was ready for the cameras. <br /> <br /> Everything about it is a little undercooked. For example, no one gets any true context or background. Henry is merely a conscientious drip, whose secret dreams and hidden ambitions are not recognized, while Albert is a frustrated artist who has forced him to prostitute his talent by making gift shops for a living. It represents a motive for their crime, but nothing that happens afterwards is a result of their characters or their plan. <br /> <br /> Other characters are introduced, but do not play a real role in the story. The elderly resident of Henry's guesthouse can (with her love of detectives) be made an illegal thorn in its side, but is simply used as a background color. Similarly, the various policemen entering and leaving the action are simply there to type the plot. <br /> <br /> As a result, the film is driven entirely by its complicated plot devices, which I find both frustrating and poorly irritating. The non-inventive robbery is achieved with minimal problems, although Albert is prevented from doing his part in the plan (by Sidney Tafler's Clayton). The gold is then smuggled to France without excuse. Everything would have gone smoothly if it was not for a minor hitch, based on the French pronunciation of the letter 'R', causing six of the golden Eiffel Towers to be accidentally sold to some English schoolgirls. <br /> <br /> This leads to a series of zealous hunts, as Henry and Albert try to get them. These scenes are well executed, but at every point the conspirators become frustrated in their quest for schoolgirls through a series of complete accidents. It's as if God deliberately intervenes to give them a hard time. This kind of plot always grinded my teeth. <br /> <br /> When they finally follow the last Eiffel Tower to a Police Academy exhibition and tear it under the nose of John Gregson's police inspector (why is he there, anyway?) are all pieces of plot logic leave. The final motorcycle jackets then only fill in screen time until we are returned to the frame that the picture started. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't even bother us the fate of Albert (Stanley Holloway). ), Lackery (Sid James) and Shorty (Alfie Bass). <br /> <br /> This brilliant little hairdresser has the professionalism of the Ealing team behind it, so it's far from a bad movie. I suspect most viewers will find it much nicer than I do (and why not?), But I can't help thinking. There was a much better movie waiting to be made, if there was just more time and effort on meat. From both the characters and the story. <br /> <br /> Due to the standards established by Ealing, Lavender Hill Mob is a missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> PS: One funny footnote is that Audrey Hepburn gets her single line ahead of time, but Archie Duncan remains anonymous despite his much larger contribution. I think she just had a better agent.
