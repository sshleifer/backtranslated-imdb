It really is a repetition that should never be found out of the stable. It has two roles acting in completely different layers. At the top of their game is Joan Plowright and Maximillian Schell. Every nuance of the Franks is in the naked eye. At the bottom are Melissa Gilbert and Doris Roberts. I can't imagine how Schell and Plowright can play as well as Gilbert and Roberts do their anti-magic. Gilbert ruins every scene she's in. It's like Dad who knows best in the Ghetto. She is Ann Frank light. Her run at Helen Keller was thin but not terrible. This is shrine. Doris Roberts makes Mrs. Van Damm is not irritating. She is a completely inappropriate choice to play the sexually hungry woman whose flirtatious, disgruntled presence caused so much trouble in the Acher house. It had to be played by a woman who could convince us that she at least remembered what it was like to act. Her weight is not the problem. Joan Plowright played this part beautifully. Roberts was on a career high when it was made, has lots of press and lots of opportunities. Her performance here shows her weaknesses as an actress shameful. <br /> <br /> James Coco and Clive Reville, most of their scenes with Gilbert and Roberts, and strong though they are, are completely incapable of withdrawing the damage. done by their partners. Reville is a brave actor capable of giving the kind of iconic performance Ed Wynne gave in the original movie. He didn't get any support from Gilbert. She drains the color from every scene. <br /> <br /> I read with horror the comments of those of you who grew up to watch this version, filled with attachments to these performances. This is a lesson in how the version you see first is attached to you. It reminds me of some inferior products I loved in my childhood. I encourage you to look the original. It has very few patches and it is head and shoulders above this mess.
