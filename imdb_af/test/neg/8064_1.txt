How bad? Well, compared to this movie, Cannibal is the Holocaust Citizen Kane. There is the stationary play, the horrible dialogue, the half-baked plot and, like his companion, too much in the way of screen animals actually done. Unlike the Holocaust, Ferox is a straight forward movie. It doesn't mean it's a pseudo-documentary. In some ways, the production helps the film to be very sharp and sharp compared to the holocaust. Unfortunately, we again get a group of people who are morally reprehensible. They torture the Natives and essentially bring everything they get about themselves. There is really nothing in this movie that makes it worth it. I was pretty lenient with my review of the Holocaust because of a real attempt at style and style, but in Ferox's case there is no reason to see it unless you just come on blood and gore.
