Although predictable and confronted, not a bad movie. It entertaines, what is everything Van Damme hopes to do. The ubiquitous twin device is being used again (as in a large number of Van Damme movies), but it is not troublesome, except for long-time fans. Natasha is beautiful and worth watching. Action is decent, nothing obvious to Van Damme, but exciting. I can support Van Damme fans and even those who aren't, but don't mind an action movie with a nice couple. The Russian Mob is a good concept and topical for the day. Obviously he is not his best movie, but his worst.
