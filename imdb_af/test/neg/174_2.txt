I heard people were comparing this movie to Sideways. How this comparison is made I will never guess, because this movie was by no means comparable to Sideways. <br /> <br /> These 2 movies were so different from Star Wars and the Thornbirds. All they had in common was that they both had wine as a subject. <br /> <br /> Although the interviews in this documentary were semi-interesting, they were ever destroyed by the worst camera work ... attempted. I have never seen worse camera work in my life and I compare it to home videos accidentally taken by 5-year-olds. <br /> <br /> I give these two stars, ONLY for the interesting interviews with French wine types and to show how naughty and corrupt the American wine companies are (Are not all companies obtrusive and corrupt?) I will give it - 10 stars (yes it is NEGATIVE 10) for the unfortunate, terrible, terrible, terrible, VERTIGO INDUCING, 5-year-old-better-better camera device.
