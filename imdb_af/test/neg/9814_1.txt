I saw these movie years about 8 years ago when it first came out, and the only memories I have about it are: 1. That it was terrible. 2. That Linnea Quigley repeatedly uses her arms and legs in one scene for about 15 minutes (it looks the same length). 3. One scene where a character touches a sledge hammer in his head. In this scene, when the hammer is connected, the head breaks like glass. It's pretty bad.
