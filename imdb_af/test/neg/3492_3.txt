Given these incredible reviews of this movie, I expected something extraordinary. It certainly starts well with a sharp and sharp dialogue, and a good role in place. A series of Robert Altman-style interwoven stories roll in the viewer with some compelling scenes. I found it to be enjoyable entertainment until the second half of the movie, unfortunately, collapsing like a pack of cards. Stack a series of ridiculous coincidences and right-wing messages until I'm deeply disappointed and wonder what all the fuss is about. Paul Haggis tackled the subject of race in LA, and it only seems that this movie has raised a new level of interest. Since most of the academy voters live in LA and have experienced racism to some extent, this film is certainly an impact on them. This means that the Oscar for Best Picture goes to the racing movie or the gay movie. Let's hope it's the latter, because Brokeback Mountain is a bona fide masterpiece that deserves recognition.
