I was expecting to see a more cinematic style of filming, but unfortunately it was just a bad low budget action movie that just didn't have the talent for it. The story is about a very beautiful woman named Teri Marshall (Heather Thomas), whose boyfriend Rick (Jeffrey Combs) works for a secret agency and invented a motorcycle that is dotted and can shoot lasers and rockets and a helmet that can shoot lasers. too. The head of the agency Bosarian (Martin Landau) made a $ 5 million deal to sell it and sends two hired thugs to kill Rick and Teri and collect the bike. A long blonde villain named Rolf (Dar Robinson) and his partner Hanna (Dawn Wildsmith) are killed by Rick, but Teri survives. While discovering at home, she discovered a video band that Rick described in terms of his invention, which helped Teri to do next. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Teri is being chased by various agents and she is caught and tortured, but doesn't talk about where a motorcycle needs is not, but she gets help from a federal agent called Waters (Martine Beswick) where they eventually use the motorcycle. for a bloody shooting. <br /> <br /> This movie is being edited by Fred Olen Ray, who has made his career to make ultra-low budget exploitation movies, but he made a big mistake here by leaving out the exploitation aspect. and try to make an action movie. Apart from a fast-paced early-stage scene, there is no nudity and the ordinary titles used by viewers to see in a Ray movie are not true. I don't think anyone expected Thomas to get naked, but she didn't wear one sexy outfit. Not that it stopped me biting her in the clear nail and admiring her near perfect shape, but Ray really blew it in this case. Like all his films, the movie is fun to watch and many well-known faces have roles like Robert Quarry, Huntz Hall, Troy Donahue, Tim Conway Jr., Michael Reagan and Russ Tamblyn. Stuntman Dar Robinson dies shortly after it's made and it's his last play and the film is dedicated to him. You have to wonder why Landau would waste him with such a mess, but I was interested in pouring Combs into a very rare romantic role. Is Thomas good in this movie? Who cares! I think she showed that she had become a popular B-movie star when she wanted to, but it never happened. Ray wastes everyone's time with this effort, although the cast is nice to watch, but he left out the elements that make him a pleasant filmmaker.
