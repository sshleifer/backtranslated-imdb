It appears that all companies enjoying the rates taken by Romania for photos give the image that has disappeared since 1994. They scarcely try to get the oldest car they founded, but they never take photos of the Lamorghini, Ferrari, Aston. Martin and all the new Mercedes that you can find in some important countries. <br /> <br /> A second problem is that they filmed in some neighborhoods in Bucharest where they could hide the streets and get dirt. People dressing up with me may not know 90 clothes, so they seem so stupid that you will realize the writing, is perhaps a second hand bought or worthwhile by eBay. <br /> <br /> I knew the future was going to make movies in the US and to make good money there than to give us a little and to shame our country. I have no reason to believe anyone will understand the message.
