The good things first: I agree with another viewer who said that Gene Raymond has a wonderful drunken scene. He did - I was tickling to finally get a chance to laugh. And other moments I found amusing - Raymond's parents in the bathroom with the defective plumbing, and the scene in the restaurant with Robert Montgomery trying to make Carole Lombard jealous by giving sweets to a stranger. <br /> <br /> But overall, I was shocked. I love Carol Lombard and most of Hitchcock. And I understand the limitations imposed on the productions by the Hays code. But it was embarrassing and horrible to watch. Of course I knew they would end up together, that's a romantic comedy. But it doesn't make sense, it happens too fast. Plus, I can't believe the careers of love when faced with such painful behavior, both physically and confrontationally.
