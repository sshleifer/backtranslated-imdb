The storyline is a rejected claim jumper and made an agreement with the devil to find gold. It is forced to protect it forever. A lot of friends find the gold and are spoken by the old miner and they are forced to blow the gold to smithereens to send him back to hell. <br /> <br /> I mean seriously ... how did this movie not win the Oscar for the film of the year? What a compelling story of late 20s running straight out of the 1800s from a claim jersey. I love how in other movies you can't kill the monster, but they can knock it out ... this movie they write the monster as completely unforgivable. <br /> <br /> Opening the movie shows the Nightmare on Elm Street part 4, but what the hell, not like the movie, was also a 5 star classic. <br /> <br /> The height of the movie is when we are introduced to a girl who has never been to school, never was out of town, never learned to read or write .... But speak perfect English, smoke hot and wear the latest fashion. How did the Oscar miss it? <br /> <br /> OK, I've finished the bad jokes. This movie is pure crap and just look at it if you have nothing better to do and all the spices on the spice rack are already in alphabetical order. /> <br /> 2 out of 10
