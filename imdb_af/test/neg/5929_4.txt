It is apparently the final film of the Left Behind series, which is the fundamentalist minister and writer Tim LaHaye's idea of ​​what we can expect in the future of planet Earth. If so, we can expect an activist presidency in every sense of the word if Barack Obama becomes president next year. <br /> <br /> The fantastic four of the revelation are all back with one throw change, Arnold Pinnock, who would know the most as Life With Derek's advisor, is now the minister's place of Clarence Gilyard. Brad Johnson as the anti-Christian pilot of the day and Christian at night is there as his daughter, Janaya Stephens, and ace investigating reporter, Kirk Cameron. These are the only four people on earth who have divided the true nature of UN Secretary General Nicolai Karpathie and throw sand back into his machinery. <br /> <br /> This time, as an ally, the United States President, Louis Gossett, Jr. are played. He has one hell of a rough time, especially the guerrilla launch on the RPG attack on a presidential car injury that Vice President Charles Martin Smith has killed. That's right, the Toad is Vice President. Someone was really badly smothered, because anyone who causes the damage knows that a president and vice-president never go together. <br /> <br /> All of them take the whole movie to convince Gossett exactly what Karpathy really is. The best one in the film is Gordon Currie and Karpathie. <br /> <br /> We still see another Left behind movie, but the door is left open, although people assure me that they are running from source material. by Tim LeHaye. I assume as long as they make money and these players can't get work in the mainstream movie industry. And there are some unresolved plot issues raised by Brad Johnson and Chelsea Noble that Mrs Kirk Cameron is in real life. <br /> <br /> One of the Fantastic Four dies in this movie, so it'll be the Fantastic Three or they'll get another fourth. Stay tuned.
