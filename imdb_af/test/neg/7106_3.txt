I made the mistake of buying it because I am collecting comic book-inspired movies. Even at $ 6 it was too expensive. I thought there might be some sense of camp in it, a "so bad", it gets well, maybe I went wrong. I've been watching it for a long time and have not remembered anything about it. Now I know why. I was bored with my thoughts and was looking for distractions to do something else. I'm all for grrrrl power, punk attitude and absurd humor, but Tank Girl doesn't work on any front. The writing is bad, you don't care about the characters and the humor is mostly paralyzed, except for some amusing one-liners. The special effects or places are poor or are often replaced by comic panels or animations that are only ruined compared to the live action. It's as if they didn't have the money to shoot the cool stuff and resort to drawings, no matter how cool it might be (an uncensored animated feature would be better for Tank Girl now I think about it). The action scenes were cheesy, but not on a fun b-movie. The tank itself was far from impressive or dynamic, although it was interesting. In fact, the best action scenes the tank was involved in were animation. <br /> <br /> It has interesting songs by renowned artists such as Bjork, Hole and Portishead, but instead of the atmosphere, they don't fit most of the time. Once they broke into a ridiculous song and dance number that was just senseless and terrible. I think that's when I totally agree. I suspect Tank Girl, played by Lori Petty, looks like the trashy puns part, but beyond her "stance" and sometimes almost amusing retorts, is more two-dimensional and superficial than the worst cartoon characters. Jet, played by Naomi Watts, is probably the only saving grace of the film and it is incredible how such a good actress was involved in this mess. Malcolm McDowell wasn't bad at playing his usual rogue. It may be a cult movie for some, but please think that it is actually different from the original independent comics and the original creators were disappointed with the movie itself (see the entry for Tank Girl on Wikipedia). <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 10
