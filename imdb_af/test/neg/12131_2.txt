Waters' contribution to the world of cinema should be searched with a telescope, and then if / if something is found (with great chance and good luck), it should be analyzed with a microscope. <br /> <br /> And after it has been analyzed, it will be discarded in the laboratory's bin for completely useless things. One single atom of that microscope is worth combining all its movies. <br /> <br /> The CB is equally champion and intentional. The usual JW stuff: comic-strip dialogue, simplistic plot, moronically cheerful characters, chewing gum doll, overworking etc. Waters knows he's not able to make a movie of quality, so he hides behind the mask of the "deliberately cheese film maker" - who is supposed to make him a special kind of "anti-artist". But in the world of theater it is an anti-talent that is often deceived for talent, which was exactly what Waters had hoped for - and finally. This is a decision. Charlatans infects the world of film and modern art; It's a pest. <br /> <br /> Perhaps we blame John Waters for inspiring Baz Luhrman to make all those awful, stupid turkeys. It's like a virus: one Waters creates five new bad directors, and then creates five more each, and so on. Where will it end? With "Dancer In The Dark"? Can the bomb actually be upstairs?
