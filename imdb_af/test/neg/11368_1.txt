It was the worst TV movie I've ever seen. The visuals were so thin, it made me dizzy. I hate the constant zoom and zoom out, and the regular Black and White to Color switch. I also thought the story didn't make sense of what it was, and it was another clich√©d Action Movie, with a hero a bad guy and a few hostages. I can make a better movie than with my own camera, why? I can keep it steady, something the director can't do. Really the worst thing I've ever seen before, you thought Disney was bad? I didn't even bother to watch the whole thing, because I'm sure I could guess the outcome, and the visuals were the worst I've ever seen.
