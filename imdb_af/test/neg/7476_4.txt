Again, we get a blend of themes well covered by so many previous films. The good and the bad seafood, courtesy of East of Eden. The American marine hero story, which he does not regard as one he knows. And the sad woman who may have fallen in love with another story. <br /> <br /> However, the mere fact that those stories are that ubiquitous is not so much of a problem. Because they can theoretically be better presented and treated. No luck this time, as all three wires eventually all flatten the same. <br /> <br /> Since the bad boy never really speaks to his father, the conflict is never solved properly. Except for the father who began to appreciate the bad boy, thanks to the latter, who repaired the kitchen of the distressed woman. Now, how satisfying it is. <br /> <br /> Then, the surprising homecoming marine is suspected that its infidelity wife is never resolved. Because he never really speaks to the man under suspicion, his own brother. So again we are here a loose side. <br /> <br /> And lastly, the US military heroic hypocrisy theme, where the marine is publicly regarded as a hero because of the filth of war, he has gone through; to be called its own standards, the third theme falls flat just the same. Because the movie ends right when he can only talk to his wife for the first time about what he has gone through. Where the real story would actually begin, namely its process of recovery, what it would look like and how it would eventually see the family, it has a huge debt to admit. All the interesting pieces are surrendered and ignored. <br /> <br /> So while this story is wise, this movie is serious, and I mean seriously, disappointment, I still give it the impressive throw. Although no movie should use Maguire for a voice, it belongs to Spiderman. Especially a big Gyllenhaal seems to meet all the expectations he has raised as a young and aspiring actor. So much so that I really wanted to see him entrusted him with a very deep and demanding lead role of a good profile. <br /> <br /> So while the cast really seems to be doing what they can, I consider this movie totally forgotten. Indeed, a shallow and ultimately pretentious, totally unsatisfactory tear cruiser. Message for the authors: We already know the wounds, see the host of Vietnam movies.
