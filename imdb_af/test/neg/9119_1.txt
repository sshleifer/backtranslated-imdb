It wasn't for the fact that it came as a 2-DVD set attached to the original American Graffiti; It was not for the fact that I had been here in Iraq for a few months and at this stage everything would look good, after the first ten minutes I would have flung this movie into the garbage. This movie was terribly bad at so many levels I just don't know where to start. Poorly acted, shot, directed, written, recorded, edited. My 9-year-old daughter's first filming in film production is better than that - and she slept the dog. (Think about it, I give that movie to 9 stars. But I'm biased.) If you even have the slightest appreciation for quality movie recording then avoid it at all costs. No character in this movie has a single redeeming quality for the Icelandic girl who doesn't even have a single line in English. I will no longer waste my time, describing what a bad movie is.
