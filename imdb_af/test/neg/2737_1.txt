This movie is just a good movie if you need something to sit and laugh for its stupidity. As a geologist, this movie gets most of the important facts wrong and uses the actors who are too young to even be considered in the top of their fields. Interestingly, it shows that lava spits in massive caves beneath the Earth's surface. It is also strange how seismically active areas are shown to have a large-scale destruction of a 6.5 magnitude earthquake. They seem to forget the building standards in these areas, the higher a larger earthquake must be to do so much damage. Also, it's funny how much they make the Washington state coastline and also Oregon to look as if they are beautiful beaches of Southern California. The Jelly donut analogy is very entertaining, even if the way it is used is wrong. The director does a good job of adding more comic relief to the 2 "sought-after" PhDs.
