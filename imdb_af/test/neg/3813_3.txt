Like "The Blair Witch Project" before, "Hatchet" got its own fair share of publicity from the bottom up (as an avid reader of Fangoria Magazine, full page ads are hard to miss); Even after its middle theater career, the film is only surrounded by the hype, and will probably become a cultural item at some point. With a MySpace URL and a powerful (as mystery subjective) promise to retain the so-called "old school American horror", Hatchet will draw many curiosity seekers with his DVD release (where the claim on the disk itself has been blown up). Perhaps it was the big print of Is It Cool News on the ads that made me film with some trepidation (it looks like Harry Knowles and his minions will approve any VIP pass and free food movie). but "Hatchet" makes me wonder what author-director Adam Green's idea of ​​"old school American horror" is really: based on the evidence here, it means the indifferent, late-80s rip-offs of "Friday 13th" and "liberation." The characters are stupid stereotypes (black Chris Tucker type, Survivalist Chick, Topless Bimbos, Requisite Old Couple, Asian Tour Guide) whose interactions are ruined by painful, try-to-hip dialogues and mostly obvious lying by humor bad like "Cabin Fever", but still); For example, the script has too much padding (for example, the "equestrian forest" scene), and "Hatchet" becomes as typical as any postmodern treasure of the past decade, with its only distinctive feature, an expertly calculated hype machine. I give it a little glory to the gore. If you can blow the road between death, the red vino is definitely a miracle, and the only real reason to see it.
