Jesus Franco is pretty much hit or miss on his films and I would say it was a dung, that is, unless you were in total drowsiness. I would say the man has an eye for a good shot, even if it's topless women with machine-gun-tipped guns. It's generally pretty ridiculous and the acting is terrible, but the acting is the least of what it's about. And what is it about? Well, it's about 102 minutes of lesbians, women choosing and kicking in the hot sun for no apparent reason, and about as much sleaze as you can stand and maybe a few. The most striking (?) Is a scene involving a young woman tied to a chair and a seemingly amorous German shepherd, and while on, it is simply implied (grateful), it is probably a scenario I could do without. I'll rank it here with Tender Flesh as one of the Franco movies I'd rather not have in my collection, although the music is jazzy and fun. 4 out of 10, yecch.
