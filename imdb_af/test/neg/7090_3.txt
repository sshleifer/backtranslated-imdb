"On a clear day you can see forever" is nothing more than a New Age update of the "Pygmalion" / "My Fair Lady" story. A professor is trying to change a common girl into a higher society. This time, instead of using language skills, however, the professor is trying it through hypnotism and past life regression. <br /> <br /> You know a musical has problems when reviewers constantly call the sets and costumes before calling the plot and the music. The songs are immediately forgotten. (No, "Come to the Church in time" here, I'm scared.) And the plot is nowhere. To paraphrase Gertrude Stein, there is no "there" here. The characters wander through the story without ever coming from point A to point B. Professor Chabot claims several times that he will come to the root of Daisy's problems, but he never looks like that. <br /> <br /> Everything meaningful conflict is avoided. For example, there comes a time when Chabot's university demands that it stop or resign its research on reincarnation. Now there is conflict! Will he give his career to Daisy? Sorry Nothing comes of this development. A scene or two later, the university changes its mind and tells Chabot to continue his work. So much for conflict. <br /> <br /> The talent was definitely compiled for this movie: Directed by Vincente Minnelli. Written, in part, by Alan Jay Lerner. A cast by Yves Montand, Bob Newhart and Jack Nicholson. And, oh yes, starring Barabara Striesand. She was almost at the top of her game at this point in her career. <br /> <br /> But it falls flat. Lerner's attempt to recall his greatest success, the previously mentioned "My Fair Lady", is so doomed to failure as Daisy's attempt to revive the greatness of her own past. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy movie music, there are far better choices than that.
