I watched it because of the description and cover art and was again deceived. I get sick of all this new stupid straight to DVD horror movies. In a blue moon I'll be OK. It started with a confusing scene and then jumped for 30 years and a couple showed one night during a thunderstorm. It was OK because I like storms and it made a nice mood. Then it became a cool road trip where they ended at an evening. meet the bizarre people. The rest became strange and then became confusing. I watched it to the end, but was even more confused when it ended so much. I have higher hopes for this movie, but it was more like a science fiction than horror and something It had to be made for TV.
