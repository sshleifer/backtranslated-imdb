According to the article at http://blog.ifeng.com/article/2737487.html, one of the movie characters, Carina Lau, was forced to appear in this movie for free. She was the victim of a notorious kidnapping shortly before the film was made, and later photos of her in need were published in a magazine that has since been forced to close and his publisher has been sent to jail. The actress denies that she has been assaulted, but there was a movie that leaked onto the internet, which allegedly showed that she was racing. (The Hong Kong press, who is out of respect for her, mostly refused to report on the incident, but Google will come up with some articles about it.)
