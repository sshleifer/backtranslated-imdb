Five fingers are so bad that I almost know where to start. So let me first admit that I only saw the first half hour. When the first finger was cut down, I thought I needed a more useful activity. I called my friend the meaning of "five fingers" and she immediately followed my example. <br /> <br /> Couldn't the producer, director and / or writer consult a chess amateur? Like me? They had to use a digital chess clock and not an analogue. This great goof makes the spiritual pressure on Martijn a laugh. How, when and why did Martijn make a Moroccan girlfriend? Such a case is very rare in the Netherlands. <br /> <br /> Of course, calling me a retard is an insult to all those who are much lower than average IQ. Furthermore, as far as I know, chess doesn't slow down. I do. <br /> <br /> Of course, the biggest problem is writing. Just compare the little intelligent movie Hard Candy. To keep the spectator in a grip, the information should be revealed a little bit. A good turn sometimes and occasionally. I understood from other reviews that there is a big one at the end of the movie. Any smart person can guess what it is. This, of course, only raises questions - why was the travel guide murdered? Oh me, why should I even care? The whole movie focuses on just one thing: the chopped fingers. The makers did not even learn Hitchcock's lesson: it is exciting to explode a bomb. It is more exciting to show that the bomb is typing. But no, we don't see the paper cutter until the impossible countdown is over. I will no longer waste words on this shit. Go see Hard Candy.
