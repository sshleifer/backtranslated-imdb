It may not be the worst movie ever made, but it is absolutely boring. Wonder why it's mostly shot in the dark, and mostly with Vincent Gallo away from the camera, or look down? Because he doesn't want to show his face because he's actually in this movie. I like his early stuff, but the pretense of the "Brown Bunny" and then thrown into this drift, hit him in my book. A Val Kilmer? I really want to send him a sympathetic card. The "doors" to this ??? Actually, the casting was the only reason I watched this movie, and Val didn't even appear until the movie was over halfway. Simply a sad movie.
