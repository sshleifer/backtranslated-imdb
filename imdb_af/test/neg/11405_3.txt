You can generally ask two questions about 80's low-budget horror movies. and this "Demon Wind" in particular. 1. Is this a good movie? No. 2. Is this a fun movie ?? You bet! Demon Wind is a horribly dirty and deceptive story filled with cheesy makeup effects and nasty violence. The story is almost non-existent and involves a group of young people who reveal the terrible secrets of one of the group's ancestors. Apparently his grandparents lived in a devil-worshiping ward, and the evil (in the form of demons and fog) still lives there. But I have to hand it over to this movie. From the beginning, it breathes morbidity! The lethal undertones, the playful gore and the (relatively) decent play that all work together make this movie high above the mainstream, uninspiring 80s slides. It shows some creativity and intestines (literally) where other productions fall easier in routine and oblivion from this decade. These creators are clearly inspired by the success of the 'Evil Dead', and perhaps even Lamberto Bava's `Demons', but what is it! It's fun and made with lots of enthusiasm. Although this film has a fairly high "f ***" standard at times. Especially near the end, when flashbacks and laser shades are blended. And what is the story of the two wannabe wizards? Nonetheless, "Demon Wind" gets my recommendation if you're not too high on the crazy horror!
