I didn't have very high expectations for this one. Before I see it, the story shouted to me "stereotypically". <br /> <br /> I mean ... come on! It's so stupid the plot line about the innocent android that realizes that the people who created it are immoral, deciding to change everything. <br /> <br /> I had to see it three times. The first two times I fell asleep because I was so incredibly bored about it. It is very rare for films to carry me so much, I fall asleep. The third time I forced myself to see it, just to warn people about it. <br /> <br /> I have the clear impression that the people who were responsible for this mess tried to do all the cool / neat things of other scifi / action movies, and put them together for a kick-ass movie! They took the Android / robot, lots of action, thin story, stereotype characters, and a great battle in the end and threw it together. Unfortunately, the movie sucks. The play is so wooden you can build a house from it, the storyline / plot is absolutely laughable, the camera work and editing is awful, the direction is not there, and to download it all, everything is so clich√© and ridiculous that it just makes me out of hell. <br /> <br /> I was left with the feeling that I could have spent the time doing this one that makes something more creative, such as pruning my fingernails or seeing the grass grow.
