This show is pretty good and fun to watch, it's a great Disney channel and sometimes entertaining. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the first season, but I hated the second and third seasons. This show has completely changed. In the first season it was more about science and animals, everything that is over in the season and third season. It's more about her life and dating. Since then, the gay child (Ben) came together, this show sucked. The authors took a perfectly good children's performance and turned it into a crappy teenage comedy. Disney made the turn the worst. I can't see the latest episodes anymore, they are all rubbish.
