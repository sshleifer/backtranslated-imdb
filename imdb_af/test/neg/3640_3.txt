This show makes me (and many others) hate their lives. Let's see it, Zoey is perfect; she is beautiful, gets good grades, everyone goes to her for advice, she is popular, she goes to a wonderful school with wonderful rooms. Reasons why I gave this view a 3: 1. The acting is terrible. Sometimes I just want to hurt the people who put these undoubtedly actresses (especially Victoria justice) on television. 2. The characters are incredible and mismatched. You have your typical popular girl. A fiery, level, stupid, stereotypical, girl portrayed by a terrible actress. Then you have a typical Jock guy who is somewhat normal and actually nice. Then the stereotypical smart girl who is a freak and obviously does not fit in with the perfect popular friends of her. Then a rich, beautiful, beautiful boy who will be happy all day. Then the actress wants to be played by another stinky actress. And lastly a normal nerd person. 3. The plot is boring and lame. 4. I hate how spoiled these characters are. Can't just be normal! 5. Everything ends perfectly for them, and we are all reminded of how much our lives stink.
