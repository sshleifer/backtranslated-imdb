This is one of those movies where I was furious for the movie's fastest ending. I wanted to see the police kill Keaton and Garcia just to get it over. Actually, this is the case. Two police have to die and a third have to face terrible burns on Garcia's son to get a bone marrow transplant from convicted killer Keaton. Is it worth it? No!
