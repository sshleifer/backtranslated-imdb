I have to give it preface by saying that I love to see bad movies that are entertaining. This movie delivers 100%. This is the worst movie I've ever seen. It's full of brave stock image of random things in a city (people walking, traffic, the skyline, etc.) who don't tie in anything. Then there are the exaggerated sex sexes. 'It involves a lot of petting and regular rubbing of socks on each other's bodies. It is by no means erotic and is the closest thing to the horror you will get in this movie. This is especially true for the landfill where two of the so-called "scarce legal" girls who cannot be over 40 are spraying with blood, but there is also a crew member who injects blood into the outside while one of the girls keep smiling at him. No one had to memorize any lines for this movie, if they didn't have clear reading cards, they had a magazine in front of them, struggling through an awkward dialogue. Then there is Mr. Creepo. He throws Ed Wood's name around, as he can somehow compare, but he is far from anything of that quality. He walks around a graveyard that hides random things that went wrong in the movie, which really helps the complete lack of flow that the movie is already doing. We couldn't stop laughing at this movie (except during the sex scenes where we were provoked and sometimes frightened) <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 1/10 to go so far above my expectations for a horrible movie.
