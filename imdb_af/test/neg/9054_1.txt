One IMDb reviewer calls Alat an entertaining movie for the "cannibal expert." Are there such people? I did not know. But if you're one of them, hey, hold a ball. The rest of you might find it a bit difficult to swallow (pun) this time, even if I consider you a horror filmmaker. I've been an avid horror fan for fifteen years. Although I never came to the cannibal subgenre a few weeks ago, and I think I owe my brief interest in this groan-inducing movie, strangely, after China's total consideration of copyright laws. You see, I bought a DVD collection of all Wesley Snipes's movies for 20 yuan (about $ 2.75), which apparently ate the last Kanannibal World, Mountain of the Cannibal God, Cannibal Holocaust. Nicholas Cage, and something called Voodoo Lagoon, along with Blade 1-3, in Chinese. Nice. To be a second successor, I immediately got a sink feeling when the movie with a cannibal in street clothes was opened, wandering around the big American cities, and shooting unsuspecting Americans with poisonous tarts and then scared off at full speed . . Having walked out of ways to hold movie cannibals, they seem to have made their way to the continent. Later, you may be shocked to learn that this guy is on an exercise exercise. Join your daughters! <br /> <br /> Earlier, the movie in the old missing sister routine, like a young blonde woman, Sheila, began her own investigation into the disappearance of her sister, who in no way looks like her, but she is willing to spend most of the movie naked, so I think it doesn't matter. It seems as if we shot one of his victims, the unfortunate cannibal that we met early in the movie, was not accustomed to the great city life, ran into the road and got killed by a moving bus. <br /> <br /> The brilliant police force finds a mysterious piece of film on him, which shows Sheila's sister in a bizarre ritual behavior, but unlike the movie, the man is a complete mystery. As the spicy police chief complains, "we know nothing about him except he is dead!" Poor guy, he must get a headache from all these things. I recommend a lunch. Luckily, Sheila is the kind of girl who can throw tens of thousands of dollars because it's nothing in the search for her sister. Ideal for learning a soft backwood caricature, as the police clearly don't help. <br /> <br /> Of course, nothing new is added to this minimal subgenre. On the contrary, cannibalism looks almost like a backdrop to a completely different kind of bad movie, about the salvation of a missing person from the dangerous elements. It is not difficult to reduce the plot of the clothing line. All you have to do is follow a cartoon-like jungle cult of people who follow a guy who calls him Jonah, who believes he uses pain as a way to reunite man with nature, called "purification. " Personally, I just prefer to look occasionally. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite parts of the movie is when Sheila is caught by one of the cult members - an overweight man who seems to have had a three-day weekend from the office to play in this movie. appears. While he is releasing his reliable medical kit to give her an injection, he warns her: "If you don't believe in Jonah and purity (through pain), God will help you." He then gave her a shot and when she won the little pinch, he kindly apologized to her. I feel a true believer in this guy! <br /> <br /> As far as the gore is concerned, there are many nasty sound effects about random shots of slaughtered animals and more than enough disgusting footage of women is cut and eaten. alive, so I just think the movie lives up to its name. The acting is surprisingly bad, as can be expected, and interestingly enough, the editing is also spectacular, but quite remarkable. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I think you should be able to relate to people who believe in totally crazy cults to talk to someone in the movie. There are many foreign religious ceremonies taking place, making it harder to understand why Sheila's sister decided to return to normal society. I'm all for individualism and do your own thing, but come up. <br /> <br /> After a while, the movie goes even further into your basic, run-of-the-mill movie escape, just before we witness the most wildly inappropriate interpretation of Glory, Glory Hallelujah in film history. WOW. <br /> <br /> Note: In this movie, a woman is raped with a cut snake. If you need more reason to never see it, seek professional help. Avoid this mess at all costs.
