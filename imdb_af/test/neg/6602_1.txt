Usually when a television biopsy is released on a celebrity, it's at its least champion (ie Cybill Shepherd as Martha Stewart, Lauren BaCall as Doris Duke), it's the most horrible, cheapest and BORING television movie ever made . If VH-1 is going to make a television movie, they can spend a little more money on it. Flex Alexander - both talented with the Michael voice - is not a good dancer, doesn't look like Michael once and doesn't even have his ways. VH-1 would have done better by hiring a real simulator. As soon as Michael sees that he is going to get plastic surgery, he doesn't really look the same. Why should we be amazed at Michael's shrinkage when it's exactly the same size as in the beginning of the movie? The woman who plays Elizabeth Taylor can't act and doesn't look like her, and I don't even like the woman like Janet Jackson. Terrible scripts and a serious problem of miscasting should retain VH-1 to produce more movies. Flex Alexander would rather have made a better JERMAINE JACKSON than Michael. Costumes? Trashy ripoffs. Neverland? Split footage of news documents. Don't save this one .... it's not even worth it. The one great piece of casting - the actor depicting Joseph Jackson and MAYBE the actress like Lisa Marie Presley, although she had to be more tomboy than girl.
