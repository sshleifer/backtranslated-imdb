Oh, God! Book II is more of a bad remake of the original as a successor to it. It's not that funny, his plot plays too much <br /> <br /> like a rejected situation comedy pilot, and using the slogan "Think God" is another variation on the idea that so much worked better in the original. John Denver didn't return for this movie and it made a big difference. George Burns, as <br /> <br /> wonderful as he played God, doesn't have the same chemistry with the girl he did with John Denver. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie a score of 3 out of 10, but only for <br /> George Burns; the rest of the roll is nothing special. <br /> <br /> If you loved the first one, don't bother seeing this one.
