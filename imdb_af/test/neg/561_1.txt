The screenplay is the worst part of this movie, as it misses from one point of view to the next, all the important bits that made a number of different stories possible. (This film is confusing because the audience does not know what the story is.) I had no problem with the low production values ​​and the acting wasn't good, but it was counting, so it was good. I don't mind if some scenes seem to have been done at once. But with such a non-sensual script is completely unnecessary. Did any executive manager actually read it before cash was eliminated? Avoid it at all costs. <br /> <br /> The prologue in particular was so poorly written, it needed a voice over to fill in all the details left out. The prologue was rushed, it wasn't clear what had happened, that is. The Russian Revolution is reduced to "Some riots take place in Petersburg", with the next scene as soldiers arresting them. I know the basic history of the Revolution, so I can fill in the details, "the turbulent Communists". The prologue is best ignored. <br /> <br /> It can be a thoughtful study of a person who is confused about who she is. This puts this point of departure in the asylum. It may be difficult for her to identify herself for the rest of the film. No. Gone. The film assumes she is who she says she is (although there is no empirical evidence yet.) It creates a melodramatic romance, a love that is so strong, it will believe something she says. All right, a sweet romance. No, because it doesn't make sense. Love's interest resembles a mad (and accidental, sloppy) mad, outburst in wild gestures. It doesn't work either, because the film decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end. They never married and she returned to America. The love story is falling apart. Even though there were many love scenes, I was never convinced that they were in love. I find rom romance more convincing, despite the fact that there are only one or two scenes that determine that they even spent time with each other. <br /> <br /> It could have been a kind of thing where the movie supposed she was who she says she is, and she's struggling to prove her identity. No, the court case is summarized rather than treated. The bizarre voice comes back to fill in the details of a better movie. <br /> <br /> The funniest thing to consider is what really happened. Anna Anderson was a wage-earner who went to America and married another loony and did the same things together. She had clashes of ugly behavior throughout her life. Not one of them in the movie. There is a very annoying character in the asylum that comes up nowhere and announces herself as a 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Next /' Twelve Monkeys' type informant. Fortunately, she disappears because he has brought nothing to the story.
