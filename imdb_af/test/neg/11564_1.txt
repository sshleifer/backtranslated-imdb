I'm not familiar with the other works of the producer, but this movie is a piece of crap. <br /> <br /> I've never seen the MST3K version, but I can tell you, Mike and the Bots probably haven't saved it. <br /> <br /> I love a Grade Z movie as much as the next bad movie fan, but it was almost immovable. <br /> <br /> There was no credit for the voice of The Dark One ". Sometimes sounds like Patrick Stewart. <br /> <br /> A group of high school students holding a junk super-8 camera in the trash could have made a better movie than that.
