"Riders of Destiny" was the first of several western countries that Wayne made for the Lone Star arm of Monogram Pictures between 1933 and 1935.

Wayne seems uncomfortable and uncomfortable to perform the musical Thank you very much for the Christmas experiment that soon ended. <br /> <br /> As far as the movie itself is concerned, it contains a standard "B" western plot of the battle over water rights between the villain (Forrest Taylor) and the local ranchers. Duke, of course, plays the hero. He hasn't yet developed his screen character and still looked like a poverty-driving cowboy. <br /> <br /> Also in the movie was George (pre-Gabby) Hayes as the heroine's father, Cecilia Parker as the heroine and Yakima Canutt as one of the boys she "falls from racing horses under the cart "while doubling Wayne. Both Canutt and Hayes will appear with Wayne in most other entries in the series. In particular, Canutt would have a major impact on Wayne's future development, including moving, fighting, and looking comfortable on a horse. <br /> <br /> If "B" Westerns does this one "It's not bad, but I have to give it because of" singing ".
