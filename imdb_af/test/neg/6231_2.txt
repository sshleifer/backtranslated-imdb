I love most Jet Li movies (with the exception of Romeo Must Die) and I bought this movie in a VERY cheap three pack with The Master and Twin Warriors. While Twin Warriors was very impressive, and I was thoroughly thinking about it, and the master was a little "Karate Kid" but also nice, I thought this movie was TERRIBLE. I'm not just saying this because I'm used to better movies. I say it's almost there with "Kazaam". The battle scenes were terrible (blurry cameras and no real battles) and the plot was your typical "stupid kung-fu plot". If you're going to get a plot, it's stupid (see "man becomes a woman to become almighty, then he falls in love with Jet Li"). You have the best to fight. If you're looking for an original HK Jet Li movie, I suggest you hire "Shaolin Temple 2" (aka Kids from Shaolin).
