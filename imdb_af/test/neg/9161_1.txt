I'm surprised to read all the positive comments on this movie. Even my 4 and 6 year olds were bored. The chipmunks are cute ... but the storyline is excessively obvious. Not recommended for infants with the least sophisticated taste. <br /> <br /> We heard some sounds from the audience while we were attending; but I wondered why. <br /> <br /> I don't admit I'm ever a "chipmunks" fan, but I expected to be entertained. It's not even an escapist movie as far as I can tell. Simply a heavy-handed view of 'success to young booty'. We've seen more than enough with Britney Spears, though, haven't we? <br /> <br /> Don't worry.
