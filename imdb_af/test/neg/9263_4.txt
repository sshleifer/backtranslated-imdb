This movie is a great drill. It has a lot of predictable plots and endless sentiments from the beginning. It starts out well with an attractive number, but looks half-lost. <br /> <br /> Surya & Jyothika's screen chemistry really works well and plays a good role by Bhoomika. Why does Vadivelu include it? He disappears completely after a good half hour! Santhanam proves his white again through the timing of comedy. <br /> <br /> AR's songs are sure to last one day. But he could have done better. What ever has the disadvantages is still worth checking out once you feel at home or looking for a good time.
