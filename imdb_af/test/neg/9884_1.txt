This movie was boring. Much like Underworld, less interesting. It's not much of a werewolf movie and not a horror movie. The main couple were boring. I didn't really care for Vivian and Aiden. And there was so little character development that I didn't care about any character in the movie. The plot was paper thin. The transformations were basically zero. I looked like the wolves themselves, just like a wolf documentary, I would have liked it. I would not recommend this movie. I didn't find it fun or interesting. It just drag and everyone in it is a boring drag. This movie can win an award for not making a werewolf film.
