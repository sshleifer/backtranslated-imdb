The main word that comes to mind this movie is "dodgy". It is a low quality cinema biography of one of the most iconic artists of all time. The Gloved One earned better. <br /> <br /> Before I get my thoughts on these biopic insects, I have to say that there are two things I found effective. First, the use of real fans and interviews at certain points in the film, especially in the screens depicting the first set of child molestation allegations. I feel it has contributed a certain authenticity which is seriously lacking throughout the rest of the film. Secondly, was the sequence of Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley's court case. I would not comment on whether I believe marriage was a pain, but through many accounts it was a relationship where the two parties had care and love. It really came into this movie; Flex Anderson and Krista Rae had decent chemistry to pull it off. These successful points are enough to keep the Man in the Mirror away from 1 star status. <br /> <br /> It said ... there was very little here that worked. Very few of the actors looked like the people they were supposed to portray, especially those playing Elizabeth Taylor, Janet Jackson and Diana Ross. The absence of Jackson's music was also a huge loss. How can you effectively tell a story about him without his music? I understand that they could not get the rights to it as it is a low budget, unauthorized production; However, it seems that if you can't have the man's music in a movie about him, you can also pick it up and go home because you miss a very important part of his life story. /> <br /> This movie's characterization of Jackson also bothered me a bit. I would not argue that he was uneasy and maybe a few fries short of a value meal, but here he was portrayed as something close to mentally handicapped. I don't think Jackson, known as a smart businessman, would have been so na√Øve about how the adult world works as he did in this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, the way this movie was written was nothing but shame. Many lines or exchange of dialogue were either extremely knee-like, like Michael and Janet's "Tinkerbell" swap, or nonsense, like Michael's "Blanket of Love" comment. Also, the authors do not have exactly a talent for subtlety. There was a lot of telegraphing of emerging events ("What might go wrong?" Types of lines) and extremely open hammering of themes and motifs in the movie (if I heard the word "believe" again.). That is what eventually the movie has cut as something that can be considered extremely bad. <br /> <br /> Perhaps we might be able to remove Jackson's death a few years, or even a decade or three. his story to life in a more deserving movie. By then, we can have a better perspective on his life, and someone will be able to give a worthy inquiry about who Michael Jackson really was and what he meant for the entertainment world. This very dodgy biopic wasn't that movie.
