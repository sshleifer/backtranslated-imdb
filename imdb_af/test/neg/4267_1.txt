I find the criticism of many IMDb users a bit harsh and in many cases find that they criticize the film from a very professional point of view and not that of the guy on the street who wants to sit and watch just to get away. <br /> <br /> In this case, however, I must say it was BAD. I'm a sci-fi junkie and there was nothing in this movie that caught me for one second. <br /> <br /> There was no proper storyline. I can be an idiot, but I still don't know where the government was so worried about these pieces. <br /> <br /> The key character of the main character to combine these 3 pieces is frightening. Half the time the two pieces were already in place and he had to add the third. A 3 year old child could put them together. <br /> <br /> This movie was BAD. <br /> <br /> Dominic
