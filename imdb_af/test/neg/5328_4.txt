I know I loved this movie when I was 12-14 years old. Now that I'm 24, I watched it again, and I wish I didn't. Because all the things I laughed at were younger, it's no longer funny. so it's an hour and a half without fun. For me the jokes were lame, not funny or just too childish. So the same thing I loved about the movie when I was a kid is now the things I don't like about it. Except that it is not funny, it is not credible at all. The evil character is very poorly done, but I think this is the kind of movie it is. And the last 20 minutes of the movie is pretty lame with bad fights and so on ... But if you're young, you'll probably love it. I rate this movie 4/10
