Wow, what an overestimated movie it seems to be! It was supposed to be "a very exciting story of a mad killer who had a women's flag and terror in her home." Well, I doubt it has played audiences in the early 50's and I know it will fall asleep today. <br /> <br /> "Send shivers into the spine," the New York Times explains. No, the only chills I get are that anyone is left on the planet, who believes something is pushing the NY Times for something. <br /> <br /> Well, it's about a stray man who held hostage for a short time. in her house, but the man. "Howard Wilton" (Robert Ryan) was actually harmless and friendly. In fact, it was one of the most beautiful roles Ryan ever played! Yes, "Wilton" was nuts, but he never harmed the woman and just wanted to trust a friend. <br /> <br /> Even after a while, the movie has become boring, with very little going on, except for a lot of fox. <br /> <br /> Beware, my reader ..... it sucks.
