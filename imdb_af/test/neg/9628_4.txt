I didn't really hate Mirrormask. I just wanted more of a movie than nice statues. The film starts with a young girl named Helana working in a circus. But while other children (presumably) want to run away from the circus, they just want to run away from the circus. During a heated argument with her mother, Helana wants his death to die. Bad move. The mother gets sick with ... something (presumably cancer) and needs surgery. On the night before the operation of his dreams, she travels to a wonderful world composed of her dreams and nightmares where she finds herself. Personally, the movie got me as soon as she started dreaming. The early scenes show the strange and wonderful world of the circus and then contrast it with the darkness of the hospital and the filth of a block of flats. But as soon as she dreams, the whole movie moves to CGI country where almost everything is a computer image. The problem is that this dream world doesn't have one of the riddles and wonders it should have. while films like the wizard of Oz were nice to explore Mirrormask, kicking images in our faces and then hiding them to give us another image. There is little rhythm or reason for the design in this movie and although some things are very nice (the librarian is a masterpiece), they disappear as soon as they are quickly forgotten. Helana and her sidekick Valentine are worst and most unbearable in the worst. Overall Mirrormask is like a nice game that you bite and find out is actually like. Stick to real world kids.
