As the film star for a local gay magazine, I automatically send a drink if it has a gay in it. Chicken Tikka Masala is in the background while writing it. I gave it 53 minutes before my undivided attention before I shouted myself involuntarily - like a Tourrette's sufferer - "This is the Sh ** movie I've ever seen." We just come to the emotional climax where the boy sends someone to his wedding. Father seems to take it very well. An attempt at honor killed at this point would at least have endured the film a little. And it made it more beautiful. <br /> <br /> For example, I didn't have the special features of Beautiful Thing, but at least I could see why other people did. It was made with some professionalism and I think it has at least some good lines. The lack of white in this film is quite amazing - even the most mediocre sitcom will tend to have recognizable jokes. The closest to this movie was funny (at least in his first 53 minutes). The subtitled commentary was given to the bold, unattractive female lead. Look at her with her legs wide open. She is like the Mersey tunnel. Completely relentless and I didn't grin a smile, but I could imagine someone with a low IQ (who might work in a slideshow) enjoying it. <br /> <br /> I think it's a bit of Lottery-funded cruelty. If not, I can at least consolidate with the fact that the backs lose a significant amount of money as even a British British low-budget film will still put someone back. Seriously, if I met the most beautiful blue in the world, and I returned to his place to make lovely love, I found a copy of this in his DVD collection ("Man, I love this movie") . I'll probably kick him in the nuts and leave it instantly. And that from someone who is about six months away without any of the aforementioned lovely love. <br /> <br /> Oh, Lord, I hate this movie.
