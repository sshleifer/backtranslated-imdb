By strange coincidence I started looking at this move directly to Brice de Nice and the good thing was that not many movies could be the worst of Brice de Nice, so I really looked for something better that would prevent me from this horrible flop . However, Oss-117 left me disappointed. I don't know, maybe it's just a translation problem, but since "Diner de Cons" I haven't seen any French comedy I would call. very good. Even if I look at the reviews on IMDb, people from France give the OSS-117 high notes ... <br /> <br /> For me this movie didn't really work - in some parts is as funny as real Bond movies, in other jokes was a little too predictable or too corny.
