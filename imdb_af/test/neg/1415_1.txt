I'm pretty surprised to see that this movie even earned low hot reviews, I found this movie really awful. The plot flounders to try to decide whether it's a comedy or a thriller, then realize it can't reach it. So he throws in the towel and continues with his absurd plot highlighted with an unintentional, hilarious scene with Laura Linney, an injection, and spilled coffee that makes the audience uncomfortable in their seats, watching each other, as it really is? Actually, it's uncomfortable and very disappointing for Robin Williams fans, and it makes you think someone has fired Laura Linney to add this piece of garbage to her. I wanted to leave after 10 minutes and wish I had, even though I saw it for free. I wanted someone to pay me for my wasted time. The computer glitch / twist in this movie was embarrassingly silly and at the end you didn't care who won the election. I tuned straight to DVD.
