Eleven years ago, Stanley Ipkiss released his true inner self and found Edge City's hero by finding and wearing the Norse god of evil, Loki's mask. The Mask has helped bring Jim Carrey to the forefront of comedy and has a very popular status for his originality and just pure fun. Everyone knew how to spell party. P A R T Y. Why? Cuz I have to! Now, eleven years later, it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new movie, "Son of the Mask." Someone asked director Lawrence Guterman, why are you doing it? And he responds "Cuz I must!" Unfortunately, the answer does not cover it, because after I saw Son of the Mask, I still thought the theater: "Lord, why?" Guterman and the rest of the people involved in the blasphemous film must realize that the answer given to why you make this movie should not be as simple as answering the debate about or not to party. <br /> <br /> The Mask Son begins with Otis the dog that finds the notorious mask and brings it back to his owner Tim Avery, a clear tribute to the legendary Loony Toons creator Tex Avery. Tim, played by Jamie Kennedy, is a struggling animator working as a turtle guide for the animation company he is striving for a one-day draw. On the night of the Halloween party, Tim puts on the mask and turns it into the ominous, insane character we all expect. After the festival Tim went home, still masked and invented a child with his wife. Nine months later, chaos follows as the baby born from the mask has remarkable cartoon powers. Whether the dog, jealous of the baby's attention, puts on the mask and shares in Tom and Jerry-type chaos to pull the baby out. Meanwhile, Loki, played by Alan Cumming, is looking for his mask at the command of his father, Odin. <br /> <br /> First, sickly admit that I respect the fact that this film honors so much tribute to the classic cartoons like Tom and Jerry and Loony Toons, with his Wile E. Coyote type of contraction and the infamous dance frog type plot . However, this reverence cannot save the film and makes it less respectful and more wasteful. <br /> <br /> The assumption of the movie is becoming increasingly stupid. Foolish is not always a bad thing, but in this movie the folly becomes just as annoying. The characters aren't nice to look at, and what's worse, they're not funny. The dull character of the characters can also be attributed to the fact that so much CGI was used. One of the biggest things about the original is that, while of course computer animation was used, so much relied on Jim Carrey and his exuberant style of being just. Jim Carrey, we were convinced, was a real cartoon. Jamie Kennedy does not have such a capability, a fact that is clear when you look at how he wears the mask and barely moves his facial features. The baby and dog were mostly completely animated, which became increasingly distracting in the film. The side story of Loki looking for the mask has become more and more staggering. <br /> <br /> The Mask's son is a sad sad situation. What I have suggested is that you buy or buy the original Mask and thank the Norwegian gods, or anyone, for bringing it to us. And will consider seeing the successor of my sacrifice while continuing to ask the infamous question "WHY?" The son of the mask gets one star, although the star has to be split between the classic creators of Loony Toons and Jim Carrey, who will always be the mask in my book.
