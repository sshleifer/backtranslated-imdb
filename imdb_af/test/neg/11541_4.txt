I appeared as an extra and was on the spot as a journalist covering "The Dain Curse". My involvement was shot in the segments of this movie in Jim Thorpe, Dad. (Jim Thorpe was also one of the places of the 1969 film "The Molly Maguires"). I reported the "action" in the Emmaus Free Press newspaper, where I was 1978-80. I remind myself of the excellent attention to detail of the costumes, cars, etc. The modern asphalt streets of Jim Thorpe were covered with gravel to imitate a 1920s rural village in the south. Then I interviewed the producer and briefly talked to the director during a set change period; I didn't have an interview with James Coburn, which was always a great disappointment to me. Aside, I briefly appear in one of the street scenes wearing a snap-edge hat and a tweed jacket. The producer asked me to "jump in" and it was a real excitement. I still have a collection of black and white stable that I took from the production work for the newspaper. One day they could be of interest to film / television historians. - Lou Varricchio
