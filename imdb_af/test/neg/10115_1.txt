At what point does a movie become so bad that it's good? Disappearing in this horror, Darkhunters appears as a shining example of c ** p cinematography, and it probably deserves some sort of award. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around the age-old battle of Heaven and Hell for the unclaimed souls of recent death. In the case of Darkhunters, the representatives of good and evil manifest themselves as a flock of cats, a Grim Reaper figure with a face of flickering flames similar to a coal-effect electric fire, a Philip Marlowe-a -like with a serious bad manicure and a female psychologist appearing on the release of Kwik-Save. <br /> <br /> The protagonists compete for the soul of a newly-died teacher who spends most of the movie running a foggy field and bizarre, resident experts trying to evade his persecutors. <br /> <br /> The plot is thinner than a diet maker's sandwich without character development or attempt to build tension. The acting is laughable, comparable to a school game - although it would be an insult to many educational institutions. And the dialogue .......... o, how my sides got hurt! With the unclaimed souls of the dead described as "life's unwanted gherkins" by the flame-glow demon, you wonder if hell really is a McDonalds. <br /> <br /> But it's extremely compelling, you just find yourself watching to see how bad it can be - in just over 80 minutes, it's worth the time for the unintentional giggles. spending.
