Give H.G. Lewis points: He managed to include cattle-like exotic dancers, gallons of his notorious fake blood and Henny Youngman in one movie. "The Gore Gore Girls" was Lewis's horror movie swan song, ending with a car pumped. Oh ... Henny plays a cute nightclub owner whose girls fall victim to Lewis's standard butchery.
