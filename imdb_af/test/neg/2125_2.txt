The best of all common Jaws rip-offs was regretted by one of my all-time favorite directors; Lamberto Bava (here under his John Old Jr. pseudonym). You know how these cheap European imitations are, right? They just want their monstrous animal to be bigger, healthier and more threatening, but it does more than often lead to the opposite effect. Bava's being is a humongous sea devil and it's more than just a shark! We have a prehistoric monster here, with the jaws and appetites of a Great White, but it also has tentacles like an octopus! It is up to some dolphin love oseologists to discover how this monster could survive these thousands of years and why he just started his murder tree. The script of "Monster Shark" makes little or no sense and most of the action takes place on the continent. The shark itself is a ceaselessly laudable creation and it was a wise decision by Lamberto Bava to show it only vaguely and quickly. The appearances are above average and the underwater photography is surprisingly clear and well handled. The twists in the plot are predictable and you will probably have the most fun details about the characters. For example, count all the cans of beer Dr. Hogan drinks throughout the movie!
