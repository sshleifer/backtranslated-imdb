Such pain! Pain in the form it promised in its central idea, but it never fully recognized it and blasted a lot of sand into your face. I won't say this straight-to-video South African / Canadian / British horrorflick is awful, but it's just too vague, predictable and there is very little memorable about it. It's a guarantee you'll forget it, not too long after you watch it. I tried to look it last night, but had to finish it in the morning because I couldn't keep my eyes open. Even then, I couldn't remember where I got up, which made me look back from the beginning. The only thing that hit a chord was Andreas Poulsson's sharp cinematography of the vast, harsh and ominous desert spots. A beautiful glamorous chic creates a striking visual sense, which cannot save the movie from its overall empty feel. All the others are under-prepared and almost out of order. Like the scrawling revelation of the beast. Huh. The computer-generated special effects of the ominous monster are tolerant, and there are some creepy flashes of stripped meat and bones. But there is too little, as there is not the fact that the clich√©d script wants to think about the generic character conflict to build up tension and uncertainty. It would be good if the wilted writing was more than basic, shallow fluff, as it never generated a strong, lasting strain, but made it unimportant. The main characters are superficial and the sign support falls into the deliverable basket. It's your stereotypical bunch. Scott Bairstow and Warrick Grier's performances are colorless and the beautiful Rachel Shelley tries to look pretty tired.
