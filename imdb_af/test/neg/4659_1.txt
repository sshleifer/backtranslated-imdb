This 'schlock-buster' should bear a health warning from the government. If you play it in your DVD machine, you have a great chance of opening a gap in the space-time continuum and disappearing without trace. So bad is this movie. <br /> <br /> The fact that this movie was so successful is evidence of the truly desperate state of the modern Hollywood theater, and the ongoing commissioning of films calling for the "lowest common denominator" - though I'm really afraid to think of the "lowest common denominators" that this movie really appeals to !! <br /> <br /> I think Hollywood was just proving some sort of trials when they made and screened this movie! I can imagine the management meetings at the studio ... "How bad is a movie, can we actually get away with making and making a lot of money? Holy cow, I didn't realize we could go that bad!" ! Woooo hooooo !! "<br /> <br /> The only movies that are worse than I can think (and believe me it is close) are Die Another Day (RIP the Bond franchise as I knew it) and Independence Day! <br /> <br /> Avoid - avoid - avoid !!
