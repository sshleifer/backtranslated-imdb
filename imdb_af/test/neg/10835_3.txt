What a horrible movie. The consequences were poor, especially according to today's standards, but it was forgiven. What was unpardonable was the terrible rehashing of every flood / dam breakdown movie ever made in this piece of garbage. The acting was terrible and I mean WHEN. The point in the story where Michelle Green stopped saving a dog from the approaching torrent was hilarious. They see the water approaching and running for their lives. (Incidentally, they had to get a very old fat woman not to harm Ms Green). They can exceed the water for some time before resorting. What speed! Later, a speed motor is not fast enough to escape the stream. God, she and that dog ran fast! If you want to see a good movie about a dam that breaks, it's not. Porchlight Entertainment shows some good family movies, but this time they missed the point.
