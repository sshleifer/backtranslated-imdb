I can immediately admit that this is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. And it doesn't say a bit because I consider myself an aficionado when it comes to crappy film. But it's still bad. This movie is so terrible that there is no fun in it, it's just bad. <br /> <br /> It's almost impossible to review it. There are no strengths and nothing positive to say. I'll just get over some of the points being sucked. First, the CGI must be one of the worst I have seen. I can't believe this movie was made in 2005, but CGI reminds me of something I could possibly see in Babylon, 5 times back when CGI was new and fresh. It is poor beyond faith. Secondly, the actors all look as if they are in the worst kind of day. And look at their resumes, I see I'm correct. Thirdly, giants can be able to respond to the other technology they invented in this movie: the indecent pistol with infinite ammunition! Seriously, Michael Par√© fires 100-200 times without reloading in any other scene ... As if that wasn't enough, there are also form-changing planes! Initially they are regular F-16 fighters, in the next scene they are something quite, and in the third scene they are again F-16! If you buy stock, don't mix it! <br /> <br /> Honestly, there is much more to say, but I think I'll stop. You understand everyone I say. Honestly I didn't think this kind of movie was made anymore. That's what Ed Wood would do. Totally ignorant of quality, don't mind how anything looks. It's almost amazing in everything, it's terrible. If I could give it 0/10 I would, but 1/10 is the lowest grade. So that's it.
