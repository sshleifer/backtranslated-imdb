I left the theater and I was just 10 years old. That's how bad it sucked. The plot was horrible and the acting was worse. Leslie Nielson must be ashamed of himself and so should the person who made this movie. I was only 10 years old when I saw this catastrophe with a friend and even at that young, innocent age I didn't even laugh at the movie. We (my and my friend) are still laughing about how bad the movie was. We finally went to the 'R' movie where my parents were. Bottom line - this movie was bad. Mr. Magoo - more like Mr. Ma-who? This movie could have been my life if I watched the popular cartoon on television as a child, but fortunately I have never seen it, so I saved the anxiety, but I will never have those precious minutes of my life what I wasted is coming back.
