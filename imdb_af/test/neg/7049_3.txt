Before the days of the home video, Stan Laurel's pre-Hardy comedy 'Kill or Cure' was known - as it was commonly known - just because a few rows in Robert Youngson's compilation movie 'Laurel and Hardy's Laughing 20's. Youngson knew what he did: the best gags in "Kill or Cure" were brought into his composition, while the rest of this only soft funny comedy stayed on Youngson's dressing room floor. <br /> <br /> Laurel pictured a commercial traveler, who received a patent medicine, called Professor IO Dine's Knox-All: that name is the funniest joke in this movie, which doesn't say much. I must point out that this movie dates back to 1923, the bark of the Prohibition. During the ban, many Americans bought patent medicine if it had (ahem!) "Medicinal" properties, so - if Knox-All contains alcohol - Stan's work in this movie is less desperate than what he and Ollie are famous for. sold in 'Big Business' and sold Christmas trees in the summer. It's bad for this movie that it's not as funny as Big Business. <br /> <br /> We see Stan (but don't hear him in this silent movie) who delivers a healthy sales talk to a man who seems to pay attention ... until we learn they are out of a dumb institution, and this man is deaf. A proud woman comes out of the gates: Stan is trying to get her attention quickly by wrapping her fingers on her. Of course she is not deaf, and she quickly hits him with her umbrella. I found this sequence offensive, not because it involves deaf people (the deaf are not the joke of joke) but because it prohibits the widespread misconception under the hearing of people who can communicate with the deaf by just their fingers randomly wrap and execute Charades without first learning the highly complex sign language grammar. <br /> <br /> More amusing, a spinner in this movie has a pet canary named Rudolph (as in Valentino), and there is a gag that includes trick photography enabling a man to hide behind an object that is narrower than its body. I've seen this device in several cartoons and live-action movies, but "Kill or Cure" is the earliest movie to use that I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Stan Laurel, a subordinate actor, does a few physical issues worthy of Chaplin or Keaton, conveying his emotions - and a change in his attitude - while leaving the camera run away with his back to us. Yet Laurel has never really become a leading comedian before joining Oliver Hardy to form the greatest comedian ever. "Death of Cure" barely 3 out of 10.
