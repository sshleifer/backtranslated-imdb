So you have a number of models on an island, and one by one they have chosen Agatha Christie style. We get someone at sea, printed a cliff, poisoned by a solvent, drifted off a cliff, inflated, and so on. Nothing terribly graphic. Before any of them start, one woman inexplicably has a dream of a murderer in a strange human face mask. <br /> <br /> The magazine owner is a sleaze who had a relationship, and someone took pictures of her before she was old. <br /> <br /> Ultimately it's about business, or something. <br /> <br /> There is an 80-year-old photo shoot style, most of the bathing suits are one piece, surprising. A couple is fairly transparent. There is camera click during the montage where the frame of the camera appears as a white square or rectangle in the picture. The photographer is pretty bad in the framework!
