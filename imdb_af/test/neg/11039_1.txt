... So some people might argue that it's not possible to ever be the worst movie ever, and no it is. I saw movies with poorer plots, worse acting and so on. <br /> <br /> So why do I hate this movie about everything? Well, it's basically about a man being kidnapped for years, and when he gets out, he tries to find out who did it and why to take revenge. The problem I have with this movie has nothing to do with gore or horror, but <br /> <br /> *** LARGE SPOILERS STOP READ YOU DON'T KNOW *** <br /> <br /> our main character is basically hurt to have sex with his own daughter, and he wants to cut out his own tongue so that his enemy won't tell her because she didn't know. It's as humiliating as he crawls on his knees like a dog in total submission. And why did he earn it? Having seen a brother and a sister many years ago, he has a soft moment - in the wrong way. He went on and told some people, and as a result she committed suicide. And viola, that's the brother who puts our main character through all this just for that. I wondered: Maybe I hate this movie so much because I think his punishment is too hard. Maybe because I feel this movie doesn't condemn incest, but somehow confuses it with love. Maybe it's because I expected something else. <br /> <br /> *** END OF SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Believe me, nobody deserves what ultimately happens to our main character and I am very serious; you know how some movies just go under your skin and stay there? Well, I got dirty after watching this movie, and I really wish I never saw it. It stayed with me for days, and some may ask: is that not the purpose of a good movie? The ability to influence us in such ways? Yes, it could be, but this movie didn't just make me sick, it made me break.
