My dad insisted that I see this movie with him and I regret wasting my time - I want to have another and a half hours back! The "funny" little film relates to the elderly Don Ameche who lives with his son, Tom Selleck. It seems that Ameche is not just "forgetful" as he is told, but has dementia (it looks much like Alzheimer's). And because Pa is so "out after lunch", he gets so much trouble again - almost like the worship of BABY'S DAY OUT. The problem, however, is that you know BABY'S DAY OUT is fantasy and the baby will be fine. Plus, you don't laugh at the baby for a malformation or illness. But in this case you are encouraged to laugh at a man who slowly loses his mind - and where is the humor in it? If this movie was more successful, then the producers would have made movies that made fun or people with cerebral palsy or a carnivorous virus?!?! There are many people who had to feel ashamed of making this movie.
