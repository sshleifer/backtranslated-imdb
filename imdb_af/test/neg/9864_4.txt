As long as you keep in mind that the production of this movie was a copyright strike and not intended as a serious release, it's actually surprising how utterly horrible it is. I even said the theme music. <br /> <br /> And if ever a movie called for a treatment by Joel (or Mike) and the MST3K Bots, it's so! Look at this with a lot of clever asshole crackers, and you're in a good time. If you get a copy, you need to buy a bootleg or download it as a shareware, but if you're here on the IMDb then you're probably skilled enough to do it. Strength. <br /> <br /> And look for my favorite part .... where Dr. Doom notifies the FF that they have 12 hours to fulfill his wishes .... and he actually numbered "12" with his finger doing it .... it's like "Evil Sesame Street" .. .. Hoo Boy. <br /> <br /> ... and of course Mrs. Storm, who states: "Just look at you ... the Fanstastic Four" is just as heartwarming ... you'll laugh, you'll cry ..... <br /> <br /> So if you like Schlocky Sci-Fi likes, it's great for you. !
