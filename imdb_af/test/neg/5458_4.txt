I'm shocked that all the "hated" ratings are six and six, still above average. To me, it seems that "the emperor has no clothes." I understand that this movie was produced on a very low budget in the early 70's. Regardless, it has become a struggle to look and see. The DVD I saw had subtitles, but about 75% of the speech is not subtitled. Some of it is difficult to understand. The Jamaican patois was cool to hear, but you didn't struggle to vote for a while. Some of the shots were nice, and realism was there, even though some of the performances were not good. (Jimmy Cliff did a good job). The plot is not bad, but pretty predictable. In the 1: 43 movie, highlights are Jimmy Cliff (Ivan) singing for a scene, and a few shooting ranges and a battle. Probably 15 minutes or so. The rest is pretty boring. BTW, near the start of the movie, there are some strange cuts with the Ivan character that looks like a editing bug, which makes me laugh for a bit. One reviewer said this film was cut so many times that there were a few copies of the original 1972 theater collection out there. The end was interesting to show how the media of young age influence people. It can also be a general comment on the influence of white man / colonialism in Jamaica. Other main themes are poverty, corruption, church, ambition ... Finally, the soundtrack is definitely worth it, the movie much less.
