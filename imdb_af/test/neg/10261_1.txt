Everything about this movie was bad, the acting was bad and the plot was bad. And where are all the blood and gore that was in "Demone", which is a good movie and it was not scary at all. My brother said this movie was bad, but I had to give it a chance as the first movie was very good. When the film was over, I understood why my brother thought this movie was bad. The only plus in this movie was the music of "The Smiths" and "The Cult", but it is a movie and the music soundtrack is not the most important thing. And I saw that four pursuers were released to this movie, I didn't see either of them, but could be as horrible as this one, I have no plans to see them, but maybe I'll have them see it for a while.
