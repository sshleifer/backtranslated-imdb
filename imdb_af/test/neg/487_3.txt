I didn't expect a classic but at least a funny movie. There were only a few scenes that made you laugh, but nothing more. Don't worry, it's full of American classics and you can guess what will happen. <br /> <br /> But it tells a lot about a senior student in a Turkish high school. Print from the Student Selection Exam (OSS) that the 3-hour exam determines which university you are going to think about the exam when a ghost is after you are not exaggerated. The movie is bad. Don't waste your time watching it.
