This show makes absolutely no sense. Every week, two ladies go to an estate to do gardening, and each week they stumble upon a murder in some way. Because everyone who owns a large home with a large garden is involved in a murder, right? But even if they somehow happened to stumble on murder after murder, would the smart thing not be to tell the police? You know, the people who can actually do something about it ... But every week these two fools go around, polluting evidence, commit their own crimes and, in some cases, cause more murders. Once they solve the murders miraculously, the murderer can never be condemned. All the evidence has been sabotaged. And you'd think people who cover murders would think not to rent these two or not? Yay! We solved the murder! Now, like every other week, we're going to confront the killer ourselves and, without any backup, tell them we know it. There is no way to endanger ourselves, is there? Rosemary and Thyme are one of the worst shows on television, and certainly the most ridiculous.
