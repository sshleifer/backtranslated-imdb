Jude Law gives Keanu Reeves a run for his money as most wood actor, Renee Z's character is straight from the Beverly Hillbillies, and the two leaders have about as much chemistry as Darth Vader and Queen Amedala. The bad guys are the worst kind of cliche, and there is no subtle moment in the movie. Unbelievable that some critics actually liked this movie.
