It's been a long time since I saw this movie and still one of the worst I've ever seen. I like many kinds of movies; sci-fi, action, drama, thrillers and sometimes even horror. Not a combination of two. It could have been a wonderful movie, but everyone blew it up. I didn't want to see this movie, but friends of mine insisted on seeing it. I didn't know it was such a crap. I loved the first part, in which Clooney and Tarantino drove through Texas and were all on their way. (Especially the scene with the liquor shooting was excellent), but at the turning point everything changed into the titty bar. Stupid vampires took over the place and what could have been a perfect gangster movie became a stupid horror movie like 'Nightmare on Elmsteet'. If you like horror, watch a real horror movie. And if you love blood clotting, thrillers don't get it at all, then you'll end up being very disappointed.
