The snarl ... <br /> <br /> That scorch ... <br /> <br /> The acts of random violence ... <br /> <br /> The gutteral voice ... <br <br /> <br /> Wearing the fetish ... <br /> <br /> The crafted head ... <br /> <br /> It just means one thing ... <br /> < br /> GRACE JONES IS BACK! <br /> <br /> In fact, my sources tell me that the title role in Blade was not played by the diva of the 1980s, but by Wesley Snipes. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's not an improvement. <br /> <br /> Blades are an adaptation of a comic character; Somehow, in the transfer of the simplistic two-dimensional world of the printed page, it became even more simplistic and lost some dimensions. <br /> <br /> The plot is almost convinced, adding nothing to the vampire genre, in fact, like Nosferatu, life seems to be sucking on the audience. In short, upward cellular vampire wants to become more powerful, but is opposed to Blade, half-man, half-vampire, all-irritating. All the highlights with Blade have been placed in a vampire juice press, some bad martial arts and the most sad CGI since 1968. <br /> <br /> Leaves should be the least empathic since Dolph Lundgren's Punisher (also a comic adaptation, maybe there's a trend here?). Surely the audience must be on the same side as the 'hero'? And while a vampire can be a tragic character, it's not true of Blade, he's relentlessly cruel, blatant and not much better than the bad guys. <br /> <br /> I assume that Wesley Snipes is an 'acting career' so that everyone can be compared favorably. As he snaps his role through his movie, you find yourself looking for a game - even a ballpoint pen - to put Blade in the grave. <br /> <br /> As a piece of narcissism, Blade is pretty unbeatable. We are treated to endless deadly shots of a gym-fresh snipes, for no reason whatsoever. Likewise, no other actor can get a chance to give a reasonable performance; like Steven Dorff * CAN *, but they have to play a second violin for Snipes' boring performance. <br /> <br /> Kris Kristofferson appeared in good movies, here he was reduced to a sidekick you just know it won't go through to the final line. And what happens if Blade finds out? Yes, you consulted, he hurried to the scene to make his revenge in the villain's huge underground army. <br /> <br /> Why can't world domination take place in a quiet country house? They always continue in underground cathedrals that Albert Speer would have wondered if they were a little grandiose. Many of these plans can now be discontinued if local councils pay more attention to sub-basement expansion plans. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is just as boring and unattractive with nothing new to add to the genre. Vampires have been done to uncircumcision and maybe they should be laid for a while - at least until someone can think of somehow to make them interesting again. <br /> <br /> To end, there is * a Grace Jones vampire movie, called Vamp and that's about ten times better than that.
