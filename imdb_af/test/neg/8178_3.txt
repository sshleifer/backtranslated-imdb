What You Need In the run up to 'What you need', every episode since 'The Lonely' was a winner to some extent. This episode is the first major failure since 'Escape Clause'. The Serling script is again based on someone else's material, a short story by Lewis Padgett. As with "And when the sky is opened, Serling has significantly changed the content, removed a scientist and his machine and dragged an elderly peddler. <br /> <br /> "What you need" works best when it's sweet. The opening half in which the herd clients offer a bar with objects they need in the near future has a soft charm about what a whole episode might have thin, but it works well in the timeframe it is awarded. Unfortunately, the main plot that sets it up is filled with gaping holes. The moment Steve Cochran's performance as a two-bit boyfriend focuses, the episode is split. Cochran's part is an underwritten stereotype and its flat performance highlights this mistake. His exploitation of the old peddler is boring and predictable, and the revelation that he will kill the old man is totally unconvincing. The whole smooth footwear scene looks completely fake. Ernest Truex is good as the peddler, who brings a magical, mysterious but hot edge to the character, but he is not good enough to help the floundering script. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, poor writing is also full of contradictions. For example, we learn that the peddler's power to provide people with what they need arises from an ability to see in the future. So, how exactly does it allow him to produce a pen that will choose winnings. It seems to be a little out of its power. Also, for a man who can see the future, the peddler is definitely surprised to find the villain waiting for him in his apartment. There are many more holes that can be selected in What you need, but it's hardly worth it when the episode is so thin that you can see it anyway.
