Perhaps the wildest outlier in Alfred Hitchcock's career is this direct comedy vehicle by the director. Carole Lombard connects to Robert Montgomery as a couple who discovered a mistake that invalidated their marriage. Where do they really stand with each other? <br /> <br /> Contrary to what others say, there is an element of tension here: The notion that these two miserable people can escape one another is free to cause their horror to some other, undeserved mate. <br /> <br /> It is funny to comment on how miserable Lombard's Ann Smith plays in this movie, as Montgomery's role is so much of a heel. He trafficked Ann, slammed witnesses, short-scraped clients - just the kind of attorney giving his profession a bad name. Ann is also offensive, and of course, the kind of woman who keeps her husband's hostage out of work for six months. He brought things like he did in Paris when he was 20, and hadn't even met her yet. "I have forgiven you!" she says, as if it's big of her. <br /> <br /> For David, a revoked marriage is an opportunity to have some illicit pleasure with his "lover" before tying the knot for good. For Ann, this is an attempt at premarital sex to be pushed with a bottle of champagne on the head, followed by eviction from their apartment and her life. The acorn doesn't look far from The tree, like Ann's mother, is scandalized in apoplexy when she learns what David is trying to pull: "Oh my poor baby! Thank you, heaven is your father dead!" <br /> <br /> This is a bad line in this laughable, unimaginable comedy. <br /> <br /> You can call it an example of the "retrochement", in which the bonds of marriage are challenged to be reconfirmed. You can also call it an example of what Roger Ebert calls the "idiot-plot", in which the storyline depends on the main characters acting like idiots. Hitchcock seems to have a laugh at American American morality, but can't do much more with it than a jocular scene where an older couple is scandalized by the sound of luxury plumber. Lombard died in a year of release of this film; It was the last movie of her to see. What a shame it couldn't have been any better! She was also offensive in My Man Godfrey, but in such a nice way you didn't just go with her, you wanted. Here she is playing for the laugh that is not there, while again and again sadistic breaking David's chops. Montgomery rolls his eyes much like Groucho, a study in smugitude. <br /> <br /> The only fair thing in this movie that lasts longer than a few seconds is Gene Raymond as David's lawyer Jeff Custer, who plays for Ann and acts with honor and decency. Raymond endorsed his many reaction shots, and even a drunken scene, all to a good effect. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER *** So decent a guy is Jeff that Ann finally rejects him not to fight David. She hit him in a confrontation and called Custer a few jelly. Jeff leaves the scene and leaves Ann and David together for their future murder suicide. Here's a Custer that manages to escape a massacre! *** SPOILER END ***
