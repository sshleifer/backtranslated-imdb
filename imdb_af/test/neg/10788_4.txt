Through his career, Hitchcock did great movies; It wasn't one of them. <br /> <br /> A man knows too much, his daughter is kidnapped to secure his silence, and in the denouement everything is solved to the guidance of firearm and roof drama. <br /> <br /> Anyone who saw the 1930s of Fritz Lang movies - "M" come to mind - will know how far this urban story of crime and conscience is short of what has already been done in that genre. There is a totally amateur air of much of the scene and acting, which suppresses any sense of threat, darkness, and depravity that Hitchcock might want to set. <br /> <br /> What it's worth looking at is the sequel to the shooting at Albert Hall. As soon as it kicks off, it is as if the film was given a blood transfusion. The camera work is alive, the cuts are interesting, and the way everything combines into a climax is masterful. Here you can see the future master: Hitchcock orchestrates all the resources laboriously into impressive and unforgettable effects: when the scream comes, you really feel it and hear it.
