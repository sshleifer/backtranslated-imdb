Okay, so this movie was well behaved. It has good direction, but the simple fact is that it has been undermining all gay and lesbian people for years. The straight man "decides to be gay" and the gay man "Definitely to be straight". I enjoyed it until the last 20 minutes, then I really offended. As usual in these films, direct actors play the lead role and gay actors play the secondary straight roles. The clues are played by attractive men, but don't let them go, because it's a movie that makes you feel you aren't full. All the romance and relationships you hope will happen. Unless you are a priest, God is hurting straight woman who heals us gay.
