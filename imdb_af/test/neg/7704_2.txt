This movie plays like a demented episode of VH1's "Where Are They Now" or "Behind the Music". In the first half of the movie (depicting his "glory days"), Abbie Hoffman is unintentionally portrayed as a kind of madman rock star. You know the kind; The poser chief singer, the beautiful boy, who did not write the music, has no idea, but gets the whole glory for nothing and chicks for free. Consequently, he takes his success for granted, abuses it and ultimately destroys it with himself. In fact, Hoffman's glory days suddenly ended when he was forbidden to handle cocaine, skipped bail, and failed. <br /> <br /> The second part of the movie is about hiding in that time. In it we see Hoffman as a pathetic crybaby who, everybody, anyone, but himself destroys infinity. Eventually, the times leave him completely; and he can never handle it. How sorry. THE END. End credits roll and OH NO! We learn that Abbie Hoffman finally committed suicide in 1989. <br /> <br /> I'm sure it's not the image the filmmakers meant for Hoffman to make this movie. Since Tom Hayden and Gerald Lefcourt were involved, they are sure to pay this film a kind of tribute to the life of a man who was an icon of the 60's and the left-wing anti-war movement. They failed in this. The film presents Abbie Hoffman as a senseless caricature. We are never told about what drives him. How did he come to his views? How did he capture the imagination of a whole generation? How did he organize such a big move? Why did he become aware of his fame when dealing with cocaine? Why? Who knows, and since the filmmakers don't look it up, finally, what cares?
