A clear entry on the * Insert Monster Here * On a plane gimmick, Flight Of The Living Dead, it's about what you'd expect. <br /> <br /> The movie has little or no plot, which you expect from a movie of this type. Although, it's fun in parts, I have to say. The zombie action is especially entertaining. Once the movie picks up, it never stops; The pacing is solid. <br /> <br /> The practical special effects are pretty good, but the CGI is terrible and distracting. <br /> <br /> It turns out the movie is open to a successor. Let's hope it doesn't come about. <br /> <br /> If you're a hard fan of the zombie subgenre of horror movies, I'd recommend it. this is worth at least one watch. However, if you're just an avid fan of the genre, leave it on the shelf. <br /> <br /> 3/10
