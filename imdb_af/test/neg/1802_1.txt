The 1994 film production of Heart of Darkness was in no way capable of meeting the outstanding book. The film contains unnecessary scenes that confused the viewer, rather than helping them understand what was going on. Of course, the director was not experienced, and if he was, he didn't show it. In addition, scenes from the book were omitted or changed, scenes that were quite important. The movie made me feel bored and was a total waste of time. The characters thought they had no idea what was going on, and the actors did not portray the emotions that Marlow and the rest revealed in the book. Overall, the movie was awful and completely lacking in the tension needed to make it even interesting.
