"Graduation Day" is the result of the success of "Friday the 13th." Both those films deal with creative, bloody murders rather than tensions. If you enjoy that type of movie, I'd recommend Graduation Day. If not, I wouldn't. There is nothing new here, just the same old murders. <br /> <br /> Although I gave the movie a 4 out of 10, I'll say it's not a repulsive movie. It is vigilant if you are curious about it, just not creative.
