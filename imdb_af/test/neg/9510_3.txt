Franco Zeffirelli's ("The Taming Of The Shrew", Romeo And Juliet, "Jesus Of Nazareth", "Othello"). Third Stitch at Shakespeare's on-screen transfer works very well with the casting of Mel Gibson (Mad Max, "Lethal Weapon" and the pre- "The Passion of Christ" celebrity) into the role previously owned by Sir Laurence Olivier (And rightly so, see my review on his "Hamlet", probably the best interpretation of one of the Bard's timeless (and most cited) tragedies) and treated 5 years later by Kenneth Branagh as a thoroughbred treatment. It explains its 3 hours 22 minutes run, combined with a dream throw (and many well-chosen additions and Kenneth Branagh, director of Henry V and Dead Dead. The spectator of William Shakespeare, author of "Lethal Weapon", is Glenn Close, Paul Scofield ("A Man For All Seasons"), Alan Bates, Ian Holm, Michael Maloney (who will grow as Roderigo versus Kenneth Branag h and Laurence Fishburne in Oliver Parker's "Othello" (see my review) Olivier's "stage" version of the tragedy, though he only stood in it) and who honors Branagh as Laertes in his 3-hour version of "Hamlet" Goodbye to Sir Laurence Olivier and his classic version of the play; my review too) 5 years later), Nathaniel Parker (who will be thrown 4 years later as Cassio into his brother's version of "Othello") and Helena Bonham-Carter, who is in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein "4 years later. /> <br /> Zeffirelli means this movie as a tribute to Sir Lau rence Olivier (who died 2 years before this movie) and it works mostly well, for the most part. What I was slightly uncomfortable was that Zeffirelli misplaced many lines and in one scene he gave one of Hamlet's lines to the Spirit. Also, Helena Bonham-Carter, didn't convince me as Ophelia. She was too dim and unreal, while Jean Simmons (who uprooted the role in Olivier's version) and Kate Winslet (who had an acceptable work in Kenneth Branagh's rough, epic "Hamlet" review) were good at , with Jean Simmons the best Ophelia ever, so she was named best actress in 1948 (she didn't win - what a shame). Ian Holm says his lines are too fast, not slow as I expected him, in a scene with him, Laertes and Ophelia. But then I am more accustomed to Felix Aylmer and Richard Briers's interpretations of the role and I think they did better work than Holm did in their respective versions of "Hamlet" (done by great directors, actors, text editors, producers AND stars of all their versions of the Bard's work) as Polonius. <br /> <br /> However, the rest of the cast was excellent. The scene where Hamlet confronts his mother has been very well done, but Olivier and Branagh have raised the scene to better lengths to create even more emotional intensity and tension that requires the scene. <br /> <br /> I recommend this version to pass the time, but it is ideal as a teaching tool for 12th grade English teachers (I recommend first to show Olivier's version, then Branagh's and finally this version). Despite the movie's "PG" rating, there was really nothing offensive in the movie. Just what the actress called for. <br /> <br /> The best versions of "Hamlet" are: <br /> <br /> # 1 Mr. Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh. Both were so good that I couldn't decide which one was the best. See my reviews on these versions for more information. <br /> <br /> # 2 Franco Zeffirelli. This one was good. It started off with a scene that wasn't in the play, but then had to progress to the real beginning of the play, where a guard cried out, "Who's there?" "No, answer me. Stand up and unfold yourself!" The scene frightens you, because you sit still and then bam !!, you almost jump out of your skin. In short, the scene sets the tone for the rest of the play. GREAT blunder on Zeffirelli's part to leave that scene. It also misplaced many lines (and cut others I think should be brought in), like the line where Hamlet tells Ophelia: "Get yourself a nunery, why would you be a grower of sinners?"; that line had to have taken place in the scene, NOT where it was placed in the film (after the soliloquy "To be or not to be". This version struggles to cut out too much or too little of an excellent literature. Kenneth Branagh will fix it 5 years later with his uncut version of the tragedy, and make his version a more appropriate tribute to Sir Laurence Olivier, as several actors (except him) performed on stage or on film many "Hamlet" Once on different occasions, Zeffirelli's quote on "Hamlet" is true to the play and that's what I was looking for. The final act essay was the same as in Olivier and Branagh's versions, just that in Branagh's version was more violent than the denial of the previous two faithful versions (more in line with the play, Olivier sank it down ... and it worked equally well) and nailed to the play, with Branagh breaking into some harmless touches g its own ... to very good effect. <br /> <br /> This version is not graded.
