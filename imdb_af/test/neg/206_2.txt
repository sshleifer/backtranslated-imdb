A Heist movie with Jean Reno, Matt Damon and Laurence Fishburne ... sounds good on paper? I suspect it had to do when someone lit the production of this movie green, but the end product is terrible! <br /> <br /> The story is boring, the action boring, and for a movie that is just 88 minutes just seems to be dragging. I could feel my life slipping away and was sure there was something better I had to do ... any paint to look somewhere dry? <br /> <br /> Soak. I'm a big fan of Jean Reno, but on earth did he think when he signed it? There are so many other good action flicks around ... go see one of them and let this movie be forgotten best.
