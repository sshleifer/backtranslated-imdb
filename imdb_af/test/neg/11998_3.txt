Wow ... I suspect this one is bad ... But now I find myself only losing words ... Honestly, no words of mine can make this movie any justice. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'll say something ... <br /> <br /> It's actually a unique jewel. One of the worst kind. <br /> <br /> Lash La Rue - giving his background as an actor - make a whip with a Toltec wizard zombie during the movie's climax ... ??? A true stroke of genius, no doubt. <br /> <br /> It seldom happens that I laugh aloud when I watch a movie alone. This has happened many times to this one. <br /> <br /> The accents of the actors, the man, the accents ... And the dialogues I hear they speak ... And the acting itself ... I just couldn't "I don't believe what I not heard. <br /> <br /> The fat uncle running so hard (when he walks with his little cousin to the house) for no apparent reason whatsoever. <br /> <br /> tits! Yes, there are tits! And female ass! There is even a naked chick in a bath that lubricates a beer ... <br /> <br /> The one extends his mouth over his face. Kill was the bomb! A real highlight. <br /> <br /> The comedy aspects were just totally bonkers. I just couldn't believe what I saw and heard. For a while I even thought it was unconscious and shook my head in disbelief. But about halfway through the movie I started getting the bigger picture. Guess it took me half a movie to dip half of my brain to finally get it. <br /> <br /> I had a very difficult time believing this movie ... But that's good, really, I guess. It got one black chick up to a very small cupboard, opened and said, "Wooow, look at all the storage space!". And she said as if she meant it. I mean, this is good dialogue and good acting, right? Oh, and maybe unnecessary to say: Lash La Rue's whipping skills suck big ass in the dark power. It's really sad and pathetic to see. Of course it's part of the comedy. Or wait, maybe I'm wrong. No, yes, I'm wrong. Lash La Rue was wonderful with the whip! It was the editor's fault. He spilled it, cut his eyelashes together. Or wait, it might be the camera operator. He filmed the wrong corners ... Why didn't Phil Smoot say anything? That's the director's fault. <br /> <br /> But it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> I'm just gonna stop talking. I have nothing significant to say, except for the fact that I hope my brain will recover from this experience ... a little soon.
