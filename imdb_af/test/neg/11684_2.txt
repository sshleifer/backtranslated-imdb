Well, the first thing I saw after watching the DVD box was "Best Screenplay" and thought it would be a good rental. WOW, I was wrong! I'm sure at one time there was a good movie here, but after the incredibly poor performance and video game production values, it looks like Tron's delayed half-brother. The first scene shows the overall atmosphere of the whole movie. Five minutes in it, you will ask yourself, "What is hell, I look?", And it will just snow from there. A horrible soundtrack that makes every song sound like Rob Zombie's "Dragula" encloses this unfortunate piece of crap in a laughingly bad movie. On a side note, # 3 most romantic quote in a movie - "I think you are the final destination."
