Some movies are undecided, but nice, but many movies are just annoying. "Motorama" does not fit as well in the latter category. Much seems to be the result of endless guests and a complete lack of sense, but these two things can only take a movie so far and "Motorama" simply has no other merit on its credit. <br /> <br /> "Motorama" enjoys immorality. His main character, Gus, is a 10-year-old on a road trip across an imaginary country who wants to collect games to win $ 500 million. When they are grown up with adults, they do not seem to worry or worry about being 10 years old. Initially it is incredibly funny, but it quickly gets too incredible, especially in the light of the people he runs and the fact that he is so untouched by many of the disturbing images that go around him. Gus has no depth and, as an anti-hero who causes no problems for others to find his games, it is difficult to feel sorry for him when he experiences problems. <br /> <br /> That problem is provided by a lot of guest appearances, each of which abuses more and more strange ways. Apart from the fact that the already exhausted plot is even more incredible and less enjoyable, the characters share Gus's lack of depth and are equally uncomfortable. The character's actions can get a bit interesting, but the actors themselves don't add anything to them, and the whole point is being deprived of getting big names (they could be played by someone and the character would have been the same). These gas reviews seem to be more for marquee value than anything else. <br /> <br /> "Motorama" should be interesting - this is a unique idea, but there is too little sense in writing because it works. Incidents that have a lasting effect on the anti-hero and the viewer do not like the movie that is rapidly occurring after incident, in the hope that something will eventually make the audience regret or understand for Gus. It never happens, because nothing is allowed to connect, it just pushes back and forth like on a conveyor belt, one incident after another. With a story that is so stupid, it stops being pleasant and a main character who never develops to take care of himself or anyone on a higher level has Motorama a little to offer, except that ' a brat around and trying to get rich. Why should we care about it?
