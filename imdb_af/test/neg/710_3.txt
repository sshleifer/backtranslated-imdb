Oh why did it end like that? Laurel and Hardy's last film, from the crudely cranked-Cuckoo theme (with a faulty credit to Hal Roach) to the closing of "Nice mess". I can not help it. Schtick, this is the duo as a grotesque parody of themselves. . In addition, their relationship is now built only from uncertain acting, asinine dialogue and half-hearted slapstick. People defeat the king of New York, but Chaplin's last exploitation was nowhere unworthy. <br /> <br /> What really hurts someone who loves Laurel and Hardy is the appearance of the two comedians. The video cover I like shows them their first, all-boy smiles and glowing skin, with a blurb on the back that reads: "The photo on this sleeve is for illustrative purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the contents of the movie, "Necessary? It doesn't even come close. The real movie sees them at least fifteen years older than the pictures that decorate the sleeve, with Ollie being overweight. It is not humorous, or comical, fat, as it would normally appear, but looks sick and on the verge of obesity. He would have died seven years after this film was made, after a series of strokes. Meanwhile, Stan has a prostitute problem and dysentery, which looks ghoulish, as his weight has dropped dramatically. Every time something bad happens to him, like pushing between a lifeboat and a table, you fear his life. Even Ollie who gives him a traditional slap makes you terrified, he can be murdered. He will last another fifteen years after completing this film, eventually dying from a heart attack in 1965. It is alarming to think of such cherished artists who become old and dying painful deaths. And it is disturbing to see their deterioration, both in health and in performance, on the screen. When I, and I'm sure, almost everyone else likes to think of Laurel and Hardy, I think of Way Out West, Busy Bodies or Our Relationships. Seeing them in such physical illnesses and performing the end-of-career proceedings is a blast on my happy memories of them. <br /> <br /> The warning signs are clearly right from the opening credits, which list Not only four authors, but also someone to get the concept up, and a credit for "gags". So if Monty Collins wrote the "gags", how were the other four writing? And in which case, why is Monty Collins paying a fee, as there is no evidence of a single "gag" in the whole movie? More than 40% of the movie is spent on the eponymous island, where we experience some of the most painful unfunny scenes the boys have ever been involved in. When I saw the bat world, I wanted to curl and die, it was so great. childlike reluctance. Yet, killing the film's death is all the support casts being baptized, not speaking English. It not only makes the movie one another, but also Stan and Ollie's reaction to their co-stars. Directly focused on terrifying movie stock and absolutely horrific editing, it totally believes the rumors $ 2m spent on it. Honestly, it looks terrible, and while a DVD version can clean up the picture, the sound and image quality is significantly inferior to any of their Hal Roach work. <br /> <br /> Stan and Ollie's friends, Giovani and Antoine are charisma-free drills that stand out against Laurel and Hardy's obsolete repertoire. This is another big problem with the movie, since neither of the supporting characters is funny, or enrolled for the boys' innocent mentality. The known hardness shown to L & H ("you - the fat one") makes them stand out as isolated social misfits, rather than lovely sub-anarchists. There is evidence of a bit darker political satire - although Duck Soup is - and the concept of an island without rules is an interesting subject. Perhaps more relevant than it ever was, a movie that looks at immigration problems and the American constitution suddenly becomes the most relevant in 2003. However, it is not beyond an amusing scene where Stan is chosen. really back and forth. And this somewhat black humor has its hard sides - or is a Laurel and Hardy movie where rape is directly implicated and Stan threatens a man with a bottle just to accidentally face someone, your idea of ​​" a good time? After all the years of Stan and Ollie sharing a bed, we also get a definite reference, with Stan accidentally kissing him - Ollie wipes the coast in disgust. Also worrying is the implication that Stan and Ollie's illegal immigrant friend, Antoine, ends up eating his lion's life. Remember, I never thought I'd see a Laurel and Hardy movie where they had to be hung. The need for the invasive and indecent narrative is a further indication of how messy the whole thing is, with the US edition (same version available on video) in 16 minutes in a vain attempt to improve it. <br /> <br /> Almost completely unwavering, this terrified, relentless, unfriendly movie just serves to avoid Stan and Ollie's reputation. Avoid at all costs.
