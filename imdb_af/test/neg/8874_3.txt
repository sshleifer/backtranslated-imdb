This film may carry historical importance, and it seems surprising how well the facts are together, the environment, the rocket, the space suits, the lunar surface, screaming a classic - but ultimately a fairly dull movie for today Eyes, and the fifties technological scenes you might be in a movie like this, are by no means enough to reward by rewarding all the tough dialogue and predictable plot developments. The characters and plot can reward a scientific sociological analysis, but have too little entertainment many times. <br /> <br /> Much of this movie looks like a good movie for nine-year-olds. The adult themes, the human drama and the violence are also kept for children. <br /> <br /> The images of the Earth and the Moon seen from space can actually be more accurate than those in "2001", but so, whether their use is dramatically ineffective. Especially 2001 may look like a protracted meditation on themes of this movie, and didn't somehow model Star Wars to open it to the opening titles of the movie? But then again - the heritage is marginal. <br /> <br /> If it's a true groundbreaking and mega-influential adult 1950s Sci-Fi classic, you're looking for "Forbidden Planet".
