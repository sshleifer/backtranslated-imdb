This movie has some pretty yummy parts like a boob gets a bit off and another big bite. Castle Freak itself is a good monster. I'll be scared if he comes after me. However, the film had stupid parts about it. <br /> <br /> A man goes drunk and kills his 3-year-old son and blind his teenage daughter. I think death is a greater damage than blindness, but you will never know that parents actually feel bad when their daughter is blind. All they care about is "JJ is dead!" As their teenage daughter walks, runs into things and talks about how she can never drive a car. The parents are like - "treasure, stop running without a guide, you know better than that," and then they cry and never stop being depressed, because JJ is dead. Sounds like favortism to me. <br /> <br /> The lines of dialogue are not very realistic or well done. For example, when a huge accident is heard in the castle, everyone walks into the basement to see what it is. It was a large mirror that crashed into the ground and broke. The man ran into the broken mirror in horror and said simply: "The mirror broke." I don't know, I'll say a little more than that if a giant mirror mysteriously crashed into the ground in my castle. <br /> <br /> The husband and wife have some important relationship issues and it's funny to see how stupid they are with each other. Nobody ever believes the blind girl. Advice: If a blind girl says she hears things, believes her and doesn't tell her. I think it's the story of the story. Listen to people when they tell you things or else you can kill yourself to prove your point. Finally, I thought the best character was the chief police officer. He was the best actor and character. Everyone else (except Castle Freak) was fairly running from the mill. 10/03
