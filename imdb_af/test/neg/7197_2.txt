Savage Guns (video title) is a dirty cheap, bottom of the spaghetti west of the barrel in which the survivors of a massacre hunt the bandits who killed his brother and killed him. They got hold of them in a village under the control of their crooked boss. <br /> <br /> Despite much violence, it runs dull and colorless with bad characterizations and almost no imagination or humor. <br /> <br /> Lead actor Robert Woods lives up to his name with a wood and uncharismatic performance that fails to generate any warmth or sympathy. In other words, the viewer never really works for him, despite being the lead. <br /> <br /> The worst scene (in my opinion) is the annoying dance hall scene where a woman is singing in a heavy and horrible thing unsexy German accent. This was the worst scene in Blazing Saddles and the worst one here!
