Well, don't worry. This movie looks so tired, the play is so old-fashioned, and the plot and characters are so murdered that it should be looked at instead. It's really a horrible waste of film; Stereotypes, cliches, nonsense and amateur movie making. I saw it in incredible awe with my mouth wide open. How can such a movie be made, and more interesting, how can anyone find it funny or watch? Old, tired, messy ... a junior high shit, at best. There is nothing to see except for a study of a very old movie. Not good movie, just old. It's not Abbott and Costello or Laurel and Hardy. This is nonsense. The acting is so bad it might be worth watching for the laugh. Some movies are so bad they are good. But this one is completely out of the way and angry again.
