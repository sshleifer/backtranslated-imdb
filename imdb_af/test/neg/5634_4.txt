What a shame that some good talent has disappeared. It's a boring and overly self-conscious movie, which can tell its story in half the time. Is it Derek Jacobi under the beard who does two roles? Gosh, who would guess. <br /> <br /> The emotional payout, the end, was poor and unsatisfactory. Certainly not worth keeping the full length of the movie. I dropped myself a lot. <br /> <br /> The noise was terrible. First, they used stock music. Secondly, it was so loud during some of the dialogue that the words were hard to figure out. Only three audio staff, and one pupil? There were more people in the credits for accounting or legal. <br /> <br /> However, some of the camera work was pretty good and the actors did a good job with a mediocre mini-dissertation. <br /> <br /> Not a good use of watch time, at least for me.
