The first time I saw this movie, it was with this cute girl I was attracted to. We had lots of fun laughing and generally having fun. So my impression was that it was terrible but was viewable for cheese value. Then, as part of our birthday, we watched it again on video. As it turns out, the movie is just awful and incompatible. It's wonderful how cute girls can change the way the world looks.
