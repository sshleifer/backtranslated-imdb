I'm usually a big fan of Pacino (Scarface, Serpico, Devils advocate), but since the scent of a woman he plays almost the same role and screams a lot. This movie has no engaging characters to warm up. Brandon played by Bongo McConnahey is the least parable of the bunch. He never even approached a real person. Pacino was hopelessly unlikeable and my goodness, how old is Renee Russo? The only high light of this miserable mess was the hot hooker with the perfect lipstick and she has 10 lines in total. Even the usually reliable Jeremy Piven was completely unstoppable. <br /> <br /> Note movie authors, they usually don't work unless one of the main characters is at least a bit nice (notable exception Scarface). As the film closes and old Brandon is at the airport, my only thought was to let a plane crash into the airport and kill Brandon.
