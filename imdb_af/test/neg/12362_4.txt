Eight Legged Freaks is a modern monster movie, like a remake of any of the old 'Attacks of the giant [INSERT ANIMAL LORD]' films of the 50's, 60's and 70's. Or rather, it should have been more than a remake of the, instead of what was there. So how was a monster movie done in 2002? Well, from the typical opening with some chemicals that make the spiders big, they mix movies like Gremlins, Jurassic Park, Starship Troopers and taste it with some parody like Scary Movie. Gremlins is probably the best comparison, but eight Legged Freaks were so full of parodies and stupid jokes that it was sometimes more like Scary Movie. It was far too much, at least if you're looking for a monster movie and not just another joke-filled parody movie. <br /> <br /> For such a movie, you don't expect much from the acting, and that's just how it was. However, the story was very thin, with just a lot of unrelated events to blend some action mixed with all the jokes, leading to an easy and choppy end. <br /> <br /> I rated eight Legged Freaks a 4/10, and this includes the fact that the special effects are pretty good and the spiders made the spiders where hilarious.
