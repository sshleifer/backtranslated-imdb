Root Top's "chairman of the board" and his AT&T commercials are living proof that fly-blown faecal material is available in orange color. Not freely available as HBO charges for such refuse. Blehhh! The saving grace of COTB is that it surely fills suicide hotlines across the country, perhaps working for thousands of telephonic therapists who lost their jobs when memory retrieval was discredited, although (unfortunately) Carrot Top probably contributed to his sponsorship AT & T's bottom line with the increased phone traffic of devastated HBO viewers. I can visualize the hordes of traumatized TV viewers, call in one hand and fully charge .45 Car in the other hand, switch off the last moment of despair before they run off the shelf of life to the ghost of COTB's orange-haired Sample escape in their synapses such as the anxiety of tearing, irreversible meningeal swelling.
