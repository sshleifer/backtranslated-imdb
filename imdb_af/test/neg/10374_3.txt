This movie should be put on: Sex in the 70's In a part of New York City called Greenwich Village and Chelsea. <br /> <br /> This movie does little to talk about sex in the 70's, except on the hypersexual environments of the public. and private sex spaces in New York City. I doubt that the Manhole bar was symbolic of real sex in the 70's and that kind of sex is much more common in the movie. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, the period looks like an explosion. And it's quite important to document the scene the movie refers to. But as far as the movie Sex in the 70's is mentioned, the title is a bit misleading. Technically, this is not an Oscar nominee, but its rawness is suitable for the subject. <br /> <br /> Overall, a "eh."
