Slowly and slowly place the film back. The play has a high school play, the plot is striking and the production values ​​are slightly higher than the community theater. The goofs are so full that it's getting weaker. Rooms are turned around, the dead move, dogs are used for wolves, men shot point empty with .45 caliber pistols can run and ride snowmobiles, blouses and buttons without human touch ... this is a baaaaaaaadddddddfilm. I almost succeeded when I saw the average rating. There is no accounting for taste. VAT, there is no nudity.
