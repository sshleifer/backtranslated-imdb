It is fascinating how this title strikes the average viewer as something new and groundbreaking (citing some of the comments). Murali K. Thalluri must have thought of himself: "Oh, fantastic! Elephant ... What a fantastic movie! I will try hard to do exactly the same movie and see if anyone is noticing!" failed with his outrageous idea. The movie seems a complete failure. As it is difficult to capture the sheen of Gus Van Sants' "Elephant", it makes it even more ridiculous. It's an embarrassment for a film director. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with the suicide of a student in the school's bathroom. This scene shows all the awkward acting skills of everyone involved in this scene. You don't buy a single word they say. In the process, interrupted by briefly interrogated pieces of children "living on their marriage" with every bit, rather in its clear stupidity on the basis of every worthless monologue. Thalluri means to introduce the characters in this way, to give some kind of quick-as-junk food insight, look at their hearts ... and fail again. Not five minutes later, Thalluri finally screamed at the audience. "Yes, people! I stole this movie and for some strange reasons I'm proud of it!" by taking Gus Van Sants' most unmistakable storyline of "Elephant": He shot two screens twice to follow the viewer every character involved on a scene in his or her particular way and role in a school situation. Hm, doesn't it look terribly familiar? For me, this certain level of much forgiveness had been violated, to the point where I could no longer rise up this terrible film. Shame on you, Murali K. Thalluri, I say! I am especially surprised that "2:37" has reached the official elections in Cannes from 2006. Everyone should definitely remember "Elephant" (2003) a few years ago! So, how did it eventually show this shameful abomination in the name of the Lord? I find myself absolutely amazed by this mistake. <br /> <br /> Directors like Thalluri use the ignorance of audiences who aren't (and can't quite) be aware of every independent film out there. If Elephant has little to do with the mainstream theater (although it is undoubtedly a masterpiece), few people see the story as mentioned earlier in 2:37 was said before! I can't say how this is possible on a film festival of so much importance as it is attributed to Cannes. It is sad and shameful that such things are conveyed and that no one sees the true deception in it. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is in all respects merely commercial, worthless as an independent film and (at some level) rather a rogue parody of his obvious idol, "Elephant".
