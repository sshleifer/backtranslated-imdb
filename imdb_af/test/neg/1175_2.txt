Ed Gein: Plainfield's butcher was in 1957 in the small American town of Plainfield, Wisconsin, where lonely Ed Gein (Kane Hodder) lives on his farm after death as his mother and brother. The local police had a wave of huge robberies to deal with & when local barmaid Sue Layton (Ceia Coley) suspects something unholy. Ed is a violent sexually abusive man kidnapping girls and killing them, police will tell the truth to rescue Erica's (Sheriff's (Timothy Oman's) sheriff's daughter ... <br /> <br /> , Produced and directed by Michael Feifer, it was an attempt to base a horror movie around the real events surrounding infamous serial killer Ed Gein and seems to be a bit crap. Real Life Ed Gein was only found guilty of two murders in 1984 and died in 1984, but several films were inspired by him, including The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Deranged (1974) and Ed Gein (2000). the worst Gein movie ever. Although Ed Gein was nothing in this movie, Gein never had an accomplice, none of his victims were related to any of the investigators. There was no car accident victim, although Gein liked his other people. had had name changes, the abduction and murder of the two women portrayed here, actually took place four years apart, but in this movie it happened over a few days. And here, Gein is shown as a great whining man in reality. He was a slim, thin, old and pretty short. As a factual drama Ed Gein: Plainfield's butcher is worthless and as pure entertainment it is no better with a deadly dull fit and feel. The character is all boring. And if he does not kill anyone, Gein is shown whether he is working or just walking around and it is very boring. There is no tension because we know who the murderer is and it is just a boring wait until he is caught. There is no real effort to get Gein's mind with the makers who no longer give him motivation than he sometimes has hallucinations of his dominant mother. <br /> <br /> There are not many gore here, there is a scene with a woman depending on a meat hook, there is a very badly crafted scene of Gein cutting off a leg, there is the usual herbs of body organs and skulls that roam, as well as some blood, but there really is not much here to get excited. The film is apparently processed to bleach much of the color from the picture as it is sometimes not far from black and white. Personally, I think the lack of color makes it even fainter to go through. <br /> <br /> With a so-called $ 1,500,000 budget, I can't really see where the money went into a very forgotten production. Although it is in Wisconsin, it is filmed in California. Kane Hodder is all wrong for Ed Gein's role, just from a physical point of view. Hodder doesn't even look remotely like Gein and he gives a very poor performance. As he just stares at the camera, it makes many crazy faces. br /> <br /> Ed Gein: The BUtcher from Plainfield is crap and it's as simple and simple as that. If a factual drama or pure exploitation is entertaining, it is the total result from start to finish with nothing to recommend.
