Without really the worst science fiction film ever made, or the worst I've seen, 'Time Under Fire' is still much below average. The site and the first 10-15 minutes are not that bad, it starts as an X-Files story, combining Bermuda triangular secrets with time travel. In short, elements of other genres (too much) mix, but the story never goes beyond the importance of a TV series. Soon 'Time Under Fire' disrupts quickly in a series of cliches, which not only mix too many genres, but are also unable to memorize anything in the tension or special effects that will help viewers remember the movie until tomorrow no. Acting is bad, and the rhetorical lines in the script don't help at all.
