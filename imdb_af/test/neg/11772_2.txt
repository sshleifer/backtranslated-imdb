It's not often that I give two stars to a horror movie, because horror is my favorite genre. A movie can be BAD because it's not a masterpiece, but it can be pleasurable because of unintentional humor, bizarre characters, etc. " A case in point is a large number of horror / sci-fix films from the 1940s to the 1980s. They are enjoyable for genre buffs and guilty favors because they are "bad" entertaining. However, this movie has none of the humor or effective gory scenes of the original "Piranha" (1978). <br /> <br /> I think it was the flourishing of political correctness in 1995, so most on television was at a minimum. Now in the mid-2000s with the C.S.I. show, TVs are an absolute feast! William Katt and Alexandra Paul are not Bradford Dillman and Heather Menzies (the original 1978 stars.) These are not Katt's and Paul's mistakes, but the writers and directors who created this sloth. Turkey. The main character of this movie is how the main characters work together. I won't say because it's part of the plot. <br /> <br /> This TV movie probably has a bigger budget than the original, but it has been portrayed as a good horror, as can be seen from the user voices here. Join the original 1978 if you're in the mood for a killer fish movie!
