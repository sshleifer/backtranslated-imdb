It's no wonder it was free with the Mail on Sunday, slow going, poor acting, and filming (camera flare, near start of movie, not even artistic) = Straight to video but not in this case, why not you (movie production cost) by releasing it with a British Sunday newspaper, at least this way you get a prisoner heard, and repair some costs. <br /> <br /> I didn't give this movie a 1 out of 10, due to the effort to get some old actors out, it was nice to see old faces (Vanessa Redgrave , it's not a Blow ?? Up, but Vinnie Jones as a lead, and I think he was better in Gone in 60 seconds when he didn't speak. <br /> <br /> This movie falls in Ratings every day, I think it will find its true point at 3-4 out of 10, in the very near future.
