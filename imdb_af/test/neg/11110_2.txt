TV Guide Extract: <br /> <br /> This week at LIEFDEBOT, Captain Stubing, his hands are full when a crypto-logist arrives with an unexpected cargo! Join the Captain, Isaac, Gopher and July in a fun Halloween special. Guests with a guy in a very bad lizard package like the Chupacabra. <br /> <br /> This is a typical, Sci-Fi Channel slice rate. The captain of a ship, once respected by John Rhys-Davies, is in charge of a carnival cruise along the coast of Mexico. His daughter is together for the ride, and she deserves her by being the ship's kickboxing instructor. Pay attention, everyone, that kickboxing will be useful later! It should be noted that the captain's daughter is fairly uncoordinated and painful to watch. It would have been good if she had taken some kickboxing classes before trying to play an instructor in a movie. <br /> <br /> Captain Stupid and his daughter close up. Gilligan's Island's Thurston Howell, a cook-like crypto-lover and a dark, mysterious stranger in this 90-minute boredom ride. <br /> <br /> That's right, I said criptozoologist. He insists he has brought some precious loads on board that he needs to check. Needless to say, the box contains a Chupacabra that someone decides to leave. From this point, a man in the rubber chupacabra pack walks around the ship and kills people. Captain Stupid is powerless to stop it. He decides to call the Marines, but they say there are a lot of terrorists on his ship. <br /> <br /> The Marines respond. They say everything that Marine speaks is talking things like "Hooya" and "Get Some". But that stupid Marines is not a game for a Chupacabra. They also don't really tell who they go, so there is no help in sight. I don't think anyone will miss a lame battalion of lost Marines. But don't forget ... Captain Stupid's daughter, grateful, is a Kickboxing instructor. Yay for Little Stupid! She came in time, she hit the bloodthirsty Bok Sucker and saved the day. Chupacabra means Bok Sucker. That's why Chupacabras sucks. But there is no way that Chupacabras sucks everywhere as much as this movie.
