There is only one word that describes this movie: BAD !! I have no idea why this movie was even made, or how they got Dennis Hopper to die in this movie. Stuart Gordon is a better director than that and Hopper is a much better actor. The movie is simply stupid. I had the idea of ​​the "square pigs" and there was an interesting love story involving a cyborg. Other than that, avoid this movie at all costs.
