All I can say is that this movie is made for the TV channel, which means no fixed characters, no particular style, poorly-behaved sexes, but no breasts and babies (because boy, it will only movie treasure In the depth of the sleaze it wouldn't?) But the heavily simulated sex, well, that's OK. <br /> <br /> When I watch these movies, should I ask myself, when will this type of TV channels and their advertisers ever grow up? I think these companies are actually far behind the times. They really have no idea what the younger generation is, and if they knew they would demand that we change. The whole point of many American TV channels such as this one seems mostly to repeat the same purified, diluted rubbish over and over as a generic movie meeting. I think it works for them ... or at least it has. Not sure about the future. <br /> <br /> Don't kill yourself as I did. Find some real TV movies on HBO, Showtime, IFC, Starz, etc. Any channel that puts effort into their work and doesn't have to ask a priest what they can or can't show.
