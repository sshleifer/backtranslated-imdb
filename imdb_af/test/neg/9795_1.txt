Terrible! A friend of mine (who obviously thought I had a foolish sense of humor) recommended it. <br /> <br /> It's gorges. I almost switched it off. It's just my anal desire not to leave things unfinished that prevented me. <br /> <br /> It was apparently a British effort to make a movie with a bunch of who also ran TV actors with a little lame script of their partner in the business. I struggle to think of anything that even approaches the paucity of this movie. Less funny than global warming. <br /> <br /> I'm not normally so fierce, but I watched it well over ten years ago and thought I'd wasted an hour or so of my life, it was destructive. /> <br /> Pueriel, plot less, useless tosh. <br /> <br /> I'd rather eat my feet than see it again.
