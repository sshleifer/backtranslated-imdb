Positionally ridiculous movie. <br /> <br /> If Doris Roberts, Shirley Jones and Shirley Knight persist in these types of movies, they can submit their retirement papers and collect full-time security. <br /> <br /> While the idea that a 35-year-old swinger, working on video games, is losing his apartment and forced her to enter Grandma Roberts and Jones and Knight borders, it is foolishly treated. Imagine that the 3 bags are high on things that grandson Alex has left in their home and Jones is going to sleep with someone who can qualify as her grandson! <br /> <br /> The video games are as foolish as the rest of the movie. The variety of characters that Alex works with is incomprehensible because he enjoys his weed habit with others. <br /> <br /> Terribly described this unfortunate movie the best.
