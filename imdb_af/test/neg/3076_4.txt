What an uninteresting hodge podge. It could have been something more, but there was no imagination in the writing or the direction. A man is estimated by his wife and her lover for murder. The conspirators do a pretty good job of guilty of him. But the man (Richard Thomas), whose psychiatric records reveal him as "stable" and "relentless", can escape from prison, knock it at the conspirator's beach house, and secretly sign a conversation between them in which they blame them public. Then he accidentally drops the tape recorder with all the evidence on it in the sea water, but manages to recover it. He shows a lot of creativity and improvisational skills to an imaginative man if you ask me. <br /> <br /> The band is now damaging goods, but it's enough to break the woman's lover and he sobs his confession. Bad people are punished. Good people are saved. <br /> <br /> The location shooting is impressive. The beach house is nothing more than a wooden side thrown into the grounds of the Fort Fisher Battlefield on the Cape Fear Peninsula. The house was wrapped immediately after production. <br /> <br /> It's a nice place. Unfortunately, it is a little difficult to see because someone shot every scene through a pantyhose stretched over the camera's lens. It's all very vague. And for all the natural beauty of the place, the viewer never gets a real sense of place, from what the sand feels, from the texture of the gray bark to the stunted evergreens. <br /> <br /> The play is good but the artists have nothing to work with. The best performance, as is often the case, is given by Dick Olsen as a sleazy but not uncontrollable defense attorney. Virginia Madsen radiation infidelity with every beat of her eyelashes. Ted McGinley is within his scope as an immoral weakness. <br /> <br /> The musical score neatly coincides with the mysterious and effective. If you want to hear the original, from which it was cut off, Hitchcock's Vertigo hire and listen to Bernard Hermann's exciting theme. <br /> <br /> I can't think of any particular reason to catch this one, except for complete boredom.
