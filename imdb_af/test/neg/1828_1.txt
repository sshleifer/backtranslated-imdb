Anatomy was a German film and subtitle. It was also over and boring. If it were supposed to be a horror movie, it became uncomfortable to me. The actors went through their steps and looked more like they wanted to be. movie work was ok, but more attention had to be paid to the terribly banal script. I didn't pay anything to watch the video and I still feel cheated. Go read a book and save your money.
