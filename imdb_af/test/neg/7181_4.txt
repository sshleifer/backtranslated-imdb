If it is the best Commander Hamilton movie, I have no curiosity about the other. <br /> <br /> A movie actor's biggest instruments are his eyes, but if Peter Stormare wants to show great emotions, he closes them, so for five or six seconds we get his eyelids, while his feelings remain unknown behind them. Stormy technique. <br /> <br /> Stormers sometimes flicker when he fires a gun, turns his head and clings his eyes. Look carefully. James Bond can easily compete like this. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting supporting actions by other actors, but not enough to hang a whole movie. The cinematography is nice, and it does a good job of capturing the Nordic cold. Even the Sahara winds look cold. Maybe Hamilton is holding his own climate with him. <br /> <br /> There are some individual good action sequences here. Unfortunately, the only sense of humor on the screen belongs to the villain, who changes the hero into a big pill. James Bond's jokes may not be very good, but he doesn't look very hard at all. <br /> <br /> One positive point in the movie's favor is that the psychotic, distorted, fiery hatred of Israel in Guillou books has been omitted. What is important is the worship of a noble, fortunate PLO, which shows us that we are functioning in Libya without the knowledge or supervision of the dictator Khaddafi. This fantasy is hard to believe, since Khaddafi actually threw the PLO from Libya for four years at a time. And at the end of the film Hamilton gives the PLO a very disturbing gift. Where will they use that gift? Hamilton doesn't mind. <br /> <br /> We're a long, long way away from "For whom the Bell Tolls" here. <br /> <br /> Commandant Hamilton will remain a local phenomenon. While Henning Mankell's books are selling well around the world, Jan Guillou will never have the same success. <br /> <br /> As for this movie, bleeeeaaahhhhh.
