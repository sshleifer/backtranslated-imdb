My Tasks: Typically routine and ring straight after Disney video attempt. <br /> <br /> Disney must have been in love with the family movie tradition that is the family dog. Many movies devote themselves to stories that only establish themselves with the man's best friend. Disney made a handful. They also have a handful of those who are literally dogs. Add this one to the bunch. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen the original for a long time yet, so I'm probably not the right person to judge whether this straight-to-video successor is performing better. . Anyone above the age of seven is not the right people to see it too. Maybe only the youngest of the young will want to see LADY AND THE TRAMP II: SCAMP'S ADVENTURE, and even they will grow up and say it's not the best kind of family entertainment they've ever seen. I think it's fair, I can say it justifies a rental, but it's not much to say. <br /> <br /> This successor picks up the parts left behind for the original, often called classic. Lady and Tramp now have a litter of cute Crocker Spaniel puppies ... and one mischievous mongrel called Scamp, which is a splinter from the old block. Instead of the boundaries of the house, Scamp wants to run with the other junkyard dogs of the town, unknown to his father's own past as one of those streets of the streets. To capture the charm of the original, throw this one into the same poor dog / rich dog love story, in reverse. Scamp falls for one of the junkyard dogs called Angel (and who wouldn't with such a name and a voice that sounds like Alyssa Milano?). Que replay of the famous spaghetti scene! Unlike the "cute" factor, there's nothing in store for any audience in this lazy straight-to-video effort. Paste the original. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of 5.
