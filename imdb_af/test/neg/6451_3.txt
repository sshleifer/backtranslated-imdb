This movie was a low point for both Jason Robards and Sam Peckinpah. Big plot points are released directly from Sergio Leone's masterpiece "Once Upon a Time in the West" (two years earlier and Robards): A man finds a waterhole is found in the desert, which is the only water for many miles in Elke. direction, he plans to build a 'station' to the hole and to ensure that there is a love interest, he falls in love with a prostitute. Hereby you add a tempering preacher, bad music, foolish quick action shots, even cleaner T&A shots - and there you go. There is little question why it failed at the box office. The right question is "how did it go that far?"
