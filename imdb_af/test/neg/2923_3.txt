A very disappointing film by Oliver Stone who, unlike his recent epic "J.FK", does not stimulate any kind of true emotion. 'Talk Radio' is about the talk-back host 'Barry Champlain', a very hard-to-read, opinion-man who has managed to upset many people and still sign an audience. Most of them think you just want to call and abuse him. His boss in the movie (Alec Baldwin) takes his character very well by saying he is just a shoe seller with a big mouth. And as Barry (Eric Bogosian) threatens the death threat to the death threat, the final outcome is almost inevitable. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie that usually has something very powerful to say. "Talk Radio", however, fails to make a serious comment and remains a frustrating, senseless movie. <br /> <br /> Thursday, September 17, 1992 - Video
