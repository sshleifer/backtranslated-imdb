This is an admirable effort by the first filmmaker Ham Tran. It offers a little perspective on Vietnam war victims who are struggling for liberation, but specially play as a glorified history. With some self-conscious, informative dialogue and sub-mating, even a relatively impressive budget with attention to detail will not bring this fun, though historically worthy, melodrama to life. Do not mind the often distracting link with the actors to the reality of on-screen situations, and you must be left with an informative or somewhat impersonal educational lesson in Vietnam's post-war history.
