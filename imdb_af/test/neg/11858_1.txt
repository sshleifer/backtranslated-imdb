My son-in-law and his wife brought the movie one night to watch video. It had given me the first idea that it would be terrible. It was. From the very first frame to the last, this movie is terrible. It doesn't even register as a "B" movie. Maybe a N or a P. One of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. From the rubber-raptor-to-a-stick to the sedentary bodies in the car up to anticipating closing times, this movie is not worth checking out for free. <br /> <br /> Save this one altogether - unless you want to play Mystery Science Theater with your friends, it will provide good ammunition.
