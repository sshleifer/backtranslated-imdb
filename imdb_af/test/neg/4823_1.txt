If it is classified as London's 'real life' then the producers must be at different levels. <br /> <br /> It's the most depressed, suicidal, dark, throbbing, foam on TV. <br /> <Everybody is fighting, everything has nasty undertones running through it. There is nothing for real reasons. <br /> <br /> If you want a real picture of people in London or the UK, then this program is far from reality. <br /> <br /> There is not one good word I can say about this program. The only certainty is that it will be a huge battle over Christmas dinner. <br /> <br /> Even the characters are absolutely incredible!
