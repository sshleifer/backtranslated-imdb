I am worried that people are not so critical of a job that is critical. The many similarities, both structurally and literally, with 'Amadeus' next to the 'Copy Beethoven', deliberately choose the easy path by placing audience in front of art. And so the world denies critical, intelligent and creative work. Now consider the following: Isn't it possible that the real story of the creation of the ninth symphony can actually be an engaging and powerful story itself? and equally in a dramatic narrative? Beethoven was completely deaf by writing the symphony? Isn't it more interesting? How was the symphony performed? Wouldn't it be nice to know? Ask yourself, what possible motivation can a filmmaker have for the introduction of a woman as the copier? If there was an executor, he would definitely be a man. What was his story? (Please try to be a bit critical here, even if you like the invention of a female composer). <br /> <br /> Fantasy should be much more than a distortion of reality to serve a writer's purpose. For those who compare the invention of Anna Holtz and justify the invention of Salieri's claim that he murdered Mozart in Amadeus, he regards as a priest in an ugly asylum. (Schaffer uses this device to great effect in the movie.) "Beethoven copying" may have worked if Anna was an image of Ludwig's crazy imagination. But we are meant to believe she is "possible" ... and that Strauss was assisted by strangers. <br /> <br /> Most of the positive reviews I've read here are often expressions of a desire for the movie to be good; almost a deliberate memory loss. Remember the movie for what you want, rather than what it is. <br /> <br /> For those who believe that fantasy justifies the means, you think you not only accept an inferior interpretation of real-life events, but also the truth for the sake of triviality. <br /> <br /> Finally, a brief note on the play here that some of you surprise. Ed Harris is NOT good like Ludwig Van Beethoven. Does it shock you? He looks uncomfortable throughout the film, like an actor dressed but down and standing at the cafeteria table. Most of his lines are said to be clues rather than answers to Anna Holtz's lines (ie he does not listen to the actor). He is very clear that an actor is masking the character rather than being a character. <br /> <br /> How many times should Beethoven roll into his grave before we get it right? Ask yourself, would Ludwig approve?
