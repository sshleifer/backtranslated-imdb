I was all ready to hate it, but it seems surprisingly tolerant - although the MTV style of movies (shot at DV, to start) is a bit of a pain! I like the script's self-sucking style, as well as its central idea to double the female vampire lead doubling as contract killer. Regarding the film, Eileen Daly (known as the 'star' of the terrible 'Redemption' intros) has an unmistakable screen presence - and despite her age, is quite sensual. However, Christopher Adamson's hammie head is angry. David Warbeck has a short role as a doctor (called the "Horror-Movie Man"!) Who performs the autopsy on one of the vampire's victims; The movie looks quite long to shoot if Warbeck died in 1997! There is a lot of nudity and violence on hand, but not much sense (especially since his subplot includes a secret society of vampires infiltrating the power structures, barely developed); The film is also over for its purpose, and eventually ends in the tedium during the last half hour.
