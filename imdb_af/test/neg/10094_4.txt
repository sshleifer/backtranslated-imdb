In a nutshell, the movie is about a gang of war in the 1950s. Deuces leader Leon, the gang, starts the gang after his brother's ODs. He vows to protect the neighborhood. The leader of the competitive gang just comes out of jail and wants revenge. <br /> <br /> The movie didn't really do that for me. The "Good Guys" were no longer good as the "Bad Guys". There was very little to suggest that the Deuces really cared for the community. I think the authors went here for realism, but I just didn't care what side won. None of the characters were nice, or even able to draw my sympathy. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Annie and Bobby's court had some funny dialogue, and the acting overall was well done.
