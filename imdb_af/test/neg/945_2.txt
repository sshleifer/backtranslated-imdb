this movie was horrible. most of the comic screens look exaggerated and thin, and perhaps the funniest scene in the movie has already been given away in previews. The whole assumption of the movie is so incredible and ridiculous that it's really hard to get into it. the actors themselves set the most unrealistic characters. It's not just the fact that the movies are so hard to swallow, but how they force it into your throat to dip you and accept them. the plot itself is so level and easy to predict. Son is in some way disapproved of every school he applied for (I suppose he totally forgot to attend community college) and decided to create his own school for co-rejections. Everything goes well for a while until the validity of his school comes into question. All the time, the brave character has managed to drop his beautiful neighbor to fall for him with his witty sarcasm, which apparently is just a skill he owns. Then the final battle with the students somehow comes together and fights for the survival of the school. Of course, the main character then persuades the Education State Council to enable his school to stay alive with an "inspiring" speech. this movie would have been nicer to see if I was under the age of 16 and was still ignorant of all college issues and issues.
