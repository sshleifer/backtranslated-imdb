I must say I was surprised to find several positive remarks to this turkey (in desperate need of a ferry transplant)! I give it a 1 because I think the idea of ​​making a movie about the wild man of rock'n'roll - Jerry Lee Lewis is honorable, but it is a pity to throw out such trash and the "killer" Don't deserve it! It is a good thing that it came late in his career ... they said Elvis had practically ruined his career with the films he put out over the sixties. It could have been the same for Jerry Lee if it came 15 to 20 years earlier. ! It's based on Myra Gail Lewis's book and it's a pity to start with. This is a bad and inaccurate story of her life with Lewis and there are much better books about the killer, which could make a much better and more interesting writing. Add to this a bunch of actors who don't know if they're taking part in a drama, comedy or a bit! The otherwise fine actor Dennis Quaid sits on what must be one of the worst performances of an actor in many moon! He walks around in the picture, talks about his "god-given talent" and as a spectator he wishes he would show it on the screen too! Dumb gestures and funny faces and Jerry Lee must have been betrayed when he saw what had become of him in this truly horrible movie! The rest of the crew is almost as bad ... except for Winona Ryder, who does her best with the crappy lines given to her. It is again "Grease" and when Jerry Lee travels through Memphis in his convertible, with the radio in the car, the whole town is dancing to the music! Everyone in this movie is like cartoon characters of the real people involved. From the wild man to Sun Records Sam Philips! And it's a shame! A charismatic and interesting artist like Jerry Lee Lewis deserves better and I hope he has the 500,000 dollars he received from the deal to the company twice to go!
