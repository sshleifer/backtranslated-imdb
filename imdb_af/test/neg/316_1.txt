Warning may include spoilers <br /> <br />. Unfortunately, I released $ 5 on this movie on Amazon and I wish I never spent it. I have never seen how terribly special effects are or are acting. I mean Jack-0 is just a laughable monster and his costume looks like something you can buy at a Halloween store or make yourself. The acting is just awful, especially Sean Kelly, I mean come on, he's so pathetic with his little lines. "Come, let me pumpkin man" low. I laughed so hard, it's just stupid. I mean the movie is so terrible that they had to put a nudity for just a few minutes, just for people not to shut it down. I think the most laughable scene is when the woman knocks and electrolyses a butter knife in the toaster. I mean come on what looks so fake and the dummy I can buy or make it at any Halloween store. Well, I recommend not to watch this movie because it will be time you never come back.
