This is a painfully slow story over the last days of 1999 when a foreign disease breaks out and ... I have stopped caring. It is supposed to be about two people living over or under one another in an apartment complex. There is a lick and a plumber puts a hole in the man's floor so you can see in the woman's chassis. Also, as there is a lot of crisis going on, news reports are actually ... <br /> <br /> Sounds promising. <br /> <br /> Not really. <br /> <br /> I've deduced and started doing other things deadly in a captioned movie. Basically I didn't start to look, what the events looked even more surreal when I looked up. <br /> <br /> It may work for you, it didn't do me.
