I am a regular reader of Kathy Reich's Temperance Brennan novels. As such, I am extremely surprised that she even consulted on this show. <br /> <br /> It's surprising compared to the books. The Temperance Brennan character is, in the books, a downward world that restores alcoholic and divorced mother of a college aged daughter. In 'Bones' she is arrogant (rhymes with rich), which is not a mother in typical P C mode. The emphasis on her co-operating staff, complete with scary details of whose sexual exploitation, is totally in contrast to the books. <br /> <br /> In total, the PC movement reflects the US enemies as peace lovers (!). Some of the information is not even correct, for example, with a character from Afghanistan as an active member of an Arab-American friendship group. Since when is an Afghan Arab? I am sure whether negative references to underprivileged minorities, or women, or GLBTs will be made, will excuse the show's producers / writers / directors. In the typically far-left fashion, all racial rebels go to the highly-reaching minority group. Asians, like David Boreanaz 'Agent Booth, constantly refer to Angela Montenegro as'' squint ''. <br /> <br /> Forget those things and forget about this show. After the episode 'The Man in the SUV' I thought I'd try a second episode to see if it's better. It just got worse! I don't even care if the teenager in question is murdered or committed and I won't look at the show again.
