If you have enough time to kill and the DVD has been given to you by your friend for free, but it may be a lot of courage to see this movie that doesn't have good writing or humor for that matter. <br /> <br /> At the stage, imran was frozen in time / acting, Tushar Kapoor was slightly better than Imran in this movie. Paresh Rawal was good at comedy. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a university campus where Imran is a bad boy. A Tushar is the good, they pretend to be the opposite of the different kind and so the story goes on. /> <br /> Just watch it if you have nothing to do and the movie is running on your local cable TV.
