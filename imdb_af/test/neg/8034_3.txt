Riccardo Freda may have a good reputation; but since now many of his best films are actually directed by late Mario Bava; It is clear that he was not one of Italy's most gifted filmmakers in the seventies. This film proves it, despite the simplistic plot; It's a tumultuous mess and overall, I even want to go so far as to say that the Tragic Ceremony is WORSE as Freda's careless Giallo effort, The Leguan with the Tongue of Fire. Freda apparently rejected this movie and I definitely owe him! The plot simply follows a bunch of kids running out of petrol in the middle of nowhere. They happen on a house while they are looking for fuel; but it seems to be a bad choice as the owner will only do a satanic ceremony ... ho hum. The film starred Camille Keaton, who died a few years later in the exploit classic I Spit on Your Grave, but failed to make an impression here, despite the fact that he performed with a cast of talented artists. . The movie contains one decent gore scene at the end, but it's really not enough, as it takes eighty minutes of tedium to get there. I have a high tolerance for rubbish Italian movies that don't make sense - but even I couldn't stand this one. Miss it, miss nothing!
