Oh, dear! What can I say about Half Past Dead? I was really disappointed with that. I thought .... A Steven Seagal movie! Cool! We'll see him kick people and flip people and break legs. We can even see that he has a stick fight with someone! Excellent! <br /> <br /> However, I was in for a rude awakening. This movie can be summarized as follows: <br /> <br /> Take an episode of the A team, remove the sweet and rogry characters such as Murdoch, Hannibal, Mr T and Face. Then a writer / director gets a plot on the pen, even Ed Wood will be ashamed of who and what is too big for a fan of The Matrix and John Woo films for his own good. Throw a lot of people with very bad acting ability and who doesn't have real names. Lastly, add a star that gently touches the midriff and may no longer be able to do its own stunts. <br /> <br /> The result? Half past death. An action movie is so ridiculous that it made me at least fix it. The plot holes are wonderful, splendidly large - for example, prisoners who, when imprisoned, fight the invaders rather than escape. Or how about the prison itself, which contains a weapon containing heavy machine guns and rocket sprouts? You also have a helicopter (with a striking resemblance to a Huey) with some kind of video game machine gun mounted in the nose. <br /> <br /> Then there's Seagal itself. I like the guy. He can fight. He is even witty in a way that Jean-Claude Van Damme will never be. But through the movie, I still hoped for that one big, definition battle scene. Never happened before. Instead, our people fired a lot of firearms and didn't hit a lot of hell. I mean, if someone runs down a narrow passage and you fire a sub-machine gun at them, there aren't many places where the bullets can go differently than in the hallway and into the target. Still somehow they miss it? Even the A team would collapse with this folly. And then, when it comes to any kind of one-to-one physical stuff, we are treated with a loose Matrix rip-off, without the benefit of bullet time. People are kicked twenty feet through the air and several other ridiculous acrobatic nonsense. <br /> <br /> Come on, Steven, you're better than that. Your career cannot be over. Say it is not so! <br /> <br /> It is immediately forgotten (except I force myself to remember for the purpose of this review) and if you see it, try it amusingly in an A-Span type. But I doubt it will be high on anyone's "visible" list. It is not for justice. More like outside for lunch.
