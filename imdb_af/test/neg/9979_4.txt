"Caligula" shares many of the same characteristics as the 1970's "Fellini Satyricon" with bizarre sights, freakishness, and images of sexual excesses that are all in the "glory" of ancient Rome. But Fellini's not ... First of all, it's not that entertaining. Too much screen time is dedicated to bug-eyed, rubber-faced McDowell in the titular role. His performance is far too blurred and cramped to be convincing. The depictions of Jay Robinson in "The Robe" (1953) and David Cain-Haughton in "Emperor Caligula" (1983) are far more convincing and credible. The latter are the nuances. Enlightenment could be wisely provided by developing the surrounding characters more fully. As it is, they are a bit more than numbers. One example is the role of Macro, played by Guido Mannari, who has a tremendous screen presence in an important role, but is mostly left behind. The only positive features to credit are the use of some Prokofiev and Stravinsky themes in the music party and the inclusion of some of the insatiable but nevertheless accurate actions of the despot. However, these two factors are far less than necessary to alleviate the prevailing tide.
