I usually enjoy underground movies and antiheroes, but it's a bad joke. I wonder how it can be called a movie. All these people are losers and the filmmaker fails to make them interesting at all. They are not funny, not tragic, just stupid and boring. <br /> <br /> May I miss something, but I won't see it again to find out what. Anyone with a video camera can do better than that ... <br /> <br /> I give it a 1 for the originality. All the rest is shit.
