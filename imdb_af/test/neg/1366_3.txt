It is one of those religious horror movies that never explain why the forces of "evil" are 10,000 times stronger than "good". We have here a satanic cult that can: 1) "beam away" people (like in Star Trek), 2) kill by toddlers' dolls, 3) transfer a soul from one body to another, 4) telepathically hypnotize from a greater distance and 5) cause drastic car accidents in which selected persons in spaghetti change while others (children in this case) are careless. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the forces of "good" can: 1) sit helpless, 2) stand around, 3) panic, 4) hysterically laugh, 5) waste time doing nothing no, 6) read comics while people are being slaughtered by the dozens, and 7) come to satanic rituals. <br /> <br /> In every religious horror movie I have to accept that the world's world is inhabited by God and Satan I must also assume that Satan may not be 1,000,000 times more powerful unless the movie has a world order that looks like hell, in other words, where were the priests in this movie who knew something? film's priest can do is read a few witches - nothing else - to read all the books in his study, at the first sight of violence, this priest becomes catatonic, then laughs hysterically, just into a big It is supposed that God's contribution to the fight against Satan is "ridiculous. Every good religious horror movie has the powers of" well equipped with a form of (more or less) supernatural power, or at least some concrete knowledge of how to "fight". In this sense, this movie is pretty idiotic. Just like throwing the droll Martin to play the high priest (!) Of the cult. There is very little threat or awe to watching the strange Martin leading a satanic ritual. I mean, it shouldn't be Christopher Lee or Langhella, but couldn't they have got someone less funny? Also, why did the couple go back to the village after their car was shut down? After their "friendly" encounter with the town's people, no healthy person would have been back; they just had to walk. The man's explanation to his girlfriend (and the viewer) is that "who knows what is in that direction".
