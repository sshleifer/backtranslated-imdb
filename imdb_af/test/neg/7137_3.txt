Hollywood movie industry is listening all over the world. It only needs a single hit to flood the theaters with the same old crap that has been rediscovered. For example, take superheroes, for every X-Man and Spiderman, there is Daredevil, Elektra, Ghost Rider and Hulk. Japanese horror remakes are even the worst. It only took The Ring, which was perfect (mostly due to Gore Verbinsky), to bring a bunch of atrocious woman-based horrors, for example. The Ring 2, The Eye, Dark Water (which was good but useless) and the grudges. <br /> <br /> The first Grudge wasn't quite bad. It was terrifying most of the way, which is what you can expect. In addition, the plot had some brain stories. Remorse 2 is exactly like the previous one; It could be a good thing, but hey, what boy in Black II? Was it a nice thing to xerox the whole script and just change the villain? For the grudge 2, the critic goes the same way. <br /> <br /> Tired, bad acting (except Amber Tamblyn), and clich√©s everywhere. Three stories take place, at different places and time. There is Aubrey (Tamblyn) who killed her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar); Allison (Arielle Kebbel) taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place; And finally, an American family testifying to strange things happening on the apartment next door. Keep saying (and I mean it) that everything is tied to the end, but don't end up in the end to make a good picture if everything is just tiring and boring. <br /> <br /> The cold fever is everywhere, a girl alone in the cupboards, someone who doesn't have to enter a house, others dig too deep. Meanwhile, spirits remain dead and murder and kill, which seems even more deadly than ten world wars or the Ebola epidemic. Hey, doesn't it look like another bad Japanese remake, something called Pulse? Yes, day after day it becomes easier to hold a grudge ... against Hollywood bullshits.
