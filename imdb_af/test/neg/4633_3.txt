I'm the score 'The decline of the American Empire' just below average because it wasn't terrible, but not great either. I like the many open conversations of people so incredibly selfish and ugly inside and out. This was probably the most original aspect ?? a sexual little movie with dialogue-minded sex with people who are very far from models. It is also ironic that this French-speaking Canadian has a film about a neighboring society, which is in "Decline" when their own actions are their own demise. A group of female friends and male friends spend half of the movie and laugh at their unfaithfulness and acceptance of such behavior and the other half "intellectually" speak of how powerful they are for their speech and deeds. These are the normal targets in typical sitcoms. The main characters are fun at parties occupied mainly by college professors. Unfortunately, this is not their "intelligence" or mastery of "history" that disturbs me. It's their pedestal made of ego and mightier-than-you attitude that pushes me away and not one character I can tolerate or not. If you cry, can't I care? It's your bed. When one complains, I barely flinched. What made me skirmish was one character, you looked red. (Another example of playing with fire.) Certainly, I understand this happens to some people, but it was difficult to watch. And I was hoping that he was washing his hands because he had no problem straighting out for everyone. On the complete opposite side of the nasal educators, they represent a stereotypical nomad. It curled me because no one really looked; everyone was as level as they laughed at society. Unfortunately, no one has left the root, you are as empty as this character's souls.
