I watched this movie last night, but I'll rent a horror / scary movie of blockbusters and I have this one out. The opening styles were so long, the conversations between characters seemed to have failed. <br /> <br /> The story line was so poor for me, she gave him HIV and then she met someone else, but she was killed by the man she infested. (I think she might have done it for a long time. Time for different people). When he showered the body, it was just the man she was going to meet in the forest and saw him dump the body. Then he pursued them (did he ever bury the body?) And they got into a car and he got them in a different direction, and they came. <br /> <br /> I think the cut head was the only good thing in the movie because it was pretty realistic. And when the woman ran, she fell before him so that he could stab her with a spade! AND THERE WAS COMPLETED !! <br /> <br /> What a relief, It was the most senseless movie I've ever watched ... please get away from it well, it's just as poorly made, I only counted 5 different people in it, and the scene where he kills her is so unrealistic and they just swear and that's it! That's mine ... <br /> <br /> STEER WELL CLEAR !!
