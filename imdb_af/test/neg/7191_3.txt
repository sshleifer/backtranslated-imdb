If you read the commentary on this movie, it is clever and funny political comedy based on true events. The only real word here is that it is a comedy. If you tell, it's insider movie about Russian politics - it's not. There is probably only 2% in the film of what really happened in Russia during the election campaign. In fact, in 1996, it was a thousand times more interesting to follow the situation and it was a real funky election campaign. Well, there were US PR advisers working in Yeltsin's staff, but their role was just minimal. The whole campaign was completely different from what was shown in the movie. It would be much nicer to show that all of the president's people across the country are carrying paper boxes full of cash, and the celebrities who give performances to support Yeltsin everywhere. least it would be true. I only give it three because of the respect for Jeff Goldblum, Antony LaPagglia and Liev Schreiber. And about the machine guns on the streets of Moscow. I was in the mid 90's in the place that had the biggest amount of hard crime in Russia and never saw a man with the gun on the street.
