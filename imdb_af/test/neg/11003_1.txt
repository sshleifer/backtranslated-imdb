This movie is terrible - honest. The play is horrible, the writing hurt me, the effects are quite uncomfortable (which I usually don't give to older movies, but it was only made two years ago), and everything about it just makes me irritate. A few friends go out on Halloween in the bush and meet a witch and her cannibal son. Of course, before it got the clich√© "You really believe it? Ha ha ha, it's just a story" routine dragged for a while. The witch's cannibal son was made a retard (I don't know if it was for comedy or creepy, but this movie both fails). It has minimal gore and no nudity, which made a bad movie even worse. Heck, the only good thing about this movie is the leg scene, and even that could have been better. <br /> <br /> Honestly, don't even waste your time watching the cable, and definitely not consider buying or renting it, otherwise you'll kick yourself for wasting time spending can become something more constructive or entertaining.
