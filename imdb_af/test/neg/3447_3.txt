Author-director Coen Brothers wannabe Paul Chart relies too much on ideas that are being lifted from other (better) movies, but manages to create a creepy atmosphere that looks at one. Robert Forster cuts loose as never before playing a psychopathic psychiatrist (ha ha) in the desert. The movie is unusual, but in an effort to keep one step ahead of the audience, it is alienated and deterred (with a role for Amanda Plummer who is quite humiliating). A dedicated bravura final, very peculiar bits of business - and Forster looks great in the nude - makes it a curiosity point, nothing more. Irvin Kershner, veteran film director, may also have rectified (can Paul Chart be a pseudonym?). * 1/2 of ****
