We picked it up as part of a Brentwood set, titled "The Broken Skull." This film is placed directly on the video, with a wide variety of sounds and lighting quality. This movie has a hyperactive quality that inspires the viewer for feelings of nervousness, confusion and irritability - and not in a good, 'Evil Dead' kind of way. br /> <br /> Without going into spoilers, it looks like a simple revenge. Ghost story is increasingly passing and weird. While there are some interesting ideas here, the overall effect will probably make you scratch your head and say, "Honey?" <br /> <br /> It's a very, very stingy movie. The gore effects range from full blood devices to a dumb video toaster effect that needs to be frozen. The "Fangoria" level of extermination effects in this film is really great and should probably be the gore dogs while someone with a poor constitution feels a bit on the rope side. <br /> <br /> The broken skull is also a very noisy movie. Not only does it contain environmental facilities (caught by mids and not replaced in the mail), but there is a lot of screaming. No, no, I mean a lot. Many, many! Characters shout, cry, cry and scream, shit and laugh manies. Turn the volume down if you appreciate your drums and your nerves! But you can't blame it for their enthusiasm, they really eat the scenery and sometimes the effect is quite entertaining. In particular, the actress who plays a certain Vietnamese immigrant, produces all of the above with a remarkable amount of gusto. <br /> <br /> In fact, very few actors were wood. Some of them may have suffered a bit (oh, just a good blacksmith!), But most of them are definitely fun to watch, go down. The film is ethnically diverse and kudos for the filmmakers. However, the two middle-aged white women are two of the most indifferent characters since the shopkeeper in the MST3k classic "The Brute Man." Just look at the other characters, it's fun! <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the Headcrusher may not become a horror icon, such as Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers or Freddy Kruger (or even the Leprechaun), but we can definitely say it ... it was " a movie.
