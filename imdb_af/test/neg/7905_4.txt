This movie wasn't too funny. It wasn't too terrible either. Just a fun ride aboard the Soul plane. It is a black flight service with a dis's disco, beautiful bar, and pump stewards. The plot takes you through the whole idea of ​​a black (not race or color, but "style") plane with the same style of black humor. Sometimes there are some big scarce scenes like when the main character uses the 'normal' toilet in the 'normal' plane. Check it out. However, there are lulls and I find it most in the character the Soul Pilot played. Look to find out who it is. All in all, it's a fun movie. Tom Arnold adds fun to his 'cracker' attitude. It's a movie to watch when you're playing poker, when you're drunk, or just a wall.
