When I attended college in the early 70's, it was a simpler time. Apart from a brief appearance in 1994, I have been completely free from the influence of illegal substances and have never regretted it. Until now. DB: TBTE should be hands-down, the best movie to watch when stoned. The strange, dreamy state it creates is very strange when you do nothing, but I'm sure it looks completely normal to a big doom. (Not that I recommend it, you understand.) The soothing narrative, as usual in a quality theater, by a TB victim trapped in a painting, would be ideal to help the stoned viewer to follow complicated. Plus, everything in the movie is pretty organic ... from old-fashioned natural breasts to the bucket of fried chicken. <br /> <br /> Now, there is no doubt that the young man with the (ahem) "hand" problem is absolutely sailing away in the movie. At one point you just know he's going to say, "Hey! If I move my hand, it goes on trails !! "Trust me ... you'll know when you get to that point. <br /> <br /> The only other thing we need to address is this: How good can be a movie if at least half of the budget is spent moving a large bed frame around for inside and outside shots? <br /> <br /> Definitely a must-see for horror aficionados, but suitable for the general Audiences under the right circumstances (if you know what I mean, and I think you're doing it.) It only earns four stars, because I can't really say it has any talent to make.
