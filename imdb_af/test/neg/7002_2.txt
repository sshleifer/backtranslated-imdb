I rarely switched off a movie after the first 10 minutes, but that's what I did with this one. What turned me off was that it was so clear that the only purpose of this movie was to expose so much skin from so many B actresses, and nothing else really mattered. <br /> <br /> Don't misunderstand me; I like beautiful actresses and sex scenes, and sex-blown movies have their own scale of merit, but this director does nothing else. <br /> <br /> For example, take the scene where the two policemen (of course, one old gal and COURSE there is all this so-called greasy rascal between them) talking about standing over the first dead body. The camera pans between them for each line (there is more than one screen width between them!) And you will eventually wonder if you are seasick of that or the clueless dialogue. <br /> <br /> Well, it's MIGHT got better after the first 10 minutes, but I won't know. I refused the sucker bet and had something better to do.
