"Wired" should be one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen. The writing and direction show a wonderful imagination and I'm sure most actors still cringe when someone calls this movie. <br /> <br /> It either fails to pay tribute to Belushi's unique talent, or as an accurate representation of his short life. <br /> <br /> A pointless debris without redeeming features.
