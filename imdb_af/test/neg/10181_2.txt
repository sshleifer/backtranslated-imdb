The only reason I gave this movie was a 2 and not a 1 because I for one reason or another forced it to run! Actually I wanted to see if there were any strangers, any UFOs, anything suggested by the title of the movie, the cover of the movie and the start of the movie! I was very disappointed to see that religion was thrown into the mix, as it was. It could have been to use the movie's advantage, but I felt the movie was trying to send me subliminal messages! Finally, how big was this wardrobe's wardrobe! I got so distracted from the number of different, and extremely bright, shirts that each character had in every new scene that I was beginning to wonder if this movie wasn't really classified under "poor comedy". <br /> <br /> drop thumb!
