Asmali Konak has probably become one of the best television series to come from Turkey. With its unique cinematography and visual approach to filming, the series has achieved a broad following base, with the score continuously broken. Personally, I don't agree with singers who become actors (so Ozcan Deniz - the main actor), but I think the numbers speak for themselves. <br /> <br /> Regarding the movie, it was disgusting to see how much someone could destroy such a plot line. Years in the making, this movie was able to look after every descent story that existed in the series. Not only that, the cultural flaws were unacceptable, with an idiotic scene taking place in the family dance (Greek style) and breaking plates, which do not exist in Turkish culture. <br /> <br /> Some argue the film should be considered a stand-alone movie, not a continuation of the TV series, but this theory has one big fall. The way the film is marketed is that it will pick up where the series has left and will end the series once and for all. . So with that in mind I and everyone I know will have asked for a refund and accept to stand outside the theater to warn other victims.
