Since her breakthrough role in the 1988 filming movie "Far North" I was a great Lynn Peterson fan, and although I love her in her other movie, Slow (2004) where she plays Francis, it is far from her strongest role. <br /> <br /> Lynn, as I am sure you know (or belong) everyone, plays the critical role of "Driver". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, other than Lynn's incredible show, I'm afraid this movie doesn't really matter. <br /> <br /> Waiting - there was another thing - the wonderful creativity of the editing to remove profanity for TV viewers. Memorable lines like: "Your son of a gun!", "Your son of a witch!", "Shoot!" And "Well, forget about it!" O.K. Ie. <br /> <br /> PS: Does anyone know where to get another Lynn Peterson poster?
