I own this movie. And it's very hard to find. It is a unique, low budget, which is a doctor looking for the perfect companion. It has the really humorous low budget, and the gore is surprisingly good for what seems to be a $ 500 budget. The director is alleged to be the master of gore. I won't go that far, but maybe in his time he was. Overall 6/10 on the chart.
