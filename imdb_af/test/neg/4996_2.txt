Don't be deceived. It's NOT a zombie movie. Take it from a man who loves zombie movies, and who rents them all: good and terrible. Yes, this movie has an extensive zombie sequence, but it's basically an artistic exercise in existentialist fear, which is a long way to say it's boring. If you worked hard all day and wanted to entertain for a few hours, rent something else. <br /> <br /> "Rise of the Undead" has cheap special effects, mediocre acting and crummy dialogue. All of these are understandable in an indie, low-budget movie, and I can forgive such mistakes as long as a movie has an entertaining story to tell. Unfortunately, "Rise of the Undead" has almost no story. In addition, the play is not nice as much as it does not exist. All the actors looked as if they were studying at the Buster Keaton School for Wood Levels. Would it have killed them to show some emotion? (And no, screaming doesn't compare to emotions). The one character who actually had a pizazz was first dismissed. Granted, there was another character who kept my interest briefly. He looked and acted like Kyle McLachlan who channeled Norman Bates, but it was too little, too late. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers forgot a little detail: film is a VISUAL medium. This means that your screens are good enough for the viewer to actually see what's going on. And all those artificial jumping cuts and close-ups could have been cool at the moment, but all they did was watch the movie suddenly and confusingly. There is nothing wrong with telling a story in a simple, clear way - just look at George Romero's low budget "Night of the Living Dead" to see how it is done perfectly. And I know these people have a small budget, but if you don't need the equipment and technicians to make the dialogue audible, then go ahead and make a silent movie (then the Buster Keaton wood faces work.). <br /> <br /> I'll tell the movie: the zombies were creepy. Unlike most zombie films where the dead are shown in all their resolute glory, the better the zombies here were just shocking, bloody people. It actually worked to make them more like us, and therefore scarce. That's why I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1. <br /> <br /> The sad part of this is that despite all its mistakes, "Rise of the Undead" doesn't insult your intelligence. The filmmakers actually wanted to make a clever, scary, original movie, and it was a pity they failed. If they could just leave the fine editing, buy a few extra light bulbs, turn the dialogue on and come up with a real story that is going somewhere, then I think they have the talent to make something really good. <Br /> <br /> Trust me: don't waste your time on "Resurrection of the undead."
