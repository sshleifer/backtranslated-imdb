Stay far away from this movie. The fact that you read reviews tells me that you are already busy with the horror it carries. This is a proud horror movie ... so let's face the problems. Writing and Directing: It would not surprise me if a group of over-active gradechoolers who "scream" and "I know what you did last summer" handled me a lot. GIANT GAPING plot holes are plentiful; While I can't be lucky enough for this movie, it's good to know they're finally potty trained. Actors (or lack thereof): Just the best for this movie ... the best extras ever to grab a screen, now starring in their role-playing role! As an indemnity, I should note that I can look and enjoy almost anything. I recognize a good movie when I see it, but I can still giggle and beg during Bubble Boy (yes, that's true); So when I say something to avoid, I KNOW that I am not sheep.
