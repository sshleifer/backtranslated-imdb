I really don't think producer George Lucas really delayed making such a terrible successor, as "More American Graffiti" seems to be. But in retrospect, it was the first crack in his seemingly impenetrable armor. With the great success of "American Graffiti", which actually played with Star Wars at the same time, this movie was the first Lucas to successfully remove from Coppola without bothering it himself. The result is typical Lucas - much more interesting in terms of its structure and the way it is edited than the actual material. Author / director Bill Norton is allowed to use a variety of different screen relationships and divider screens to produce strange associations in the images. While it is interesting to see ironic composition of the 4 story lines, the style is ultimately only the broken nature of the film itself. <br /> <br /> Lucas's brilliant original movie has all about a group of friends on the archetype "last big night" before school ends and Kurt (Ron Dreyfuss) and Steve (Ron Howard) are supposed to go to college to go. One thing that made that movie work, despite the fact that it is very episodic, is that at the beginning you had the core characters together and they came together again in the end. There is a time frame, as in Nick Ray's "Rebel Without a Cause", where a certain period becomes very elastic and takes on more meaning than what such a specific time really would be in real life, but everything finds its way into " places a static space. "More American Graffiti" is basically the opposite - space is very dynamic, with Toad (Charles Martin Smith) in Vietnam, his former girlfriend Debbie (Candy Clark) involved with hippies in San Francisco, Steve and Laurie (Cindy Williams) student protest in Berkeley, and John Miler (Paul Le Mat) drag racing on the semi-pro circuit. In a confronted meeting early in the film, all the principles are brought together to see John's race, but afterwards the wires are not re-assembled and weave separately as in the original. Instead, they divorce and follow the characters by about 3 years, and just see different events on New Year's Eve appearing in 1967, 68 and 69. It's easy for the audience to get confused and I think it's fair. to say we do it. While the original film condemned important events and rituals of passages in unrealistic theater condoms that experienced nostalgia, even for those who have never experienced the event, this successor draws the few plot points from the original epilogue and strives to make them a coherent film. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is the Candy Clark in SF and Charles Martin Smith in Nam. Some of the jokes fall flat, but the style of those sections is interesting and a neat contrast to each other. A good movie might have been made if these parts were just a little better, and if the other parts were not so sad. Speaking of drag racing, the whole plot with Milner talking to a foreign exchange student was really lame, unfunny, and thrown into Mackenzie Phillips for a cameo, didn't help at all. It was just another pleasant moment, as when they briefly explain why Curt is not in the movie, because he is already in Canada. Instead, Laurie has just another brother who is actually identical to Curt, but has a different name and is now played by a very boring actor. There is a black kind of satire for some of the Vietnamese things, very similar to what I would think Lucas and John Milius's original idea for "Apocalypse Now" would have been. And there are some of those manic pleasures in the San Francisco scenes that made the first movie fun. But still with those fun things, you dragged the rest of the movie, as if someone wanted to see Steve and Laurie argue in their horrible suburban residency as if they were hearing about a Spielberg movie about divorce and childhood. I think even if those parts of the movie were not so painful, it would not really be comparable to the first movie, because there is no closure and no sense to come back together or someone has learned something. It's just an end to the point when they're out of money or something, a cheap freeze-frame simulation of Two-Lane Blacktop and so much better movies. <br /> <br /> Like the original, however, this movie has a good soundtrack of period hits that is probably worth the effort and makes the movie almost palatable. The performances by Country Joe and the Fish are wonderful, and Scott Glenn has emerged as a hippie who fell in love with Candy Clark, a sight to behold. I wonder if he had to use a wig first? I might not have recommended this movie, and yet it has a little love in my heart because I'm so much of the original. Every few decades I think I should try this movie just to make sure it is as worthless as I remember it. It's a party killer, but it's something every fan of "American Graffiti" or George Lucas generally wants to see at least once or twice. It shows how much effort can go into something and it can still be half-baked. It reflects on how much of a miracle it is that Lucas first made such a good movie as 'American Graffiti', as if all the elements were in place and all the appropriate gods were placed. Unfortunately, this was not the case for this movie or for Bill Norton.
