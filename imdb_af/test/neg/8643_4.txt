I rented this movie because I noticed the cover in the video rental shop. I saw Nolte, Connely, Madsen, 40's time setting and thought "hmm, can't be bad." Unfortunately, after watching it, my impression was "not too good". <br /> <br /> Its kind of a Chinatown ripoff, but the worst part is the other than Nolte, the other members of the team don't have enough screen time. But it's a decent movie to watch as I think. And Melanie's role was small enough that she didn't get the chance to be a nuisance.
