Sorry this was an unfortunate excuse for a movie .. a plot line so holey it looks like a block of Swiss cheese and a few characters who seemed to me to be completely without interpersonal relationships. Well, except of course for Carlyle and Lee-Miller I swore, was meant to fall in love. In contrast to the union of Tyler and Miller, which was largely unconvincing, like the rest of the film. Although the end product was unsatisfactory and amusing for all the wrong reasons, the production values ​​were high and earned some recognition but unfortunately the end result was garbage. What was everyone involved in thinking ..? they definitely had to pack this one early.
