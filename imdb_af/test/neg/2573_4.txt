Since I'm not a big Steven Seagal fan, I thought it was a good movie. Obviously, his fans are very dissatisfied with this drama that has an abundance of martial arts and brute force. <br /> <br /> Gailard Sartain plays a self-alleged militia leader in anticipation of the ATF for weapon offenses. He abandoned the intention to release a deadly virus. Seagal is a former CIA agent who has become a land doctor, forcing him to resist the deadly mistake made by a small town. His grandfather's native American herbal remedy is in salvation. <br /> <br /> Noticeable appearances by L.Q. Jones, Camilla Belle and Silas Weir Mitchell. My personal favorite in this movie is Whitney Yellow Robe. She is wonderful and seems to need to take on a more challenging role. <br /> <br /> Despite the far-reaching end, it was a decent movie that could have used much more action.
