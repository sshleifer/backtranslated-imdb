Honestly, Mr. Thalluri .... if you do a drama movie in a high school environment that a lot of teenagers follow through a school day and if you waste the time frame and jump back and forth ... if you It does not allow you to use the exact same "Elephant" storytelling device, which uses a camera that moves from one character to the next and shows scenes 3 times from different angles. You just can't do it because it's such a blunt, it's hard to believe that someone gave it more than a 5 rating. <br /> <br /> Where "Elephant" (released 3 years before this movie) uses school shooting (or shooting the Columbine) as the focal point for his writing 2:37 use teenage suicide and see reviews the shock value of the subject worked. It's the same slow storytelling, very dramatic keyboard music that brings everything to a final you know from the start. At least the characters seem to have tried hard to be somewhat different in that department. So you have an unmarried gay man who looks like a stoner / skater, a brave lover-son who can't handle his gay side, brother and sister of a wealthy family. They both have their own problems and here comes the nose dive. <br /> <br /> You also get a spoiled bulimic chick and one of the most ridiculous characters ever ... a man with medical conditions that weighs his pants because of "2 urethral syndrome" that has never actually heard of the invention of diapers, but rather pester his pants in the classroom and then change into new clothes and do it every time! WOW, as hard as this movie is realistic, it's the most absurd thing I've ever heard. He is beaten on the toilet and is apparently ashamed of it, but does not wipe the blood off his nose if he goes through the whole school with wet pants and a bleeding nose. It's the new century realism that directly leads to the "twist" and final character that seems to be the suicide victim. <br /> <br /> After watching the "very realistic" life of teens (one day included, incest rapids, teenage pregnancy, bulimia, parental pressure for grades and appearance and the gay subject previously mentioned, like yours) very realistic "daily soap ... trying hard to be) we look at a girl we met once in the beginning of this movie and who has no reason but the man she loved loved the room left when she talked to him (in a thought-out piano playing series, has it ever been seen before?). And it gets even better ... before she cut her wrist into a painfully long scene of "Yes" and "No", she asks for 2-urethra guy if he's OK, constantly smiles and then cuts her wrist a scissors in a school toilet. <br /> <br /> Now you have a movie that is a total rip-off from Elephant, failing with some very messy storytelling (the whole rape thing was also pretty incredible) and people call it a shock candle. <br /> <br /> What's the gate to? Is this all it takes to take some pseudo-dramatic music, boring storytelling and the addition of a shock box above and people think there's a big deep message here? I think Elephant is already overestimated, but the movie was the original while it is a clear rip-off here that fails at much more levels. I've never seen a more brazen steal of a whole movie concept in my life ... and believe me I watched hundreds of horror movies, so I know how low you can go there. It's a total deviation in all departments ... it's not realistic, she stole, his damn slow and anyway I wonder how useless ... yet another romantic suicide (many give this point to the movie me wonder if they are just watching Romeo + Juliet these days because there are dozens of movies that deal with the subject in a clear, non-romantic and more realistic way) or this ridiculous set-up. Come! I still try to work out as 2-urethra or the suicide itself is unrealistic and ridiculous.
