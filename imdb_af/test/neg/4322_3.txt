SPOILER AHEAD! The mummy (Lon Chaney Jr.) is running in a college city in New England looking for a college student (Ramsey Ames) who is the reincarnation of his beloved princess Ananka. Moderate, slow (even at 65 minutes - it moves slower than the mummy!), Carelessly acting, but the end is worth waiting for. The mummy gets the girl (!!!!!) and she matures quickly, because the two slowly fall into a swamp. This is (I believe) the only time in a Universal Monster movie that the monster has the girl! Aside from that, it's strictly amateur night. Probably the worst of the mummy persecution - and it says something!
