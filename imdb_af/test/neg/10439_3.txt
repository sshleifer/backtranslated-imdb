In the mid-1800s, Irishman Dennis Hopper (as Daniel Morgan) emigrates to Australia and seeks part of the continent's gold. Instead, Mr. Hopper branded himself and thrown into a terrible prison; there he is gang raped. With release, Hopper joins David Gulpilil (like Billy), with whom he seeks revenge on sadistic Bill Hunter (as Sergeant Smith), Jack Thompson (as Mainwaring's detective) and others. Ultimately, revenge becomes heroism; Hopper is admired and assisted by the common people, and hunted by corrupt and powerful authorities. Hopper's "scarce human" performance certainly fits in with the drained feeling of the movie. Mr. Gulpilil plays a strong supporting role. The staff involved in Mad Dog Morgan not only make it worthwhile, but also a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> *** Mad Dog Morgan (1976) Philippe Mora ~ Dennis Hopper, David Gulpilil, Bill Hunter
