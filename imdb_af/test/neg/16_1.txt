For years I was a big fan of Park's work and 'Old Boy' is one of my everyday favorites. <br /> <br /> With much anticipation, I rented this movie just to find the worst movie. I watched for a while. It's not a proper horror movie; There is no tension and even the "light" part is so lame that I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. <br /> <br /> I launched my younger brother to Chan-Wook Park and got a disappointment. For me, an idolatry has fallen. <br /> <br /> If you loved movies like "Old Boy", the Master & Wife are wasting "revenge" or even his short films on "Three extremes" your time, the movie is not worth it.
