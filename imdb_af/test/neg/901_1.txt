I'm not going to say too much, because this movie is not worth it. To put it simply, the movie has sucked absolutely! It's the worst movie I've ever seen. The storyline was stupid, you couldn't follow what was going on, the characters were so annoying, especially the chief. I wanted someone to kill that child and make him and the movie out of his misery. Very, very bad.
