Cybrog 2: Glass Shadow stars Elias Koteas as Colton Hicks (Rhymes with kick!) A karate instructor who escapes a Cash (Jolie) from Pinwheel, her creators who are trying to explode and destroy a competitive company, helps. On the way, Billy Drago and Karen Shepherd see the duo, while Jack Palance is there to guide the duo. One of the things that is quite shocking about the Cyborg franchise is how the series has managed to have fairly productive and off-beat actors in the film. The original had Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dayle Haddon. (Don't know her? Well, she was in some 70's). These have Jack Palance, Elias Koteas, Billy Drago and Angelina Jolie. The third one has William Katt, Zach Galligan and Malcom McDowell. (Okay, Cyborg 3's cast isn't that impressive.) I've never seen Cyborg 3, but I saw it on the Sci-Fi channel and have to admit that I wasn't impressed. Actually, it ceases, Cyborg 2 is an often sweet movie, it is shot with great style and the visual detail makes it easy to spot. But Cyborg 1 was in the same way, indeed the movie was aimed at some style, slow motion and music that made it all easy to spot. Unfortunately, like the first, this one has no new ideas or something that looks like a plot or texture. Most of the ideas are taken from Blade Runner and Max Headroom, so for many reasons the movie doesn't have much to offer. Another aspect is the terrible play. Karen Shepherd and Billy Drago are absolutely horrible and Angelina Jolie is not much better. Elias Koteas and Jack Palance are doing well, but Palance is seriously playing a cyborg warrior and Koteas is a karate instructor. On the positive side, I can't blame Michael Schroeder for not being ambitious with casting. Still, the movie is dull and I lost interest in the story in fifteen minutes. Also why did they connect with Cyborg anyway? It has nothing to do with its predecessor, who is getting worse than that. <br /> <br /> * from 4- (bad)
