See this movie on a Saturday matinee with a friend. Theater was about 70% full. <br /> <br /> Although there are quite a few funny lines, it is more of a drama / thrill with the upside down humor. Robin Williams gives a decent performance like Laura Linney. As a Daily Show fan, Lewis Black is pretty good at this. Christopher Walken also gives a good performance. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly and remains so for the first thirty minutes, then the tension begins to split and you start to hold the rest of the movie a bit on the edge. Suspension in a suspected comedy movie? I know that I, as well as everyone else in the place, struggles through this. A character will crack a joke during tension season and you will only hear one or two laughs in the theater. <br /> <br /> In all fairness, after the movie was there, there was applause. So, definitely, some people enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a four out of ten because I believe the comedy aspect doesn't work very well in a stress / drama movie and the actors performances, but not bad, were just properly. <br /> <br /> Again, this movie is not what was advertised.
