In the twilight years of his career, Charles Bronson forged long-term partnerships with various directors, especially J. Lee Thompson and Michael Winner. He also did two films for single-time director Peter Hunt - the first being the actual 1981 actor Death Hunt, the second being this indifferent political racer. Murder is pretty boring when the truth is known, and to the end, you will be looking for something with a little more passion and fitting, such as The Wilby Conspiracy (for example, what this image looks like). <br /> <Bronson sleepwalkers through his role as bodyguard Jay Killian, whose mission is to protect the American president's wife, Lara Royce Craig (Jill Ireland, true wife of Bronson). Killian believes Mrs Craig has been targeted by killers; she thinks he is an overprotective, paranoid pessimist. It comes out - surprised, surprised that Killian was right throughout and someone is indeed out to eradicate her. The two go on, pursued by the killers. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows that a US president's wife is known as The First Lady. For some reason they have renamed her "One Mama" in this movie! Whatever the point is, someone's guess, but it points to the movie's senselessness as a whole. Most of the film's performances are lazy, and the screenplay takes a little while to get where it goes. If I had to indicate murder in a particular genre, I'd say it's a "thriller". I would say with a few discussions, but to say that it is a thrill, it has very little excitement.
