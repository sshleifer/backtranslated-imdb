The only reason I watched this little-known Irish movie was whether Mike Myers could play a normal dramatic character. Well, he can and his acting was pretty good, but unfortunately it was probably the only good thing I could say about this movie. In the beginning, the film follows the life of twelve-year-old orphan Mickey who lives with his brother and sister with their somewhat eccentric grandmother. Despite a strong language, it looks like a family movie, but after a while it becomes clear that Pete's Meteor is barely suitable for young drama. And the worst part is that it is a drama with so much ridiculous and even totally indisputable plot. A preliminary story line changes into another and all the time there is not much sense in the events on the screen. I suppose when a life drama needs a meteor or is more that looks even more ridiculous spiritual content, which is a very bad sign. The characters are not much better than a story. Despite all his problems, young Mickey is not at all a nice character, but it is clear that we somehow care for him and even feel very sympathetic to him. It doesn't work. Same thing with other characters. They are mostly as ridiculous as the story itself with the title character (although not the main character) as the only brightest place. By the end of the movie, I had another strong hope that something was out of the likelihood and absurdity. Unfortunately, even though the author of the story is such intentions (and certainly he has) in the film, they are hidden and virtually imperceptible under such a strange writing. <br /> <br /> Degree: 3 out of 10. Those of you interested in seeing Mike Myers as a drama actor can see Pete's Meteor, but the rest of the viewers will probably be bitterly disappointed.
