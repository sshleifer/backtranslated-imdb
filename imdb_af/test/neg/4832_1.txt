It's a cellular rip-off. <br /> <br /> Bad decisive ... <br /> <br /> Bad direction ... <br /> <br /> Bad music ... <br /> <br /> And the list continues ... <br /> <br /> Well, there was no direction as story, scenes and settings were lifted straight from other movies. <br /> <br /> Even battle order is copied. One with the queues of Kill Bill and another with a fire hose was from a Jet Li or Jackie Chan's movie (I can't remember the name of this movie) ... Stay away From this cheap imitation and try to see the right thing ... <br /> <br /> Can't expect something original from any of the Bhatts!
