Shirley Temple's Twentieth Century Fox films are not negligible, as they are poorly made (Darryl F. Zanuck supervised most of them); they do not retain much of a "classic" stature among films, mainly because they are weighed with the syrupy optimism of the Depression era Hollywood. Obedience of the 1930s was bothered by the delight of a thin, often orphaned sunshine girl who made the adults comparable (they frustrated their hands while they were doing away with her problems). Many years later, Temple's vehicles barely see it over (it is always helped by musical sequences to strengthen the content), and its timing (always too perfect) and exaggerated responses make most modern viewers look their eyes. No one can be accused of accusing them of the temple's performance over the Temple's performance (screaming at the top of her lungs) or the perversion of her dance steps, with a crowd of sailors going to "At the Codfish Ball". Yet the fantasy aspect of this particular story, which was previously filmed in the book by Laura E. Richard in 1924, is enough to enchant those in the real sacrament spirit. Looks like Shirl has been pulled out of a shipwreck by a state-run lighthouse, but if a solid state council officer finds out that the fabric is not at school, she threatens to take the child away. It doesn't matter if the polluter has a point that the temple is not being properly raised (the woman is almost immediately changed into the proverbial villain); One can immediately see that the Temple can occupy itself, take care of herself and her elderly guardian (as well as the local widow who has her brackets for the captain). Temple is not the only one to rehearse; Guy Kibbee's January was chosen for wide-eyed reactions. So often you wonder or maybe as if he didn't even record them in one movie one day. The dialogue is disturbed in the waterfront metaphors ("You can't hurry a trout!" ... Well, don't give up the ship!) And something about the whole business looks strangely pixilated. ** of *** *
