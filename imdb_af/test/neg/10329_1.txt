This movie is # 1 in the list of the worst movies I've ever seen, with "Lessons for a Assassin" on the # 2 spot. <br /> <br /> The play is common (sorry, Sandra Bullock, but even your performance was terrible!), the music party could have come from a bad x-rated movie and the story was ridiculous. It has this in common with a typical action movie: the dialogues were short and consist mainly of one syllable. But unlike the average action movie, there was no real action in this one. Boring. <br /> <br /> The only reason I kept watching was in the hope that there would be at least one interesting scene in this movie at one stage ... <br /> <br /> Thumbs up on this one .
