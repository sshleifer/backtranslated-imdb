I look at this horrible movie as we speak. It is probably one of the worst movies ever broadcast in my home. I sit here with 3 friends and they agree. it is not scary. It's not funny. it is not dramatic. it contains nothing appellant whatsoever. we are 49 minutes in the movie. we only saw 2 insects. only one person is dead. this movie is a great letdown. nothing about this terrible, horrible movie showed me. I'm going to hang a movie. I hope everyone who has something to do with making this movie dies. I don't just mean the actors. I mean the director, producers, the presidents of the studio who funded this movie. it is the worst movie ever. It should make IMDb's worst 100 movies of all time. at number 1.
