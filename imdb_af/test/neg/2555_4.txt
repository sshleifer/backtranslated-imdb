I couldn't stand the woman the mother played. I wanted her to lock up. She had a bizarre way of talking and the lines she was given to read didn't make it any better. I had no idea why the men of the town went with her to cause all these problems, except that they were the only woman who was more than ten and less than sixty in a town that was populated by men. Even after a terrible tragedy, her voice was without human emotion, she had no ability to understand the events of her life. She delivered her lines with the same emotion, or she said, "I love you", "I hate you", "the bank is exclusion", "my dress is on fire." Was it actually filmed in Ireland? The sun was blowing through the movie and the characters were surprised by a rain bath during the harvest. I lived in Ireland during the summer of 2002, the wettest summer in a century. Most are still harvested. If the farmers in Ireland could only harvest during long dry regions, the country would have been hungry hundreds of years ago. There didn't seem to be much money to make the movie. The black and white flashbacks seemed to be filmed with the security cameras one can get at Sam's club.
