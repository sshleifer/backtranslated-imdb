This film is only striking in its banality and the use of clich√©s. Unfortunately, it was clear to the end. But do not be wrong to think that it has ended strongly. Just a little bit unexpected, though nothing is worth looking at. <br /> <br /> Of the taciturn and the unfair hero, the Germanic bad, to the best team, the characters were completely wood and obvious. The two FBI agents Smith and Wesson (thoughts?) Have hoped for humor, but it didn't come to anything. <br /> <br /> I'm a great science fiction fan, but it's hard to find any redeeming quality in this movie. . A turkey! <br /> <br />
