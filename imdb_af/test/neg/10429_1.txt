Any film school student could have made a movie 1000 times better than a rubbish bin. As someone reading the book, I expected even a straight repetition of the book to make it a fair movie. There was a chance that a talented director could go beyond Woodward's story and make a good movie. <br /> <br /> Well, the director went beyond Woodward's story. He added a hip-Spanish angel called Velasquez who was not in the book. He interviewed Bob Woodward with the dead Belushi in a mortuary. The film had the insight of someone who was stoned on PCP and stared at his navel. <br /> <br /> If it's a devastator for you, you'll thank me for it because it's absolutely the worst movie ever made.
