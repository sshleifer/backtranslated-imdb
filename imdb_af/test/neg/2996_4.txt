I was the biggest movie of this film, and I am the one who usually understands the works of such mysterious films as David Lynch (Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me) and Darren Aronofsky (Pi). Not to say that Northfork doesn't make sense at some level, it just doesn't combine to form a completely coherent film. As time goes by the movie, its themes and intentions become clearer, but during my initial viewing, I was really ashamed, and I find this the big mistake of the movie ... its lack of direction. The plot is centered in the town of Northfork, Montana in the year 1955. The town is empty and will soon be flooded to make way for the creation of a hydroelectric dam. The biggest problem is that not all residents are prepared to evacuate and move. A group of men are hired to disappear the remaining residents from the village before they are drowned, and mostly succeed in some strange situations and townspeople. At the same time, the film tells the story of Irwin, a very sick young boy (or is he a fallen angel?) Whose adopted parents return to the Northfork orphanage for his illness due to his illness. Father Harlan (Nick Nolte) cares for the dying Irwin, but Irwin suggests whether there are a group of angels (including Daryl Hannah and Anthony Edwards) in the deserted and empty village looking for a fallen angel. Irwin has scars on his back and on his head, and he tries to convince the angels that she is scars where people have amputated his wings and halo. Oh, and in this all there is a strange surrealistic animal on silence moving across the backdrop of the landscape. There are many other small events taking place in the movie, but none of them is much more than short-lived plot. One can appreciate the artistic quality of the film (obviously the filmmakers have looked deeply at this movie) and its rich cinematography, but the film is still trying to be too different and then ending and making end up without much of a statement. As I wrote earlier, it became clear, long after I watched, which may have been in the movie. Irwin dies, and so is Northfork, and in dealing with his own loss and death Irwin probably created characters from ideas he gets from the objects surrounding him at the orphanage to comfort him as he leaves and his life approaching its end. But then again, maybe he's really an angel, and he has found his kind and can come home now. I must emphasize that there are some wonderful moments in the film, heartbreaking, bright and lonely and sad. Unfortunately, the movie ends up as a whole just disconnecting and somehow incomplete.
