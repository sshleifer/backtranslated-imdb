The price of a dream - and a few dreams can be too expensive. <br /> <br /> Only the English translation looked might be the reason for a low rating of this viewer. <br /> <br /> This made the overall movie poorer than the story material that came with ... <br /> <br /> ... and other comments suggest that the caption version would be better. <br /> <br /> However, some plotting elements have remained inexplicable and have an unfinished feel. <br /> <br /> It also leaves the thought "is there a series to follow?". <br /> <br /> Sorry there was no more (at this stage, at least, anyway).
