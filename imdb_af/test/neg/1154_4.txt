Most likely, "Cleopatra 2525" would be of little interest if you didn't watch the series when it was broadcast; and I don't think many people did. But if you're still a bit busy, it's a "Buck Rogers in the 25th century" without space ships and with no wardrobe or production budget. <br /> <br /> In this case, the Buck Rogers section (Cleopatra) is played by Jennifer Sky. Which one can expect to be a good thing, because Jennifer is very beautiful and quite talented; and has a good comic touch. But a quick look at the promotional material will show that she is a bit worse for a bad hairstyle and a Salvation Army Thrift Store wardrobe. Remembering how she was Jennifer during her time at Xena, her dull Cleopatra look was a great disappointment. With a target audience of "teens who want to burn their eyeball, look at" hot fetish-pleasing girls ", it is not a good idea to mock the exploitation of your heroine or her costume, and they wonder why some series Don't Like a Audience Keep it or hate it, "Buck Rogers" has warmer costumes and much better guest stars. <br /> <br /> The other two exploiters are Cleopatra's two female collaborators; Hel (Gina Torres basically playing her "Firefly" character) and Sarge (Victoria Pratt another Xena junction - a very wooden version of Natasha Henstridge) Torres does a good job of playing the Cleopatra character, most of them Shows Comic Enlightenment. /> <br /> Torres sings the theme song, a somewhat lame parody of Rick Evans 'In 2525 (Exordium and Terminus)' (1969). In the year 2525, If man still lives, if the woman can survive, they can find ... "I suspect that they didn t give him a series of titles so they could beat this tiny little song, although they know, maybe the title is a tribute to Buck Rogers, and they thought to use the song later. <br /> <br /> So, the premise of the show is that the Earth's surface has been taken over by strangers called Bailies (not the WCRP) and the people are underground. Our three heroines are fighting the bail towards an intact (supposedly) female voice (called "Voice"). Unlike Buck Rogers, Cleopatra is kind of a wimpy third stooge, still dazed and confused by her cryogenic sleep or perhaps just disoriented from the creepy haircut. There are many beautiful close-ups of Sky wide eyes and confused. Like 'Buck Rogers', the running ghost is Cleopatra with a general expression of the 21st century, and everyone finds it completely deep or completely astonished. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Firefly", the action is more of that hyper-edited Xena garbage that is neither realistic nor particularly entertaining. A good smile is that the girls move around in a "Spiderman" fashion, a kind of web that tunnels and shafts in the labyrinth of their underground world. <br /> <br /> Strange (or maybe not considering the budget), it's only half an hour episodes and except for one two-part show, there's not enough time for any subtlety and nuances. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
