Everything that this movie is trying to do is better done - and excellent in "Run Lola Run". The Red Haired Hip Cutie, the critical deadline (s) at risk, and the "Crime pay-at-times" message. BUT, unlike "Lola", it just isn't credible or well constructed. It's a bother that worked for me when I saw it in front of "Lola" - but it looks in comparison. Yes! The Falling Beetle was nice! But it was about the only surprise in the movie. Do yourself a favor and see the Real McCoy - (and the REAL hip Red Head!) - in Run Lola Run!
