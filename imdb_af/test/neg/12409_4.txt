"Ashes of Time" was a diligent project but eventually became a pretentious movie. This film is a great example of how to tell a simple story in a complex way. The plot of "Ashes of Time" is fairly simple and comes down to two words: "love triangle". Because of those "love triangles" that cross stories, jealousy, hatred, and love, the main dynamics are displayed by the characters. The story is seen by Ou-yang Feng's eyes (Leslie Cheung). Old Yang Feng lives in the desert, where he acts as a middleman for various swordsmen and becomes the instrument of Destiny through which revenge is obtained. Unfortunately, "Ashes of Time" fails to tell these simple stories of love and hatred. Wong Kar-wai has driven himself by a desire to make every frame of the film a painting and an aesthetic experience. In fact, besides the decisive of beautiful actors (men and women), everything else is a failure in this movie. Dialogs are minimalist and not at all original. The quality of the picture is very uneven. The editing is one of the worst things I have ever seen in the swordplay genre and ultimately the scarce sword battle is very confusing and unattractive. Even the effort to build artistic scenes is not always achieved: the erotic "women on a horse" scene is ridiculous, not erotic and useless. Wong Kar-wai wanted to deliver 100 minutes of pure aesthetic experience and forgot about a movie about how to tell a plot. By forgetting that he is delivering an uncomfortable film that does not even reach his artistic goal.
