It can hardly be called a good movie, actually it is not even close. But I have to say that there were a few things that made me. Don't laugh, not giggle, but something. The Resovoir Dogs parody was one of them. The rest is not important enough to be remembered. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was a little disappointed about this movie. The plot sounds like an idea, but it fell to the ground quickly. The whole thing was just messy and the actors where it wasn't good for the characters; most of them just transferred. There were also many unessecary rows, which was a total waste of film. I realize that it will make the movie shorter about 20 minutes, but it will only improve. <br /> <br /> Now, with the good and the bad things set up, we come to the conclusion: two out of six toilet seats for this one.
