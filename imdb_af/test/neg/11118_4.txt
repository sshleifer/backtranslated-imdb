Without John Rhys-Davies, I have to admit that it will never register on my movie meter. But in spite of that single fact, it's not a bad little excitement, seen the low budget, the low quality effects, the rigid and the Sci Fi Channel aspects. The blood effects are very convincing, and the Chupacabra actually looks realistic ... no matter what you think a Chupacabra looks like is a beautiful Chupacabra. <br /> <br /> Apart from the positives, these runs are kind of like Kolchak: The Nagstalker (Darren McGavin, remember?) meets the Love Boat, but despite the ultimate cheese of this work, it still holds something that looks like a plot and tries to get your respect while letting you laugh and roll your eyes. <br /> <br /> Unlike this work, I still managed to find some pleasure. Maybe you will too. <br /> <br /> This is a 5.2 / 10 on the Made 4 TV Scale. <br /> <br /> It's a 4.1 / 10 on the movie scale of ... <br /> <br /> the enemy :.
