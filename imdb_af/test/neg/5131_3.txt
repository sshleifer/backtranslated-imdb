Of course, this movie had good intentions. In the end, there is a commitment to someone named Kellie who, as a viewer, can only assume she is in a situation similar to the one depicting the film. Maybe she made the "wrong" choice. That dedication is the only redeeming quality of love and suicide. <br /> <br /> The movie becomes unbearable from the opening sequence. As soon as the viewer is already irritated in the movie for about five minutes, it actually goes downhill downhill ... what it was. I know the film was low budget and the camera shots were actually pretty good. Unfortunately everything else was terrible. The acting, the plot, the sound quality, the image quality ... the acting. I'm sorry, but the acting is terrible. Except terrible. It's as if the actors are trying to act like people acting. That's the only way I can think of describing it. As I watched, I actually depicted the script with the stage in my mind. Of course, none of the movements were matched to any of the characters' reactions. In short, the timing is AWAY. The timing of the whole movie is far away. I'm not a director, so I know the limits of my knowledge, but I really feel there was a way to give time over ... until they explained that the graduation was not too far away , I was under the impression that the first part of the movie took place over a week ... a month. <br /> <br /> All that is said is really a shame. This movie might have been strong with a little tweaking. All the moments in the movie in which we have to feel something are obvious, but just because the setup is obvious (it's a bad thing). The moving scenes have become completely flat. For example, when Kaye's brother takes his hat off his head and puts it on hair, we must feel the understanding he has for her, the innocence and the protection of her brother's love ... somehow it comes just not down way. There are so many more scenes like this (for example: ALL the battle scenes) and all they do is away from the movie. All these things come together, Love and Suicide come down as one long, cute, low-budget commercial.
