The initiation to the local sports team involves newcomers going to the wheat fields and guessing what? There is a scarecrow killing people there. Only one of the newbies survives, but falls into a coma due to diabetes. Meanwhile, the scarecrow begins to kill all the people involved, one by one. What is that scarecrow secret? Will they find out before the scarecrow gets them all? It's a low budget movie and it shows. Sound is OK, but picture is really corny. The plot / script really sucks and is rather pathetic and not logical. The acting is really bad and sometimes just laughing. Can't really say much about the special effects because there aren't many, but the few there range from bad to OK (for a low budget that is). There is a little nudity and it's probably the only thing worth watching in the movie (it's if you hit a horny teen, if not the movie all together). Another complete waste of time and money doesn't see it. Also go for hack'n'slash fans.
