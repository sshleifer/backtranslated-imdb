Tom will soon be in a delicious Jerry sandwich when a giant prey comes down and flies with his bite fly. He is not happy with the fact that his sarnie was stolen right under his nose, and Tom took him in pursuit and was determined to get his mouse cake. <br /> <br /> As much as I like Tom and Jerry, I must say that this one is a bit of a stinker: the story is rather mundane; it presents a poorly conceivable peripheral character that does not have charm; and it flog the old man dressed up the cartoon character as a woman's gag until death. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Flirty Birdy is the rival 'Fraidy Cat' and 'Mouse in Manhattan' for the title of worst tom and jerry caper so far.
