Zoey 101 is such a stupid show. I don't know if that's because the snooty Jamie Lynn Spears is or isn't the prize star, but I just know the show sucks. It's about a girl and her brother going to a residence. The jokes in this show are extremely boring and unique, and I hate every character except Chase and Lola. The jokes on this show are so unique that they make Jack Black look like Monty Python. This show is without a doubt one of the worst performances on Nickelodeon, it's right there with Avatar and Danny Phantom in the pit of shame. if this show was a person of any honor, it would be disgraceful. <br /> <br /> 1/10
