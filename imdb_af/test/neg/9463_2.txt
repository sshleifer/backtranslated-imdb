I know this movie is a low-budget horror movie meant for those who are in favor of shocks and "cheap" gore, but even if considered, this movie is just too boring, filled with an incoherent plot, along with terrible music and clear signs. that this movie was never finished. <br /> <br /> Without giving up, I'll just say at the final rinse that things are not being explored, either by movie or narration. The girl Anitra is really attractive, yet it is not a good reason to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the 60's and 70's Gore movies, you should see it, but be warned that it doesn't even come to the usual plateau of these movies.
