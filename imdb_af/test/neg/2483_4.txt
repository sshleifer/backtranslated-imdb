This show had a promising start as opposed to 'Oceans 11', but evolved into a plain show of T&A. Actually, this is the only good part of the show, my little brother. <br /> <br /> The first season was by far the best, it was new and interesting things just went down afterwards. The only point of salvation for this show is JamesCaan, the other actors lack luster. The characters have depth and seem to be selfish and generally non-sweet. <br /> <br /> To quote a friend, "Las Vegas is like Baywaych in a Casino." According to me, Baywatch was so spacious and more realistic.
