This movie is really a sorry excuse for making movies. The pacing is poor, the budget should be depressed low, and the acting rate is night (that is, except Bela Lugosi). The sound at this time is also terrible, with so much extra noise in the background that it sounded to me as if a ray was for the whole movie. If these things bother you, you shouldn't see this movie. <br /> <br /> If you come here, you'll find that the idea behind the movie is very good. A German plastic surgeon (Bela Lugosi) was hired by the Japanese to work on various Japanese agents and transform them into the parables of upcoming US businessmen who kidnapped and killed the Japanese. After completing his work, he was betrayed by the Japanese and thrown into jail. He later escapes and travels to America to take revenge on his patients through a series of highly publicized murders. <br /> <br /> It was as if Bela Lugosi was the only decent actor in the film and to be honest, the rest of the actors were completely oblivious and stodgy. The leading actress eventually became boring and stereotypical, while the police officer assigned her case, was the general, chauvinistic and always correct dominant male found in many films of this period. <br /> <br /> I also found that camera work was completely uninspired, and often took exactly the same angles of exactly the same rooms. After a while, it tends to drag the movie, and it sets a very slow pace for the "action" that in any case does not exist. <br /> <br /> For me, the idea is a fascinating one, and with a better writer, director, script, equipment and actor, it can be a great movie. Unfortunately, these disabilities keep the movie back, and I can't recommend it to anyone, but the most open to movie lovers.
