It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I could barely stay awake. The acting and the plot were terrible. I like B movies, but this movie has nothing that can leave me or think. OK, there were two or three funny moments at the beginning, so I have to give this movie 2 out of 10. If you really want to see it, look at the first 10 minutes. Then you will be more and more disappointed while the movie is running.
