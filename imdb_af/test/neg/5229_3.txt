This film is based on a Stephen King novel in which the mysterious new retailer Leland Gaunt (Max Von Sydow) every citizen of Castle Rock desires the item he or she most desires - but there is a heavy price paid for these transactions must be. Local Sheriff Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris) will soon be forced to handle a variety of brutal deaths and suspicious circumstances. <br /> <br /> Below average for Stephen King theater: I can see why some people think it's boring. It plows without giving real fright and forces the viewer to spend time (again) with a bunch of repulsive losers whose hate is spooky. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the novel and don't believe this dark movie makes it fair. There are too many unfortunate changes from book to screen. <br /> <br /> Von Sydow makes Gaunt very charming. We must have been at the right times of Gaunt, not amused by him. I also hate that the sheriff's primary deputy (Ray McKinnon) is written and portrayed as such an annoying, Barney Fife-type moron. Star Ed Harris seems to be forced to do this photo through his agent, but professionally he is, he really throws his teeth into his dialogue. Bonnie Bedelia (such as Pangborn's love interest Polly) and Amanda Plummer (in one of her standard mentally unbalanced roles) come closest to creating fun characters. <br /> <br /> It's also dirty and mean. <br /> <br /> Although I am not aware of a bit of cathartic feeling, a lot of unlikely movie characters look at each other. The climax has some good explosions. <br /> <br /> I often give movies a better score than they probably deserve, but in this case I feel I should really be honest and just say: 3/10.
