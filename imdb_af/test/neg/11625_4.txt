When I was a little girl, I absolutely worshiped the Swan Princess. It revived the same fairy tales of Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella. The princess and her prince who save the day are always a timeless story that will never die, well, hopefully. But I figured I'd watch the sequels for The Swan Princess to see how they were and unfortunately it's the typical cartoon sequel just entertaining. The only character I still found very amusing was the Queen, she was very funny in this movie and the best part. But with the voice changing, they were noticeable and I was a bit bothered, I didn't want to be picky, but it was too strange for me. The story is also more or less borrowed from the first Swan Princess, but the villain in this movie follows Rothbart's footsteps. Odette and Derek are about to celebrate their one year anniversary, but Derek was also fighting for his kingdom to keep it safe. His mother's birthday also comes, he forgets about it, because there is a new villain in the town, Clavious, who hopes to go above and beyond where Rothbart's powers went and kidnapped the Queen on her birthday. But Odette had to change back into her swan to help Derek fight him and save his mother. <br /> <br /> Of course, the Swan Princess 2 is more than good for the kids, it never gives me that, it's good fun for them. However, the reason why these successors are disappointing is that it is usually only for the children, it is the audience they are striving for, but it is nicer when the jokes and stories can be enjoyed by everyone. Now there are a few laughs and giggles here and there, but it wasn't so clever in my opinion for the first Swan princess. I would recommend it to the little ones, but if you are looking for a fun cartoon movie, I would recommend staying with the first Swan Princess. <br /> <br /> 4/10
