I'm used to patience with movies, because I usually found it usually paid. But a few works take tedium to new levels and enter the field of provocation .... "Last year at Marienbad" comes into consideration. Well, "Pola X" is not "Last Year at Marienbad". I can count on the number of movies I have walked out over the years. "Pola X" achieved membership in that August group. In my defense, I believe I have made a brave effort to stand my ground - hoping things will be reversed. However, I eventually threw the towel, but only ashamed of the 90-minute point - properly respected under the circumstances. "Pola X" doesn't come close to the promise of Carax's previous work. After a 10-year hiatus, it must indeed be bitter to him. Melville is still in his grave!
