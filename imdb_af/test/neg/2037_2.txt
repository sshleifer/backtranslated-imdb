I had nothing to do before going out one night, so I didn't want to see anything, I chose the perfect movie. It must have been a gift to Barrymore from someone she slept with, director Raja Gosnell has made nothing but folly and the writing on this one is just horrific. In which high school can you register without a parent meeting and no proof of age or previous schooling? They all brought the kids to the prom, without shirts, in empty fields, shorts and one girl was dressed while Eva only wore fig leaves? She announces that she is 25 and her brother is 23, but there is no retaliation of the school, parents or lawsuits of any kind against the fraud or spying newspaper? The newspaper boss wants to educate the teacher in a minor sex scandal, but does not realize that the teacher comes at a 25-year-old. Do they allow a camera and engage in private conversations with underage children? I wonder if I hired my younger sister to go back to HS with a camera on her and filmed under age girls for my staff use, I won't be in a kind of trouble? NAHHHH No problem. Didn't she need a gym or go to the bathroom at some point? The secondary characters in this were like cardboard cuttings of what high school students are and everyone was a stereotype. Jessica Alba is just embarrassing in this assault for the camera at every chance. In what world are parents not suspicious, when their beloved daughter is wonderfully asked by the school attendance to the prom? And they don't ask the man to meet him like any other parent in history. If a guy in my school or any other school knelt for that matter to my sister and put her eggs in her dress, he would have been in a body for the rest of his life. This movie is so confronted and predictable, it is deceptive, and why is it all (including the Alpo girls) who cried for this chick when they hated two days before they hated? ???? <br /> <br /> DUMB, DUMB AND Dumb.
