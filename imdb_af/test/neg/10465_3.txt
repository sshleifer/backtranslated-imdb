All I can do is laugh. Wow. I like Jim Wynorski's movies, I really do. I mean, Chopping Mall is a classic. But what happened to this man? He used to make funny horror movies, which tried to be good. But it was hardly even funny. I mean, I think it was because I laughed. The villain is incredible. I mean, horrible CGI. It looks ... terrible. And the movie has no gore, and no nudity as redeeming features. It's rated PG-13. A movie called "Bone Eater" that you know won't be a blockbuster movie, you know it probably won't have a clever script. A movie like this can rely on gore ... but no. It doesn't trust anything, it's just ... crap. Check it out if you want to laugh. But don't expect a good movie. I hope Jim Wynorski goes back to movies like Chopping Mall and Ghoulies IV because it and Komodo Vs. Cobra doesn't cut it.
