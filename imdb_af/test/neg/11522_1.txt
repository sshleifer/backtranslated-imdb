Rent this tonite from my local video store. This was titled "Black Horizon." I think somebody felt it was good enough for a 2004 release ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Micheal Dudikoff is not a ninja in this movie, one of the biggest mistakes of this movie right from the movie. bat. Another big mistake would be that Ice-t's action scenes from other movies are stolen, especially the first scene of his rescue, edited directly by the Wesley Snipes movie "The Art of War" with Ice-T. I hope they pay for that footage. <br /> <br /> The plot is terrible, the special effects put little effort into them (love the threads they hold in space), the acting is wood (also like the New York / Russian accent) . Ice-T in the movie is useless. These guys also forgot that there was no gravity in space, but I think they are not worried about it. <br /> <br /> Micheal Dudikoff has to go back to doing what he is good at making American Ninja 6.
