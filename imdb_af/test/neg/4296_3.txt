Have a chance to see if maybe a very good WWI movie slipped my notice - it's not like that. John Phillip Law and Don Stroud are both stiff in their actions and mishaps for their roles. The dialogue is stupid or non-existent; the flying rows are good but fairly repetitive. Compared to the awesome "Blue Max" this movie should never be made. Look at George Peppard, James Mason and Usula Andress in the BM and you get why that movie is one of the best war movies ever made and that's not. Recently released on DVD Richtofen and Brown being presented as a great "lost classic" from the 70's, I sold myself the rest of the day after buying it. Don't waste your time or $.
