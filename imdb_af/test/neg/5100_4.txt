River Queen, in less than two hours, attempts to embrace a complicated, winding, historical narrative. There are some spectacular scenes and the Wanganui landscape is beautifully captured. However, the film suffered from some poor leaders - Samantha Morton (Sarah) was particularly convincing. There was a shamelessness about how the role should be played - as a helpless waif used by fate or as a strong, determined character with a clear image of her destiny. Kiefer Sutherland's character - Private Doyle - was pointless and for the most part - incomprehensible. Keifer's Irish brogue needs some polishing. On the other hand, Cliff Curtis, Temuera Morrison and Rawiri Pene (as Sarah's son "Boy") was well-rounded and credible. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of the river queen generally compressed and raced. It seemed as if they had decided to tie all the loose points before 120 minutes. Eg How on earth did Wiremu know how to find Sarah and Doyle? No explanation and very unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> I went to this movie with an open mind. I didn't read or hear much, except for his turbulent production. What I experienced was a mish mash of New Zealand history, beautifully photographed, but ultimately disappointing.
