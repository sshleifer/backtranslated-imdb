I love the underestimated character Laura Linney played in 'Love Actually', and she is very good at 'Man of the Year'. <br /> <br /> But wow. Robin Williams didn't give much of a show, with a few minor exceptions. Laura Linney may not be mistaken, but the editing raped her character, or it was just a sad performance by director Barry Levinson. <br /> <br /> And I think it was Barry Levinson who grew old. So many poor performances, such uneven results, should be management's fault. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum play major roles in supporting roles. Goldblum plays a sinister side with joy, and Walken's combination of entertainer's manager and commentator for the movie is great. <br /> <br /> But the story is clich√©, the look looks like a very good picture, and too much action is half-hearted. The pacing, story and direction are all bad compared to, says 'Head Office' (spoof of 'Secret of my success').
