Loos based on novels by Earl Derr Biggers, the Charlie Chan series of the 20th century Fox was an audience favorite - but when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the studio would turn feared audiences against his Asian hero. It was an error estimate: actor Sidney Toler played the role in Monogram Studios, "driving poverty," where he continued to portray the character in eleven more films made between 1944 and his death in 1947. <br /> <br /> Twentieth century Fox considered the Chan movies as affordable "B" movies, but the studio paid a lot of attention. The plots were often stupid, but the pace was sharp, the dialogue was greasy and the roles (such as Bela Lugosi and Ray Milland) were always knowledgeable. The result was a friendly charm that stood the test of time. Monogram was another matter: Chan films were "B" movies simple and simple. Little caution was taken with scripts or castings and the resulting films were at best flat, mediocre, virtually unshakable. <br /> <br /> Thanks to accessories and some interesting plot devices, the SHANGHAI COBRA is one of the best of the Monogram-made Chan movies - yet it is hard to achieve a consistent mediocrity. In this special entry, Chan (Sidney Toler) is requested to investigate a killer who kills with what appears to be a cobra-like bite; At the same time, he decides to make sure that a government's supply of radium is kept in a safe deposit box, from all places, safely. Should these two seemingly unrelated plot lines come together? Well ... can be! Sidney Toler is always pleasant as Chan, but most of his Monogram performances were "phoned" - and so is COBRA's as it is of any Monogram Chan movie. As usual, the enjoyable artist is Mantan Mooreland. Changing times have led us to see Moreland's brand of comedy as deviant to African Americans, but he was a knowledgeable actor and comic and within the context of what was possible for a black actor in the 1940s, she did work a great charm and innocence. <br /> <br /> Fans of the 20th-century Fox series will likely find Monogram's Chan a significant disappointment, and newcomers who love the Monogram movies will probably consider them the third rate after meeting the Fox movies . Like other Monogram Chan films, the SHANGHAI COBRA is the best remaining collectors. Four stars, and it's generous. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
