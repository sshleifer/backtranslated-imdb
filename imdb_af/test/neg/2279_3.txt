Director / screenwriter Allan Burns seems to be sticking together two different scripts before coming to this little outing: a comedy about infidelity and a melodrama about loss and sabotage. This leads to a wincingly unfunny movie. Christine Lahti plays a crass, cynical TV news reporter who makes friends with aerobics instructor Mary Tyler Moore and soon eats with Moore and her family. Just to discover Maria's husband (Ted Danson) is Lahti's secret relationship! Burns has a strange, stop-and-start rhythm for his dialogue, which is neither realistic nor effective (just getting increasingly annoying because nothing is important). Rail-thin Moore, who looks terribly weak in her leotard, has a radiant smile, but not convinced of Danson's wife, and Danson gets stuck with a clever, ungrateful role (he's just there to be a caddy ). The film aims to cover all the bases in a classic case of handing over (the role of the woman in the workplace, the TV news magazine, the fraudster family, the working woman and mother who wants more, a woman's need for female friendships, et al, but nothing is essential from these ideas, as Burns only half-heartedly investigates the issues. As a writer, he is surprisingly free of punchlines, but is also without purpose and the heavy plot is only followed up. * 1/2 of ****
