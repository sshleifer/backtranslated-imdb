The opening of "The Jungle" promises us a safari adventure with a science fiction element, but mostly what we get is a travel book with lots of stock and stuff (and the strange leopard attack). The movie is quiet when you want to grab it, and try to inject interest in the proceedings with poorly-advanced games between different wildlife (I didn't know that lions and wild pigs were natural enemies in nature, you thought ? The big cats laughed at herbivores, but the producers apparently knew better). <br /> <br /> As for the actors: Cesar does his usual big job slamming the mustache, and Marie Windsor is pretty credible as the daughter of progressive thinking rajah (nice eyebrows, btw!). However, Rod Cameron is barely vigilant when the hunter returns as the only survivor of his expedition. I'm sure he was in question in his day, but here he comes down as a Rent-A-Center Bogart: look rough, but with none of Bogey's series or timing. He spends the movie back and forth from Stoic anger after fierce stoicism. And every time the script tries to renovate some romantic sparks between itself and Windsor, you just laugh. The scratched, lumpy face is not a good vehicle for tenderness. <br /> <br /> The script isn't quite without merit, though it makes some strange choices. Early in the first play, the screenplay makes a point of spending several moments where the heroes decide to bring the compulsory smart young boy and monkey mascot together, but basically ignore them to *** SPOILER *** the monkey on one way or another, a living hand grenade is found during the mammoth scene and happens to be near Windsor. It is so that Cameron can prove his bravery by diving and saving her life at his own expense. *** END SPOILER. It is possible that the Indian version of this movie (which I understood better than 2 1/2 hours ran) could possibly give the child and the monkey more. <br /> <br /> Another thing that shows the performance of the movie. ** SPOILER ** is the issue of the woolly mammoth (the plot device that moves the safari in the first place). When they finally appear, the way the scene is filmed is clearly that the "mammoth" (of course elephants draped in a shag carpet) doesn't really attack anyone, or even move so fast, yet Cameron immediately up trying to erase them with hand grenades. Today, the idea of ​​destroying the last known specimens of an extinct species is unthinkable, especially if everything they look is through the jungle in a fun pace. *** END OF SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> So IMO, four stars, which is pretty good for a Robert Lippert production (usually Lippert-hack work is his best two or three stars) . It's not a train wreck of a movie or something; plus, it looks good with the rajah's daughter, who claims that the most repressive aspect of the "traditional ways" and the elements of mixed breeds that were properly progressive in 1952. And there is a beautiful scenery and exotic spectacle. See if anyone offers it for free, but don't expect much, except for an interesting historical chapter of the early fantasy theater.
