I checked it free at the library, and I still feel ripped off. Yes, Sandra Bullock is actually there, but only in five scenes up to barely 5 minutes, and even it's pretty painful to watch. The rest of the movie is so bad you will spend most of the time hoping it will end soon, but only if you are one of the people who have to complete a movie when they start it. Everyone else will just shut it down. Don't worry, you won't miss anything. Bullock's lines (assuming you looked at it because her name was plastered), it's just parroting other characters, like this dialogue: <br /> <br /> Lisa (Bullock) - "Danny, please tell me what's going on. "<br /> <br /> Danny -" I don't know. "<br /> <br /> Lisa -" Whaddaya means you don't know? " <br /> <br /> Danny - "I don't know - it's something to do with my dad." <br /> <br /> Lisa - "Whaddaya means your Dad?" <br /> <br /> Danny - "I don't know - he's excited or something." <br /> <br /> Lisa - "Why am I here?" <br /> <br /> Danny - "I'm sorry Lisa. I don't know." <br /> <br /> (moments later) Danny - a few hosts of my dad ... <br /> <br /> Lisa - "Whaddaya means army friends?" <br /> <br /> See what I mean? <br /> <br /> Bottom line - Don't say no.
