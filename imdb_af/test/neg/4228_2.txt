This French film is thought to be of a creepy, dull man investigating the rape and murder of a young girl in a small town. However, the film is really nothing and it takes forever to say nothing. If it takes ten minutes to walk from point A to point B, the movie spends 10 minutes showing this step, and that is the "action" scene. There are also static shots that last for a few minutes, which the viewer wonders if he accidentally hits the pause button on the remote. The script has enough material for a 20-minute movie. The movie lasts seven hours or so. You do the math. The actors were apparently amateurs and show it. Note for self: never see a Dumont movie again.
