This photo hit the scenes on June 6, 1980, with Stephen Macht as Sergeant Thor, Avery Schreiber as Captain Comelius Butt, J.D. Hinton as Buzz and this year's lead actor Dorothy Stratton. The picture begins with the roaming space of the police's infinity, looking for criminals. Suddenly an unknown spacecraft is attacked. Bring Sergeant Thor and his partner Buzz as they try to find out who the unknown ship is. If they don't work, they call Captain Comelius to instruct his crew to fight back. Start beautiful Dorothy Stratton, who plays the role of Galaxina, who plays man-made robot. A few thoughts on this photo. This movie was stupid and that is one of the reasons why I'm not in Sci-Fi. If you are in Sci-Fi, you will notice that the laser sound effects of an early Sci-fi movie entitled Battlestar Galactica, broadcast in the theaters in 1978, are borrowed. Much of the door you hear in this movie comes from another Sci-Fi movie that was returned in 1966, Star Trek titled. Now for the reason I bought this movie, Dorothy Stratton. She is beautiful in her one piece suit. I think her talents were wasted in this picture and that she would never have been involved in such garbage. Connie Sellecca was also considered for the role and her talents would also have been wasted. On the photo alone, I give this movie 1 weaselster and on Dorothy Stratton I give her 10 weasel stars, although she didn't deserve to be put in such a garbage film. If you like these pictures, you can get the DVD version on Amazon.com
