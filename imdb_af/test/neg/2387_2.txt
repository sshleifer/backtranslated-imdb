If you see the title "2069 A Sex Odyssey" in the video store, BEWARE !! The cover has Tori Wells and three other "80's" porn stars, and has a copyright of 1986. If you're like me (and I hope you're not), you'll think "80's porn? Tori Wells? All right!" Fraud !! It was created in 1974 and baptized German stars! There is nothing inherently wrong with 70's German pornography, but it's not my cup of tea, and it's nothing like cover covering you to believe you get. As soon as I passed my rage over the blatantly misleading jacket, I looked at it anyway. It's a bad, bad movie. Sorry, I don't think I really got past the rage.
