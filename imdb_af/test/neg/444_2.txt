God, it sucked. You can't end up with a horror movie with a happy-ever family setting. Yeash. I was kind of ambivalent in the final act. But my God. He didn't have to kill the girl, she didn't die, the ghost father appeared with a healing (which didn't make sense, because his spirit would have been liberated after the kid kid killed all the bad werewolves). What a while of junk. It's the worst horror movie I've seen in a long time, and I've watched many horror movies. It is a slap in the face of Landis and everyone involved in the American Werewolf in London. Blegh. I hope it ruined everyone's career in the July Delphy bar. And CGI: Kind of new and chic back in 1997, but today it just looks murdered compared to the artificial prosthetic / makeup work of London. Anyway, I'm done, I hope I have a few people from. Get the original instead, or fail The Howling. Or else, look at the American Idol reruns. Don't just look at this mess.
