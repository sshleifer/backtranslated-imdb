Loki, Norwegian god of evil, creates a mask that gives the wearer with cartoon-like powers. On the orders of his father, Odin, he spent the rest of the movie looking for the mask so that it could not cause any further sadness to man. Meanwhile, the owner of the mask develops a child who inherits the powers of the mask. Etc. If it looks like a pretty thin plot line, it is. Add to this the fact that the film is constantly being handled from start to finish, and the result is very, very bad. You can find worse movies, but you should actively search for them. <br /> <br /> Generally, Son of the Mask is presented at the intellectual level of a preschooler, but in view of Scene like the mask baby, many in six different directions urinate, including on his father, this prospect unlikely. I asked my son who he thought was the target audience for the movie. He responded to "convicted criminals" who apparently forgot the moment that the Constitution prohibited cruel and unusual punishment. <br /> <br /> But just for a bad movie is not a sin, or hell will overflow. What makes it sin is that $ 72 million has been spent on this garbage. To put things in perspective, the day after we watched Sun of the Mask, my son and I watched "Good Night and Good Luck", a movie that collected six academy awards (including the best picture) and brought in for $ 7. million. That's right. Just one-tenth of the amount of money to Son of the Mask. It is then the sin to rinse good money into the sewer, when it is better accustomed to making risky movies, or feeding hungry children, or for the matter, almost any other purpose. The producers must really be ashamed of themselves.
