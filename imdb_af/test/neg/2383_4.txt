Overview Correction: The end doesn't show Ben is online for guys. He studied Arabic language courses at The Presido Military Acadamy in San Francisco. Perhaps the Iraq war is a translator. (FYI- Much of the dishonest dismissal of "D'ont asks D'ontranslation was Translators (they are now a major shortcoming.) Ben also spoke Russian, good timeline of life in Manhatten, but a bit of the Reality Here Mostly a good laugh for Lame's social skills and the sad portrayal of "Grown Up" twenty somethings that do not go beyond the college party - changing scene in Manhattan - somehow it always stays close to the edge from the same BS) <br /> <br /> Watch the films "Englishman in New York" and "The New Twenty." Both good for Nostalgia. I think the movie "twenty" shows how far the fade between gay and straight as developed. <br /> <br /> These two movies are GAY Time Travel, sure!
