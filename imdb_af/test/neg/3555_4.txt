The acting in this film was from the old school: corny and stiff. Irene Dunne is light and comes from the best though she has many unnatural lines to say. Yet, her ability to convey emotion comes through. <br /> <br /> Old movie films will feature at least some redeeming features in this film by observing the 1930s movie technique. Otherwise, it's not really worth it.
