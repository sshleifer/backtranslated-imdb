It would be a wonderful film with a lot of educational potential for teachers around the world on evolution, biology, the creative work in science, research and Darwin's life, but it is not. <br /> <br /> The script is mostly historically inaccurate and turns a true story into a Mexican soup opera melodrama. While it is true that Darwin has gradually lost his religious beliefs, it was largely due to his findings during the Beagle's journey, not just because of his daughter's loss. He was undoubtedly disturbed by his loss, but he did not literally make him mad, delusional and detached from his friends and family. Such a depiction of Darwin is an invention of the author. So it can't be used in any way to give way to Darwin's life and psyche. According to most historians, Darwin has the theory ready by the end of the Beagle journey, and keeps it going public because he wants to further develop its effects and look at more data. In the film it is an imaginary conflict of Darwin with his religious beliefs and the mental illness he developed after his daughter's death that kept him from the public. <br /> <br /> The film brings a modern situation, the creationists vs scientists debate, into Darwin's life and times, so it's anachronistic. This does not propose Thomas Huxley as a man trying to develop a further understanding of biology, but as someone who wants to "kill God", in his own words from the film, and destroy the church, who would accepted the evolution theory for such purposes and not because it was a synthesis of very decoupled data. Huxley is presented as a very arrogant and invisible person, a combination I interpret was an attempt to mock active atheists speaking against religion. In real life, Huxley only gradually accepted Darwin's ideas after publication, and before Darwin's work he thought there was not enough evidence to support evolution. His first evolution support was published one month after the Origin of Species became public. He was agnostic but didn't think it was necessary to kill God. Just thought there was not enough evidence to believe in the supernatural. The debate writers against scientists appear throughout the movie, and creationists capture phrases such as "It's only a theory" are part of the discussion. Of course, there was no such dispute or catch at that time. In fact, the Anglican Church has published a positive review of the Origin's statement that they are in fact somehow contrary to God's work in evolution, in the way the clergy is portrayed in the script. <br /> <br /> Another horrible aspect of this movie is that it gives the wrong audience to the general public that scientific research is done by a single crazy man who writes a lot. Nothing can come out of the truth. The concept of evolution theory was the result of thorough observations of living forms by Darwin for five years in the HMS Beagle, and has gradually evolved, as can be seen from Darwin's notes of the journey. Although the Beagle journey was the only major part of Darwin's life for the concept of "Origin of Species", the journey is briefly mentioned only once at the beginning, and no attempt is made to show that the book as a extensive analysis has not come. of observations. To make it worse, Darwin is shown to do a single experiment (pigeon breeding) to test his theory and eventually stop it. And I'm not really sure if such an experiment actually took place. <br /> <br /> Great disappointment. It is in no way a tribute to Darwin and science.
