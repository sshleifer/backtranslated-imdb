This should be one of the biggest mistakes. The writing was nice and could have ended up much better. The actors had to play better and maybe I would have given this movie a slightly better grade. Maybe Hollywood should redirect this movie to a few little better actors and a better director. Take care of guys for disappointment, but the movie is bad. If I had to see it again, it would be like torture. I don't want to spoil everyone's opinion with me. My advice is to see the movie first. See if you want it and vote (don't vote before you see it!) And by the way ... Have fun watching it! Don't just look ... look it to the end :)))))))))))!)
