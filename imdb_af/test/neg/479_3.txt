Written by, directed by and head of camp of Camp Bruce Campbell. It's easy to tell, a budget on a shocking issue; filmed independently in Bulgaria. All I can say for sure is that stupid is not always funny. Campbell plays a wealthy American businessman with a fraudster (Antoinette Byron) and tries to close a business deal before being killed. He rents a cabbie to drive him to a strange little town; Not knowing that his wife was on the taxi driver. Within moments of Campbell uprooted; The cabbie is killed in the same place. A Mad scientist (Stacy Keach) continues with an experiment that puts the cabbie's brain in the American head. With great stitches on his forehead, Campbell breaks free and walks the streets in search of his wife; He is already frightened by a strange voice. Campbell disregards his rubbery face that makes foolish expressions as he argues with himself. So, Bruce does what he does best and undoubtedly she will be happy for many fans. I get the impression it should be written as a straight comedy. The finishing touch is Ted Raimi, Tamara Gorski and Vladmir Kolev. Check the Sci-Fi channel for this.
