With this movie I really hope the idea was to make up for the insatiability of the first AVP, and to my horror: Requiem is much worse than I could imagine. <br /> <br /> My hope was in the opening hours of the movie in the Predator ship and I almost had a sigh of relief when we finally saw the Predator homeland (a throw-away digital carpet painting, but still nice to see it eventually) and then of course, Man (if such poorly written characters as such can be called) is introduced. <br /> <br /> One has to wonder why it seems impossible for Fox to make a good movie from Aliens and Predators. At least the alleged filmmakers could have done their homework. <br /> <br /> Characters are set up in the same way we would expect the 13th Sequel on Friday. The pizza delivery scene was an invasive induction like every other scene of character interaction that followed. Bimbos and teen actors don't make a real movie, they are making a cheap movie, and Alien 1-3 and the Predator movies are good because they are produced above the concept (remember the 1st Alien is a " B "movie The Strause brothers really missed an opportunity, which could be rectified by knowing their Alien + Predator roots. In both Alien and Predator movies we are introduced to characters that are part of a bigger group (Alien: Refinery, Aliens: Marines, Alien 3: Convicts and in the Predator films we usually follow a main hero of a unit; Predator, Arnold - Special forces, Predator 2: Danny Glover, Police) and that is easy to see where the filmmakers of both franchises went wrong: in Alien Resurrection we have pirates ... or something, AVP we have ... explorers? ... with guns ?? And of course in AVP-R we have What is there to identify in? In concept, the idea of ​​a convicted person who went to a small door pie returning and returning a warrior, a set-up for a first-blood-type action hero, but like many things it never paid. <br /> <br /> The film-making is equal without rhythm of reason. There is no sense of forward momentum for the action, just small rows that build the tiny levels of tension or interest just to cut off just as they get interesting ... take the audience out of the movie at every turn. The action screens themselves, although very ballyhooed in the trailers, are so darkly lit, it's literally impossible to tell what's going on during the battle scenes when they finally happen. Basically, the film is prevented from many levels. Bad actors combined with poor direction and a horrific screenplay (who noticed myself as a screenwriter himself, seemed to have hit every wrong note and cliché that only the most undoubted writer could have unknowingly combined) The WRITING, if called is not even direct to video quality, nor does it show a lack of respect for the established lore of previous entries in the series. Why does Predalin suddenly have the ability to shoot alien embryos on a pregnant woman's throat to use her as a chest for incubation? More than likely, because the brain-dead writer needs a way to have more strangers so that the predator can fight (and give the fast growth even more than the first AVP: as soon as possible. Why should meaningless little ones speak between cardboard cuttings on sticks (what does the supposed characters mean) replace the actual character development? (Remember, a character is defined by what they DO, not say.) Why does the Sheriff lead civilians to a closet of guns? (Isn't he an officer of not the law?) How does the Bimbo know of all people where they are? Why does the Predalien wait for the Predator to remove his mask very slowly before it attacks? Why do strangers still fall into that nasty series-after-Alien 3- habit to tell everyone the time to let their prey know how to run? How on Earth this series surrendered to a character who says, "People die ... we need guns!" (how this writer even works past me and reflect sleigh g on Fox's already destroyed artistic reputation. It is like everybody involved in making this film suffered from a mental disability or is impractical at every level of the film processing process. <br /> <br /> This effect is pretty common. The Aliens look like men in fit and ADI is just lazy with their creature design. The aliens look like modified remains of Alien Resurrection, with the same bulky muscles around the arms as if they were not learning about that movie, it wasn't a good design or a good one to recover. Once again, everything is shrouded in such a state of darkness as not to create mystery or atmosphere, but simply to hide how bad the beings look. And just like in AVP, Stan Winston is greatly missed when the fake look Predator face is revealed. <br /> <br /> There are too many mistakes to list, so I'll just say: Don't waste your money on this movie. . Fox is out of caring for the fans, as this inexpensive and trashy movie is evident. I felt bad about taking my girlfriend to see it (though it was free) and apologized to her. It's a hard-fucking fan that's done with the franchise. <br /> <br /> Note to Fox: What we really wanted was not an incessant slasher movie, it was a movie adaptation of the original Darkhorse Comicbook, which was better than anything you produced for this franchise 1993 has. <br /> <br /> Signature.
