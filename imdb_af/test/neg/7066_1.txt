I had this movie, in the head of my head I saw it. I wanted to tell people time and again, but never remember. now I found it. Now, finally, I can tell people exactly what the absolute worst, crappy movie I've ever seen in my entire life is no. <br /> <br /> This movie is complete trash, and is unsuitable for a garbage dump. All prints and other copies of this movie must be rolled into a large rocket loaded and launched in the sun. Just the purifying heat and pressure of the sun can purify the material this movie stores, so it can be useful to the universe. <br /> <br /> I like movies. I like bad movies. And yes this is an opinion. But this movie was pure trash, garbage, and bastards from a few animals that should never be seen, yet to name the man. <br /> <br /> I'd rather watch a weekly Bold Movie marathon than watch this movie every week. and I hate your Boll's movies.
