The most impressive thing about 'Anemic Cinema' is the title: an anagram that is almost also a palindrome. Unfortunately, it only works in American English, as it is spelled anemic in Britain. <br /> <br /> I have always found the dilettant Man Ray and his artistic efforts to be profoundly successful, and I have never understood why his work attracts so much attention. In addition to his Rayographs (which he accidentally found out, and which is only direct contact photos), she was one real contribution to culture that he was the first photographer to portray female nudity in a way rather than art accepted as pornography. But it certainly had to happen, and there is no real reason why Ray deserves the credit. The critical reaction to Man Ray reminds me of the story of the Emperor's New Clothes. <br /> <br /> Back in the early 1960s, the second season of The Twilight Zone opened every episode with a shot of the turning concentric circles in black and white. There is an image in 'Anemic Cinema' that is so similar, I wonder if 'Twilight Zone' borrowed it from this movie. The biggest difference is that the screenplay here is a black and white spiral. Indeed, if there was ever a movie to be described as a spiral, it is one. In the course of 'Anemic Cinema' we are treated (?) On shots of a lathe with words (in French) moving in a spiral. The effect is fascinating, and the texts - about incest and Eskimos - are almost Dada in their meaninglessness. I laughed at a smart sexual pun. <br /> <br /> The emperor is naked, people, and this movie hardly counts 2 points out of 10. Au suivant!
