One of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Three immature young people have sex and talk about very little except their "love". They do not want much interest, but each other, and only passively so. I was left to feel outside. Most of the outdoor performances take place at night, so you can't even enjoy enchanting Paris attractions! I gave up after an hour and ten minutes.
