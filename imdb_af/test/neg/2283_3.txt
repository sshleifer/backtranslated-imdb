I bought a tape from this movie based on the recommendation of other IMDb users and have to say I was very disappointed. I am a college professor and showed this movie to my class; they agreed unanimously that this was a terrible movie. I think if you like the old Dark Shadows series, you might like this. (I had Donker's shadow when I was a child in the 70's, but now I think it's just terrible). The first half hour or so has at least the virtues of some faithfulness to Wilde's novel. After that, the story is of course wild, at least compared to the 1945 MGM version (which won two Oscars). Nigel Davenport as Lord Henry is actually the only thing that can be seen throughout production. Many of the other plays are bad, the music is melodramatic, and watching the movie is terrible. Actually, it's not a movie at all - it was shot on video, of course, and looked at that distinctive claustrophobic BBC. The opening styles are particularly poorly lit, the women's costumes are terrible (the men look right) and many characters - including Dorian - seem 1970s rather than Victorian hairstyles. The movie does well to include a lot of wild dialogue, but the voice-over-story in Dorian's voice contains a lot of junk that is in direct conflict with Wilde's character. I am a great Oscar Wilde fan, and I fear he rolled violently in his grave when this monstrosity was made. His only improvement in the 1945 version is that the homosexual sub-texts are definitely more clear, without being heavy-handed. I didn't see any of the more recent versions, but if anyone is interested in telling the story well, I would recommend the 1945 MGM black and white over this one.
