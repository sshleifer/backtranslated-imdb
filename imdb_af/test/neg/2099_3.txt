Looking back at the year 2006, one of the things I will remember most is the "Snakeamania" on the internet for a movie called Snakes on a plane. But I was unknown there was a straight-to-DVD rip film called Snakes on a train! After I saw it, I felt it was a sub-par B movie at its best. <br /> <br /> The plot: <br /> <br /> A man and woman get on a train to check out Los Angles, to get help from the man's uncle who is a shaman . This is because the woman's family does not allow her to violate him, so they put a curse on her that snakes will become her. Thought about a sixteen hour drive to Los Angles and a group of passengers including a former policeman and some drug dealers. Will they get there before the snakes take over? <br /> <br /> Watch the movie: First, the effects: I have to say, while some scenes with the smaller snakes look good in a boring way, the main effect must wait eighty minutes to watch shots! Unfortunately, it is so bad that they kill any good memories of the movie. (The film makes 198os video games like T2 alongside!). One of the things I noticed is that there is no script credit on the movie! And the directors make the film so anti-climate it ruins the whole movie. Final view on the movie: <br /> <br /> A sub-par B-Movie, with an incredibly bad end.
