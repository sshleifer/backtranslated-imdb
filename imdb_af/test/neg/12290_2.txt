Seen it at the video store and thought I'd try it. Sounds like a good story and the cover looks good. That was it. The characters look good, and the actor who played "Noel" was the most convincing, though he didn't have a hard time in the movie. I find it very difficult to give a movie a bad rating, but it is one, in a minute, that gets it my book. While the movie went with me, I wanted to get it better, but it has no use. Asthetic, it was good. The sound and lighting were good, but the play in this movie killed me. It was like a low grade soap opera. I just said, "I can't believe they've released this movement like that". I have put out several unbelief several times that the acting was so bad. There is so much I want to say, but I'll just say it. Everything was for the most part good, it was the final cut that really made this movie.
