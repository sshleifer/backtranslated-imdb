There are many reasons why I am not a fan of fact-based movies, but more than any other is how the filmmakers give themselves creative license on the story. If they have such a great imagination, then why not use that talent to make something original? Keep the facts different. It could be a good movie if they did the same. Ed Gein was a frightening person. It is said that if you take Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees and Leatherface, pack them in one person, Ed Gein will still be worse / scarce. So why can't someone make a movie about him who can convey it? When will they find out that reality is ultimately scarcer than fiction? <br /> <br /> I have read books and watched news programs about him and now I'm not a scriptwriter or anything, but I believe there is enough documentation on Gein that it shouldn't write much. a story about all these atrocities he has committed without creating murders that have never been documented. I am aware that he has only been found guilty of 2 murders, but with all the evidence found in his home and barn, there have been many other ways to put this film together rather than the deputy relationship with his mother and girlfriend as filler, and much too much of it. <br /> <br /> I think what I'm wondering is ... why did I know more about supporting characters than I did about Ed Gein at the end of the movie? Why didn't we get to know his mother, father and brother and the relationships between them ... what made him the psychopath he was? What abuse did he endure as a child who might have contributed to the man he became? Instead, the only thing we had of his childhood was flashing him as a boy ... running. <br /> <br /> In the end I give it 4/10 stars. It's 2 for the gore and 2 for Kane Hodder. Although it was a bad decision for me, Gein was a small man, and perhaps slightly and Hodder was anything but small and nowhere near what I would consider female. Maybe I was just excited because he was Jason Voorhees.
