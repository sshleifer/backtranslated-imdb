It's really a horrible movie by any of the regular criteria. Plot, storyline, play, effects, direction - I can go on. Suffice it to say it is poor. However, it has a certain appeal. Very completely out of context sex scenes appear, it's nice looking for Batman references. Umm - that's it. Poor really, don't bother.
