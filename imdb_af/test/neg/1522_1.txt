Possibly the worst movie in the genre. It is announced as a comedy, but is just tragically pathetic. I don't think anyone could have done anything more terrible and annoying if they were specifically requested. It is toilet noise at the very poorest, I will avoid even watching the trailer. I just went to see it because it was announced that if you like Monty Python, you should stick to it. Whoever wrote it was either biased or seriously confused. I'm still confused about how to honestly believe such a statement. Rarely do I leave the theater, really it takes a lot of effort for a movie to have the effect on me: this one did it within just 30 minutes.
