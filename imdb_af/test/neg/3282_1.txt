Robert Montgomery-Myrna Loy-farce about Loy (Irene) and her fiance, played by Reginald Owen, stranded in Labrador when their plane crashes. (It's really what happened to this highly predictable movie.) Montgomery stays there while waiting for his fiancee. <br /> <br /> Surprise! Montgomery and Loy are soon attracted to each other. The scene with the bear was so confronted. We knew it was already a tamed bear. <br /> <br /> Complications occur when Clara pops up. Loy wants Montgomery to tell Clara that they should share ways. If he refuses, she wants to leave immediately. <br /> <br /> You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out how it will end. Out with all that snow, it's just too cold for anyone!
