I rented it when it came to video cassettes in 1995. Once I saw it again, my idea didn't change much about it. <br /> <br /> I was adult then and I'm still an adult! lol <br /> <br /> The illogical elements mentioned by other reviewers didn't bother me. It's not a documentary, it's a fantasy story where animals can talk! <br /> <br /> While not caring for many of the songs, I kept the one at the end of the picture where it was sung by barry manilow and another person. <br /> <br /> Some people apologize for the primitive animation by saying that CGI is not often used in animated features, but let's not forget that THE LION KING is released in a year. earlier and it may have packed more excellence than any animated feature that came before it. <br /> <br /> But I think it's fairly fair to say that THE PEBBLE AND THE PINGOIN were made cheap, while the LION KING didn't ... <br /> <br /> High points for me in 1995 as well as today are the stresses generated by the little dangerous (mostly) underwater scenes. <br /> <br /> I also liked the opening scene that takes place on a music note page and a bit of the love story. But most of the time the story dragged and was boring. <br /> <br /> A watch is if you want animation, but if you are an adult and not a risk resident, get another Walt Disney production instead of this!
