My question is what was the worst element of this movie? Was it the play? directing? script? Maybe it was the waste of Alan Ladd and Jack LaRue. LaRue and especially Ladd are able to bring extreme sincerity to a role. In this movie, it was difficult to tell who the bad man was. Granted, Ladd was playing a nice good guy, but even in his good old roles he could cool down. So, the net result was a potentially good movie of any sense of conflict.
