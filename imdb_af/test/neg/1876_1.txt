It may be for those who have been in summer camps, but it is certainly not an entertaining camp. I went one before, but it didn't make me shout for joy. Instead, it hurt my head. <br /> <br /> The first thing you see is that Bill Murray actually had hair in the 70's. Yes, and he also didn't hope to run some. But to let him run, give him a wife to chase after. <br /> <br /> It's not that some of the stunts can't be funny. For example, the running joke with one of the councilors waking up elsewhere due to the movement of his bed. Instead, jokes and stunts were poorly set and executed. It just failed. <br /> <br /> For someone who likes comedy, it's a pain. Others are captured for life. I wish it was more like Leonard Part 6, but it didn't come close. "F"
