I got a discount copy of this. I've seen it a few years ago. My only recent experience was "Mystery Science Theater" where it was well spoken. One never gets a chance to go into these movies because of all the games. I love the start of fifty horror movies. They give us a pumping lecture on the defense systems near the Arctic. This was there to protect us from the expected Soviet invasion, but they should be handy with the threat of very large insects. <br /> <br /> This particular one is flying. For some reason, despite the exoskeleton made from the things that locusts are made of, they can still fend off air to missiles and turn off fighter jets. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's nicer - first the compulsory prisoner who saw the flying thing cools his heels in a hospital (it only teaches one - see an insect as big as a house - keep your mouth closed. I wonder if the poor man had to go home after they found the mistake. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's a very ordinary effort. This follows the usual attempts to resolve the stubborn mistake - and next time we open up to other possibilities - the Russians. I still get a kick out of these movies and this one is usable.
