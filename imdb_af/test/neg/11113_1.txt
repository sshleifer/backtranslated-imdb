Just on the sci-fi channel in the UK, July 5, it was ****. Sorry on JRD! May he be bored for a week! He can't pour LOTR. I think he was not to blame. Mr. Sheppird was. I turned off after 50 minutes, couldn't carry it. The ship was bad and the creature looked like a big 5 foot bat. Who funded this project? I think the whole thing should cost $ 250 dollars. Avoid at all costs, don't think about buying the DVD if they release one, I can't think they'll spend dollars to manufacture one. Let's hope someone is making a decent Chupra movie and a decent BIGFOOT movie. Sasquatch was okay, poor Lance. It is a pity a great studio and it is right to risk it, no more super hero movies!
