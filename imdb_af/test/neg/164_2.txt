This movie is so boring, I spent half of it on IMDb while it was open in another tab on Netflix trying to find out if anyone thought it was one of the more boring, nasty, gimmicky movies they ever saw has. A warning: I really couldn't finish it, so it's my impressions up to 54. <br /> <br /> Keira Knightly gets a lot of screen time. As others have mentioned, her mother wrote the script (perhaps during a drug-induced stupor in which total ignorance and emotional statements about emotions sounded like an interesting dialogue) and it appears that the movie is a showcase for Knightly . Oops! Although I agree, she is beautiful (with her teeth unexposed ... her checkered teeth cause me anxiety and fear). I forced her reactions and poorly tempered. As in, William or Dylan does something cute ... breaks ... HAHAHA from K with dimples and a playful arm. Like a minute too late. What? And she can't match Cillian Murphy's intensity. He managed to really look at her and looked as though she was fascinated by her and fell in love with her as she was completely disconnected, almost as if she had interacted with a mirror. It must be torture, acting against someone who does not produce the same level of energy as you. Know what else is torture? This movie. <br /> <br /> Her boyfriend looks beautiful during her cyclical "I have 1940 curls and a warm dress. Look, I sing!" shots, but what is the point? Is she an altar or an actress? When she speaks, it's weird, "Ooow, Mehster Deelan. Where are you going?" It makes me confused because the accent is so mixed and unexplored, but sometimes so thick, I have no idea what she says (or may fall asleep). If no one knows who Vera is or cares, or does little, was it so important to give her this supposed Welsh accent? This results from the rest of the action. (It just makes a joke). <br /> <br /> This movie seems to have dreamed a movie, perhaps after reading a little Dylan Thomas before bed. But instead of adjusting to the awake world, it was like, "Man, that dream was so interesting" and tried to repeat it. Then someone else warned, "Your writing needs work. Nothing happens, promotes a story or creates necessity" and the author is all, "But that's the way I dreamed it!" It's like a scary fantasy of a child, one of those wild and winding threads they turn to get your attention. And then William went to war and then Vera had a baby and then a blonde chick drank too much and there were so many planes and pencils and all had ruby ​​lips and ... <br /> <br / > As for the Dylan Thomas character (so boring it's all I can call him), why doesn't he have any lines in this goofy biopic? All he does is drink beer and smoke cigarettes and roll with Sienna Miller, who is so wild and artistic that she will make a wheelbarrow publicly! Get out of here, crazy spotters! (I realize she's not a poet, but she and Thomas are like this one nebulous unit of crazy guys, like a lukewarm Sailor and Lula from Wild at Heart.) Someone asks in the message board whether to buy this movie. I say do this. Leave it on your shelf and use it only as a weapon to condemn children, the elderly or urgent home guests. <br /> <br /> P.S. after Murphy's character ... when someone asks if you were "in the sh **", you can say yes because your wars are shot at a landfill.
