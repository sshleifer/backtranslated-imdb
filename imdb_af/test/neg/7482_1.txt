Carson Daly should be the only late-night talk show host who is not a comedian. What was NBC thinking! He's not funny! The writing is terrible! All the sketches are painful to watch. The current new karaoke is not funny at all, especially as he tells you what to sing before singing it! The escalator interviews are just stupid and unnecessary to say no funny at all. All he jokes, especially during the monologue, is the smartest smart, not the funniest joke ever put on television! I mean, every time he makes a Jessica Simpson joke, he ends up with "because she's stupid," who has already canceled a lot of fun in the joke. Any 3 year old could have made any of the jokes and sketches they made for this show for a show. Seriously, don't look at this show unless you're on the verge of suicide and want something to push you over the edge.
