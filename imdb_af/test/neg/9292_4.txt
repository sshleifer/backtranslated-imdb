You may know that BARRICADE was considered a failure by the studio for a year before ALICE FAYE's popularity reached such a high level that the studio decided to release the film despite the fact that it never fully completed. Faye refers to a murder during her nightclub in New York. This scene was actually in the screenplay and was the way the movie started. . Instead, it was completely lacking and could never be filmed an exciting series (including a full song by Faye). However, the rest of the story is quite intact and the release of the movie is possible at a 71 minute running time. <br /> <br /> A tired search WARNER BAXTER is too old to be credible as Faye's romantic interest and is just perfunctory as the broken down reporter. Audiences today will be offended by the portrayal of Chinese by broken English phrases such as "My likey makes noisy". Key Luke is one of the Chinese loyalists, but plays his role in a low key, straightforward way. Arthur Treacher is everything but invisible and still gets fourth bill on the screen due to changing changes in the story. Originally, Joseph Schildkraut played a role in the film, but his part was finally worked out. <br /> <br /> A mishmash of an entertainment-only movie for the hardest Alice Faye fans who have a chance to see her in a dramatic role - even if it is weak. Charles Winninger is completely wasted as a friendly man who runs the US consulate. <br /> <br /> In spite of all the weaknesses, there are a few scenes involving narrow escapees that are played effectively and Karl Freund's B&W photography is on top.
