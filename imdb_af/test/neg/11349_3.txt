Any of Law & Order's, CSI (take your city choice), and Homicide: Life on the street's worst episodes is better than the strongest episode of Bones. <br /> <br /> David Boreanaz is stuck in the crappy Angel-off, and Emily Deschanel also portrays "Bones" ... unrealistic. The actors as a whole have terrible scenes, either with forced acting or just horrible lines. <br /> <br /> After a while, the murders are predictable, as the shadow and clues are just too obvious. <Br /> <br /> Music is okay, though unnecessary. <br /> <br /> All in all, Bones is barely the show I recommend to watch during weekdays, as it is a better-looking carbon copy. with unreal characters and narrative stories. <br /> <br /> Skip it if you can.
