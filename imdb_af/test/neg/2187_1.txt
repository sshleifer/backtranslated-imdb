This is the best film that takes first place at the sickest and most helpful movie ever made in this poor country. You people don't even know what the word cinema means and you vote for movies, I'm really curious to know how many movies from P.P.P. or L.Bunuel you saw. The score of this "faded experiment" reflects much of your way of understanding things and recognizing a good / quality movie when you see it. We only have the Romanian people one movie and to this day the status has not changed and the movie is "Padurea Spanzuratilor". But I don't lose my time thinking how many of you have seen it. This is a movie that respects all the required quality of a MOVIE. From the writing to the frames and even the quality / clarity of the picture is even 41 years old. I recommend voters to look for better movies and then vote. KuDos will see you later.
