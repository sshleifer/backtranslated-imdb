Robert Lansing plays a scientist experimenting with passing objects through solid matter, but he goes too far one night and inadvertently makes him four-dimensional! Atomic age fantasy is pretty beautiful in a very cute way. Perhaps it was considered a thoughtful sci-fi in its time (with psychological overtones), but today the film is lightly baked and naive; This is a tailor-made festival for TV's late-late show. Wood performances by Lansing and Lee Meriwether barely considered one-dimensional, although Patty Duke (a cute brat pre-"Miracle Worker") gets a colorful, memorable outing. <br /> <br /> ** of ****
