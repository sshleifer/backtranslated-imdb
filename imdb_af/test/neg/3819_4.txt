It's important to check your expectations when you see HATCHET. The * buzz generated on this site surpasses the real impact of the movie. What someone can help to see the movie is to realize that it is not supposed to be scary. It is a beautiful camp and an effort to have fun. It's not - isn't it - just champion. Don't expect something like SHAUN OF THE DEAD; or something like Friday THE 13th (Part II by infinity). <br /> <br /> HATCHET has judicious actors. The cinematography is straight Ed Wood. Headache effects and makeup are stupid - probably for the purpose. Gore and blood is something between Romero and DEAD ALIVE. HATCHET is a movie of betweenness. This is between SHAUN OF THE DEAD and LESLIE VERNON. It's between camp and comedy (there's a difference). It's between the ultra-violent and violent cartoon. <br /> <br /> Instead of capturing the essence of American Horror, or any other silly jargon used to describe the movie, it tries something between the most important - American - Fright like Friday THE 13th and new horror like SHAUN. Fortunately, it remains away from Torture Horror. <br /> <br /> In the end, HATCHET is between a bad movie and a decent movie. <br /> <br /> * I think it is increasingly happening that people are involved in movies peering at sites like IMDb to judge and comment on the movies they are involved with. There is at least a campaign going on for people associated with the associates to leave positive feedback and ratings. There is no other reason for this movie to star in the high 7's with 600 voices and fall quickly after wide release. This movie is just better than the HorrorFest releases and shouldn't be so bloated.
