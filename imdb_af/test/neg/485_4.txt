It's better than the early Cronenberg horror movies, but nothing more than your basic what-true story. The videogame theme was previously also told. Nothing original was left except the strange Cronenberg atmosphere (not so strong here) with the entertaining sexual references and Shore's dark count. The story never takes your full attention. It just flows after a passing event after event. Rating 4/10.
