I think it's safe to say that if you're just looking at standard office movies or any premium production, don't bother with this movie, because you hate it. If you are an overly critical movie buff, don't bother it either. If you love science fiction movies and don't care what capacity you get a glimpse of the future, you'll be generously entertained. It is very clear that the budget for this was super super low, but what they did with the money is worth it. Some of the burning screens were pretty bad and the evacuation styles were awful, but it's pretty clear they had a good support from a computer perspective, as the scenic and alien images were pretty inventive. The dialogue is right hilarious, but acting is not completely poor. As for the story, I'm not sure what really happened to tell you the truth.
