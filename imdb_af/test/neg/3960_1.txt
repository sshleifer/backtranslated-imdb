This beautiful dog (called several names during the film) is apparently loved by the whole town ... but he is alone. He's friends with two kids (Cindy and Paul played surprisingly badly), but their dad doesn't let them have a dog. Then Benji meets Tiffany - another worshiping dog. They are immediately in love and this leads to a hysterical assembly of the two of them jumping into the grass, drinking from a fountain ... in slow motion, no less! Benji also lives in the cleanest deserted house I've ever seen. Then the two children are kidnapped by the most indifferent, rude kidnappers I've ever seen and - you won't know - they put the brats in the exact house Benji lives in! <br /> <br /> WOW it was bad! A great hit (for some reason) in 1974 that led to many persecutions (which I will NOT see). The movie was just terribly dealt with with "humor" so ominous and bad that you just stared at the TV. The movie also has a song that NONSTOP plays during the movie - so much so you want to scream. It was inexplicably nominated for Best Song at the Oscars - it didn't win. Yes, the dogs are rich and much better than human actors. But I need more than cute dogs to interest me. <br /> <br /> You might think I'm a little hard on a kid's movie but I've seen it with my 5-year-old cousin. Within 20 minutes he was bored bored and he basically stopped watching. I kept looking in the hope that it would be better - it didn't. Actually mean - but VERY patient kids or dog lovers might like it. <br /> <br /> Note to parents: This is G rated, but a dog is kicked a few times maliciously. You don't see it - you only hear it and the dog survives, but it can bother real young children.
