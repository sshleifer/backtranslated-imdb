I was pleasantly surprised with this one. It's actually very interesting and engaging. The cast is strong, even Dan Cortese. Brooke Shields came to act as herself. Black and white really had to put her, because I had never given her so much to play a conventional character. If sold right, it could be a medium-sized hit.
