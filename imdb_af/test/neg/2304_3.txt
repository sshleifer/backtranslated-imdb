Nice idea to have Dionne Warwick do the song song for this movie adaptation of Jacqueline Susann's best-selling book ("Valley of the Dolls"). Although it's really bad, this sudser doesn't have Patty Duke's Neely O'Hara. to spit the story. "The Love Machine" is incessantly boring. Even the final noise (with an Oscar award as a warhead!) Can't save it. Dyan Cannon looks balm in her heavy pancake makeup and cumbersome fall (although her small, sun-colored figure is a beauty to watch), John Phillip Law is a block of wood in the lead, David Hemmings embarrassing in gay fashion as a flamboyant photographer. And where does Robin Stone go to the end? Is he going out to the waterfront to pick up some sailors? After Cannon dissolved his masculinity, it would be a safe bet. In that case, 'Love Machine - The Final Episode' can be a more interesting movie. Surely better than this throw-inducing snooze opera. * 1/2 of ****
