I know it's hard for you to find Americans European films on video / DVD, especially from the 80's, but please look for the original version of the Vanishing title Spoorloos (1988) - and you'll see why the Hollywood version of The Vanishing screws up bigtime, especially in the final. <br /> <br /> I really like Sandra Bullock, Kiefer Sutherland and especially Jeff Bridges, but it's just as lame compared to the original. What they think? Can you imagine Seven with a happy ending with Gwyneth Paltrow who happily walks in the arms of Brad Pitt in the finals? The whole point the original was was such a great international success due to the shocking final. So why do you accept this kind of shyte remake? Actually, avoid it and get the original.
