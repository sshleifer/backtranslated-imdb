Possible Spoilers As Peter Jackson showed so brilliantly in his 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy, it is quite possible to make good movies, even grand, within the heroic fantasy genre. The genre distinguished literary antecedents, dating from the medieval bilingual romance, especially the Arthurian legends, on which Tolkien and other writers drew. 'Lord of the Rings' apart, but it's hard to think of any other sword-and-magic movies that are good. I agree with the reviewer who said that Ron Howard's "Willow" was the best of a bad bunch, and even that made little difference, except that it was just a mediocre movie, as opposed to a positive bad a. However, "Red Sonja" cannot reach the even more modest distinction than just being a bad movie, as opposed to a frightening one. <br /> <br /> As with `Willow ', many of the plot elements in` Red Sonja' are derived from `The Lord of the Rings'. An evil ruler seeks control of an artefact with supernatural powers to achieve an ambition of world domination, but is muted by a variety of heroes. The film, which is in the Hyboreic Age, a barbaric era in the distant past of the earth, begins with the villain of the piece, the ungodly Queen Drenched, which makes unwelcome sexual advancement to the heroine Sonja. When it is reclaimed, Driven (not a woman who answers no) responds by killing Sonja's parents and brother. (In 1985 it was presumably still considered politically correct, not just to make the main villain a woman, but also to make one of the main motives for her villain-frustrated lesbian desire.) Driven next step is to To catch the Talisman, a kind of fluorescent green soccer ball with magical powers, by hitting the all-thinly dressed female priesthood accused of destroying them, feeling their powers, became too dangerous. Among the dead is Sonja's sister, her only surviving family member. Sonja herself, however, is not idle, but enrolled in a martial arts academy from which his summa cum laude graduated and avenged herself. Along the way she is with Kalidor, a heroic sword fighter who looks at Tolkien's Aragorn, Prince Tarn, the marvelous ruler of a kingdom that falls to Gedren's forces, and Falkon, Tarn's loyal servant. The rest of the movie is pretty predictable, as Sonja and her allies are trying to overthrow and prevent the destruction of the world threatened by the out-of-control Talisman. <br /> <br /> What is it that makes film so bad? Well, the play, for a start. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Kalidor complete the type of typical wood, poker-wicking performance that has become his trademark, at least in the early part of his career, with heavy foreign accent. However, compared to Brigitte Nielsen as the heroine, he looks like Laurence Olivier. Miss. Nielsen seems to have even worse language problems, delivering every line in the mechanical, voiceless voice of someone who has just completed three of a learning-English-correspondence course. One wonders if she is hired for the role of just making Arnie look good. The other characters, while not playing their own private battle against the English language, are merely cartoon caricatures, especially Prince Tarn, who must be one of the most unpleasant childrens ever. <br /> <br /> However, an even worse mistake than the bad acting is the film's almost complete lack of imagination. It is a particularly sharp mistake in a fantasy film, because films of this genre have to rely on their imaginative power to convince the audience to suspend the natural feelings of unbelief that would be caused by a fantastic plot. Looking at Peter Jackson's masterpiece, at least for the next three hours, we can convince ourselves that we are in the Middle Earth, that eleven, wizards and hobbits exist and that the fate of the world really depends on the destruction of a magic ring. Looking at "Red Sonja," we are not convinced, except that we watch a lot of actors with bad accents fighting each other on a hill for possession of a lime-green soccer. <br /> <br /> This lack of imagination even starts with the movie's title. British science-fiction writer Brian Aldiss, when faced with the exotic names given to his characters, replied that there was little point in creating a fictional alien society with its own distinctive culture if you were to spoil the effect by calling hero Joe. . (Tolkien was able to <br /> <br /> get away with the name Sam on one of his main characters, but that was because Hobbits had to be wisely known, the Middle Earth equivalent of second-pipe-smoldering Englishmen) . Likewise, as the name of the name 'Sonja' is pronounced, the fact that the heroine of a story appears to be in a long barbaric age is a common girl's name like 'Sonia'. It's about as suitable for her "Betty" or "Mary-Jane". <br /> <br /> The movie looks like a very small budget, which makes me wonder why they didn't bother at all. Fantasy must be convincingly done, or not at all. It is clearly shot in a remote mountain area, with little or no attempt to suggest a distinctive culture. Of course, the few buildings we see, like the temple of the Talisman or Dren's palace, are cheap sets. We learn that Tarn's capital was destroyed by Gedren by the power of the Talisman, but we do not actually see this event; All we see is that can be a thunderstorm that takes place on the other side of a hill. Initially, you wonder how Sonja overthrows a whole kingdom with just a few allies, but if you see how small an army has run out of its reach, it becomes understandable. When an earthquake threatens to destroy the palace, you wonder if it is the Talisman at work or just a crew member who accidentally leans against the set. If we can enjoy this movie for nothing else, we can at least enjoy it for his inadvertent humor; a good example of the bad-it-funny school of movies. Ed Wood would have been proud of this one. If it appeared on California's television the night before the recall, Gray Davis would still be governor. 10/02.
