I just rented this stinker because of its relatively high ratings. It was totally sucked! I can't imagine how anyone would find it a good movie - even an OK movie. None of the characters had any salvation traits of any kind. To varying degrees, they were each selfish and temperate person - or abused and damaged personalities who had no idea about the spirit of Christmas (when it happens!) I know Canadians and love them - but I can't even think that They think it's a good movie. I'd rather have a sharp stick in the eye than watching this offensive movie again. A colossal waste of time and money. Don't believe the person who wrote the opinion was worth watching. This person will probably want a dentist to drill their teeth without anesthesia. Don't be mean, but for my life I can't imagine what this person thought. Unless they had illegal motives. Perhaps he / she was the director or producer. If so, I would ask them to return my money. If your money is important to you - save it instead of renting this piece - or rent something (anything!) Otherwise. For good reason I do NOT rent this movie. If I were Canadian, I would be ASHAMED that it was supposed to be a favorite Canadian movie. If so, I would say that those who think so, definitely need powerful drugs. YECK!
