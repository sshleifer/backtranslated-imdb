The gate to hell opened under Moscow. A priest, played by Vincent Gallo, goes to the city to find a friend who has disappeared into the tunnels beneath the city to find the gate. He and his colleagues have to move around with the tunnel dwellers, both human and demonic. A good idea with good role-players from second-level actors is nowhere like the tunnels its surroundings. I've been watching it twice now and I still have no idea why it's scary if not much happens, then people talk about evil and see our shadow. Nothing is clear and honest, I have not seen the point except offering a payment check for those involved. (Second selected Val Kilmer is in some fleeting scenes that aren't much more than allowing him Billed than in the movie.) The idea is really good, the performances are good, the script goes nowhere. Take the advice of several characters in the movie and don't cross the river to see it.
