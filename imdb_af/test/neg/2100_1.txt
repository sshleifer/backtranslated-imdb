Snakes on a train are a movie I rented because of the pure entertainment of the thoughts I had about the movie. Snakes on a plane were a pleasant action movie, so of course the filmmakers wanted cash on success, with this low budget effort. At 85 minutes, Snakes on a train are almost unbearable to testify. I had to keep the film doing something to entertain myself, due to the lack of events in the film. For the duration of the film it is never quite explained why this girl has this curse, or why does she keep this green / blue goo on the stocking constantly. Not only that, there is endless boring dialogue of the two main characters, Brujo and Alma, how to get rid of the curse. I can appreciate low budget movie-making. I'm not really picky about movies, I'm open to any genre or budget, but Snakes On A Train is really one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. Were the authors on acid or something at the end of this movie? Why did the woman suddenly become a giant snake? and most importantly how on earth was it able to digest the train? <br /> <br /> At the bottom of the line. Snakes on a train are a movie that should be avoided at all costs. Don't be intrigued as I was at the title, it's a bad movie. Let's put these snakes in peace <br /> <br /> 0/10
