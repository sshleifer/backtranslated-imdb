and it's just January, but I'm sure of it! <br /> <br /> By far this is one of the worst Swedish movies I have ever seen and to be honest Swedish movies is not as good in general. It is alleged to be original and perhaps it can be seen as that for people who have never seen an English-speaking film. For those of us who have been to the movie for the past 10 years, it can't help but feel Måns Mårlind. and Björn Stein has been sitting through the most successful movies for the past year, trying to print it all in one Swedish package. What can I say the outcome can only be ... poor. First, the story is just bad to start, even worse if it's not just a poor story, it's a wish to combine with very bad stories. First, a failed attempt to make Swedish action on the Matrix and then combine it with a very bad combination. moral story. And if you thought it couldn't be any worse, you'll see all the "cool stuff" just thrown in there, for absolutely no reason, but in a bad way to prove that Sweden can also do Hollywood movies - what we can't try either. For example, the main plot is trying to deepen by allowing young people to play a computer game called Storm has absolutely nothing to do with the story, or for example how there is an internet site about Storm, while it is just the main characters awareness - I really don't even think Stein or Mårlind can see a point with three quarters of the movie, rather than just showing poor additional effects. For the actors, I have to admit Eric Ericson does a pretty good job, except he does the same work throughout the movie. Even tough Storm is trying to be a movie about the personal development of DD. He doesn't change one piece in his way of acting. Jonas Karlsson, good to be honest, I thought he was a fairly respected actor but judged by Storm ... really, he should just be ashamed of this movie, his character and his scar. Finally, Eva Röse is just out of criticism, both her character and her acting. The only reason Storm doesn't succeed in getting a 1/10 is for Eric Ericson and, what can I say, try it at least.
