If you think it's great to be obsessive about who you fall in love with, then I can suggest giving it a good rating ... but I can't imagine that this theme has obsession and little respect for others not (like the way Paulie treats the teachers trying to help her) is anything you want to teach your children. Yes, it's also bad as Victoria treated Paulie, but guess what. It is life. Isn't it a more important lesson to learn how to get these disappointments and make the best of your life? Or fall off the roof a better lesson to teach our children? Second, when Mary's father didn't show up for dinner, and Paulie helped Mary to abandon her anger. Maria even said she wished he was dead. Somehow I think this is not a good message Your disappointment with anger.
