I can't believe anyone actually paid to make this movie. Mute, unrealistic and stereotypical. From the massive 747, the pilot withdrew the accelerators to increase speed. then you have 5 armed people with semi-fully automatic weapons who do not burn as much as one bullet that breaks the pressure cabin walls at 38,000 feet. Then once in the belly of the plane a stray bullet hits a fuel line and we see the fuel leaking from the side of the plane. The acting was just terrible and forced. There was no direction. I saw a bit of terrible B-movie in my lifetime, but with the names in this movie, I was very disappointed.
