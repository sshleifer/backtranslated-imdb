hi, that's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The day I watched this movie, I had a high fever. But I still watched the movie a lot of patience. And after watching the movie, I felt like repenting. Because I wasted 3 hours for this silly movie. I could have been quiet rather than watching this movie. And I was really surprised how actors like Sunny Deol, Akshay Kumar Aftab etc. Recorded in this movie. <br /> <br /> I don't understand if directors don't find a good story to make a movie, why do they stay as directors? Why can't they spend their time at home and spend their time at home? <br /> <br /> I urge all directors to be good to their audiences either by mail or media, newspapers, radios, etc. ... to send them a nice story if they don't, find a good story to make a movie. Please, I do not request all directors of such films.
