So much good chemistry between Kristen Scott-Thomas and Harrison Ford, but every time the story about their relationship began to accumulate momentum, the writing cut off and dealt with some irrelevant subplots that didn't do anything to advance the story. Indeed, the subplots have nothing to do with the story. They were like commercial breaks where you watched a trailer for another movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, the authors (or someone who controlled the writers) did not trust that they were compelling writing about relationships and living in the interior of their characters. They looked uncomfortable if they didn't throw in gunfights and bar fights. Or maybe they didn't trust the audience to pay attention to a story about a man and a woman trying to understand their relationship under difficult circumstances. After all, we all know how boring "Casablanca" was. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if the relationship between Kay and Dutch develops and is allowed to play, the authors would know how to end the story. This film is a disappointment to no longer do with his wonderful actors, who have produced good performances, but could have done better with better writing.
