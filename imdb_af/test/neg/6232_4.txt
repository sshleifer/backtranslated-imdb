As in so many films of the past, you'd think Hollywood would learn it now, make for a very disappointing movie, not to mention, make sure the kidnapped victim is alive before paying the ransom. <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie would remind you of these basic facts in case it ever happened to one of us. Why the long walk in the bush and can a city man really go through the bush without getting lost? Just an opportunity for a sentimental dialogue that was ultimately meaningless. <br /> <br /> I had to listen to part of the director's remarks in the special features section, of the big moves made by Redford in the past, (Sneakers for one) surprised that he agreed to to die in such a movie. The director's comments and reasons were poor. <br /> <br /> The best parts of this movie were the scenery, can't wait for the spring to come.
