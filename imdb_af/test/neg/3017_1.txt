yes, that's what the station indemnity indicates to the ads for this program. "Some scenes may be disturbed by some viewers." <br /> <br /> It's over. Validating this entire display of ego framework and chauvinism is in the fact that it is on the COMEDY channel. Yes, a comedy where and where. N GRAP. To see that this "playas" goes through their rigid charade really plays out what is wrong with society. Especially the meat market bar scene. Both sides, men and women, are equally weak and desperate to mix under this superficial atmosphere. Of course, the club is one of the gift screens of the Cigarette Corporation. These people have a choice, and it makes it even more of a joke. <br /> <br /> These smooth rides try too hard. They shine with their own groove fat. That's right. It's a new generation video tape lesson on how not to focus on a potential heartbeat. Hopefully, the facade will crumble with the Bush / Harper administrations. Problem, who was created after these characters fade? The bastard kids of the one night stand?
