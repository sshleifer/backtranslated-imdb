Jack Frost 2 was a terrible, terrible, sad pathetic excuse for a follow-up to a big movie. The original, was a low budget comedy horror movie about a murderer who, after an accident in a snowman, changed with some toxic waste. And the snowman went around to kill people, and to avoid the driers like the plague. However, it was far from the quality of the original. It seems to have even had a lower budget because for some reason, after an hour in this movie, I haven't seen the snowman yet. A revenge he gets is as if he is always in the form of ice cubes with a cheesy voice and a little shake of the cooler in which he rests to give the character. Disappointing to no faith, even to a bad theater fan.
