What gives Anthony Minghella the right to destroy two extraordinary works of fiction? First, he destroyed the English Patient, which was bad enough, but now I discover that he was slaughtered, Cold Mountain - generation! <br /> <br /> I had such a strange response to the English Patient. My son and I saw this the first weekend it was released and I was so disappointed but told my son I felt I had to read the book. I drove straight to Barnes and Noble, bought it, read it and tried to find out what in the world the critics were talking about when they said that Minghella in the intelligence of the movie trusted enough to give them a good movie. give. . This is what he certainly did not do. <br /> <br /> I don't read much fiction normally, but Cold Mountain was so highly recommended by friends I felt reading it. I didn't see Cold Mountain, the movie, when it played in theaters, and that was because of what Minghella did to The English Patient. But like a fool I hired it today, and I am so upset that I had to explain my frustration and especially my sadness that someone could take this beautiful story and put it in something almost as beautiful on the screen, and now they will never don't want to. <br /> <br /> Read the book and let the movie scale. I will never be overtaken by a Minghella project. I think he might be one of the worst directors working today and I'm tired of the Hollywood hips on his head. It should be that nobody in Hollywood is reading any more. This movie has no resemblance to the book, except the names of the characters. Mingella's ego shouldn't know any boundaries, and if he didn't keep the book, why not write an original script and leave the book alone. Even if I didn't read the book, I would still consider this movie one of the worst I've seen since 2003; and I saw almost everything released in the US. <br /> <br /> Elaine, you're not going to like this one either.
