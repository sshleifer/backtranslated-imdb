In New York, one morning near Christmas, a top father and mother go to their private school to see their little girl in their BMW. Then they go shopping and later return to their fine apartment in Manhattan. At night, they move to a simple apartment in a dangerous environment where they prepare drugs for distribution. On Christmas Eve, while the Christmas gift is bought for their daughter, the father is kidnapped, and his wife desperately tries to raise a large amount of money to pay for the requested ransom. "R Xmas" is a deceptive film by Abel Ferrara. The main characters do not have names, are anonymous, and perhaps he intends to tell you that in the neighborhood of a neighbor in your building drug dealers may be; or that drug dealers may also have families and be people; or that there are many dirty police, probably worse than the criminals; or is it a simple excuse for crime? Whatever! However, this humanization of criminals is a terrible message, and I really didn't like this movie. For example, in Brazil many drug dealers and criminals help their communities because of the absence of state in poor areas and slums, but this procedure does not make them a model citizen. In this movie we see a loving high school family in the day, offering drugs as a means of living, but the destruction of other family members is not shown in the story, and it is impossible to feel sympathy for any characters. In the end, I wanted to kill them all. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Gangues do Gueto" ("Gangs of the Ghetto")
