Well, they said he's in many other movies I've seen, but I don't remember him from any of them ... and you won't remember him ... These two unhappy, make the movie ... They don't make you good. They just make it. <br /> <br /> One to Five Scale: 1 It's bad ... It's very very bad. .. In fact it is so bad that this movie should come with a clip loading gun to play Russian rolet with ...
