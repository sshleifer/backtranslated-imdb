Even Mel Gibson couldn't save this slap of a movie. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Why would Mel Gibson make a movie I'm sure he couldn't sit and watch? What was it? A total goofball on some heavy drugs stalking a schizophrenic lady, who is also on some heavy ilicit street drugs. For all the filmmakers out there on heavy drugs; You will love this movie.
