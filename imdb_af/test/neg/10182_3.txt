Wow ... not ... wow. There are already many reviews on this movie, but I wanted to add some comments myself. I agree with most reviewers who said that this movie is acting, writing and directing - whose son ever does it. However, I think there are some other problems here. <br /> <br /> 1. Why is Christian faith and the extraterrestrial grant mutually exclusive? The movie serves as if you just can't be a Christian and allow the possibility? Why? They briefly touch it in the movie (ie "The Bible does not say there are strangers." "Well, the Bible does not say there is.) But the real rebuking is never answered. not so, how about dealing with the question rather than giving it away, or, better still, recognizing that it is an infinite universe in which we live and when we are in an infinite God believe is the possibility that he has made another life somewhere and has his own plans for them. <br /> <br /> of sleep paralysis and nocturnal horrors related to abduction experiences? What if it is completely different? The filmmakers have all made up their minds. <br /> <br /> with the occult, it is a fairly big claim to make without it present factual evidence is present. I'm not necessarily arguing that they don't, but if you want to say something like that, you'd better have the facts back. <br /> <br /> 4. Why does the other reporter (not the Greasy Haired Blonde Guy, the other one) always have his hands in his pockets? It is difficult to take someone seriously when they are constantly playing pool. <br /> <br /> I wish it was an exploration of Christian faith and UFO phenomena, but unfortunately the filmmakers were concerned about their "Faith Message". Like a Christian himself, it is my sadness.
