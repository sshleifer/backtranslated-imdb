I went to this movie full of hope. With so many skilled and humorous actors erected by Sir Ben, I thought it would be a little treat. Oh, how did I feel my eyes as the credits rolled. That I wasted 93 minutes of my life was this movie, which was clearly DOA. There are some real problems with this movie and it will probably be easier to list them; 1. No jokes, I'm not very hard to please comedies - high or low appearance - but there really isn't one laugh in this movie. <br /> <br /> 2. Does Sir Ben murmur by every line whether he is drunk or not?! 3. There is no attempt to begin to develop the relationship between love interests in this. 2 people randomly bumping into the street will immediately have more report. <br /> <br /> 4. All the acting talent gathered is totally messed up. Don't be foolish to look at it because of the names. <br /> <br /> 5. For a cold ass hit, he washed out more people in Gandhi than this quick waste (a little colored beard really looks scary). I was hoping it was a slow burn, but in the end it was the only thing that could inject any life - and justice - in this Frank was 9 and the whole favor started with Tea and ended with himself - sorry it was so bad.
