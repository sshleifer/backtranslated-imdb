I'm sorry, but this movie is just a path for me. In it, Perez is a taxi dancer with a boyfriend Keitel who tries to make it an actress. First of all, what is hell a taxi dancer? Even after I put it in, I still don't know. Oh yes, Perez also inspires DeLorenzo to follow her like a lovely puppy. There is no reason behind love, it's just a kind of happening. There are times when the characters and events really try to pull your heart beats, but it seldom works. The only character you really feel or not is Keitel's character, and that's just because he does such a good job with it. Any other actor and character would have been like the others. <br /> <br /> The writing is basically an uninspired rehashing about how difficult it is to make it an actor / actress. This has been done and said before, the language and dialogue sounded like a street pimp. The end is ... well, I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say it feels unsatisfactory. I would be more upset if the story was something good to start with. The direction is average with nothing really wonderful, but nothing really painful to watch. Repeating the play is the only one to do everything worth watching. Although I could have lived without seeing him in tiger-printed bikini underwear. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, Eddie Bunker appears. As random as it is, it's how random it is in the movie. And Tarantino gives his director a favor by showing 20 seconds.
