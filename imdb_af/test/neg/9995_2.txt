many people said it was a good movie with Hoffman making a good performance. I went from suspended disbelief, to boring boredom, almost walked out. there is not there. <br /> <br /> Hoffman goes all out. he is committed to the show. but sometimes he plays an affected man like an affected actor who walks on the scenery. <br /> <br /> No characters in the film except capote are much more than placeholders. Nell, jack, perry, shawn, the sheriff are all one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> yes the film shows the manipulative, preening, dishonest sides of capote. it shows them so many times I started to wonder why - do the filmmakers think we should have spelled out everything? and again? and again? it often refers to capote's genius, but does not show it. it shows him surrounded by fans and flatterers, but we never convince us why. <br /> <br /> But my goal is not to deconstruct the movie. I'm sure other interpretations will have. for me it was a two hour movie that felt like five.
