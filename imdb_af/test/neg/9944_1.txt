This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is supposed to be a remake or update of "The One-armed Swordsman" by Chang Cheh. The ham-fisted direction and crappy fight choreography means the battle scenes aren't even worth watching. The writing desperately tries hard to look serious, but is full of claws like: "And I knew nothing would ever be the same again ..." or "If only I knew what a heavy price I had to pay. "Ugh! And who is that girl singing? Someone finds her and eliminated her !! She's terrible. If you like Chinese martial arts movies, you'll be better off with Lau Gar Leung. It stinks.
