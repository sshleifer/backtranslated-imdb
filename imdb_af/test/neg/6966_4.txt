Like other movies of the worst director ever, Ed Wood, this movie is very bad, but that's why it's funny too. May not be for everyone, but I laughed a lot. It's a strange thing when you enjoy a bad movie. How do you rate it? If a very low film, than entertainment, is a little higher. <br /> <br /> The film tries to explain what a transvestite is and it does it by a scientist (Bela Lugosi) and an inspector (Lyle Talbot) speaks to a doctor (Timothy Farrell) who Know these things. The doctor tells the detective two stories and that is what we, and apparently the scientist, see. The doctor picks up these stories because a dead transvestite is found, suicide and a head in the newspaper about a gender change. The first and longest story is about Glen (Ed Wood himself) in love with Barbara (Dolores Fuller), but he never told her he would like to dress like a woman if he is called Glenda. The movie tells the same thing over and over, especially the fact that a transvestite is not necessarily a homosexual. The movie says it's almost a transvestite, it's not a bad thing, but being homosexual is because it tells us that a transvestite is not a homosexual. The second story is about a transvestite that really wants a sex change and doesn't just want to dress like a woman, but it's much shorter and less interesting. <br /> <br /> A few things make this movie very bad, and therefore laughable. How the story is presented is the first thing, how the same things are told over and over and the conclusion is all. This is not where it ends. The acting is very bad, especially Dolores Fuller seems to be reading her lines directly from a screen. Every thing she says is funny. The whole dialogue really laughed at me. <br /> <br /> There is also a sequence where someone walks into a room. The door is half open and we see something hanging on the wall, not quite straight. Then the door, which looks the same shot, although we know it, is not, is a little less open and suddenly the thing hangs on the wall. Ed Wood did not mind leaving these types of continuity errors in his movie. May be a good thing, because it's basically just another laugh for the modern audience. I think you understand that this is a bad movie and I think there is a good chance that you will also laugh at the ridiculous mistakes.
