I say "flick" because it doesn't deserve the appeal "movie", and certainly not "movie". I'm sorry to pay the rent, and although I've never come to a movie, it would have been if I saw it in a theater. A society that lives underground underground (oooh, it's original), very burning drum drums, inexplicable surrounding light shining through windows, an ungrateful woman and her shocking son ... the list goes on and on. C. Thomas Howell influences the whining voice of the stereotypical one-person; you know as Eastwood was killed. He needs special sunglasses to remember his wife and child, but in flashback he is the same age! Talk about a poor memory! I staggered when the little boy Abe randomly pushed a code into a door and it opened! No tension, spicy religious (what religion?) Under / overtones ... sadness of all: I expected Roddy Piper better; <br /> <br /> Surely the worst movie experience in my life.
