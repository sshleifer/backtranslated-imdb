There is no sense of savings in this terrible, increased, boring snooze festival, keeping in mind: "The Ransom of Red Head"! <br /> <br /> Although there are some big stars in this movie, the play is almost uniformly horrible. <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford, usually a happy man, pushes it up with forced emotion. <br /> <br /> Donna Reed is so over-laughing. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielson is terribly disgusted and horrible. <br /> <br /> The boy is such a repulsive little brat, I found myself for the kidnappers. <br /> <br /> The only decent performance in this mish-mash is the relatively small role of the butler. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I'm too hard on the actors, because all they did was read the lines they wrote in the script. Oh, the manuscript, that turgid piece of drunk drink that wants to drag on your heart strings, but just change your stomach.
