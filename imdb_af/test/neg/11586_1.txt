I just caught it on Showtime ... ewwwwwww, not even fun in a bad movie similar. One of the worst monster flashes I've ever seen. Plus the TV reporter in the movie was that annoying Jerri of a previous season of Survivor. The only amusing thing was that the "secret base" was home to Fantasy Island (and a million other movies and TV shows. The place is in the L.A. area). I fully expected Mr Roarke and Tattoo to come out and greet the visitors. If Tattoo was eaten by the snake, I could have given this movie a 2, but oh well. To watch people standing there and shouting for five minutes while the Komodo or the cobra crashed over them instead of making a run, was very funny, especially because you really could say they just shouting at an empty spot where the computer animators would later paint in the monster. I almost fell out of my chair, but in a flashback scene they either brought the cobra or the komodo - then normal size - into an indestructible solid steel container, with a few air holes drilled into it. Would a loft not be enough? LOL! Guess they couldn't afford to rent a real komodo and cobra. I have to remember that I sell Showtime for their series and not their movies.
