Let me first say that I am not a very artistic person and that I do not "get" new art. That being said, this movie is absolutely crazy, and in my opinion it's not crazy in a good way. Avida is a movie for those who can see modern art and say, "Wow, I feel the energy and passion of this painting." The only reason I give this movie a 3 out of 10 is because I actually managed to laugh at some parts, though I mostly laugh at the mere insanity of the movie. Two characters who throw chairs on a lawn, to do what these characters do, I have no idea. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
