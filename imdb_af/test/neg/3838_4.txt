I thought Choke had potential, but I thought it could have been a much better movie. It had some interesting twists and turns, but some didn't make sense. If wallpaper appears on the two main characters, it looks like it's really going wrong. Most of it was kind of useless and didn't help the movie at all. It wasn't Dennis Hopper's best hour either. However, the main saving grace of this movie was for me Michael Madsen. His performance was excellent. In this movie he almost made Mr. Blonde looks like a good guy. All in all, it was visible. Yet I was left to think that things could be done differently. These things would have made the movie much better, in my opinion.
