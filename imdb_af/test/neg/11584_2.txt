When filmmakers hear two popular villains, characters will fight, flow to the theaters to see how the battle will end. There is Freddy vs Jason, in which two very popular horror icons try to kill each other. And more about this, there is Godzilla vs. (Insert Name Here). But the very generic Komodo vs Python is just a terrible title, and an even worse condition. Obviously, the movie is a D-list photo, but at least a more compelling name, perhaps something that the unsuspecting viewer might deceive to watch it. With a name like this, you know where you're going. <br /> <br /> A army of military men and women, including a 20-year-old scientist sexy woman, is left dead by the army. an island inhabited by a giant komodo dragon. As long as they can make it off the island and the boat, it'll be fine, but ... no ... there's a giant python that keeps the ocean and the road safe. Let's hope that all these guys can make it from the island, and that the python and komodo don't satisfy each other in a kind of terrific special battle. <br /> <br /> Really, this movie is bad in almost every way. The play is pretty bad, or maybe the special effects are so cheesy, that the play is incredible, because no one believes these people are in any danger with creatures that seem to have been made on an early 90's computer. However, this movie is pretty funny. The creatures are so busy watching, and the actors really give it all to them as if they are in danger. <br /> <br /> I want to say that this movie is a steaming pile of sh * squawk! * ... but I can't. This PG-13 rated movie actually blows itself out. Every time a swear word comes, a parrot tears the word out. Even words that can be said on network television. How cheap is that they blow out words, and with a parrot no less. Eventually these parrot sounds got me and I couldn't help but lay the incompetence. <br /> <br /> This movie is bad, from the stupid start to the ridiculous night of the living dead style ending, but it's also kind of funny. As a horror movie it fails miserably, as an action movie, it is slightly less, but rather bad, and as a comedy it shines. <br /> <br /> My rating: * From ****. 95 min. PG-13 for some violence and Squawked from cursing.
