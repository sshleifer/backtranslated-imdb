It must be the biggest practical joke. I'm surprised that all the other actors kept straight. I might be wrong, but the impression I get from this movie was that they muted Frank Stallone and Joe Estevez to play in this movie. It has a budget of just under $ 40, depending on the cost of the aircraft and the spray-painted catch of the truck. the most incoherent film ever created, and sit back and laugh at the fact that Joe Estevez and Frank Stallone were not joking. <br /> <br /> If they don't get a chance and they really tried to make a real movie, I feel sorry for everyone involved in creation. I had quite a love affair with stockings, but this movie is so bad that I can barely see it. They repeated so many meaningful "special effects" that it was obvious that they were just trying to cover the fact that they shot only 30 minutes of recordings. If I had to be forced to see this movie again, I would bludgeon my own hands after about one and a half times. No offense to the big Frank Stallone, but I'd rather look at Sylvester for 10 hours a finger-painting class than ever to watch that movie again.
