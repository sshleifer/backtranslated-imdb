Difficult and unnecessary follow-up of a bona fide classic. An American Werewolf in London was undoubtedly a jewel of a movie: humorous, demented, just a tie romance and so many, many British, it left me to stand up and save God. Then this abomination came. You know you are in real trouble when the lead is so unpleasant. You're happy when you're slaughtered, and start cheering yourself for the lycanthropes. Tell you the truth, people, I just came about half of this CGIed travesty before I lost the will to get it off. Absolutely pitiful and a quick waste of anyone's time.
