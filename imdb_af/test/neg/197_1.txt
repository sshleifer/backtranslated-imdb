I was a hippy age 22 in 1965, saw the play 5 times, had 2 versions of the music and read the script many times. Perhaps as a separate thing, the movie is right, but as an adoption of the play it's terrible. <br /> <br /> First, the good. The songs are sung well and the production values ​​are pretty good. The homosexual implications in Black Boys, White Boys are cute. The Claude / Berger switch was interesting. Hair is a liquid production and constant changes in it are inherent, provided its basic spirit is preserved. <br /> <br /> But the basic spirit is very distorted. It seems as if all the producers who are wanted have to sing some songs and match the story, regardless of what it did with the original intent of the play. <br /> <br /> Claude, Sheila and Hud were offered. as a selfish brats who could give less to anyone outside their tribe. Claude destroyed Sheila's parenting party (it's hard to believe she smiled while her parents were hurt) and stole cars repeatedly. Sheila stole the soldier's clothes and cars. Then she left him in the middle of the desert, where he would surely burn sunburn, probably brought to the rank and probably die on the lonely Nevada road. Good fun. And Hud found it good to break his son's heart while shouting at his ex. It's not what hippies were, not what the play described, and is directly opposite of a love generation. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a hippie for money. The point was to be self-sufficient outside the capitalist system. Don't greet it. After Berger was jailed to destroy Sheila's party and host Claude to sponsor bail, Berger claims he should be thrown into jail. , with no better plan to hit the rest of Sheila's parents, and then hit his own mom. <br /> <br /> "Getting in" has always been a very spiritual point, but here it is stupid mess. brides floating around. Even if it's part of his journey, it ruins a beautiful song. I know they contrast "Floating In Space" with the army. But again, it ruins a beautiful song. <br /> <br /> While Sheila and Claude slam thinly, Berger steals their clothes and laughs "it was nice man", even after he could see, were both very bad. Then a little later, Berger does one thing that no hippie ever does. He hits Claude. Terrible. <br /> <br /> Then they have the perfect opportunity to sing 'Starshine' at night in a beautiful SF location, with the twinkling stars, perhaps in an inventive duet. Instead, the whole trunk sang it in the burning sun that is accelerating in a convertible (stolen course) road. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed with the movie in 1979, and I like it even less. I think it would have been possible to do a fairly close adoption of the show, but that is not the case.
