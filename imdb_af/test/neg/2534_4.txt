This movie starts out promising enough, but it gets a bit upset and stuck in its stylistic charm. The set of designs, costumes and music was wonderful - as close to perfect as you can get. But the more I got in the movie, the more I felt that all these efforts were for the directors' entertainment, not the audience. Although I loved it, except for a few short musical scenes, I can't say I enjoyed it. The director shows a great imagination, but if he had fun with this movie, he didn't share it with the audience, or at least with me. I didn't get a sense of impression and I didn't suck in this universe. <br /> <br /> A major cause of this was (surprisingly) Zhang Ziyi. You can say she's trying very hard, but she looks so mistaken that she's almost amateur. She is a skilled actress, but she has her limitations. I noticed in her acting that she should not really respond to her co-stars, a mistake that creates a gap in chemistry. The language barrier in this movie just seems to be expanding. She and Odagiri act as if they were on separate planets. She is also not a very good singer who makes me sing every time, but fortunately there were not too many screens. Odagiri was OK but didn't make much of an impression. <br /> <br /> I didn't even care for the characters. There is really a lack of characterization. The only reason they care about them seems to be good royalties. Without the compelling love story in the middle of the movie, it's hard to worry what happens. The film also interacts with small scenes that have nothing to add to the story and was actually distracting. I had to rewind because, after I entered a subplot, I couldn't remember what the scolding was doing in the main story. There were also scenes where it was difficult to tell what action had taken, because it was so styled. <br /> <br /> Mostly I am just disappointed because I love the concept here and there are many things I love. The music and dance choreography is very good. Supporting performances are uniformly excellent, fantastic in both acting and singing. It's just too bad that the protagonists were so dirty.
