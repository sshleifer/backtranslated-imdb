Words almost make it easier for me to describe how terribly this Irish vanity project (funded by Canadian taxpayers - both federal and Albertan) is. <br /> <br /> There is a sudden appearance by a beautiful Canadian woman (Kathy Ranheim) who in real life was a star athlete in Alberta, for no other reason to ensure Canadian content. Credits also indicate that some Calgary bars were helpful. <br /> <br /> Everything here is poorly filmed and at least third-hand (pieces of poorly digested Trainspotting, Lock Stock, Snatch and Reservoir Dogs are the most obvious steals). Avoid like the plague unless you want one of those camps, "so bad it is almost funny" nights ahead of you.
