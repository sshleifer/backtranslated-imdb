This movie is a waste of time. I expect action action to have more than 2 explosions and a few shootings. Van Damme's play is terrible. He was never much of an actor, but here it is worse. He was definitely better in his previous films. His screenplay for the whole movie probably wasn't more than one page of stupid one liners. The whole dialogue in the movie is a disaster, the same as the plot. The title "The Shepherd" doesn't make sense. Why didn't they just call it "border patrol"? The fighter shields could have been better, but they couldn't afford it either, or the fighting choir had a lack of ideas. It's a cheap low-action theater.
