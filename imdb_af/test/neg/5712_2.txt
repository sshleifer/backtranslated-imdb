It's a high-gloss soft-porn; a boring sea opera that focuses on one thing: sex. They actually made sex boring, sad to say, because I deceived you to look at it and tell me what the storyline was. What it is, is an excuse for Kim Bassinger to show her big body and for Mickey Rourke to smear a lot. That's it. Rourke's smugness is so bad that it is sick and Bassinger, despite the big figure, looks cheaper than beautiful. <br /> <br /> Kudos to the photographer for some nice close-ups and a wonderful color, but the story is so poor - no character development and no plot - it can't be compensated. Let's watch it: this movie is made for just one reason - to titillate male viewers. At that level it probably succeeded. If I remember, that's why I chose it to be a fan of Bassinger's appearance, but I actually expected a story. <br /> <br /> Those who try to give it up as "arty" and something deeper than soft porn are just fooling themselves.
