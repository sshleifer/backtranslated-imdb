The film has so much potential that has not been developed. Mark Hamill gives a good performance and also Bill Paxton. The scenery is beautiful and the ultralight aircraft are neat. The problem with this movie is that the story is underdeveloped and the plot doesn't go anywhere. The movie at certain points almost makes you fall asleep. I give it 3 out of 10 stars for the flying scenes.
