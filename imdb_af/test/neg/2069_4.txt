For those who expect front page art and storytelling to indicate another impressive Bollywood Indian production, beware: no musical dance numbers or songs of production value exist to ease the mood in this rather tired story of regular marriages in the British Indian Culture - with some Variations being thrown in. As written by Roopesh Parekh, the script jumps to topics that are just discussion that is just discussion to cover them with routine avoidance tactics. Harasy Singh Kalirai directs as a traffic agent, trying to keep the diverse subplots together at the tip of Keystone Cop tactics. <br /> <br /> Jimi (Chris Bisson) is a medical school student who is gay and has a beloved Jack. (Peter Ash) and they live with Jack's obese, alcoholic, loose moral aunt Vanessa (Sally Bankes) and Sally's clever daughter Hannah (Katy Clayton). Jimi's family is visited by the Patel family of Delhi who brings their beautiful daughter Simran (Jinder Mahal) to England to find a man. Jimi's parents (Saeed Jaffrey and Jamila Massey) and his grandmother (Zohra Sehgal) decide Simran is the girl for Jimi to arrange with a fiancee and wedding in the habit of Indian ways - without consulting Jimi. Jimi discovers the plot and is too unimpressive not to go along with it, a decision that Jack frightens and Vanessa bears. Hannah tells a "lie" to Simran (she is Jimi's daughter) and the wedding is off. When Jimi's parents visit Jimi's home, they discover Vanessa's drunk, apostate, but ultimately decide that they will agree with Jimi for the fact that Vanessa has given them a granddaughter and decides to make the marriage preparations a to use wedding. for Jimi and Vanessa. Jimi convinces the very reluctant Vanessa to go with the idea and before long Vanessa is dressed in a sari, prepared for a wedding, and Jimi, anxious about what he does just to please his parents, includes Jack as his best man in. At the wedding comes the truth and for Jimi's surprise, his family adapts to Jimi's true self and the day is saved by merely being truth. <br /> <br /> The role play goes well with this stupid little nonsense and there are a few good performances: Chris Bisson and Peter Ash are handsome men and play their roles well, even if they have no indication of all love relationships ( the director is afraid to show the least suggestion of intimacy between the two men). Sally Bankes offers most of the laughs like Vanessa; The rest of the movie repeats the stereotypical roles they played countless times in Indian movies. It's not a bad movie - it has its moments - but it's just too superficial and tired of caring for any character.
