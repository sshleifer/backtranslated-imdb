I went to see these 3 nights here in Cork, Ireland. It was its world premiere, in the small cinema at the Triskel Art Center as part of the Cork Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I got "Alien Fruits" as an excellent movie. It's a bit rough around the edges, but for a low-budget movie that can be expected! In general, the play (especially the headquarters, Kent Faulcon) is wonderful, cinematography and direction excellent, and the writing is extremely entertaining and exciting, with some nice set-up and witty dialogue. <br /> <br /> The end was a bit sudden, with no conclusion to characters and events as soon as the finals came to its end ... but maybe that's what the filmmakers are going to do. It definitely made the movie more disturbing. I like the fact that the main character never came with his mother on the screen: it makes you wonder if he will ever want, or even in reality, sometimes these things are never settled. It was a good choice to keep it unresolved, rather than pack it sentimately! <br /> <br /> Stout and exciting, "Alien Fruits" is a very ambitious debut and I have great hope for what writer / director Kyle Schickner will release next time. He and his colleagues are a worth-watching talent. I hope "Alien Fruits" will soon get a bigger version, as more people deserve to see this movie, an above-average thriller with some original and insightful twists on homophobia and racism in America's deep South. <br /> <br /> Highly Recommended: 7/10
