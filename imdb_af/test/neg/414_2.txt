I'm a historian. This movie is so wrong that it hurts. Try to look with an open mind, but if you're going to dive into a movie or something, you should at least do a homework on history, places, church protocol, and so on. Stop playing the stupid hearing, please. There are some of us out there who actually light our shoes and venture to the theater when something of this nature is worthy of a theater release in town. A little research, all I ask. But then the book on which it is based is somewhat of a joke in itself. So basically, they have taken a novel with many errors and decided to make it into a screenplay, millions and millions and millions of dollars out of it and an incredibly promoted world of theater release and nobody took the time little research on its fate. I know several of my colleagues who just did it for the credit or at least gave it to a group of students for a few weeks to investigate various aspects? Or someone just pays some money just to run through it because I trust, there are many hungry historians out there who would have the opportunity if it offered itself.
