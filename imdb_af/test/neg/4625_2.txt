This movie starts well and sucks you in. Most plays are good for Patrick Swayze (with his Texas Twang all different from the Muslim), proving he can't act. You can live through it until the first battle scene where they all fall into pieces. Why did Patrick Swayze bump into bad things when he threw his sword into the ground just 5 minutes ago. <br /> <br /> A few minutes later, a few weeks later, swords were misplaced, and people who know of others should not know about it. Other reviewers call "Troubled Production" and it shows. <br /> <br /> In the end, I just didn't even care about the scenes, sure, the CGI Dragon was poor, but the storyline was the biggest fall.
