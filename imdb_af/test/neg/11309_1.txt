After watching this movie, I got sick in my stomach and if I had seen another minute, I had to rush to the bathroom and vomit until dawn. A sick movie that wasn't funny and wasn't worth the money any money. If anyone ever wants to see this movie, don't do it! Your children will never forgive you and will be ill for a week. So if you appreciate your child's education and want to stimulate your child's mind, please don't see this movie. I beg you, don't!
