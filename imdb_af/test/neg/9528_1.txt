Lois Weber's film "Hypocrites" was and still is a very fat and daring movie. I enjoyed it and was very impressed by the filming and storytelling. The priest sees the hypocrisy of the people in his church and tries to show them the "naked" truth. The people are terrified when depicting the naked image depicting the truth after they have failed and the couple who did it help along the way. The people do not want to face the truth that they are doing something wrong, but it shows that they are putting things in front of God, tackling illegal beach parties, their materialistic ways and other things that people of our world are inclined Don't be morally right no. In the end, if he does not get followers, he must enter the gates of heaven alone. This film seems to me very brave, because a naked woman is shown throughout it, especially in view of the period in which this film was made. I found the images and symbolism depicted in this movie incredible. The way they made the naked woman transparent and used a naked woman to symbolize the naked truth shows a lot of creativity and art. By pointing out the different sins of the people as they walked along the road and refused to follow the road, each with different excuses, setbacks and / or higher priorities, it was a good way to get the people of today. represent. This film does a very good job of conveying the moral message to his audience. Lois Weber has a tremendous way to draw her spectators' attention to her creativity, symbolism, visuals, and auditory. Even the music of the piano throughout this film is very beautiful and appropriate to the whole theme.
