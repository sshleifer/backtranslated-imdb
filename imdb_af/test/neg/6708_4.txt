This movie starts with this terrible song that gave me cold fever like the song used in "Nightmare on Elmstreet"! It immediately pushes the mood! The sequence that follows also shows what to expect! We are aware that a ghost is present! The secret of this ghost is what keeps this movie together! But the structure of the plot is so complex that it is difficult to make sense! The ideas behind the plot are very interesting! Only the way it is told to us is too abstract! I understand that the director believed he had to maintain the mystery for as long as possible! The problem is that when certain issues are revealed, you never get a satisfactory explanation! The motives of the important characters are left out and some questions recorded in the movie are not answered at all! As we do not learn enough about the characters, it becomes difficult to care for them! And as a result, you lose interest! Just a few horror stories and a twist make this movie a total failure! The twist is interesting but no real shock! The experienced viewer will see it coming! Some reviewers argue that this movie is too much like "Ringu" and is not original at all! Well, it is true that some of the effects and horrors of that movie are borrowed! But there is a big difference! The tension in "Ringu" was mainly based on this one turn where the viewer finds out how the characters are killed !! In "Ryeong" (the "Ringu" holds) the twist is used as a creepy effect to accompany another crazy twist! "Ryeong" relies heavily on a complex structured plot and twist that doesn't have enough fright to keep you interested! Simply put: It's not a scary movie!
