Rossini once described the rival Wagner's work as a few wonderful moments ... and a few horrible quarters. Inuyasha seems it can also be described in this way. It has many great episodes, but there are many filling episodes. The whole series consists of about 175 episodes of which I would say at least 125 fillers or some subplot (I didn't bother counting and I wouldn't be surprised if the number was higher). <br /> <br /> Some of these stuffing episodes are actually quite enjoyable, though quite silly or dull. Nevertheless, the constant deviations start thin after the first few seasons, as the plot ends on a scratched creep for most of the series. Character development is also greatly delayed and by the later seasons the role-play has become rather unchanging, which is increasingly naughty jokes (especially those of the monk, whose ironic features begin to glow slightly humorously, but growth becomes tiring when jokes are accompanied by repeated ). <br /> <br /> That doesn't mean that Inuyasha is a bad series. It's just not a good series like Neon Genesis Evangelion, for example, is widely regarded as. If something to look at at the end of a hard day, it's nice, but it can never be confused with high art.
