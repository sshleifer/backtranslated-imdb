I heard a lot of bad things about this movie before I saw it, but thought all the negative comments were probably the movie's low budget and poor acting. I can handle both when it comes to zombie movies. But what I didn't count on, this movie is really boring; If there is one thing you can count on low budget zombies, its entertainment and entertainment - but unfortunately this movie does not. I'm quite surprised because the previous two horror movies I saw about director Bob Clark - Deathdream and Black Christmas - were both highly inventive and entertaining movies, but kids shouldn't play with dead things, but don't cut them. The plot line follows a group of young adults traveling to a burying island to ruin the rituals to bring back the dead. However, they soon learn that playing with things they do not understand is a very stupid idea when their rituals actually make the dead alive and return the bodies of the island to celebrate their blood! <br /> <br /> The plots sound as if it can lead to a decent movie, but what I didn't mention is that the interesting parts don't start until the last twenty minutes; And since it's a ninety minute movie, I'm sure you can guess it's not a good thing. The opening hours and ten minutes were stuffed with poor acting and even worse characters. I can understand how to set up a situation so that the abomination is more powerful when it comes; but if you want to spend that long on it, you really have to make it interesting. All the characters in the movie are over and annoying, and personally I just wanted to hurry and eat the zombies. However, the film is not without its merit, as the atmosphere is an exception. Lucio Fulci would show seven years later how an isolated island and meat eating zombies can mix well; but Bob Clark did this with this movie. The direction is also not bad, but it is broken down by poor makeup effects and a clear lack of blood, which probably won't please fans of zombie films. Overall, I really can't recommend this movie; But if you're a hardcore zombie fanatic, you might get a chance.
