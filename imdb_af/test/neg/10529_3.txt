I really tried to have this movie about a doctor who has the possibility of a new life with a young woman if he can come to the death of his wife. I think it was playing like a strange light romantic comedy, but the theme is a little uncomfortable to me. <br /> <br /> But I found it, I found that the dialogue was too much like a play, despite being based on a novel and also the mediocre acting was embarrassing especially by the look young head Vincent Spano. <br /> <br /> I tried to film all the eighties I missed in that decade. It was my pet spot that eighty-year-old nostalgia buffers appeared to be on the same core gun of films, usually with the brat pack actors and actresses, and neglecting the other films such as the creator who had fallen through the cracks. But in the case of this feature, I have to say I can understand. Not all of the eighties were movies, and Creator is evidence of this.
