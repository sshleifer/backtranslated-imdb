First, I didn't know if I should use my imagination in this movie, or the director tried to save money or low on the budget! Here we go .... <br /> <br /> Actually, there were so many years and gaps I didn't understand, it's like 9-year-20s to 30-year-olds and so many gaps you ask questions how hell did it happen? and why? I think it's a big flow. Forget about the reviews about history, but this history has not only history facts, but also so many errors. So most of the people continue to see it in the movie, you will have all cinematography like rivers, deserts, etc. Lose. That's true it's beautiful, and so I waited for BluRay 1080p to be released. OK! beautiful scenes but what is its point? I switched off the movie after 1 hour and half, I just lost interest. The film continued to do exactly the same things that are jumping for years. (At least, Mr. Director, for example, sat after 2 years after 10 years!) I mean I couldn't see the movie I lost and what I understand! Anyway, I wish I could include spoilers, but if you decided to watch this movie, just ask yourself what happened? you will know what i mean! Don't see this movie, it's a waste of time.
