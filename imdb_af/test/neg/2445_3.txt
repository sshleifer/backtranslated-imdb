Genre: Cartoon short without dialogue, African girl and lion. <br /> <br /> Main characters: Inki, the lion and the minigolf. <br /> <br /> What happens: A lion wants to eat an African girl called Inki. There is also a rather confusing Minah bird. Is he on Inki's or the lion's side? Message: Erm? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: I agree with Lee Eisenberg, it's rather common on poor Africans !! :-( I love how the main character, Inki (who is an African girl) is quite a nice main character, but they make her rather rude and don't make a younger audience like her much, just because she is !! GRRR CHARLES M JONES !! I don't like much of the lion and I think the Minah bird is ALL RIGHT (I suppose.) Personally, I prefer Charles-Jones' Looney Tunes cartoons in the future. /> <br /> If you want to see it anyway, then I recommend the YouTube site, just tap "Inki" on the main page space and you're there. <br /> <br /> I wish Charles M. Jones was nicer to Inki in this short, so there. <br /> <br /> Recommended for: People interested in old cartoons and / or people just brushing on You Tub.
