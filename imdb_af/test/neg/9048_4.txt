"Geten Alive" is much easier than Ruggero Deodato's "Cannibal Holocaust", but it is also a much more soulful film. I mean it can sometimes be inadvertently hilarious, but the plot is so wise idiot that it was impossible for me not to lose all the patience at the end. Hard Man Robert Kerman (Cannibal Holocaust) teams with Janet Agren (the gates of hell, here with an unbearable accent) to seek the jungles of New Guinea for Agren's sister, led by a religious cult leader ( Ivan Rassimov). Along the way, they become evidence of (sometimes true) torture and a bit of cheese-bound cannibalism. As indicated by Umberto Lenzi, the movie is on top, it's hard to take seriously, but if you enjoy a garbage movie with more than a few inadvertent laughs, it's not bad. <br /> <br /> 4/10
