It has one of the most pathetic, predictable and bad-acting movies I've ever seen. Clint Eastwood has never been worse, I have never convinced anyone on the screen convincingly. I laughed at him completely. Then there's this romantic kind of thing between him and the beautiful Rene Russo, which is even more pathetic than the one between Mr.Connery and Ms.Zeta-Jones in Entrapment. <br /> <br /> One IMDb user asked the question: What does not like this movie? I ask: What is it about? And the answer is: John Malkovich. He is an absolute genius and probably the best movie deal ever (he even saved Con Air you know). But that's it. <br /> <br /> This movie is called in the line of fire, but "Bodyguard 2: the rip-off" seems to be a more appropriate title. Just look if you're a tough John Malkovich fan. Otherwise avoid at all costs. * 1/2 (out of five)
