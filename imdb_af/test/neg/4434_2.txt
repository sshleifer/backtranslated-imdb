I suppose I actually expect a Bollywood remake of "The Fog" of the title, but it's actually more of a Bollywood remake of "I Know What You Did Last Summer", with some elements of " Scream, kind of, kind, and not a very good one. Aside from some very entertaining songs and dance numbers, it's pretty awful. This apparently got a decent budget and yet it was washed away on heated reserves that were not so nice to start with. A young woman is being threatened by a creepy man not to enter a beauty contest because he wants his sister to win (she is grateful, doesn't look as creepy as her brother), but in any case she goes in and win and of course the creepy man comes after her and is killed, after which an exciting game of 'hide the body' comes. Of course, the body disappears and no one seems to know why, but someone knows, and they are waiting for the end to reveal a ridiculous plot. Between this tired rehash there are some fine dance numbers, especially the festive dance number at the festival for Simran, the girl who won the beauty competition. It's very colorful, well done and fun, and totally wasted in this horrible movie. I'd rather look at an old Ramsay brother movie than this piece of crap, though somebody thought it didn't have to be available for the most part, which in itself is a crime. But not so big of a crime as this movie. I took one for the team to watch this one, so take my advice, don't bother. 2 out of 10.
