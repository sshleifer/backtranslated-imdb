The four LA police officers in fedoras driving around in a big black convertible look are poorly absurd, and even more ridiculous when Nick Nolte, the dumbest-looking of fate, appears to be in control. The author never manages a spirit of companionship among the group members, and the director fails to destroy articulation from the manor Nolte. Foprget questions anyone. Nolte's character lifts a cigarette, gets angry, and interviews a pulp. His methods didn't get him anywhere, until one point in the action, he was driven away from the closed residence to the residence with his mouth open and his brain closed. He hit an FBI team, and fled two military officers out of a plane, with only a vague report of anger at HK and no punishment. At the end of the film he was as gormless and muscular as he was initially. How he managed to get a beautiful whore to fall in love with him is a mystery, just like the eternal dedication and tragic betrayal expressed by his unemployed wife. Two interesting shots in the picture: one of a nuclear explosion, the other of a giant crater, apparently caused by a bomb. It's almost as devastated and puffed as Nolte's face.
