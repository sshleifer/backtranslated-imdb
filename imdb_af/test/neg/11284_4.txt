I have to admit that, despite all the media promotion and nominee for Oscar, my expectation from the film was not so high before I watched it. And I really found what I expected; A film that is fun for both conservatives and liberals in Turkey, trying to be authentic spectators, and enough for everyone. But it must be understood that it is not possible for everyone to be favorable. Therefore, the film remains as average for everyone. <br /> <br /> The whole movie tells a story happened within 24 hours. To fit the short story into a full movie length, some scenes are added without a connection to the main story. This is mostly the sales figure of the ice cream to the eccentric local people (ie, buck herds, old women, etc.) and each of these sales scenes is made interesting by the comedian dialogues to the spectators. The subject is mentioned as a universal problem: struggling with a local manufacturer-dealer against holding companies and monopoly, but that was the interesting subject for the twenty years before. Most of the readers will remember Ferhan Sensoy's "Hero grocery store" in the 1980s. It was the right story at the right time. In short, the story is not strong enough and is worth a movie now. <br /> <br /> In addition to some gibbers due to local accents, the performance of cast is so successful. The leading role is played by Turan Ozdemir with excessive body language, but anyway, he is also successful. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, for limited budget, the clear efforts of directors and players are obviously a good mood for the movie. . But it does not lead to a movie that is good enough to compare with Italian neo-realists or Oscar nominees. <br /> <br /> Note: In real life, the ice cream vendor will usually stop his own production. and be the dealer of one of the Manda brand competitors.
