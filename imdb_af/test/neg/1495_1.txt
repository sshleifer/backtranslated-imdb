A lot of teenagers gathered to discuss their fears, but an uninvited guest turned up and killed everyone. <br /> <br /> Probably, the worst horror movie of the 90s, Camp Blood (1999) is the only movie that can challenge it for the title, has some of the stupid characters and situations to ever get a television station . The so-called surprising end is terrible, just like the rest of the movie. Mild entertaining in such a bad way is good level. My rating: 2 out of 10.
