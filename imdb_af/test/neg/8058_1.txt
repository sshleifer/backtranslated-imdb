This movie was incredibly bad. It's a pity, but the violence is just too much to the point where it looks extremely fake and predictable. Since everything is shown to you, there is nothing more to the imagination. And the plot ... what plot? There really isn't any! The pacing is incredibly slow (despite the random acts of violence) and the script should be written by a twelve-year-old child killing kittens for fun. So this movie was banned in 31 countries? I could see why ... not because of the gore (boring and trite) but because it was a terrible movie. It had to be banned from existence. Avoid this one like the pest. 1 out of 10
