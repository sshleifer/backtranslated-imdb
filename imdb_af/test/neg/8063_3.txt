I bought this thing at a video game store's "clearance bin". I wanted to get that guilty feeling to see something I was warned about was too intense to look at; I wanted the shock value. I wanted to feel guilty and bad about watching a "forbidden movie". I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Cannibal Ferox doesn't work because it's so champion and fake. Most of the time the camera does not show you the "shocking" sticks, chops, cut - you just see the aftermath. (They show a breast hook in detail). The special effects are just OK. Nothing here that tells you any of the violence is real. The "cannibals" are apparently poor people from Central and South America dressed as jungles and said to mean. Of course, these people were on the whole picture to get some money, or food, or both. Again ... just not convincing. <br /> <br /> But as everyone said, there is actually a real killing of animals going on here. This is the scale of realism. For me, it was more shocking than any guts, hiding scales or castration, and even then the animal's death is not so bad - maybe just sad.
