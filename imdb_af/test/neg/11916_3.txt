I just read through the other reviews the last half hour and I don't know if I want to laugh or cry. There is no way ADJL is like Harry Potter, Danny Phantom, Fair OddParents, others as a secret magical world close to exaggerated. Also, no way is ADJL anime. Anime is quite a drawing style (and some will say more like plot and Japanese origin). ADJL is not anime, so stop saying it is and if you're looking for something like anime, look different, like Teen Titans and Avatar. <br /> <br /> ADJL is typical. It's just like all the other Disney shows. An arrogant main character who thinks he knows everything and doesn't mind listening to people older than him and still making the same mistakes. Dear friend sidekicks. Recurring plot with a hint of a twist. And brothers and sisters rivalry. Can't they even make a character that has a brain and is not full of itself? Can't they respect children with their elders? Can't think of something else with the plot? Can't they have the brothers and sisters and don't hate each other? ADJL is just too generic, because you also have bad guys who are defeated and return, and are also complete idiots who have no background for them. Let's think someone at least 30 can be a 13 year old. <br /> <br /> Watching ADJL is like watching almost anything else on TV, the same thing over and over. Nothing special, just new design characters and a small idea that was used again and again.
