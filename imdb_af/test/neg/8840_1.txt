With great expectations this year I saw this film, Spain's contribution to the Oscar race. Part of totally useless, banal, pathetic, poorly written, edited, acted and directed, the movie is too long. It fails to deliver the "message" he tries to give, fails in his storytelling, clumsy historical settings and especially in his rhythm. There are some so extreme misfires that I haven't seen in a movie long ago (the story of Lucas whose dead sister lives in his head, the divine revelations, all the lizards). The Spanish-speaking audience around me was patient and lost patience quickly and some of the comments I heard were whether the members of the Spanish Academy had taken drugs before choosing the Oscar match.
