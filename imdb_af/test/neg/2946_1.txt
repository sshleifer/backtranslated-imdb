Now you can really call it a movie. Did I know some of the movies that Japanese people do are good for nothing but bad? I mean, I slept with this movie three times. No horror, some small percentage (0.2-0.5) comedy. Action, let's just admit it has some, but the screens are poorly filmed, the actors are pathetic. None of the actors played a good job in his own role. It wasn't convincing. The writing is also terrible. I mean this movie can be good, actually, but for the 60's (not 100% sure.) I recommend not to see it unless you want to get bored as much as I did. I can't be quite pretty, this movie got its rating. It is ABOUT, ABOUT, AGREEMENT !!!. This is, of course, a personal opinion. I don't want to offend anyone, but who can keep this crap? So I hope it helps someone not to "enjoy" this movie for a while. Yet this is your choice!
