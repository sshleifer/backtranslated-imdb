Beautifully twisted Horror movie, which has a few good moments here and there, with some creepy blood transfusions, but it's just too boring for its own good. All the characters are OK, and the story, while having a lot of potential, is pretty boring, but the blood transfusion dials look scary, and as a result they were extremely disturbing. It was well made and properly written, and it started off very interestingly, but it just couldn't keep pace, and I found the end to be disappointing. Linnea Quigley no longer has a very small role in this, and I was also disappointed with it, and Stephen Knight did a good job as the lead, because he was pretty distorted, plus I got it in a DVD Horror series called A Taste Of The Evil, along with a bunch of other horror movies. There is a lot of blood, but it's not all that is a pity, and for the low budget it's done pretty well, but as I said, it just can't keep its interest. It's a nice, twisted Horror movie, with a few good moments here and there, with some creepy blood transfusions, but it's just too boring for its own good. I'll succeed, but I think it's worth a watch if you have nothing. better to do. The direction is right. Elly Kenner & Norman Thaddeus Vane does an OK job here with decent camera work, and does a good job on the low budget, but the pace is too inconsistent for my taste. Acting is actually good. Stephen Knight is big like the head, he was creepy, twisted, sick, and had a very creepy performance, the most creepy thing about it, but he was like a normal person. Linnea Quigley did well in her small role. Christopher McDonald is OK I think his sin is short. The rest of the cast is also good. Overall, I'll succeed, but I think it's worth a watch if you have nothing better. * 1/2 out of 5
