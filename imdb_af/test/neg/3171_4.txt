I think Homegrown is a little wrong for this movie - more like "Plantation Grown" - but it doesn't have the same ring on it. My guide described it as a comedy, but the pathetic trajectories of these uncomfortable buffalo are not my idea of ​​a stomach-laugh. More in the genre of the delightful thriller / drama. The characters developed well enough - an all-star throw made it so promising, just sorry the plot was remarkably absurd. Ted Danson delivered a fine cameo, as Jamie Lee Curtis did in her lead. Jon Bon Jovi has this wonderful ability to measure the THC content in the front seat of his car! I think if you stay a few, you can sit through this one - not for the gun shy paranoid types though.
