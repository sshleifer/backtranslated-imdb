It's a strong recommendation to anyone who reads this review, who has never seen the movie Total Reality, does not waste your time and money hiring this poor apology for a movie. It's the only worst movie I've ever seen in my life without peer. I've had nightmares from this movie since I saw it. The acting was terrible, and any amateur movie maker could make a more decent movie. The movie is blatantly distant from far superior sci-fi movies, such as TimeCop or Total Recall (where the title seems to be derived from). I'm sorry, but I just think there is more entertainment value to watch the side of a cardboard box for two hours. If you've seen this movie, I feel sorry for you to go through what I've done.
