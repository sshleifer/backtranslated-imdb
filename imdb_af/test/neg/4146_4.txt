I can't believe it's a movie I don't like. . . I usually find myself open-minded about all sorts of things. . . but this movie is just fine, bad. <br /> <br /> I could handle the subject if the script and story were better. I could handle the play if the camera worked better or the characters were better established. . . I think it's mostly in writing and direction. <br /> <br /> It was just bad. <br /> <br /> I want to give it the lowest score, but. . . I don't believe it, at least this man pulled out his tail to make a movie. . . so he gets four stars (just above the average score so far)
