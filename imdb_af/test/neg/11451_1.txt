*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** There is not much that can be said about this early-talkie era flick. (I am reluctant to call "Cimarron" a "movie" because I feel the word is too esoteric.) But what can be said about it ... speaks mainly to it. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, over-exploitation to portray Indians as a bad people. In one scene, the little one's main character - an exaggerated and excessive family man who wants to set up a newspaper business - is just outside his father's office. An Indian kneeling before the child. "Hello," said the boy to the Indians, in a very polite way. The Indian gives him a feather, stands up and walks down. <br /> <br /> Yancy Cravat, Jr. is excited in the office. "Mom! Mom!" He shouts and holds the Indian gift. "Look what an Indian gave me!" <br /> <br /> "How many times should I tell you!" She snaps at the boy. "You're never ever talking to those dirty Indians!" <br /> <br /> Yancy Yates, Sr. (Richard Dix) comes across as a man talking to a fork. At the beginning of the story, it seems he has a definite plan to give his family a better life. But we soon discover enough, he is not good at achiever - much less a completely good-moral minded man. His slave child, Isaiah (Eugene Jackson), is one sign of this. <br /> <br /> At his family's first draw after a Sunday morning church service - one <br /> <br />, oddly enough, Cravat is giving the sermon - Isaiah is trying to come along, like Cravat , longtail suit, holster, rifle and all dressed. Cravat tells him to go home. "Yes, I don't want me to come with your church?" Isaiah says with a pout. <br /> <br /> "No!" Cravat fixes him and hits him on the shoulder. "You don't understand! I want you to stay and wait for the house. And if anyone comes along ... you kill him!" <br /> <br /> The characters - not to mention the actors - In "Cimarron" they couldn't <br /> <br /> get their way out of the bag, despite their obvious efforts. And nothing in the script was too commendable. (Allowed: the incomparable Edna May Oliver - notorious to play the Red Queen in Alice In Wonderland, which was also released in 1931 - actually manages to portray her portrayal of a fiery old woman, which she was best at.) known for.) But besides, well ... <br /> <br /> Yancy Yates is not popular in town from the first week he arrives, <br /> <br /> and one of the Outlaws decides to shoot Cravat's white hat, as he and his wife (Irene Dunne) are unaware. In spite of her anger with the man who fired the bullet, Cravat only takes it completely. <br /> <br /> Not only was this story not "shooting for realism", but it was very <br /> <br /> lacking in several key areas: eg. Cravat's newspaper has never really been seen. (Bulletins and posters, yes - but not a newspaper.) <br /> <br /> Perhaps strangest of all, though: it's in a small town in <br /> <br /> Kansas. Yet, for some reason, Yancy Cravat was shot dead. <br /> <br /> He calls his paper "The Oklahoma Wig-Wam." <br /> <br /> Really good westerners have always been very few and far between - the only exceptions are Clint Eastwood's so-called "spaghetti westerns" from the late 60's to the early 70's. Cliche westerns, on the other hand, are dime-a-boxes. <br /> <br /> If you like Clich√© Westerns, Cimarron will make you proud - but like me ... it made me embarrassed. <br /> <br />
