I must say I really wanted UNDER SIEGE and HARD TO Kill. <br /> <br /> See how Seagal does his funny martial arts on people. I always looked forward to Seagal movies and unfortunately I was disappointed for the first time by GLIMMER MAN, which I really found bad. The foreigner is probably one of the worst Seagal ever. <br /> <br /> Acted. Terrible boring, poor editing, wrong soundtrack and so on! Dear reader, do yourself a favor, stay away from this! <br /> <br /> Honest: Stay away!
