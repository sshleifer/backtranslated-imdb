This movie sucks. It's awful. If anyone likes it, those people should be investigated there. Jackie Mason's character sounds like a retard. The man trying to kill the gopher is a loser and he sucked. Even though Chevy Chase was in this movie, he wasn't funny. This movie had rude jokes and didn't have Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight and Bill Murray. Although Jackie Mason's character had the character of Rodney Dangerfield's character, Mason's character sucked. Rodney Dangerfield was funny! He had to return! I don't care about Ted Knight, but Bill Murray also had to return. The original Caddyshack was Murray's career performance. If he was funny at first, he could have been funny in the second place. <br /> <br /> Final remark: I recommend this movie ... NO ONE !!!!!!!! THIS FILY SUCCESS! It sucked, it comes now, and it will always struggle !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> 2/10
