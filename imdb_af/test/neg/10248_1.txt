For connoisseurs of bad movies, Galaxina is a real gem. With really terrible dialogue, acting and direction, it's not the choice for people who are looking for a proper movie. But as one of the most unintentionally hilarious films of his genre, it is invaluable for a good laugh. In particular, the scenes of the Harley Davidson worshiping motorcycle culture are exceptionally good, and many other scenes provide an opportunity for a cheap laugh. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the screens with Dorothy Stratten are not really right to deliver, but since she is playing an Android, I can excuse her for woodworking. <br /> <br /> Bad movie lovers, don't miss this one!
