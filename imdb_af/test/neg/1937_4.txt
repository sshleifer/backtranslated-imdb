By reading the review of A666333, most of what I have seen through the film has been predictable storyline, cliché versions of lesbians / heterosexuals (that is, straight woman becomes lesbian while she thinks her husband is offensive and aggressive). <br /> <br /> The score was also very disappointing. It was mere, gentle, sentimental elevator music - another common cliché in movies about lesbians. The movie would have had some interesting dramatic moments if they were not destroyed by the music. <br /> <br /> Some scenes about sex and eroticism have also struck me as attempts to stimulate and increase the shock value, including parts of the final performance scene. The conventional "hot and steamy" moments were as boring as the exaggerated sentimental score. For example, during the pool scene, the women are kissing, and then the camera pushes along the deserted wine glass, the flowing water, the sound of their heavy breathing over the soft waves. <br /> <br /> The only elements I liked were the costumes and arobatics. They are well-choreographed, and the development of attraction between the two characters felt very natural during the exercise scenes. I really smiled at that and at the last scene with the police officer. But they weren't enough to balance the negatives or to enjoy this movie.
