Black and white satire from a Madison Avenue agency taken over by blacks. They are led by Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) who is determined to change things. But he even seems to be WORSE as his white predecessors. It's about as original as it gets. <br /> <br /> I'm sure it was considered brave and shocking in 1969, but it looks silly today. The jokes are either unfunny (the president is a midget. HOW is that funny?), Cruel or obvious and the movie is full of unlikely characters. It is done in a very experimental way that makes it even harder to take ... or understand. The movie becomes more bizarre and surreal as it goes. The end comes from nowhere. To make it worse, with the only exception to Johnson, ALL the acting is bad. Antonio Fargas (a regular in these types of movies) is especially annoying than the Arab. It gets three stars because the commercial parodies (done in bright color) are amusing and there is a rare good line here and there. I heard it was a cult classic, but it's more interesting than good. Save it ... unless you are in experimental 1960s movies.
