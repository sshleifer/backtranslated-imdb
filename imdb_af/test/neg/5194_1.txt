I can't know cinematography or mr. Angelopoulos does not pretend. But I know Greece and I love her people. In July, my 14-year-old son and I traveled to Cappadocia, Turkey, looking for some remnants of the area where his great grandfather Iordanis lived until the great exodus of Anatolian Greeks in 1923. Read the summary of the movie ( refugees from Odessa) I thought I might learn something more about the forced migrations of modern Greeks. If I didn't have a house in Rhodes, I had been to Greece for so many years 28 times, I was not married to dozens of islands and cities in Greece and if I never had the friendship of this ebullient, life-drunk, I had perhaps believe that this lamentation has something to do with modern Greece. As a professor at a New Jersey State College, I assure you that I am familiar with the history of the film being discussed. Indeed, my wife's uncle was killed by the communists during the communist seizure of power. My mother-in-law lived through the Italian invasion and German occupation ... hardly. These characters on the screen speak Greek, they listen to Greek music, but who are they? No, they are not even vaguely Greek. Of course they are not people at all, but merely allegorical. They are what the artist finds out when life is not entirely appropriate or insufficient for his perception of what it was or should have been. All of them represent some aspects of post-WWI Greece that greater external forces are being transferred to a fate they have not earned. As we joked in the late 70s in America: "The Revolution didn't happen." It is no joke to an ideologue / artist. It is actually grounds to hurt us by two and a half hours. And that's all because the different powers (Eleni's soliloquy of "guards" in different colored uniforms) did not allow the revival of the "1919 aristocrats" (Spyros) to follow the call of peace and freedom (the music of Nikos and his fellow musicians, ie the Movement, the cause). This dark, surreal review shows the true and heroic efforts of the Greek people to carry out their lifelong lives through the tragedies of the 20th century, to reach more than any of their Balkan neighbors, so politically developed and integrated worldwide.
