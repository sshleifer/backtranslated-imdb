I was totally confused with this unnecessary sequel to "The Poseidon Adventure", a movie I made a good comment on. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredible from the word GO! I agree, why was nobody else saving and boats around and helicopters? The one who saved the original survivors just flew over the boat, which is Michael Caine & Sally Field. WHAT WAS THE ONLY RESCUE? Hard to believe. <br /> <br /> The acting is generally poor and the show looks cheap. I hated the waste of talent from some good actors. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie unless you have to catch Sally and Michael as lovers. <br /> <br /> Gord
