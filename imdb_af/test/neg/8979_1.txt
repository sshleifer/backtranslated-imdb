It's by far the worst British comedy ever, how it left the first episode, let alone the pilot's past me. The play is weak from the main character Ben Miller played to Sarah Alexander (of the fantastic link) throughout the role. The plot / story lines were unsuitable and very predictable using many depleted ideas. A very painful series to endure, but unfortunately in a slot between two excellent shows. describes it as Britain's answer to 'Meet the Parents', makes a poor service to meet the parents and is about as fresh as an old shoe that walks around with the family dog. Britain had learned that rip offs from other countries never work to look at America's sad efforts to do so.
