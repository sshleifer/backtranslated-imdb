Unfortunately, I think this is one of those movies that if you or I took it to the studio and said, "Can I make this big movie with my friends Mary, Mungo and Midge from school?" the studio would have kicked you in the spot. But as a lot of the massive Hollywood names say, "Look, I want a chase for Italy with my friends, how are you?" The studio writes a check. <br /> <br /> We're kicking off with the Ocean's casino boss 11 who locates the robbers who kicked off with his cash, and then Brad Pitt Catherine Zeta Jones shakes, and then there is some monkey in Amsterdam and Italy and so and so and then it ends in some way. <br /> <br /> The film, however, includes the most disgusting moment of both Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis's film career. gem. I almost waved my lap and tore my eyes when Julia Roberts, Tess in the movie, pretends to be Julia Roberts. Bruce Willis is ready to know clearly when he can leave and how much the check will be. <br /> <br /> Oh, to be honest, I would have done it for the cash, so I think I can "I really didn't criticize the poor love but I'm an eternal slum," a Hollywood legend. I think what really annoys me about this movie isn't that it's boring and useless and has a horrible story, but I think the actors probably all had fun doing it! I think the actor's whole job is to project emotion outward. I felt like I was paying to go to the festival, but had to stand outside in the rain. Booo! <br /> <br /> See if you want Como, or CZJ or something, but go different.
