I can't believe I'm leaving myself in this movie to receive a favor, my friends ask me early on April 14, 2007. This movie is definitely a pain in your hole in the theater and sickly boring, I don't even agree the gory impact does not feel of his "terrifying scenes" which I consider a complete failure to attract his audience. The worst even troubled me because my girlfriend didn't come to the theater in time because she was helping her boyfriend to find a suitable inn to stay one night. I was not really disappointed with this matter, but this movie is indeed a matter for me, a poor plot, useless storyline, naively created and I no longer know what to say. <br /> <br /> Doing the title Anyway, the creep and the horror we didn't face could no longer get the beasts of the animals, if they saw it in the theaters, this is the right situation. Good luck to anyone trying to see it anyway.
