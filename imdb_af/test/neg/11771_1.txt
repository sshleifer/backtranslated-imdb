Well, I thought the movie was p. 1/10. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the best part is the first 5 minutes of the movie with the Nerds or any girlfriend, which is the part of your parents' fit. had big hooters, I thought it was actually a random actor? Heck no, it wasn't, it was actually a model under the name Larissa McComas, but you already knew it. <br /> <br /> So it made sense, but it didn't care about the rest of the movie (which I saw anyway) 4 and didn't look at the rest. That's all I need to be happy with C. So 2 of you just care about it. There you will enjoy.
