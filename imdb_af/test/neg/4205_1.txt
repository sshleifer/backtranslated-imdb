Do you ever want to see a movie where Chuck Norris takes away the bad guys and quietly discusses the mistakes of their ways until they see the light and with their tears in their eyes shake their hands, right the wrongdoing of the world in peace and harmony and forever does the rule of evil end in the world? <br /> <br /> Forget it, Jocko. <br /> <br /> "Breaker! Breaker!" Instead, it's all right for the drip head, because our Chuck driver Chuck sticks his big harness into the small backyard town where his little brother is held by a corrupt judge and his even more corrupt judges. <br /> <br /> Chuck karate kicks, chops, slices, juliennes and crinkle cuts every bad thing until it doesn't dare to lift his head. Many fights are in slow motion, for excitement, but only help fill out the movie to fill 86 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are many battles here, leaving only 15 minutes for plot. development ... and it's all about the plot you get. But what did you expect: calm conversation? <br /> <br /> One star for "Breaker! Breaker!"; and it's a small 10-4, good size.
