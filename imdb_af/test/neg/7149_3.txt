I was in this movie as an extra in the Dallas filming in July 1975. Some of the things you see today, and of course in movies, are implemented in this movie. The movie show, the costumes, the special effects, the acting. It was all before his time. It opened the door to movies like "Star Wars", "Terminator", "Matrix" and "X-Men" movies. Now people look at it and they say, "Well, it doesn't add to this new special effect story ..." It didn't have computer graphics and like the new movies do these days. It had a story, and a wonderful role, and a director's hell! The venues were filmed like the Dallas World Trade Center, and the Zale Building, and the Ft. Worth Water Gardens was the most modern and futuristic backdrop to roll into. Director Michael Anderson was very creative and tried to show a perfect future that was flawed by human desires and weaknesses. It was my first movie experience, the first of six movies I was in. Just because it's filmed in Texas doesn't make it a wonderful filmmaker's art. Look again and appreciate it more. This movie was the basis for setting the standard for many good movies we now enjoy. Well, my hand flashes ... I have to run. Santuary waiting for ...
