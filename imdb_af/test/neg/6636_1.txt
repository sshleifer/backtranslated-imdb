This is undoubtedly the most poor thought-out movie in history. The invention goth at Carrot Top is one of the most horrible attempts to be funny in history. I'm not familiar with his other work, but if it's half as bad as this, I'm just going to cry. I give this movie 1 out of 30 billion stars, and may God be merciful about the souls of those responsible.
