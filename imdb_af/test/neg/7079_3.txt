It had the promise of being an interesting movie. The subject was definitely a promising one - the excess of the Catholic Church during anti-reform. However, it was not only developed (except for a two-paragraph introduction), many things were not explained - that is, the gypsies, the Anabaptists, the inquisitors and their relationship to the one true church. Also, the politics of the time has not been explained, that is, the relationship between the Catholic Church and its supporters such as the Holy Roman Emperor. Although it may have been for an Austrian audience, the lack of explanation makes it confusing to Americans. <br /> <br /> But maybe it's a good thing they didn't emphasize history, because what they showed was pretty inaccurate anyway. Instruments of torture, bloody ecutions, witches and heretics, great shiny swords and beautiful golden relics are the stars of the film. It could just as easily be one of those Conan-type swords and magic movies, just with costumes ...
