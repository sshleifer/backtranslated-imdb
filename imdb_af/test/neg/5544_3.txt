Pumpkinhead was in itself a decent 80-year-old movie. No classic in any way, but a nice piece of fluff. Why then, we are now dealing with a fourth film in this franchise outside me. As in previous prosecutions, there is nothing here to really link the movies, except for the monster, the witch and Ed Harley (Lance Henriksen). This time we follow the feud between the Hatfields and the McCoys. Part of the movie is a Romeo and Juliet romance as a young McCoy boy and his Hatfield lover decides to run away to be together. Soon, however, they are torn apart and the boy's sister is dead. The boy escapes to the forest and gets the witch to raise Pumpkinhead for any revenge. The acting is at its best, amateurish at worst. The titular demon does not even really appear for nearly forty minutes and when it is a light comparison between him and the original design. Overall, Feud's blood fails to impress. It may be worth it once, but definitely not an addition to the collection.
