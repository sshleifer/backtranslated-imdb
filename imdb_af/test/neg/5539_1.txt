I just wanted to leave a quick comment as it is not being listened to here, but I just saw this movie. The version I just rented was released in 2005, as far as I know and it's actually called "Don't go on the attic" I just realized it's the same movie as Devils Harvest looking for some of the actors that became known in the movie. Anyways I'm in Ireland, so maybe it's just released here and now in the UK, but that's what it mentioned here .......... not really that matter because I won't be this movie not recommended. . The only words that come to mind are the CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE !! My one point out of ten is pure for one little jumping little bit: o)
