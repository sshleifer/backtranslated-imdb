It was clear that a number of agents had seen no more than dollar signs when they entered their clients for this 117 minutes * omage * at the court service complex. <br /> <br /> Sure, the movie could have been good, the $ 1m has remained. Seriously. The amount of the check does not matter, prostitution is still prostitution and no amount of "love conquers all" can change the fact that no marriage vows ever meant "for richer for the poor, to catch as in marriage". Don't suggest the story differently, though: 2 kids, flat broken, borderline "desperate" and totally stupid. They clash with the rich businessman. Children's marriage is tense by imperfect times and the fact that the man is a loser. Give Mr. Tuxedo, cute charm and stability - a virtual magnet for the ticking biological clock - and with him the woman's temptation, tension, tension. Who will she choose? Perhaps, under such circumstances, I could actually care. Similarly, Redford's selfish and manipulative playboy is the sympathetic character. A woman who will sell herself is just about what a man deserves to pick out his wife. The indecent proposal makes the man a TOTAL loser, short of every positive male trait, and makes the woman a cheap boyfriend who is deceived by money rather than confused by another potential love, a woman without moral center and self-respect. <br /> <br /> All the impressive talent (acting, directors, cinematography) wasted on this movie - and it was an impressive amount - couldn't save it from its brand new but trashy $ 1 million pin line . If I see this turkey at another bridal shower, I'm going to braai it! (Or cross it with Titanic and stick out the band in the sea!)
