From the English accent to the so unnecessary violence after violence. Moses shows up as a murderer. People who actually believe in the Old Testament will just sit there shaking their heads. I'm not a religious person at all. But even I felt as if the authors of this movie were trying to turn us all against God and the Jews. When Moses picked up the rock and threw the first stone with the woman to kill her for adultery. I wanted to stone the authors. Today I can't believe that Hallmark and ABC (Disney) will try to show such rubbish. Don't we have enough problems in this world?
