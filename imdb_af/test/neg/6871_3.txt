And just one, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> The reason is Margaret Leighton. She is a wonderful actress, both on stage and on screen. However, we have little chance of seeing her. I think this is especially true in the United States. <br /> <br /> Here she plays a sympathetic role. Not only that, but she is also very beautiful and intended to be something of a bomb. <br /> <br /> Walter Pigeon doesn't like the tradition of Drummond artists. He is always trustworthy, but he is not much fun. He's not a rascal or a knave. As a result, it had an appropriate endeavor with little action or tension. But check it out for Leighton.
