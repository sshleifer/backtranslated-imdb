Some teenage agents went to an old, abandoned farmhouse, which remained with their dead grandfather, unaware that several decades earlier there were murders because their grandfather with the devil pacted for a good harvest. Did you think of something better to sell his soul? The man's grandson and friends were set up to be the next sacrifice, for reasons never explained. The stereotypical teenage boy and his girlfriend, the black man with a white girlfriend and the two lesbians must fight with three murderers of scarecrows. But don't be as deceived as it was, it's not as fun as it sounds. . It's mostly just a lot of talk about ball kicks, dope smoking, and the main actor complains about never knowing his parents. The camera work is horrible and shaky, perhaps done on a handheld camera in some scenes. It may be a good thing since the scarecrows seem to have just come from a baby's birthday party and apparently they can only rent two people to play the three. scarecrows! Some of the best movies I've seen were this low budget, independent horror movies, but this one is just pathetic. The role players seemed to have consisted only of a lot of people who knew each other. They never did before and didn't want to act again and had a few thousand dollars. I can't believe this movie costs $ 130,000. make a weekend of free time on their hands - even the lesbian skinny shell scene is lame. <br /> <br /> I also find it amusing that this author is a sequel to this movie that does not even bother to add to IMDb. <br /> <br /> * From ****, and I only evaluate it because of the skinny dip scene, no matter how small it may be.
