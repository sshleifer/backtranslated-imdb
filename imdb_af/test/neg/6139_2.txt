************* SPOILERS BELOW ************* '' Night, Mother 'is the story of Jesse (Sissy Spacek), a divorced epileptic woman who calmly announced to her brash mother (Anne Bancroft) that she was committing suicide. It is a fascinating premise that is drained of all vitality and excitement. The brilliant hook seems to be a fraud - the story that follows is lacking in substance, gravity and revelation value. Where are the shocks and surprises like mother and daughter can be the last conversation of their lives? Where are the secrets revealed, the confessions and fantasies and regrets? They are here, but they are all painted the same dull color that holds emotion in the background and celebrates the "genius" of playwright Marsha Norman at the expense of everything. The result is not a movie, but an exhausting endurance test. <br /> <br /> Let me submit my comments by saying that I find Sissy Spacek one of the greatest actresses in the history of movies, such a magnetic, so natural that she continues to surprise and amaze be dying after twenty years. She brought a touch of class and magic to everything she did, and I saw her more than one movie from the recycling bin with her angelic face and vulnerable eyes, her soft voice and sweet smile. It was because of the big Spacek that I watched in the first place for this movie and that one of her movies should be terrible, it must fail in a significant way. This movie failed in two. <br /> <br /> First, the movie is so faithfully adapted from the Pulitzer-winning stage game that it is claustrophobic and repetitive. The whole movie is a two-wife dialogue between Jesse and her Mother. What worked on stage - a middle-aged mother and daughter struggle for two hours in small houses on film. A game, no matter how big, should * be adjusted * for the screen ?? It is self-sufficient and arrogant to believe that the dialogue is so perfect that no word can be changed. The script for this film could be shortened by thirty to forty pages, and a well-known writer gave the brilliant Spacek and capable Bancroft some * physical * rows, some facial responses, something to wall-to-wall. break and prison single set. It's no wonder the script was adapted by the original playwright Marsha Norman, who knows the theater, but reveals herself to be clueless in film. <br /> <br /> I can't over-emphasize the effect of the stage play script on the movie. Looking at Jesse and her Mother argue about Jesse's impending suicide is superfluous and boring. The women walk from the living room in the kitchen into the denon and back into the lounge, where they start again. A small Midwestern home is not the ideal place for a single set of movies, and the director never tries to make a clever or original movie, never try to get the monotony with an outside shot or cutaway or a backlash or * anything * don't break. There is no music, no other characters, no other stories ... just two women who cover the bank cushions and dispute their opinions. The reverence for the play is sick? even Shakespeare's most solemn classic players are shaken for the screen. The commitment to the original play looks almost indifferent? It is as if the film was made only to document the dramatic treasure that the play was, with the audience remembering. <br /> <br /> The other reason why the movie fails is Anne Bancroft. She can be a good stage actress, but on film - where presence is 80% of the performance - she seldom looks fitting. She certainly does not fit here, plays a Midwestern grandmother, but looks more like Mrs. Robinson for her morning coffee. She chases Jesse around the house, looks worse than surprised, and looks extremely unsympathetic, even when her lines spread a loving woman. <br /> <br /> Sissy Spacek is great as she always is, honest and open and so good that you really understand and agree with her character's choice. Sissy tells us that Jesse is a flat band, a wrong turn of a woman who had every bad break and made too many wrong choices. She never had control over her life, and her suicide would be her way of finally saying, "No more, that's where I get away." That's how she puts it anyway, and when Spacek talks? you listen. In all of her films she proves that a good actress doesn't have to act like a man, not all have to be bluffing and brainstorming and borrowing testosterone. In this and in films such as "Coal Miner's Daughter", she quietly demonstrates a gentle power and quiet depth that is as impressive as it is hypnotic? you can't help falling in love. <br /> <br /> That's why it was so hard for me to watch. "Night, Mother." Spacek is being wasted in a stilted stunt of a movie that never serves to engage or even divert. I would not recommend this movie to anyone except the hard-pressed Sissy fans like me and even then you will be disappointed. I give the film a whole-letter bonus for the end, which is brave enough to make the main character do what is right for * her * and not make a beaten happy ending. GRADE: C
