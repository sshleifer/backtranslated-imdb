Should the writers of these "comedies" have such empty lives that they have to embody them in such tragic programs. <br /> <br /> Why the talented and beautiful Busy Phillips is under this garbage is over I can't stand the Spanish girl whose accent sounds very fake and is as dirty and annoying as the other African American girl with the shrill voice. <br /> <br /> The jokes are often stupid, the Jewish man shouts a lot and the performance never goes anywhere, but a particular episode with solid search for love was just awful. <br /> <br /> I don't believe there will be so much work in a love office and just one man? Of course, all the Women are in tough tops and tons of toddlers to uncover their talent. <br /> <br /> I actually found Holly funny in her older shows and I always wanted admiration, but this The show is stupid, empty and nothing went for it.
