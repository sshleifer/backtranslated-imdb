I don't want to look too much of a nitpicky spoilsport, but if the accidental death of a butterfly by a time traveler caused such a tremendous change in the timeline, how could it be because the butterfly would be burned by the pyroclastic blast the erupting volcano anyway? And how can travelers return at the same moments and not meet their previous and later ones, which were also the same minutes in the timeline? There seems to be quite a large crowd standing in front of the dinosaur drawer. <br /> <br /> While accepting the idea of ​​a time wave, I doubt that the wave would have caused only a few changes. As the wave passed, all the changes that would have happened would have occurred immediately in the corridor of the wave. So, scratch the idea of ​​the city to get overgrown with jungle. And why jungle? The city's location would still have been on the latitude and longitude it had previously had and would have suited vegetation at its geographical location on Earth. <br /> <br /> And an endless list of other illogical irregularities. <Br /> <br /> Bwahahaha! This movie is a strange combination of reasonably decent production values ​​and totally ridiculous pitfalls and factual errors. <br /> <br /> Too bad. A terrifying story idea refurbished with stupidity. <br /> <br /> Soak ... why, why, why, why? Why spend all that money on production and don't even bother reading the script to see if it has some real sense?
