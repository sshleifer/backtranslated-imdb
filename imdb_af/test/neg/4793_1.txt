Famous for being "brought to you by the digital effect team behind Independence Day", Coronado is even more of a spectacular failure, just because it's not associated with ID4. This ridiculous mess of a movie starts with a mindless premise and goes completely downhill from there. A wealthy, soon to be married couple in Beverly Hills is the subject of this idiotic story. Claire's fiance traveled on a business trip on Christmas, and decided to fly spontaneously to Switzerland to spend the holiday together. I especially love her initial reason to go because he left some documents at home that she thought he might need. She grabbed them and screamed behind him as he drove off and decided that her best bet would be to fly to the other side of the planet rather than calling his cellphone. I refuse to believe that a couple living in such an abominable mansion, as they were not aware of the existence of cell phones. <br /> <br /> So far, the movie is incredibly bad, but it goes out, HERE. is where it gets bad! She comes to Switzerland and when she can't find her husband, she gets some cake and calls her friend to blow up on how unfair it is. This woman is not an action hero, and she is definitely not a German Indiana Jones because he is crying out loud. She is an overgrown cheerleader, a pampered girlfriend whose outdoor experience is probably limited to digging her hooks out of the ground when she gets strong enough to walk on the lawn during a wine and cheese coming out on the bluffs. <br /> <br /> She gets a hint that her fianc√© is in South America, so she flies completely there to get him. Once there, this moron thinks she's going through the jungle in the jungle, cutting out the enemy base and saving her poor helpless boyfriend. She laughed from a comment about the danger of going in there, and later she let go because she found out there were battles going on. "You never said anything about the fight!" <br /> <br /> There is one point where Claire and a journalist she met are driving this huge truck across a bridge that is hundreds of feet high and hundreds of feet across, and suspended by two at four. Literally. There are thousands of thin pieces of wood tied with a rope, and these morons decide to ride on it. Not only does it crumble under the weight of the truck, but Claire manages to fall, fall hundreds of feet and land on her back in the plane. Later she remembers the event, laughs it down like, oh maybe it's just a hundred. At least she wasn't turning her on her fingers. <br /> <br /> What is really sad about this catastrophic bad movie is that they even have a terrible performance of the incredibly talented John Rhys-Davies, FIRST Indiana Jones veteran. There is a lot of nonsense about a rebellion at the end of the film, where we meet an extremist rebel who, once we met him, has such a heavy emphasis that he is his r, as he thinks he is in " Ruffles commercial, he later talks like a guy who pulled them off the streets of Venice Beach. Unbelievable. <br /> <br /> The special effects are negligible. The team that brought you Independence Day was virtually involved with ID4, but just went through the moves, throwing some rugs and blue screens together, I have to believe because they had nothing better to do. The story is amazingly bad, and Kristin Dattilo, who calls many other IMDb users the only reason to watch the movie, puts the slightest effort in her performance. Perhaps she thought the digital effect team behind Independence Day could build up any meaning in this mess. <br /> <br /> And given how far they've fallen, they might have thought they could. <br /> <br /> <br />> At least they could have tried.
