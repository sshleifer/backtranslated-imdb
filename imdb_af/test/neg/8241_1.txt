Sorry, I can no longer agree, with the last comment. Frankly, I thought it was worse than Carry on Columbus, said enough. Last movie for the usually brilliant Charles Hartrey who looks forward to the humor at the evil spectacular level, whose films were made simultaneously, was frankly funny. Barbara Windsor was embarrassing character like one of your mothers, flirty friends who still think she's eighteen, on holiday with some non-entities of a Scottish, Rab c Nesbit, he is. The series performed wonderfully with duffers such as Carry on Agter, and wears England. Stay on Dick was not bad, but really with this movie was the end of the series pity, because I can not think of bad film before this movie.
