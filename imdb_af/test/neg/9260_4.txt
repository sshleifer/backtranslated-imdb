Seven pioneer children are striving independently over many miles of Indian territory and hard weather to reach Oregon. According to history, young people who traveled by themselves through long distances - such as the "Crusade for Children" - have been manipulated and exploited by being abused and sold into slavery, but these children are fairly tough and they try their best to reach their goal of making a farm from the west. Film is a bit too harsh, but for fans of 'The Waltons' and 'Little House on the Prairie'. <br /> <br /> Dean Smith gives a cool performance as Kit Carson.
