I suspect the previous "House" movie was a hit that Universal asked to wring a few more drops of the monster cash cow. The creative team must be in a recycling temperature. It starts with the opening theme being lifted from Son of Frankenstein, and some of the stock distributed by the movie is like one unintentionally funny piece of business where the recording of Glenn Strange as the monster is mixed with Karloff's pebble from the Bride of 1935, and compared to how Robotic Strange moves, Karloff seems to be moving like a cheetah in comparison. <br /> <br /> Previous film continuity is thrown alongside the miraculous death-cheating capabilities of the Wolf Man and Dracula, but as dr. Edelmann & Larry Talbot discovered Frankenstein's monster with the skeleton of Boris Karloff, Edward T. Lowe admits at least some of the past film history, although Talbot never remarked that Karloff's met. Dr. Niemann. <br /> <br /> As it was the last of Universal's horror cycle, the supernatural elements of The Wolf Man and Drac (inadvertently) become degenerate into medical ailments. Drac is said to be suffering from a blood disease, a very rare disease that allows him to turn into a bat or evaporate when sunlight hits him. >: -] And Larry Talbot has just a little pressure on the brain. Of course, this is all explained carefully with a 'many' medical jargon that is continuously related in many screens. It seems to be the biggest stumbling block, like somewhere along the way the filmmakers seem to be indignant about the real abomination or entertainment in favor of the monsters' conditions considered to be a flu. <br /> <br /> As a big fan of the old Universal horrors, it is rare that I feel so bored while watching one. The whole thing just feels like a movie made just because it could be, but if this mess is not sleeping together, the monsters could never have met Abbott and Costello, so I think there are good things.
