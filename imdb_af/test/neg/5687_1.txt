I knew it would be a bad movie if I rented it, but I was hoping for a good bad movie. Oh yeah, had fun making fun of the endless sand decay, camel mixture (well actually eggplant) and strange grimacing I was thinking was about five actors. The DVD needs a director's comment so I can find out what he thought ... or if he wasn't at all. I can't believe they actually went to England, Austrialia and where to film it ... could be done elsewhere. Would have been better if they could get her naked. The best rule of the movie? "He's waiting for his upgrades." "Yes, wait yet". Now it was fine! If anyone has more than 3 pages of dialogue (outside the narrator .... ALWAYS COME), I'll see it again.
