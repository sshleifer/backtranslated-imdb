... And the boy is soft. <br /> <br /> I saw it on the Bravo cable channel, one Saturday night, and here in Britain we often have these harsh "erotic" soft core movies late at night on Bravo. This one follows a type of few colleagues who have a virtual reality chapter that makes you sexual fantasies. <br /> <br /> If you've seen one of these movies, you've seen them all with a bunch of bimbos that seem to advertise silicon implants. Come on, I actually saw breasts in real life (I'm sure some of us also have) and they wobble around differently here where they defend the laws of, if not physics, at least gravity. The sex scenes are these boring issues where a well-spoken razor rubs against his fellow star, without any dialogue or sound apart from some muzak and when they look climax, they both seem to have a bad attack of constipation. The girls themselves are very nice especially Brandy Davis and Nikki Fritz, but they are wasted in these kind of soft films <br /> <br /> And if it is fantasy, it is again after I recommend the Lord of the ringing trilogy
