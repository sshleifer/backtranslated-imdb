After 1988, the GJS Amitabh's films lost the quality they had earlier. <br /> <br /> The expansion of HEAD AZAAD HOON released in 1989, which was a good movie reserve, was all movies, mostly except HUM (1991) later in 1991. <br /> one of the crap Amitabh films that people rejected in the early 90s. <br /> <br /> The film he did was like a friendship sign to Shashi Kapoor who directed the movie and he didn't take a penny. The movie also has Rishi and Dimple (not back to RANBHOOMI again) composed) <br /> <br /> The film came in 1991 when Bachchan had 4 releases and 3 flops among them INDRAJEET, AKAYLA, AJOOBA <br /> <Ajooba has 2 years after TOOFAN and JAADUGAR both supernatural movies rejected. It's another kind of crap Bachchan wears a mask and a Krissh outfit and performs the magic of changing one person to a donkey. Of course, in 1991 you can apologize. special effects, but the movie is too bad to look at <br /> <br /> Direction by Shashi Kapoor is not good Musi c is bad <br /> <br /> old and tired, his acting is good, but not in the same way as his best Rishi. Dimple is good, rest is forgetful.
