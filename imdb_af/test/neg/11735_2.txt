Okay, so Gus Van Sant wanted to refine his psycho in color so that he could bring it to modern audiences. They will probably go into cardiac arrest if they ever had to see a movie in black and white, while comfortably forgetting that both "Clerks" and "Schindler's List" are filmed in black and white and are fantastic movies. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the same meticulous people don't want to see a good movie just because it's black. white are the same people who do not want "Psycho" anyway, because they have no murder or sex scene every two minutes. And the murders aren't the creepy blood / guts / gore / bone snapping that people use to see Halloween, Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street. That is why the repetition of "Psycho" was almost exactly as it was originally intended not to work, because it is really only important for people who are fans of the original. Everyone else just watches them leave until the next "Scream" prosecution comes, and so they will be disappointed. "Psycho" stands for tension and mystery, not blood and intestines. (And so, nobody thinks I should be a senior citizen if I like older movies, let me set the record straight by saying that I'm 21.) <br /> <br /> So if the movie is in color was everything that Van Sant wanted to change, why not just color and read the movie? I mean, what's the point to remember a movie if you don't * change something *? The least he could have done was to put his own director's turn on it, rather than just copying Hitchcock's - or even better, a new writer hired a new script from the original "Psycho" book To adapt. But it seems that Van Sant could not decide whether to repeat "Psycho" * exactly * or not. It would have to be a whole or niche project - either fix the film exactly or do it differently - but as it stands, this movie is about 95% the same, but with a few touches it is not. Like having Norman masturbate while undressing on Marion. This does not mean the plot at all, and the only reason he brought it in was because he could *. He wanted to say, "Hitch couldn't show people masturbating in 1960, so I'm going to do it." Whoopee, big deal, like I'm so shocked to see someone masturbating. And what on earth was the point of seeing a few frames of clouds and farm animals in the murder tones? And then he leaves an important scene, where Lila and Sam meet the Sheriff outside the church. <br /> <br /> Plus, with almost the same writing, the whole movie looks a bit like an anachronism. The opening credits say the year is 1998. What about Marion's 60-year-old dress or the parasol she's wearing with her? Why should Marion and Sam have their trysts in a hotel room if nobody is shocked about what they are doing today? Why are there no air conditioners in Marion's office? Why doesn't the Bates motel have any TVs in the rooms and apparently no automatic locks on the doors? Why should the Sheriff ask the operator to connect him to the Bates motel? That was why using exactly the same writing was a mistake - just changing a few words here and there wasn't enough to modernize it. It needed a whole rework. <br /> <br /> While Vince Vaughn turned in a good performance like Norman, he didn't look right for the part. Part of what made the original "Psycho" so terrible was that Norman had that innocent boy-door quality, so no one could believe he was able to do such terrible crimes. With Vince Vaughn playing the role, is anyone really surprised that Norman was a psychopathic killer? <br /> <br /> With that, I understand Gus Van Sant was a fan of the original "Psycho" movie and wanted it to be a tribute. It's not a bad movie, but the problem is that it can be some people's only "psycho" exposure. I really think you should see this movie if you saw the original. Since I'm a fan of anything with "Psycho", I bought a used copy of the remake, which I can occasionally watch. The original movie was a filet mignon, while the remake was a burger. But even filet mignon will be boring if you have it every day, so it's nice to have a hamburger once, for a change.
