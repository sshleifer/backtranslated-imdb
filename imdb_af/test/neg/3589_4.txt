I know, it's a movie. But when it comes to portraying real life (in any case), it should be as faithful as possible. I'm sorry, but "El Misterio Galíndez" is not as accurate as it seems. The Dominican Republic is also not portrayed as it really is. In fact, it shocked me to see the filming of Santo Domingo actually being Cuba. And amazingly, movies with Cuban themes (Havana, The lost city, Bitter Sugar, The Godfather part II) are actually filmed in Santo Domingo! So what happened here? Why did they shoot the movie in Cuba instead of the D.R? The Spanish dialogue with the Cuban accent is terrible! This is not domineering! On the historical level, Galíndez would never have been. He may just as well be shot, beheaded or died from the inhuman torture he received. Then threw his body into the Caribbean Sea. But Trujillo would never have ordered death by stinking. His sick mind would not have allowed it. <br /> <br /> The action is not delivered as expected. Harvey Keitel looks like he's just expecting a salary. I prefer the leading actress in Deep Blue Sea. The rest of the movie would have been excellent in some Cuban films, as well as the chosen shooting range. <br /> <br /> I suggest "La Fiesta del Chivo", best-selling author Mario Vargas Llosa, directed by his cousin Luis Llosa. It's a little more realistic with Dominican history. The Trujillo character is very well portrayed, and the Galindez incident is very briefly covered in this movie.
