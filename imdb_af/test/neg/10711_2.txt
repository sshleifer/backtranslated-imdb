The makers ask for a great suspension of unbelief, you give them the hope that they have given some time, they will convince you that it is possible. Unfortunately, with TV movies, they seem to have been specifically released to make cheap Cosmo questionnaires. With a small budget and big claims you have to spend every penny on the details to convince the audience. Not here. The film gets a few points for the good performance that the two leading ladies give to the chance, but unfortunately it is not enough to save the day. Oh, and the less said, the better the end. Happy movie-watch everyone!
