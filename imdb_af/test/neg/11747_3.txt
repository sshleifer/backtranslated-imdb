Do not be fooled into thinking that this is a remake, as the repetition of THE TIMER is based on a previous movie this year. This is not because it is a senseless movie. This is the director who shot the original camera shot for the shot similar to the "remake" of the way a few years ago. The screens are identical to the original, the dialog is identical to the original, the camera angles are identical, no attempt to decorate or restructure the original script. (But with a director like Van Sant on the steering wheel, we have to be grateful. He's not a Hitchcock. In fact, I can even be correct by saying that the costumes can be the same because the private eye is a pork hat. Don't go out of fashion in the late 1960's? <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Avoid
