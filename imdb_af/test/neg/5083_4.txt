This is the award that has lost me to the Hugos. <br /> <br /> If such a "beautiful" panel can't see or care about the obvious story telling problems of Battlestar Galactica, what is the value of their award? The answer: not much. <br /> <br /> Award-winning shows should be examples of creativity and excellence, and not in BG, in this episode or any other I have seen. <Br /> <br /> Shooting in a deadly video is not "artistic", it's just cheap. Camera shake is not creative. It is vomit-inducing and lazy as it can be. <br /> <br /> All the BG has shown, how corrupt are most academically-awarded awards and how easy it is to buy awards with a lot of PR money.
