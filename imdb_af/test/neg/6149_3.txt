But then again, what ever? I chose it on my local 99-center because you guessed it, 99 cents (plus tax). I remember seeing it on video as a teenager and thinking it was a cool movie. Badly the movie and my memories don't match. Regardless, it's not a terrible way to blow a few hours, and it's neat to see some vintage Bill Paxton and Mark Hamill. Blah .... Blah .... Blah .... Man, oh man, I can't think of anything else about this movie ... (Just fill out the ten line's rule ...) Good golly, that's pathetic, just how bad is this movie that the best I could get with it was five frickin'lines of text? So anyway, ten lines of text, eh? Hmmm, ten lines are hard to come by when you can't remember a movie you just watched.
