Reports of the movie of this movie seem to be too exaggerated, and unless the other reviewers have watched another movie, I do not see how anyone can find this movie, other than boring, unsuitable, irregular, long and sometimes unbearable irritating. I'm not a shocking horror fanatic. Every day I am aware of j-horrors and euro-horrors about US horrors, but I feel the need to warn any potential viewers about this movie before investing two hours of their lives in it. <br /> <br /> It could have been so great. A reporter investigates a series of bizarre deaths and incidents, which are apparently disconnected, but a series of unconscious tropics seem to link them - dead pigeons, sounding sounds, the presence of strangely knots ... Our reporter goes from person to person person, interviews with them, filming and then going on. Three important characters are one of these people, a young, shy psychic girl, a very annoying, mad psychic man and a crazy old woman and her son, whose importance is only revealed until later. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the film is not even remotely interesting, which makes the two-hour running time unforgivable. It's not even scary or awful. Without scary scenes, such as shots of ghoulish faces, being done incredibly poorly, shown twice or worse, we are told when they will happen. Other techniques, such as telling us that a family just interrogated, "questioned five days later," don't care about me, let alone gently creeped. <br /> <br /> The movie picks up a bit at the end, as our reporter, cameraman, psychic and cursed woman goes to a village to "remove" the curse that binds all these deaths. By that time, however, I was in a state of catatonic boredom, and could not care less, so all the rather horrible camera work and shocks messed me up. The "final band" is pretty good, but again I care and just wanted to finish this movie. <br /> <br /> Drilling and boring, not scary and not creepy, I will command you to stay away from Noroi. It has promising moments, but it's a bad movie that's not worth your time.
