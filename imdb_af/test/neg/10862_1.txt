This movie Oh my god, this movie is so poor, I'm surprised I could see it all. <br /> <br /> First of all, I want to say that Vinny Jones should only play a London dwarf period, it's finished with the story. <br /> <br /> Pistololero is so unconvincing his almost comedy. Scared of Dennis hopper and David Carradine, this movie didn't save. In fact, I think it's a total comedy and as a comedy it deserves its 1 star. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs .. Vinny Oh my god I thought I saw it all when he played that Irish Tinker: P <br /> <br /> I think the average viewer will realize that this movie might just be a kind of movie. I can't see how anyone could actually fall into this crap
