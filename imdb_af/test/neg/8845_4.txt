While the design and places and photography are strong assets in this movie; It is a turgid and melodramatic relationship that demonstrates the boundaries of the theater to convey the truth. <br /> <br /> The case is using the soundtrack music: a mix of Gustav Mahler and Andrew Lloyd-Webber playing constantly and loudly, and would have made Max Steiner grimace if it was used, as it command the audience so hard; how ecstatic how tortured it is to be an artist. And then it really counts the story, elite the details at the end. <br /> <br /> This increased and kitsch exploitation of emotions was once made ridiculous by Peter Ackroyd about a Yukio Mishima book: writing it, that's Barbara Cartland. Exactly the same criticism can be made on this film: a fraudulent, mawkish vanity project.
