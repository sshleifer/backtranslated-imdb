Disney-like entertainment with some un-Disney-like moments of graphic violence and sexual references. Lousy comedy with clich√©-driven moralization. Noah as Abraham, Lot as his divine friend. Laughable special effects. Redo with a bad timing. Sodom and Gamaa were destroyed before the Flood? Strange coils and too many subtypes that the Bible does not mention. God, as a dubious father, who should only be entertained by whistling before deciding the world, must be saved from the disaster. <br /> <br /> Bannie Wannabee director John Irvin adds another failure to his worthless list of poorly-directed movies that seriously lacks the plot and direction.
