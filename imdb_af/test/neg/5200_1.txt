Since I have to write at least 10 lines, and this garbage not only earns one, I start with the following: 1. I voted AWFUL for this terribly so-called "movie". <br /> <br /> 2. Let me explain why these turkeys David Varod produces, mainly in my beautiful homeland, shot Bulgaria (only in VAT, for illiterate people - this country is in Europe, north to Greece, and has nothing to do with Mexico. Uruguay) A few years ago NOW Image our country invaded and start making mostly live direct-to-releases. Why here? Because here they pay low fees to the Bulgarian crew and to the Bulgarian actors (most of them distinguish) who are in many ways better than most of their American colleagues. I am personally ashamed of it. The reason for this is of course the eagerness of the Americans involved and their desire to get the most, if not all the profits. Actually, it wouldn't be so bad if the production wasn't so dirty and pale. There has been no good photo shot for years. Currently, the NU image is being accused of the major issue of our national film production center called Boyana Films. There was no doubt about corruption, there was fraud, there was a lie in this recent purchase. The Bulgarian theater is dead. Living the Bulgarian Theater!
