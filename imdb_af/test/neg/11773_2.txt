I saw this one at Sundance, and I can't figure out why it won the live award. It was painfully slow and literally colorless. This is the kind of movie that is only appreciated by movie parties that any movie that many people want to be among them. <br /> <br /> This year's jury at Sundance made a conscious effort to reward the underdog, ultra-low-budget movies. It's all good and good, but this winding, towed mess looks like a home movie. Mini-DV shot in a snow-covered gray winter leads to a deadly look at a killing movie. <br /> <br /> Certain motives (snakes) are beaten to death despite the fact that they do not add anything to the story and do not make sense as symbols. <br /> <br /> It wasn't bad now. Vera Farmiga is phenomenal in her role as a mother with a drug problem. She goes to places and she deserves it. Her fellow student Hugh Dillon also does a good job. Frankly, there are many fine moments in this movie, but they don't fit well together.
