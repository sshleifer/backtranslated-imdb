Like the Tinto Brass ("Caligula"), the people who made this movie cannot tell the difference between explicit and erotic things. Don't build up, just throw naked women on the screen; no, it doesn't work like that. If close-ups of female genitalia are not your thing, prepare to look at many points of the screen (I often did). The "all women are harlots of heart". The mentality of the movie is offensive, and the "story" in turn is absurd and boring (the escape is the boring part!). But halfway there is a random scene coming out of nowhere and one of the (female) prisoners and one of the (male) guards in a nude match she wins with a few judo moves. Although the choreography of the battle is bad, the whole scene is undoubtedly unforgettable. In fact, that scene and fine cinematography are the only two reasons I give this movie * out of 4, instead of 0.
