Maybe it's because I'm not a fan of the comics (but if the comics are of the same quality as the movie, it's hard to believe there are any), but it has to be one of the worst movies ever made is. Non-existent plot, ridiculous acting, dumb dialogue ... This movie is so bad it hurts. Very. That some people actually gave this one is an insult to any good or at least mediocre (or at least bad) movie. If you hate yourself, look at Tank Girl! On another thought, if you hate yourself so much, maybe you should commit suicide ... My review: -34/10
