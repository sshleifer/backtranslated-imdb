My wife and I watched this movie because we were going to visit Sicily and Stromboli soon. Fortunately (or unfortunately) the landscape and seascape (complete with tuna) are the only credible members of this cast. We expected to have a reasonably well written and well-directed film, but were disappointed. The only redeeming grace is an extensive and remarkable sequence of fishes, full of authenticity: cleft tuna, nets, long-rowed wooden boats, and passionate, superstitious fishermen. <br /> <br /> The movie's sequence is striking, its dialogue stilted, and the acting ranges from stiff to completely "over-the-top". One scene highlighting Bergman as her macho, indigenous and naive man, hurting his ferret on an "innocent" (but apparently already deceased) rabbit would be perfect for a Monty Python skit. <br /> <br /> When the volcano blew, we hoped for a gracious end to the suffering (us and the roles). Unfortunately, the film remains on fire, eventually ending in a melodramatic and absurd end. Unless you're really in the old tuna fishing, this hokey is passing through.
