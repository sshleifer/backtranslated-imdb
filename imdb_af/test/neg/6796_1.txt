I just don't understand why anyone ever made a show about one of the largest metropolitan areas in the country (Houston, Dallas, Austin / San Antonio, etc.), they describe the average person as someone wearing wranglers / cowboy hat , talk with a draw, have zero fashion sense and drive a truck on the way to the "saloon" or his next hunting trip, rodeo, skeetskiet or country music concert. I've never seen a small town be a police officer ... anywhere in Texas. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that it's not done for artistic reasons or comedy ... they're really serious and I think the average person is too stupid to know the difference. The bad scripts and the equally bad acting give it away. This show makes a solid performance in the past, as Knightrider looks like a high-brow entertainment. At least Knightrider had the talking car.
