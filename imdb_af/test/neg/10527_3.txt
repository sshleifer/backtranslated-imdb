This movie was disappointing. After 15 years, when it was again to review some information about Mariel Hemingway, I was already reminded of the movie. Remembering Peter O'Toole, I was totally unaware of the fact that the female "leads" (okay - she wasn't much more than an object of discussion in the storyline), was me. Hemingway. I saw this movie in the days when I wrote movie reviews and warned people about it, as the stories just didn't work, and fifteen years of my subconscious mind sorting out still didn't make sense of the flow of ideas. <br /> <br /> Part of this might have to do with the fact that it looked, after the original movie (about which it was going) was also filmed, an editor came in and tried to put something together. add it. I don't know if it was a project of a previous studio boss, and so it was sabotaged to discredit him or her by the successor, or it was a disaster of the original script attempting to save, was unsuccessful. The theatrical version just didn't work.
