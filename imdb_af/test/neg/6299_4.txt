This movie tries hard but fails. Perhaps for non-Australian audiences this can be a travel report, but for the native it is just boring. <br /> <br /> Anyone who lives here knows Broken Hill is a rough, tough, isolated mining town. If some of the identified fruit is towed in the tow, it is all so predictable. Where did I get that well-behaved theme before? Oh yes, Town Mouse and Country Mouse. Save us. <br /> <br /> I was hoping it would improve, but after the Broken Hill scene I could see where it was going and so the TV turned off and went to sleep.
