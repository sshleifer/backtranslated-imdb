'Embarassing' is the only word to describe this laughs awful production. From the blatant disregard of the source material (to make sure someone far from mythology is familiar with the predictable insufficient production value, this whole mini-series is a train wreck. <br /> <br /> The casting (which includes good actors, with whom I am sorry) generates the illogical dialogue in the same generic "European" accent so common to bad epics. Worse is the lack of originality in almost all other aspects, from costumes and set designs (decorating styles from time to time), to the score (which looks many well-known classic songs as well as "Lord of the Rings"). The most abusive of all is the visual effects that it proves manually that if you can't afford to do them well, WRITE THIS. <br /> <br /> It bothered me to see another legendary story set by a cheap "customization." Maybe someday somebody will do it right.
