This ominously boring and unpredictable movie made me suspect that Chaplin was the real Hitler, as only someone as angry as he can torture people with this trip. I saw this movie, which only makes the suffering of this cruelty worse. This movie is nothing more than a pathetic, repetitive movie, but instead of two hours of laughter, it caused two hours of suicide. After the first 10 minutes of this I began to wish the guest of the theater speakers would start sipping. <br /> <br /> If I could give it zero out of ten, I'd love to do it. Avoid at all costs!
