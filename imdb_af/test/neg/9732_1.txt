It looks like a main film company wants to make a movie for teenagers, but it only focuses on one thing: sex. Don't get me wrong, I'm not prudent, but the fact that these people seem to think about getting off my rocks is all I'm interested in being highly offensive. Take the Summary, a movie that so strongly relies on you to find the main characters attractive, it thinks it can get away without a plot and / or a script not written by a six-year-old. This is basically the craft of (so-called) hot guys. And yes, that's it. It bored me to tear. Even my friend, who usually wipes our crap movies, hates it. It's really surprisingly bad, to the extent that it can actually be funny. I would have laughed if it wasn't for the fact that several other women in the movie attendance enjoyed it. They were accompanied by several angry guys who curled up positively and died when the (really clich√©) boy on a boy kissed at the end. Watching them was the highlight of the movie. I don't think mainstream, Hollywood theater will ever broadcast good movies for teenagers (or, indeed, for anyone), so I think I'll give up. Unless you're a teenager who likes the Pussycat Dolls, Paris Hilton thinks it's "hot" and looks at MTV, it's like a kind of desert. Life is difficult if you are a fifteen year old who likes to do business. : (P.S. Someone had to tell the director that not all teenage girls will find, boy members will be "totally HAWL LOL !!! 111 !!"
