Skilled professionals live it in an exotic and dangerous place. They get drunk every night. They smuggle opium. They fall into pigs in parachutes. They fly under impossibly dangerous conditions. They glory strangely and act as weirder. They are iconoclastic, shameful. They violate every order of command and have contempt for their employers at the CIA. They are irreplaceable. <br /> <br /> No. It is not "Angels Only Wings" and it is not "M * A * S * H." It is an uncomfortable mix of the two that unfortunately occur more than stupid or funny. <br /> <br /> It is aimed at shock, entertainment and education, but does not really reach its goals. <br /> <br /> As far as its shock value is concerned, we are now busy, aren't we? Does it really shock anyone that a lot of live pilots flew secret missions in Laos in the 1970s? No, it's not shocking. It is not even educational now, under our current circumstances, when it would be interesting to learn that a paramilitary outing is not buried in a file called National Interest, Defense de Toucher. It is good. So we are a bit awake and no longer so shocking or stupid. <br /> <br /> The problem in this case is that the movie relies on those many features for its power to enjoy. Without it, the movie implies. A group of brave, drunken CIA pilots sit in a cathedral, throwing the girls out, shooting the lights with a silence gun, and throwing lizards together. Ask the new pilot Robert Downey, Jr. "When you act like this, does it mean that there is something to celebrate?" Answer another, guffawing, "No, that means it's night time." It may be funny if we expect apostate pilots to be as upright as the rest of us. If we don't, the gag falls like the movie flat. <br /> <br /> There are, of course, action scenes. Anything that might happen in or out of a plane in flight happens in or to a plane in flight. People dropped out of them, luggage was thrown out of their hatches randomly, engines failed, they sustained damage by AAA, they were torn apart during crash landings, but we saw most of them elsewhere, often done better. <br /> <br /> Some people find it harder than I did, and the acting is pretty good. Robert Downey Jr. is especially effective as the straight man. Look at the other comments and if they describe a movie you might find appealing, look at it in every way. There can be a little laugh in what has escaped me.
