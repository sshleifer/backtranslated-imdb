The movie quickly becomes a huge chase with increasing destruction. The first very bad thing is that the guy who hijacked Steven Seagal is hit by Seagal's management, but that would probably be the whole assumption for the movie. <br /> <br /> They seem to have decided to make all kinds of changes in the movie slot, so just plan to enjoy the action, and don't expect a coherent plot. Wear any logical meaning you have, it will reduce your chances of getting a headache. <br /> <br /> I give myself some hope that Steven Seagal is trying to move back to the type of characters he has in his more popular movies.
