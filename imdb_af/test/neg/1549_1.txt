For a while it seemed as if this show was 24/7. Then there was apparently a second season or another kind of continuation of this terrible show about the two most foolish and conceited people ever filmed. All the other comments perfectly captured the essence of these two selfish, haggish, airheads. Not much can be said about them except what everyone else said. <br /> <br /> I doubt these two ladies have souls, and more than likely, they made a kind of Faustian Bargain to get their lizards. a television series. May fate protect the human race from any more exposure to the Horrific Girls!
