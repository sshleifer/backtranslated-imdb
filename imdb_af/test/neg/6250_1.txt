Before I start, I need to inform you that I love horror movies with a passion. Love them! I saw thousands and rarely do you come together that I don't like. I am very forgiving of the horror genre. One of the greatest lines in the film history is in the movie Ed Wood where Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) comes to the critical producers and shouts after commenting on "Cheap 9 sets and continuity issues of Plan 9," You don 'I have knew nothing! Have you never heard of a suspension of unbelief? "Well, I try the philosophy of the" suspension of unbelief "with me at every horror movie I see and it usually works. Unfortunately, it didn't work for me during the performance of Cheerleader massacre. <br /> <br /> Strike One: <br /> <br /> The first thing you will see about this "movie" is that it is shot on video and has that crummy hand-home digital camera style . The work and quality of the camera is so bad. This makes daytime kissing compared. In fact, it makes Troma and Full Moon videos good. And it's bad. <br /> <br /> Strike Two: <br /> <br /> Jim Wynorski. This "movie maker" probably gives him a flash out of the head, but nothing can come out of the truth. Roger Corman shot fast, furiously and under the budget, but could deliver a stiff original movie. Although Wynorski produces a cheap movie, he cheats his viewers (and perhaps other artists), stealing whole pieces of James Horner's "Humanoids From The Deep" and "Battle Beyond The Stars" musical scores and dropping them in Cheerleader Massacre. On the back of the boxing art and in the beginning the music score is false to Dan Savio (an extra in Wynorski's "Deathstalker II"). You'll also see Cheerleader Massacre jump from video to movie and back, as Wynorski highlights entire scenes of both "Slumber Party Massacre" and "Humanoids From The Deep". Wynorski used this fraud fourteen years ago in his terrible version of "Not of this Earth". <br /> <br /> Strike Three (you're out): <br /> <br /> While Cheerleader Massacre has a little nudity, (40-year-olds playing teens and the roughest fake breasts I ever put in) seen a horror movie), the murders are relatively bloodless. What is it all about? The film is titled, Cheerleader Massacre, but a handful of off-screen murders, in my opinion, does not add to a massacre. It doesn't even add a bad mosquito bite. <br /> <br /> The movie's story is fair enough - invisible killer steals a little cheerleaders (old gals playing teens) until the bus runs off. and the "girls" are forced to hold in a secluded two-storey storehouse. I will not destroy the end, but it is one of those "movies" where the person who is, of course, the killer is not, of course, the killer. Cheerleader Massacre would have been great if it was shot on film, directed by Joseph Zito and had special effects by Tom Savini. Instead, it is an effect-less, shot-to-video transvestig by Jim Wynorski. Ouch. <br /> <br /> I beg you, don't buy or rent this horror. If we support these clowns, the more of this talented video rubbish will produce them. Go out and hire "The Prowler", "The Last House on Dead End Street", "Delirium" or "The Burning" instead. You'll be glad you did.
