I just saw this movie. I kept the soundtrack. I saw the trailer first and was beautiful, like all Hollywood movies, they know how to sell. But the movie is almost terrible, the first 30 minutes are interesting, but then .... like almost all new movies. blow it up. I don't get the idea, why did the child die? Being a clich√©, every nigga movie has to kill a child, and everyone must be good after his death. LOL. I don't understand what the connection is. With the movie ... And so predictable, you know the end of the first minute. Nothing new in this movie. I saw "You have served the same idea, but also ... something new ... it's something like" Honey "but is not a small difference between them. If you do not have another option, look at this movie, but be sure is the last option you take. And the choreography is worse than everything before. It is NOT a must for sure ...
