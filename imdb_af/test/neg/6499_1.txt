In a post-apocalyptic future, the new Highlander is a slightly tiny root, called Quentin MacLeod, which is being cemented by a new Ramirez, while his little sister agrees on their quest to prevent an evil immortal ruler. To do this, Quentin must absorb all the knowledge of other immortals before doing this, Korton,. <br /> <br /> In short, it's pure crap, like the Highlander sequels. Quentin is a pretty stupid character, constantly shaking and groaning and choking in a "woe to me a reluctant hero", and he never touches the fact that he is immortal and cannot be murdered, at least easy. Ramirez would have done better to demolish him and withhold Korton himself.
