Having seen the movie version of Heart Of Darkness, I feel like I've been wasting 100 minutes of my life. Although the book was not my favorite, I was very disappointed to see how badly Nicolas Roeg portrayed the story. Despite the fact that he left out many pieces of important information, it seems that the role doesn't just fit their roles and the whole film looks very emotional. The book shows vibrant scenery and detail that is completely ignored in the movie. <br /> <br /> You'd think a director would fit 76 pages of a book into a movie of at least one hour and a half. The differences completely changed the story for me. For example, when the character of Kurtz's fianc√© is indifferent to the fact that Kurtz died, it completely changes the end of the book the book gave. Not to mention the sets and landscapes used in the film were not as beautiful as they were described. It feels as if Roeg has filmed another story with references of Heart of Darkness embedded in it. <br /> <br /> If you watch the movie without knowing the title or expecting it to be something like Joseph Conrad's story, you might find it good. Although I thought the camera work was poor and the role unfit, it's a fascinating story. However, if you're looking for a good movie version of the well-known classic story, don't look at Roeg's movie.
