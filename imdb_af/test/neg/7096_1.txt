When I watched this movie, I think I was a first-year high school student and I still feel like downloading Master P for the hour and 20 minutes or so that he has taken my life that I will never return. <br /> <br /> The man who has already posted is completely right. Master P is a wannabe mobster. He, like all the other rappers in this country, has made millions of rap CDs sold to young, impressive white children in this country. It is well known that the gang was not a black thing and blacks could not be part of it. Unfairly than rappers may not handle. This movie paints Master P as a mobster called Nino? The writing is terrible with the play that matches. Absolutely incredible. While looking, I got a link or something that said he was planning to make another movie called "The Black Sopranos". <br /> <br /> Please save us and stick to Nickalodeon. You're not a white killer, you're not even a good actor Master P. Please stick to your music for who's listening it today.
