As a young lass, beautiful Joan Woodbury (as Rita Adams) was orphan, after her father shot a chair pigeon. As a young woman, Mrs. Woodbury is struggling to keep a job because her murdered father's former belief status makes Woodbury a bad business risk. Woodbury rooms with the singer Linda Ware (like Donna Andrews), who advises Woodbury to get in touch with old orphanage friends John Archer (like Bob Elliott) and Jack La Rue (as Mickey Roman). But none of her friends can help if Woodbury is the victim of a scam that ends up in jail. At the release, Woodbury decides to give the men a run for their money? <br /> <br /> With the title "Gangs, Inc.", it's a clearly poor, cheap mobster melodrama. Still, it's great fun to see Woodbury's work wonders with inferior materials. She plays the innocently growing sophisticated "Rita" fairly convincingly; and she threw in a big bit like a blonde hooker. Woodbury must be added to the list of unfortunately underused Hollywood actresses of the past. Paper Bullets also features an early Alan Ladd (like Jimmy Kelly also Bill Dugan). Me. True, who sang the hit an apple for the teacher with Bing Crosby, sings some fair '40s numbers nicely. But especially, this is Woodbury's performance. <br /> <br /> **** Paper Bullets (1941) Phil Rosen ~ Joan Woodbury, Linda Ware, Alan Ladd
