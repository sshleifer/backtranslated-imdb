This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Independent or not, solid writing is a must. This for directing and acting. I know these actors can act (I saw them in Sporanos and more ...), but this movie is very bad, very bad. Maybe it's the script, maybe it's the director. Probably a bit of both ..... Probably a lot of both! Technically OK, Just bad, bad, bad ... I have a theory that the backs for this movie also own the Poker Magazines, because I saw a very favorable review in one of the magazines. "Hey, we made it, so it must be good, right?" Not so fast Bucky. I know it takes a lot of hard work and money to make a movie, sell and distribute much less, and for that I recommend these people. But the final product leaves a bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> P.S. I won a free rental and chose this movie from Blockbuster. Tomorrow I'll get my money back.
