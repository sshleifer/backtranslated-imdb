Years ago I deliberately watched bad movies. Somehow I missed this one. No gesture rings are true. No facial expression fits the scene or action. I have never heard such inappropriate music for a movie. At the last scene, I waited for the car to run over that ridiculous child - one of the worst child actors ever. <br /> <br /> Only one name I've ever heard - Wilford Brimley. He had to be very hungry to take this part. <br /> <br /> DO NOT BE UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES, BE THIS MOVIE !!! YOU ARE WARNING!
