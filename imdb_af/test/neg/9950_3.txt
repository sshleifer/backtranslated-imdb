The Mad Monster starts in Dr. Lorenzo Cameron's (George Zucco) laboratory as he discovers his discovery of how to turn a man into a fierce wolf like monster by injecting animal blood into a human subject which is his dull servant Petro is. (Glenn Strange), apparently he plans to put the serum at the disposal of the war department who will use it to create an unstoppable army of these monsters, the ultimate soldier! First, first, like Dr. Cameron's interests, he forced some sweet revenge on the people who had fired his experiments, to resign him and expose him to the public. Dr. Cameron puts his plan into action and uses his monstrous creation to kill Professor Blaine (Robert Strange). Dr. Cameron can't control the animal and is traced by a local farmer Jed Harper (Eddie Holden). who spreads the news like a wildfire, in another unfortunate coincidence, a reporter named Tom Gregory (Johnny Downs) gets the story of the story and begins investigating, he begins to suspect dr. Cameron and since joining Gregory with his daughter, Lenora (Ann Nagel) He has enough opportunity to sniff around ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Sam Newfield, it's really low-budget 40's and even worse , these are dull, unauthorized low budget materials. Fred Myton's script drags out the extremely thin presentation after almost 77 minutes. It's too long, there's no variety in the story and it's basically the same thing over and over. The character is dull clich√©s, the mad scientist who performs meaningful experiments that create the monster, the fragile, beautiful daughter, the reporter who plays the hero and happens accidentally, is to investigate the mysterious deaths, the mad scientist said. for and is romantic. involved with his daughter, the stupid washbasin, stupid idiotic police and stereotypical hail-throwing farmers who are always accused of being drunk. It was probably clicked in 1942! The movie is slow and slow, and Newfield driver never manages to maintain or generate excitement or atmosphere. It's a bad thing. Technically speaking, the movie is not good, of course the budget is trivial and the crazy monster looks like an old homeless wino who has not shaved for a few weeks and put some plastic joke in his mouth. The black and white cinematography is basically and statically like most movies of this period, while the good dr. Cameron's lab consists of a sofa and a table, with a few pity pieces of scientific equipment on top. The play is stiff and wood with Petro looks as if he is baptized throughout the film, Zucco is not convinced as the mad scientist and is forgotten. The Mad Monster is a nice horror movie. There is very little here to entertain, although at least I ended it in a single sitting, which, if I think about it, is a bit of a performance in itself!
