I heard about this movie by a friend, it was supposed to be a thrill, but what I watched was not a thriller. It was more like a poor effort at one. Amber Smith was a bright spot - it could give her too much credit. The scenes she was in bed with the actress Erika Michels was also paralyzed. The two actresses didn't sound at all with each other. Amber Smith was out of this gal's league, and it certainly showed on camera. She didn't look in those screens at all. I was disappointed that a friend of my husband obviously pumped this movie into something "awesome", but it was more like watching dime store porn.
