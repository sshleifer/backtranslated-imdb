When I heard Disney was entitled to "Underdog", I thought it would be at least a cool Pixar partnership, and we'll get a great Adult & Kids movie like "The Incredibles". Unfortunately ... I forgot how Disney should get rid of the classic stuff for today's dumbed-down youth. What do they think? "Underdog" was a product of the 60's, your Prime Fanbase is in their 40's and 50's, why would you change it to 5-year-olds again? It had been done ala "Roger Rabbit", half animated half ware. Instead, we get characters like Riff Raff (a WOLF !!) immersed in another dog. "Underdog" cannot have an "energy pill" because we're so "lighted" now. This will, of course, be a steroid or drug reference. The only good decision was Patrick Warburton as "Cad" because he really looks like sorta like the cartoon version. Otherwise, old school "underdog" fans should avoid it as the plague is. What next? A live action version of "The Go-Go Gophers" disguised as a revisionist history lesson? (My advanced excuses if Disney jumps on this!)
