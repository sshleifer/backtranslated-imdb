I am a longtime fan of the original of this movie (Bella Martha / Mostly Martha), and everything that makes the movie look good, is missing from this one. I miss the slow pace, the building of characters and their style in small gestures, the domination of lights and moods and moving over dialogue. I don't think the story itself is enough. Martha / Kate is more isolated, and Mario / Nick is not a fool. In most cases, the things that make one play in the original are not here in his copy. The small changes take away the tension. My opinion is that you have to look at the original. This will be worth the inconvenience of captions.
