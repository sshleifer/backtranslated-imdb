Have you ever noticed how many really bad movies are getting so many 10/10 votes? Not much of a mystery how it happens, but it's not much of a movie. There are two ways to see if they give in the Mail on Sunday. <br /> <br /> 1. It's free, so you can't complain too much about it. 2. It's free, so it can't be much good. <br /> <br /> My vote is number 2. The free DVD in Sunday newspaper stuff is a recent trend and some big old movies were given away. They are the ones who have been making years and most of the money they've ever made, so it's a case of anything else is a bonus. It's the last stop for old movies, not the first for new ones, so you can guess how bad it should be to rent TV and DVD. <br /> <br /> The pluses are that Vinnie Jones is trying hard and Derek Jacobi is good as Dickens. The minus points are a longer list. Trying is not the same as succeeding for the poor Vinnie and Jacobi's other tramp character is talkative ham that is gone. The story is very poor. The Dickens story has nothing to do with the film's murders and feels like another movie slapped on the screen to make people think it's a British Dan Brown without religion. Supporting role-players are also there for the money (Vanessa Redgrave really has to be hard) or because they are friends or girlfriends of the filmmakers. It is also very, very long for what it is. <br /> <br /> Vinnie takes his valuable Dickens story with him in his jacket pocket everywhere, is good for a few laughs, but that's it. Not funny and not very good, even free.
