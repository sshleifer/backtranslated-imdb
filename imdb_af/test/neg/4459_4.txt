Although I enjoyed the SATANIC RITES of Dracula (1974), I knew I shouldn't expect too much of his even more malignant predecessor! The least of the Hammer Draculas (Marcus Hearn on Audio Commentary for THE CREEPING FLESH [1973] goes even as far as calling the studio's nadir!). The movie really thrives because of its completely unhip - and now shamefully dated - Updating the myth (the contemporary environment is better suited for SATANIC RITES). Although the truth is told, it is still much better to drink like Dracula 2000 (2000) or VAN HELSING (2004)! <br /> <br /> Despite Christopher Lee's fast bashing of the movie, he still cuts an undeniably striking figure as the dead vampire (though he looks very little and is inexplicably limited to one institution); Similarly, Peter Cushing delivers his usual dedicated performance. The only other notable acting work in the film is that of Christopher Neame (son of director Ronald) as Johnny Alucard (!) - even if it's just because of how incredibly hammy it is! Unfortunately, the two most famous female members of the film (both horror regulators) - Stephanie Beacham and Caroline Munro - do not rise above their physical characteristics. <br /> <br /> The camera work was done by Dick Bush (who shot the BLOOD ON SATAN CLAW [1971], and for Hammer, then DINOSAURS THE EARTH [1970] and TWINS OF EVIL [1971] - but is Perhaps best known for his long-standing association with Ken Russell), which manages some driving ambiance, especially during three major rows: the carriage ride at the (properly Gothic) begin; the hysterical Black Mass sequence, followed by the resuscitation of Dracula; and the final confrontation between Lee and Cushing's Van Helsing.
