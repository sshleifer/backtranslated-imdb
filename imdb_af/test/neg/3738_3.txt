Celebrity singers have always had a difficult time breaking into the movies (the movie is full of unsuccessful attempts), and one can still speculate why John Mellencamp never made it an actor. Instead of taking small parts into sincere projects, Mellencamp dives right into the lead of "Falling From Grace", which he also directed, and the results are as uncomfortable and unpleasant as that title. The story of a well-known singer returning to his hometown in the sticks, opening up old family wounds, boasts a screenplay by Larry McMurtry, but the winding film doesn't go anywhere. The supporting role is decent, including Kay Lenz (who's always watching), Mariel Hemingway and Claude Akins (who share the very strong scene in the picture). Regarding John's acting, he doesn't seem very comfortable, despite efforts to make him look at home; He seems to ducking the camera most of the time, and he never connects with the audience in an instant. * 1/2 of ****
