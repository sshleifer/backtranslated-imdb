First, I'm a big fan of Tolkien, and as one I will base most of my critic on his books. <br /> <br /> The movie is a standard adventure movie, well made with some special effects, good sound tracking and fine. Now if this movie is called something other than the lord of the rings, the reviews will not be half as good as they are here. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that it is the basic story line of Tolkien's books, but then it and all that Hollywood can do, many scenes from the book are equally missing or changed, the characters become Also, changing the book, something I think must be punishable! What the film lacks is a deep insight into the characters in it. I know it's almost impossible to make a good movie out of a good book, and it didn't work here, mostly the motivation of the characters is over best. <br /> <br /> As an adventure movie, it would rate 7 +/- 10. As an adaptation of Tolkien it is 2/10 <br /> <br /> I mean honestly, what did Arwen do on earth at rivendell ford? And for the comment that this movie is "the best ever" I can only say that the ecker is very young or you haven't seen good movies. <br /> <br /> Peter Jackson had to call this movie and adventure movie based on the lord of the rings.
