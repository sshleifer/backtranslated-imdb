Two things are always signs that you are going to watch a bad movie: <br /> <br /> 1) If you are immediately reminded of other movies such as THE TERMINATOR, HARDWARE or BLADE RUNNER in the title order <br /> <br / 2) If there is a death during a sex scene, directly to the title sequence <br /> <br /> There is actually a third warning sign and a caption indicating lazy outline which the poor are ignorant. naively heard of the dangers of corporate greed. Guess what ? CYBORG 2 begins with a caption warning us of corporate greed in the future, followed by a title sequence that reminds me of THE TERMINATOR, HARDWARE and BLADE RUNNER followed by a death during a sex scene! Hey, you don't think I'll see a bad movie by any chance? <br /> <br /> As you can guess, it's a bad movie. It's basically a series of action scenes written around a threadless plot of a cyborg running from a greedy corporate company. It's badly written, directed and acted and especially it's badly lit, which makes it very difficult to see what's happening on the screen, but I'm not quite sure it's a bad thing. The only interest is that it is the movie debate of Angelina Jolie playing the cyborg at stake and what the prophetic line says: "They love, I wonder if they really are?" What is something I ask myself when I see one of her movies
