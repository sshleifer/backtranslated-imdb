"Mr And Mrs Smith" is one of the not-known American American Hitchcock films. But if 'Rescue boat' (which unfortunately also belongs to this category) is an underestimated masterpiece, not all the movies were signed by the master of tension at that time (early 40's) really worth seeing. And to tell the truth, the discovery of this movie isn't really lost. <br /> <br /> "Mr And Mrs Smith" is an average and conventional screwball comedy, where it is difficult to find the Hitchcock's touch. . Perhaps you can get a glimpse of his shadow (which is not much) in the cruelty that Carole Lombard is sometimes capable of (but well hidden in an impersonal package), in a vertigo scene where two of the characters on top of the foot trapped by a trade fair attraction, and perhaps in the character of the mother. And it's about it! Even for the Hitchcock fan, there is little to join. <br /> <br /> And for the screwball comedies amateur there is not much more: nothing of the situation is exaggerated enough to be really funny, and we are far from the masterpieces of Hawks for example. And if one or two scenes are quite amusing, it's not even the funniest thing in Hitchcock's filmography, which has created comic situations in almost all its movies (even "Psycho" can be considered very dark humor). So, there is really little to save in this movie, which no one can annoy (or maybe just both Hitchcock's hardcore fans and screwball comedy, in love with Carole Lombard), remains one of the not-known American Hitchcock Movie.
