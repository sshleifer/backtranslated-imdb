Pathway is a B-western with some great pretensions. But it is in Hollywood history for a most ominous reason. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie with its musical score, which can only be described as overbearing, I have a feeling that Howard Hughes is trying to do is a singing cowboy for RKO movies. They already had Tim Holt who was so reliable a B-photo cowboy hero, was there, but he wasn't a singer. I think Hughes saw how money Herbert J. Yates invaded Roy Rogers in the Republic and decided he would also get one. So Terry Gilkyson, who was a very good artist and much better song. author recruited and sung his material that was not his best and worse, looked like their shoes in the picture. But worse than that, there is this annoying chorus that sang much of the story and overwhelmed the actors, extras and even horses. Needless to say Terry should never be a cookie cookie. But he wrote such classics as The Bare Necessities and Dean Martin's big hit, Memories are made of this. <br /> <br /> The plot relates to an inner woman at a stage jewel robbery. That's right, the criminals who plant Gig Young, Myron Healey, and Ken Koutnik plant Virginia Gray in the coach as a passenger they receive carry valuable jewelery. <br /> <br /> It's a good act, Gray and Young, pull off. Young takes her away from the coach to presumably be a fatal worse than death and they do the scene correctly in the ears of the passengers, but what he does is to lower her. Last place can watch the authorities, if she doesn't run away with it. <br /> <br /> But if they flee the robbery, it's on tired horses, so they stop at a cabin to take some replacement heads and shoot three Navajos. objecting. This puts the Navajos back on the warpath, did not help one of the victims was the chief Ric-Roman brother. <br /> <br /> It is the situation where Captain Brian Donlevy has to deal with the fort when the coach and The Outreachers come there for protection. How it all works out is predictable, but in a foolish kind of overproduction way. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is the problem with the SleepDown. It's a simple, uncomfortable B-creature that picked up in something almost grotesque. <br /> <br /> But the real reason for the hit test in history is that this movie apparently indicates the official start of the blacklist. Originally, Howard DaSilva had to play Donlevy's role and perhaps finish his play when Howard Hughes officially fired him for communist sympathy. His scenes were shot out with Brian Donlevy again. <br /> <br /> Regardless of what a fiasco this movie has changed, I'm not sure Donlevy or DaSilva Hughes had to resign or keep him in his private.
