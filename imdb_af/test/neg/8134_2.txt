This movie has some good performances, as others have pointed out, but suffers (as others have pointed out, except for the people who are apparently friends of the filmmaker or the movie to explain otherwise why they should make it a "10" view of some self-confident and self-absorbed film school stuffing and excess premises. This is the kind of plot that Sex In The City could handle in a half-hour episode, so there was no reason that it would even be an 88-minute movie. A perfect example of the wasted footage is the fast forward fitting in the first third of the movie. Some of the back stories have been earned, but too much time has been spent on Daria character at the anal sex and on the back story for Paulie, who was not a realistic character, although the actor did a decent job with the lines he given. <br /> <br /> The worst aspect of the movie was the level of amateurish parts: from tipos in the typed material, to bad jumps and modifications, poor camera positions, angles, lighting problems throughout and, most sharply, a weak written writing with a poorly developed concept. If the writer (also the director and chief) worked with someone, he might not have ended up with a 100% rattan on Rotten Tomato, further enhancing the ability of anyone to give the people it 10 to the rating system. here.
