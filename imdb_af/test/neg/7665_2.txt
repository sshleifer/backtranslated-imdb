'Airport 4' is basically a mess for Universal Studios to try a new turn - the Concorde supersonic airliner - in their 'disaster-in-the-air' formula. <br /> <br /> With unintentional humor, the best of it is when George Kennedy puts his hand out of Concorde's window at supersonic speed to fire a firearm at a heat-seeking missile to the plane's flight path and The simple fact that these stupid passengers are back on board the same plane to continue their flight despite all the problems in the air. Many stars in this one, including Robert Wagner, Sylvia Kristel, Alain Delon and Martha Raye as a nerve passenger. <br /> <br /> Not really related to other 'Airport' movies.
