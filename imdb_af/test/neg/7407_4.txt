* These comments may technically contain "spoilers", but it certainly does not contain any surprises. <br /> <br /> My cousin and I hired it the other day and hope to have a good laugh at a typical amateur. Movie. Unfortunately, we didn't laugh too much, and we certainly didn't have too many scares. <br /> <br /> Plotskets: An airplane with a company's main daughter and some strange pieces of technology fall into an area where our furry friend lives, so the head of the company is a team of personalities, rather as skilled hunters, gather to repair it. <br /> <br /> For the first three quarters of the movie, things get very boring. It consists mainly of shots of Big Foot that sneak into the trees, with party members who have heard from time to time, and give it as nothing. We also see some shots of the party through Big Foot's point of view, and he apparently sees in thermal vision. <br /> <br /> To set up the plot, our group of groups around the campfire should look at the possibilities of justifying the existence and actions of the sasquatches. "Maybe he can dodge bullets ... if he sees them coming". Sure enough, we see later he can. "There are many unprecedented countries where the sasquatch may live. Maybe it's one of those overlooked." And of course it is. "Maybe the Sasquatch is angry because the plane hits one of its relatives." And sure enough, that's the case. Along with those scenes, there are some of "Oh my God, that's the sasquatch, I'm just waiting for you!" Scenes, and unfortunately, they are among the frightening. <br /> <br /> Then, finally, people are dying. Well, at least 2 people. In addition, the bodies of previous victims are discovered. The dead scenes are pretty lame. This usually leaves it just after our imagination, by grabbing the Sasquatch and then cutting it to another scene, but first we are treated to some horrible crooks of the camera. <br /> <br /> Then we finally see the protagonist's final confrontation with the monster. I must admit, I found it very exciting while it lasted. But unfortunately, it is fairly brief, and after we are put to an end, which makes half an effort to look cryptic. Then, some concluding text with a little boring conclusion. <br /> <br /> I can't say I recommend this movie. It's not quite bad enough to give the Mystery Science Theater 3000, and it's definitely not awful enough to enjoy a horror movie. Don't just bother with that.
