I like YOU. It does have its charm, but lately it's too much propaganda in it. For an outsider (a non-American), the patriotic feeling may be a bit too much. <br /> <br /> I don't think Rabb and MacKenzie are lawyers (as they were in the early parts of the TV) to become superheroes that stop wars and save entire continents. It's almost like watching a recruitment video from the US Army. <br /> <br /> I'm still watching the show, so it's not that bad. But I would prefer more episodes than Rabb and MacKenzie investigate military accidents and not save the world in the future.
