Do you hear that sound? This is the sound of H.G. Wells, who rolls over in his grave, between this version and Spielberg's film abortion, was a difficult year for the classic novel. But Steven did at least some things compared to this crapperella. Hello, the ships weren't big insects, they had names. They were Tripods and the strangers worked in threes. The ships and the aliens were wrong, you didn't really get the strangers to the end. The effects and the throw work well. But these actors are much better than earning this "movie". The bulk, if not all, of the movie, is the Howell character who wonders about the destruction, meets one person, joins him and loses them for some reason. There are no more than two people on camera at any given moment, but most of the movie. It was as if they had filmed three at the same time, if the film was about budget or something. So bold is the only and comfortable and customized adaptation of the WORLD STORY story, the GEORGE PAL version, back in the 1950s. THE BLACK HOLE.
