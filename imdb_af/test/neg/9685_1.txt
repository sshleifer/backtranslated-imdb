Although I have great interest in Biblical movies, I was bored every minute of the movie. Everything is bad. The movie is too long, the play is most of the time a Joke and the script is terrible. I didn't get the point of mixing the story about Abraham and Noah. So if you appreciate your time and common sense stay away from this horror.
