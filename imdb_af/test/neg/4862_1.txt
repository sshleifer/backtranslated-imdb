Funny thing. Charlie Sheen, Donald Sutherland, Sam Waterston, and Stephen Lang all had incredible performances. Who can forget Sheen if the clod is naive in Wall Street, or Sutherland as the cynical Korean war surgeon in MASH? Waterston and Lang both had successful TV and film careers (Law and Order, Killing Fields, De Niro's Tribeca, etc.). So what in the world will any of these fine actors do in a stink bomb like this? <br /> <br /> Shadow's conspiracy's plot of a Washington coup is not really that bad, not original, but not so bad. . Sure it was done (Seven days in May - a fine movie!), But with a little tweaking, it could still be entertaining. <br /> <br /> Shadow Conspiracy's biggest problem is in execution. Early in the film Sheen, political strategist extreme, inspired and insulting a potential public relations gambling by expressing a congressman. Later, with Lang's mute hit, the firearm declared half of what Georgetown was supposed to be a gang war on the news. Did anyone who remotely linked to this movie ever live in Washington for a day? Sheen is about 20 years too young, far too young, to be so senior in a White House administration. Sheen's response to a political crisis is so fraught with fake machismo. He seems to be attending the David Hasselhoff school. And when was the last time gang gangs spread to Georgetown? We are talking about a section of Washington where citizens voted to stop a subway so they could keep their exclusivity. <br /> <br /> I agree with another reviewer that this movie would be unbearable without the quick button. I signed it from HBO a year ago and then took three separate views to go through it. <br /> <br /> In summary: Don't buy this movie. Don't rent this movie first. If you see it at Blockbuster, run away as fast as you can.
