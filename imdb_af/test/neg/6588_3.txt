The biggest problem with 9th Company (9 Rota) is that it is not sure if it wants to save Private Ryan or Full Metal Jacket. The attempts at Spielberg's sentimentalism are embarrassing, such as the Burley sergeant crying in a field of red flowers !!! The training sequence has nothing of intensity or realism that Kubrick gave them in his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Another disadvantage is that the Afghan fighters are called Ghosts because they are strike and almost ever seen. Here they attack a Russian strong hold almost in formation without trying to use cover. I'm sure tactics have been going on since Waterloo. <br /> <br /> Each scene in this movie was previously seen in other war films and performed significantly better. <br /> <br /> I have to ask: Why should all talented batsmen cheat on a match? <br /> <br /> Finally, I am always suspicious of a movie that starts with no narrative, but must qualify the end. <br /> <br /> "We won!" ... errrr ....... no you didn't.
