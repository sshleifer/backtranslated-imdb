At the beginning of the film, Paleontologist Donald Sutherland arrives at the Argyle family's home and it appears that he is the indisputable alibi for one of the members who killed his mother two years ago. Your sensation is that you're about to see a top thriller; An innocent man was found guilty and there is another killer. But as the film goes, your disappointment becomes inevitable. <br /> <br /> "Ordeal by Innocence" is a dull and sometimes boring movie that doesn't increase at any moment. Nothing interesting happened long ago and even the final disclosure of the facts lacks surprise and intensity (whether you guess or not). <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland, Cristopher Plummer, Faye Dunaway and Sarah Miles (far from her good performance in "Ryan's Daughter") are just going through their roles and not very enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> You won't miss much if you hit this one.
