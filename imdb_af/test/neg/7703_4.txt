Let me start by saying that I am a great fan of Abbie Hoffman and read this book and steal this urine test. Also an even bigger Jerry Rubin fan. But his movie was a disturbing stack of garbage that made a lot of PG version of Abbie Hoffman. The director had no chance of making Abbie Hoffman interesting in this movie. They denied Stew Albert as a cartoon chjaractor of Intellegence, the man was a pro in Berkley for Christsakes. Okay, they've done a lot of decisive work for Anita Hoffman, a Horrible Job Casting for the Jerry Rubin character did. I just think the movie doesn't fit the news flags I've seen from Abbie or the books he wrote. The movie just didn't fit and upset me. Oh yeah and teat is the absolute worst voice I've ever heard from Richard Nixon. This is one of the few movies I have ever rented out, which I could not quite afford because I have a passion for Abbie Hoffman and his outrageous band of Yippies and this movie was just bad. And it hurt me when people see a movie about the yippies, they will see a terrible adjustment and not get a real sense of reality. Instead, they get a hollywoodized palace of crap. <br /> <br />
