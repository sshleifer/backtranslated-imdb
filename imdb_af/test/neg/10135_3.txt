I know it's impossible to keep all the details of a book in a movie. But this movie has changed almost everything for no reason. In addition, many changes made the story illogical. A few examples: 1) In the movie "Paul Renauld", Poriot really met before he died (in the book Poirot only gets a letter), telling him he is afraid to kill. It's completely stupid, because if Renault's plan were successful, Poirot would have known that the dead would not have been Renauld. (Poirot was in the mortuary when Mrs Renauld identified the victim). 2) The movie has two people in one! "Cinderella" was removed by the film. The girl Hastings falls in love and Jack Renauld's ex-girlfriend is one in the movie! Why for God's sake? 3) Hastings finds the victims because he is such a bad golfer. Totally unfriendly and stupid. 4) The movie tells secrets much too early (for example at the beginning). So you know things you shouldn't know. 5) The killer is shot at the end by someone who doesn't exist in the book. Maybe because the person ("cinderella") who stops the killer does not exist in the movie. 6) The book is very complex. The movie lasts only about 90 minutes. Certainly, it is difficult to include all the necessary details, but it is impossible if you include stupid things that are not in the book and have no meaning (eg cycling).
