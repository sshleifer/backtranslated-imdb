Some may recall whether the movie Juno has seen a scene where Ellen Page for a moment of praise for Dario Argento's Suspiria, her favorite horror movie. Jason Bateman's character then asks if she's ever seen a Herschel Gordon Lewis movie, and he has a copy of a movie (I forget about that right now) and shows it to her. When I saw Juno, I saw Suspiria and some Argento movies, but not Lewis. Now I can see that it is not just another of Diablo Cody's pop culture "in" references, but something that is actually an indication of the taste of the characters and perhaps more subjective, how to judge them by their taste. In other words, Herschel Gordon Lewis' reputation has been maintained for many years after ending his gore films - and that of a Schlock-Meister, no longer. Actually less. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to use Argento as a comparison, since both filmmakers approach, at least in the case of The Gore Gore Girls and, indeed, any given Argento image, similar material. Where Argento is extremely aware of his craft, to get an audience in whatever small story exists through the movement of camera and music and style, Lewis takes the easy route to get to an audience, which with a immature writing is (lightly) light direction. The Gore Gore Girls unveils a filmmaker who is not interested in entertaining his audience in a truly compelling way as a horror movie, but as a sideshow or brothel. He can't make the actors worthy, it looks like it's a porn movie. And for everybody it might be clever or funny one-liner, there are ten that are either totally stinky or too clever, or half or not smart enough. <Br /> <br /> It is said, perhaps, as the best content thing to say about The Gore Gore Girls, a riddle film about a detective (2nd class Sherlock Holmes guy played by Frank Kress) and A newspaper reporter (dummy Amy Farrell) examines a series of go-go dancer murders, serving as the template for many more Troma style films. Maybe it's dull praise, and it's really the best thing that can really be said is that Henny Youngman- "Take my wife, please!" - has a few scenes and steals each of them without trying much. It's sad because it can be the kind of picture that can entertain at a very bad level. But even at that point, one can be more embarrassed to the production, some of the actors (that is, the man who plays the policeman, plays), than from a guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> Even the Gore itself is somewhat of a dilapidated one. At first one thinks Lewis is at least at the end of this case and shows that these women are murdered in crazy and evil and exaggerated ways. But with the murder everything goes beyond what is necessary; I don't mean it with respect to shock value, because it's good. But there must be something else to really hold it. It shows that women's faces are being dissected and the eyes are golden when you are 12 and see it as one of your first horror movies. It turns out, dare I say, boring. It was Lewis's last film until 30 years later, a seemingly worthy swan song came with a sequel to a film he had previously brought out of his life. retirement of movies and work in writing on books on how to make it in business. But any experience he gained shows. It's not a failure, but it could have been, and it's just simple ... slap. Take it or leave it.
