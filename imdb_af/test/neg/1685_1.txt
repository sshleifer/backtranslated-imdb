Let's be realistic here. This is one of the worst shows I've ever seen. My wife and children showed real promise in their first season and then just went to the mountain. It's so bad that words aren't described. The acting and writing are so terrible on a consistent basis. I wonder if Damon Wayans put such an awful performance to the test. From top to bottom, each performance is ridiculous. Damon Wayans puts it in completely and George Gore II is so horrible that I drop down at every exaggerated line. Can anyone really see this show and find it fun, let alone, funny? Please request me. Don't watch this show. Once TV affiliates stop picking it up in syndication, we can finally get rid of this absolute rubbish.
