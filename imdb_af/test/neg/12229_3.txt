A comedy featuring inspiring sports films, The Comebacks tells the story of an out-of-luck coach, Lambeau Fields, who misfits a lot of colleagues and drives them to the soccer championship. In the process, this life-long loser discovers that he is a winner by saving himself, saving his relationship with his family and friends and finding that there is indeed no "I" in "team"! <br /> <br /> I decided to watch the bad version for this movie. It was thirty minutes longer and I could be better than the scene release, and hear people hated this movie. Thirty minutes of extra material can instantly add a movie. Well, I was probably wrong. It was just as bad as the recent "Meet the Spartans", but it was thirty minutes more of torture! <br /> <br /> Seriously, who makes a two-hour ghost movie?! A spray film is short because if it goes longer, it will be too much! Honestly, I love stupid comedies. Heck, I like "Date Movie", "White Chicks," "Epic Movie," and "Little Man"! I think when it comes to flip flops, it's either a hit or a miss and this one definitely missed. <br /> <br /> On the lighter side, of the many jokes in this movie, I will have about six or seven laughed, even some that make me laugh aloud. But it doesn't say much. Following those jokes were more scenes of torture and infertility. <br /> <br /> I can't see how people would say it's not a horrible movie. In fact, there is so much product placement here like Meet the Spartans, there are so many dance series, and unprecedented jokes. I'll say another thing I like about this movie is the songs. They are very good songs here. Generally, watch it if you want to have movie movies. If you like funny movies, skip it.
