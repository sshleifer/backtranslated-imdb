After nearly killed by a big dog, a stray cat thinks to herself: "Why can't I be a skunk? Then everyone will leave me alone." She looks around the junkyard and gets an idea: white paint, black paint and some Limburger cheese and some garlic ...... hmmmm. The next thing you know is our predecessor to Pepe Le Pew, although she is still a cat in this cartoon, she is a hair, and just a skunk in disguise. <br /> <br /> The cat also enjoys and fully enjoys her new status as a smelly skunk. He's a happy, happy man now ..... to a real skunk (with the Charles Boyer imitation voice) appearing! <br /> <br /> I appreciated the cat at a Bugs Bunny outfit appreciated. In general, I have never cared about these French take-off characters, found the stereotypical dialogue exaggerated and not really funny, so I only consider it "justified". However, I do this a point for the moral at the end of the story.
