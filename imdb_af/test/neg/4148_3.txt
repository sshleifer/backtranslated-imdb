Exclusive from Troma (which is my favorite movie company). Unspeaksble is a messy horror movie that can be interesting but very dark and twisted. <br /> <br /> Inexpressible starting with a family in a car, they hit in an accident that lets a daughter die and a mother deformed. The father eventually gets mad and beats prostitutes. He sees his daughter in other people. He killed her. Meanwhile, his wife who is now deformed is raped by her orderly. These are sick people! <br /> <br /> Inexpressibly trying to be sick and disturbing and doing it as a good horrorflick, it's not. Most Troma movies have a sense of humor, but that doesn't mean.
