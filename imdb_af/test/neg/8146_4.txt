Froggie is upset that he never has a great feast like all the other kids. Spanky and the gang are trying to fix it by giving him a surprise party. Unaware that all the decorations and preparations are for him. Froggy sabotage everything just to find out that the festival is for him. <br /> <br /> Okay, our Gang comedy is working and starting. The bits work but I don't think it really works as a whole. Part of the problem is that we all know where it is going and as much of the humor has to be a form of surprise to be able to work, the whole thing falls down. I think in a strange way the movie just misses something. This is the kind of thing they actually thought of, maybe something more than a rubbish burn. Worth trying if you lower your expectations
