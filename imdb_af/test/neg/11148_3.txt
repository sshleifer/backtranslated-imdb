I felt the movie was rushing, and the play was full of holes. Arnold was good, but the head girl was stupid and the man who played the devil was terrible. The story was confusing and idiotic. The film had no meaning and was incredible. The movie is not the worst movie but is not too far from it. Overall I was very disappointed, it could have been much better. My score is a 3 out of 10
