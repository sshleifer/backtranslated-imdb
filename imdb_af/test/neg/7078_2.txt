I saw the movie yesterday and stopped it halfway because I felt it was a waste of time. The idea of ​​making a movie through the eyes of a captain - one of the "evil guys" in most fantasy and medieval films is wonderful and offers many possibilities, but the movie can't catch one of them. I didn't feel for any of the characters, the plot was too predictable (to the point that I followed it) and the second lapse of the storyline stopped me. Those who have a deep insight into the emotional situation of a Middle Eastern chief, a social wiped out to that time, may be disappointed.
