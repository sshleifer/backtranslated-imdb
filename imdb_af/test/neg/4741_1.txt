Ed Wood rolls into his grave. He could have made a hundred cult classics for the price of this apostate. The worst writing in memory (it shines "X-Men 3" like "Citizen Kane"); the most amateur rule; pre-K cinematography; the bareest "special effects" (I'm talking about "Friday the 13th" prosecution area); and throw a useless, rebellious, deeply disturbed maternity ward. The lack of talent or sensitivity that this garbage puts on the screen is amazing. That the "industry" should be rewarded by anyone involved in this celluloid cess pool with future projects must be a serious alarm.
