Jonathan Demme is such a character-oriented director that he sees that he is pulling a Brian De Palma (that is, Hitchcock). It's almost predictable if he doesn't get a lot of tension in this lukewarm secret. Demme tries out a script by David Shaber, of Murray Teigh Bloom's novel, somewhere to strike a line between Alan J. Pakula's paranoia plays and Hitchcock's thriller-participating thrillers. Roy Scheider stars as a retired Secret Agent who sighs his wife's murder, now killing bad guys that kill him. Take off immediately, but the writing is full of faint threads and any excitement dies out quickly. There is a visually impressive climax at Niagra Falls, but Demme gets a little out of it, and even less from this bummer of a story. ** of ****
