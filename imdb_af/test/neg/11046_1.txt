Unbelievable. "Philosophy". "Depth". "Genius". "Masterpiece". People should have seen another "Oldboy" because the one I saw was a poorly written, poorly awakened, over-the-top acted, sordid piece of "Kraapola" that even the ridiculous violent scenes it is. Not suitable for the eyes of a child, barely the imagination and thirst for plot can satisfy consistency of seven years. <br /> <br /> The "depth" of this sorry merger was exhausted in a little bit of wisdom, "Laugh and the whole world will laugh with you, weep and you'll find yourself alone", the kind of boring fortune cookie that says a great writer, Shakespeare or more to the point of IMDb, Kurosawa, would have thrown into the rubbish bin with no second thoughts. Where this movie should have landed, if we didn't live in an era in which the cheapest shocking and perverted disgusting confusion is with what was once called a "great art". In short, yuck. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 100. It's not 1 in 1000 just because of an occasional expert camera work. In no way enough to save this infantile failure of worthlessness.
