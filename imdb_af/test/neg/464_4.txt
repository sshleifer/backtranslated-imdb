The movie is precious, and the cage is a babe. <br /> <br /> But will anyone agree with me to say that the punk representation in this movie is unhappy?!?! <br /> <br /> Where's the collision? the ramone? Misfits? social distortion? the cramps ?? six pistols?! Someone?!?!?!?! The music is this movie is incredibly disappointing! at least they play the healing. <br /> <br /> plus, striped feathered hair and pleated khakis ... <br /> <br /> it certainly looks like a movie about "punks" like a bunch of film industry squares see punks. <br /> <br /> Although it's a 90s movie, SLC punk paints a much more accurate picture of the punk rock scene in the early 1980s. just say '.
