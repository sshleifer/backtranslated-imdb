I once talked to my parents who told me in the 1940s and 50s that British filmmakers are looking at a movie's country of origin before they see it. No matter what the plot was or what was in it, if it was an American movie, people would want to see it and if it were, British people would not want to see it. It may sound like a ridiculous generalization, but after I got the RISK HEART, I can understand why people in those days chose American cinema for the homemade variety. Back in the 1940s. British stocks were without workers' classmates and it shows in this movie. Everybody speaks in an English boy that top class accent that the British Royal Family sounds like working class scum and what that means alienates a huge amount of a potential British audience who definitely prefers to watch Jimmy Cagney in WHITE WARM because people would if not related then definitely empathized with a violent gangster in movies shrinking more than a few high class English in 1949. It's entertainment, why people go to the theater. Even the characters' names look bizarre - Leonora! How many British people were Leonora in 1949? And the protagonists drink cocktails. And they use words like "Austere". You get the feeling that it was not marketed for a 1949 mainstream British audience. But why should the majority of British filmmakers come to the theater to entertain American imports? <br /> <br /> Look at the ATSONISHED HEART in 2005. I was amazed at how dated everything was. In fact, it's so dated I thought, maybe it's a spoof of the HARRY ENDFIELD SHOW. What didn't surprise me was the fact that these kind of movies sank near the British film industry, an industry that didn't pick up before investing US money in people like ZULU, ALFIE and the James Bond movies.
