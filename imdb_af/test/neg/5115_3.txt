This movie is exactly the same as Ridley Scott's, Someone To Watch Over Me, which is a classic. It stares Tom Berenger and Mimi Rogers and the bad guy from the Fugitive. It's a quality movie, with good direction and good acting. This movie is the polar opposite. It's the same plot, just minus any good acting and the addition of TV movie director. I must say I like the interaction between Lowe and the woman. She is warm and their romance is credible on many levels. Unfortunately, it can't just save this carbon copy of the classic Ridley Scott movie. <br /> <br /> There are usually a few TV movies that have a measure of redemption quality. I think for me, the film's reasoning is that Rob Lowe and the female have chemistry. This and I were able to watch and compare the plot with another quality film.
