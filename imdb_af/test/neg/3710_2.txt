A horrible B-movie at its best with video quality similar to Dead Alive. I challenge someone who is an "Aliens (James Cameron 1986)." Movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost complete rows of the first two Alien movies were ripped off to make this classic piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> Cast members such as R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with any talent and the chief "Jack Scalia" was really absolutely horrible. I think they know him for his massive split. I was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black man on the set John Toles-Bey, who has to watch this movie and just wonder. Take a look, because he did many interesting movies. <br /> <br /> But on this movie: The script as I said earlier was a rip-off of Aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine thriller. It included such lines as "I have a bad feeling about it," and "Kill me", since one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his stomach starts to do the "alien hops" just before it gets out of his stomach. come out. There is also a rip-off of the classic "get some!" via Bill Paxton. We also have a lot of marine grunts running through caves, with flu crawlings jumping out of walls. Even the mutations of the mutated creatures are very similar to the extinction of aliens, as they control marines in the movie "Aliens". And the kicker is that some mutant acids are acidic (as opposed to blood acid). There are many more important examples. So if you want to see this script well, check out the first two classic Alien and Aliens (With Sigourney Weaver). You will have a pleasant time. <br /> <br /> The plot could have been interesting and better done, if not for confusing rows at the beginning of the movie and generally poor editing. Camera shots were pretty dull and frankly it wasn't very hard to stop watching and walking around to get a snack or email. Many of the interactions between characters have made little or no sense and nowhere more often than not. The entire command structure between crew and Capt. Was poorly done. I'm not even sure if there are Captains in the army who have full control over core parts. Generally speaking, it appears that little research has been done on background information to at least show some respect for the film and there are many other similar examples (such as dive depth, etc.). <br /> <br /> If you like horrible movies or are a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something just laughing and shaking your head, then this movie can be for you. As for me, this one goes on the shelf ... permanently.
