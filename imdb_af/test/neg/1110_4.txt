First, I'm a horror fan. But this "Tobe Hooper" production (come on, the man of the original Texas Chainsaw and Poltergeist !!) was below the standard, even for a fan. The acting wasn't bad at all, some characters were incredible, but the top ladies were OK. The story was something we've seen a hundred times, without any surprising twist or whatever. Never be exciting or intense, and don't count on special effects except blood splashes. The terrifying zombie kids are white-faced faces with dark eyes and that's it. It may have worked in the early 70's, but not now. Director J.S. Cardone did not do a good job of keeping up the tension, halfway, because there is a risk of falling asleep. My voice is mainly based on the premier acting, but it could easily be called Children Of The Corn 8: From the grain field to the mines ... Enough said.
