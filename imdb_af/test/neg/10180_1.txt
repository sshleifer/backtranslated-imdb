This is the third movie in a month I watched, didn't go as I expected. The first two are The Black Dahlia and Hollywoodland, which did not give any new ideas of who committed the crimes. <br /> <br /> I've always had a fascination with UFOs and were so excited about a new movie on the subject of UFO investigation that wasn't a comedy. But after about 30 minutes it all went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> I could stand for the acting, the camera angles, the stereotypes if there was just a good story about chasing UFOs, but no one here. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with the subject, but Netflix printed this movie as a UFO skeptic, and a UFO believer investigated several sentences. <br /> <br /> I stopped looking about halfway through. I can't believe I wasted so much time on this one. Please don't make the same mistake I did.
