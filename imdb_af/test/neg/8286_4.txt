Next stop on our journey through the calendar-slasher scene is ... oh yes, "Graduation Day"! All the seniors, just full of opportunity and ready to go into the real world and become adults. However, if they can graduate without turning around at campus, who are running around and sticking out students' lives with his fence sword ... Yes, it all comes from a high school star who dies during a race from a blood clot and a year later, her older sister returned from the Navy for Graduation. The track trainer holds the blame and pants in his subdued position in the store class, while the girl's boyfriend mourns her death another year later. All these characters are first candidates for "Serial Slasher of the Year" and you just have to sit through this movie until the end to find out who's ready. "Graduation Day" is fun, even though it's not binding in any way, and there aren't a lot of memorable deviations, but there's plenty to entertain you generously. Like Linnea Quigley, the music teacher screws and with 30-year-old actors playing teens, and of course ... Roller disco! Gotta love that crap! You can do much worse than "Graduation Day", kiddies ...
