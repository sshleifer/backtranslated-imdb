Despite the all-star cast, this attempted epic failure. It appears as a set of flat cartoon stereotypes merged with too clever social commentary. <br /> <br /> It is as if with every dialogue and introduction to a new character, the author looks out and says, "Isn't it smart? Am I not smart? And unfortunately the answer is always "Ummmm ... no." Wear self-absorbing things that are more like soap opera (in the worst sense of the term) as a movie ... and a clear attempt at television immortality. Fortunately, it died young. Empire Falls falls flat.
