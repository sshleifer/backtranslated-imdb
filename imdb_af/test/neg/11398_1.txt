Actually, I'm still in doubt if there's something about this movie I love. Regarding the story: unrealistic and very exaggerated. The acting was, I think, too bad. Not very likely Antonie Kamerling will get a Rutger Hauer status. Some people will expect it anyway. First, let him work on his English pronunciation. If you watch the trip to Paris from these actors (DVD extra), you will most likely want to pop up. Advice to Beau Dorens: Stop your stage, you'll never get there. For the 2 main 'actors': grow up, please. To be generous, I give it 4 out of 10. <br /> <br />
