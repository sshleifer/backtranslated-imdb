Well, this movie is really "PLUMPED" HAHA Get it? It's like the attitude of this movie. The plot is just a copy of Pulp Fiction, okay it is acceptable but to make this piece as "PLUMP" (haha)! is really incredible. The storyline is so pathetic, and the whole thing just collected a few laughs. It tried to make a few jokes from several other movies, and it failed most of the times. I mean, I have a sense of humor, but it's not really the way to laugh. Most of the so-called "funny" moments are completely ironic. The movie is quiet for about 75 minutes. They could have done a much nicer job, they seemed to have made fun of a flashy movie, they were gambling and hey! I think they lost! <br /> <br /> In the overall PLUMP Fiction, "PLUMPABLE" is but you won't get together! <br /> <br /> Appreciate looking over and over?: Not enough is enough, actually it's more than enough! <br /> <br /> So is it worth the rent? Ummm. As I said, it is "PLUMPABLE", but you will only get a few "PLUMPS" from it! <br /> <br /> Overall 10: 4 out of 10!
