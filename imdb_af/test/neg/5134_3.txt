OK, I don't want to upset anyone who enjoyed this movie, but it was a very bad movie. Just as the plays were edited and the acting was cut, it hit me on some points. I really tried to enjoy it, but it was like a student movie, they had to have the smallest budget. I really liked the story line and the characters were nice, but the movie on the whole was just awful. Also, why is it that in virtually every movie with lesbian characters one of them has to commit suicide or die or turn straight?!?! It therefore sends a wrong and unrealistic message. I gave it 3 stars and everything I thought was very good to me. Just look at this movie if you want to laugh about how bad it is.
