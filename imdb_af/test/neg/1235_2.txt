I'll give it a second chance, but was very disappointed in the first one. It won't hold a candle on the other series. It has a very meaningless dialogue that does not add to the storyline. I agree with others that it does not seem to develop an interesting story. It's slow and plodding and I just know what the Comanches are planning to do. Perhaps it will tie everything in the second installment, but I have to force myself to see and figure it out. I'm from the Apache legacy of the Texas / New Mexico area, but I don't recognize much about what's happening there. Maybe I'm just ignorant of the facts, but it doesn't do much to educate me.
