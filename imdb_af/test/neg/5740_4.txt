I suggest that in the future any movie made by the sci-fi channel and then released on DVD says that it is indeed made by such a channel as I would not buy these things if I knew it. Not that it was all bad, but if you sold out in the middle of your movie for advertising, it just ruined the flow of the movie. This makes the movie more boring. This one had an interesting story, but the light and extremely generic soundtrack derived from the movie, just like most of the bad actors, except Dien and Linda Carter. The story, vampires are on the attack in South America, of course, the rules of vampire movies are not in operation, usually not in any of the movies about vampires I have seen lately, except the Blade trilogy. A group of soldiers are sent to the team to meet a team and find the former wife of one of the soldiers. Why is she not just his wife, who knows that as part of the plot is not really true. Yet we get an interesting boat ride, some beautiful jungle and lots of blood. However, this fact does not save the film from the road to shaggy in its performance, and sometimes it is sometimes boring. I don't know, it was the CGI blood and smoke and everything they have to do now, though old effects look better and not much more. I mean cheap Italian zombie movies can do a bullet hole without cgi. Why can't we?
