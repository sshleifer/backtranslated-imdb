I can imagine what happened to this movie: a lot of studio guys sit around, drink gin-tonic, maybe a joint and one of them comes up with the idea that it would be good if they could find a movie that the bridge overgrown, which was so far apart as Archie Bunker and Mick Jagger. Something that both college-age rebels and their parents would find equally interesting - for various reasons, perhaps, yet a ticket is a ticket. What are hippies interested in? Asia, philosophy, pacifism, and wild sets and costumes. What interest their parents? Musicals, eye candy, a good script and nostalgia. Very well, then, "Lost Horizon", the old classic, as a musical, in color. Can't miss it, right? It was a bomb. Lost Horizon, by James Hilton, may be less than a classic, but not a bad novel. In broad outline, he outlines a utopian society in Shangri-la, "The Valley of the Blue Moon", near Tibet, inhabited by peacefully satisfied residents who serve a long-monk abbey. In paradise is a Gilligan's island-like outsiders (a World War II veteran, a missionary, etc.), each with their own spin on the situation - what plot is there about each one's reaction to a choice to live in paradise, or try to return to the twentieth century. On its own terms, it is soft, pop-lit fluff, which offers Hilton's own conservative British outlook in "Eastern" dress, so exotic and so known as a fortune cookie. As a prisoner of the monks, the residence is forbidden to leave the valley, but never pressed into work or prayer (not that the monks do too much of it themselves), treated in the royal hands and given simple but luxurious accommodation - what do I want to escape? In this Middle American Sky-on-Earth, the monks are cultured and showcased, the climate is warm, the food is plentiful and delicious, the villagers are picturesque nonentities and nothing ever changed. The nuns are cool but encouraged to look good, and even flirt a bit (the reason is one of the most hilariously inaccurate statements by Tantric Sex I've ever read). Even their religion is not threatening: revealed as a combination of Christianity and Buddhism of the best world, there is nothing but the strongest fundamentalist or oddballs out there who actually knew something of Tibet (that in the early Thirties) a very small number). <br /> <br /> As a Capra movie focusing on the adventure / character angles, it was mesmerizing; and maybe Steven Spielburg would have let it fly if he was there. As an early seventy Hollywood product, the adventure was too fast, and the updated timetable of characters is too fine to impress. The monastery is deprived of the sketchy, suggestive features of classic B&W. It looks like a luxury beauty spa in white and light blue, and while at least some of the monks' clothing has tried for historical accuracy, most of the prisoners look like as if heading for a morning massage and fango bath, with a few golf holes in the afternoon. Perhaps Stephan Sondheim might have recovered a bit of eagerness in the story and could play the real conflict within each character's response. just five years later, Brian Eno would have caught the tranquil atmosphere to a T; Instead, Bert Bacherach and Hal David were given the job of writing the songs, marrying Muzak-like melodies with some of the greatest New Agey lyrics ever written. Quite natural for the time, call each song for a dance number, ranging from just forgetting to the completely boring, and so is the writing, which is not one rule to quote. <br /> <br /> Tie-ins with this movie were legion - there was everything from cookbooks to posters planned to promote this movie, and so were the hype that I actually went out and bought the album from the album has. Just about the only thing I can say about this is that it made enough of me to remind this review almost thirty years later. The next month I read Aldous Huxley, bought a copy of the Bardo Thadol, and learned about the true Tibetan culture. Moan <br /> <br />
