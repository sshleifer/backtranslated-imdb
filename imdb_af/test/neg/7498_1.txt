Hello everything - for what it is worth, I am in a doctoral program on Indonesian politics and returned this semester after about a year's field work, most of it in Jakarta. <br /> <br /> I am a big movie fan in general, so I went out as often as I could and bought tons of local VCDs while I was there. This one I saw in the theater, as it opened while I was there, and thankfully closed it shortly afterwards. <br /> <br /> Who was the intended audience for this movie? The spoiled women and girls of the Indonesian super-elite whose fianc√© is poorly and ineffectively parodied? The vast majority of Indonesians who could never even afford a single dish, let alone a full meal in the central restaurant's place? Or gay-Indonesian men, whose dilemma in the country's Muslim-dominant society is being reduced to absurd, simplistic, how-to-respect-self-preaching. <br /> <br /> If not all that bad enough, the soundtrack was either recorded or mixed so unclear that even indigenous Indonesians could not hear much of the lines. <br /> <br /> In short, if you're looking for an advanced gay-themed movie from a region of the world that probably looks like such an animal, forget about it. "Westler" of the early 80's, or "My Beautiful Laundry", of the same era, is much better at making a happier face about dealing with homophobia, and not doing so by ceaselessly telling scenes. <br /> <br /> Overall, an unfortunate waste of money in a country that still can't train all its kids and can't stay healthy.
