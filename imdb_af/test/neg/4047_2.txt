It must be one of the worst images in a movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This isn't all that this movie lacks. This movie has the worst acting, writing, directing, special effects, you name it - it's the worst ever. <br /> <br /> I strongly advise you to spend your time and not waste your time at this time. <br /> <br /> I agree with an earlier report that "women" were definitely dressed in men's clothes and it made me laugh, I'm still trying to find out if they were obvious it or if they actually trying to be sexy women. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there's not much more in this movie worth watching! <br /> <br /> Summing up: horrible acting, horrible writing, a horrible idea for a movie. A hundred and a half of my life, I want to go back, right now!
