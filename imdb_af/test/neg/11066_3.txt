Monday, 02 October 2006 So I always do with my dad as I always do. We ordered a few Japanese outings, switched off the lights and pressed them. I'm a keen fan of horror movies. However, the Cavern was released on this DVD in October, but it was definitely a slack. It was promising to meet all the standard requirements of any horror movie machine: pulled out with antagonistic character, a sexual scene cannot be omitted, and the all-known pre-ghost (when they haunt you unexpectedly, but seems to be the idiot partner). When it finally came, I was ready for a real gore action. The director, I admit, was keen. Of course, you have to fill in a full 81 minutes with people moving back and forth in a space of about 10 meters wide. It all starts when a college buys "cavers" for another cave dive. They all look like seasoned benefits, very serious and spiritual throughout the cave experience. This time they are bringing a new door, a little annoying photographer who has been blinded by his National Geographic cover to understand the full dangers of cave diving. As they deep into what they call "hell", they soon realize that they are not alone in the dead-end. I will be polite if you are spoiled if you do not listen to my advice and avoid your time. Although the atmosphere and background music were haunting; and there was a lot of blood and gore, when the moments came to see a real separation, it was more like watching porn without the full frontal. The camera work was deliberately dark and sketchy. I think the director used it for effect. I think the thing I like most about the movie was the moving characters. They deserve Acadamy awards for those who become bickering scenes. I almost scoured a tear when they finally got it ... A tear of joy! If you have dry horror, soft porn, and you hate Braveheart. Then it's the right movie for your next Saturday night.
