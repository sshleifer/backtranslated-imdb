If you can stomach the camp, this movie has to make you laugh aloud several times. This did at least for me. I'll just mention one of my favorite elements: the "underwater shots" of the "fish" "swim". The sound that accompanies the shots is also wonderful. <br /> <br /> One last note: William Katt is actually a pretty decent actor. I hope he gets another day in the sun; Looking at him as the "Greatest American Hero", a few decades ago, it was a fun part of my childhood, and he hasn't been very visible ever since. He was similar to depressed in this movie. Someone gives him a fun job on a good performance, or something.
