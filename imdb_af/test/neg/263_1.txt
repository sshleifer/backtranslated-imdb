It's officially the horrible, boring, crowny and ridiculous movie ever created. The movie is about a crazy child and his friends, and they land a 747. His dreams are very stingy and do not make sense and are very poorly done. Every special effect seems to have been done without modern technology, and could possibly be created by the child who plays the "leading role" in the movie. Watching this movie will definitely make you stupider. I advise you never to look at this movie, and if you do, happiness and do not miss the brain cells you killed. My comments do not even understand the terrible creation from hell that was made. The person who wrote the comment in front of me didn't watch the same movie I was watching, and I never wanted to watch. Peace.
