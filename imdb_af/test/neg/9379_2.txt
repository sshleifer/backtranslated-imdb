I will be honest and say I've stopped seeing it somewhere halfway and then quickly break ahead with a few. Then I come back here and read many of the reviews already made. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I'm just, and I can't help it, but this cartoon for North American society seems to be a goal of "We can save them from themselves" and Iraq is coming immediately. It seems to me that this is justification or part of another good intention. <br /> <br /> The lady after me looks like a caring person, and I became honest with her portrait trying to be sorry and feel for her. Well, in this case it can never happen, because as a history teacher has already mentioned here, I need to know how her family was so rich above average, keep it (if they both play) and send her to Paris! ? Now, if that had happened to a poor girl's biography, I could see myself having certain emotions. but as it stands + his release timing is just pure propaganda movie; Even worse, as the cartoon survives, the soft side of things is too good to do well. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are clich√©s related to gays. Well, a woman fighting to win her rights shouldn't at least have sympathy for the underdogs of society like she? Of course, the message is self-indulgent from the point of view of a ruling class member. <br /> <br /> I give it only 2 stars because it's production and related stuff. Of course, a propaganda movie has interests to manipulate my thoughts too convincingly. That is why it is well done to address certain visual emotions that I cannot deny, I also have so good.
