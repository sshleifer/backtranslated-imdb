I like the whole set-up with Ceasar's Palace, Roman guards and Togas announcers. This event also marked "the passing of the torch" as far as the voice of the WWF goes. Gorilla Monsoon who has done the play for every WWF PPV so far opens and gives the typical introduction that seems to be there to announce another PPV. But then Jim Ross announces what makes his WWF debut and JR continues to deliver the WWF commentary to this day. But beyond this, this event is pure refuse. Good ol scientific wrestling was thrown out of the window and the birth of bumps entered. This was the event that the WWF started, and did not recover to the late 90's attitude era. Here's an overview of the event. <br /> <br /> IC title game: Tatanka (Challenger) against Shawn Michaels (champion): An ok opener, but given what Shawn is capable of, it was very disappointing. I have no idea why WWF bowed hell to convert Tatanka. They have to realize that Shawn was the future and Tatanka was just a few hippers in an Indian Gimick. The end of the game itself was very lame. Shawn grabs the ref and pulls him out, then an invitation is asked. While it was fun, Sherri sustained this weekend, but this match was just forgotten. Shawn had to wear this game and had a hard time doing it. <br /> <br /> The Stenier Brothers vs The Headshrinkers: Steiners wins the win over a Frankensteiner. This game had its moments, but the crowd didn't succeed. There was no heat behind, I think it was a game to throw in only two teams of teams. <br /> <br /> Crush vs. Doink the Clown: TERRIBLE! Terrible! Terrible! This game sucked completely. Two very crippled gimmicks. A clown and a Hawaiian dressed in bizarre colors. The end surprised everyone. In the months to come, Crush got hooked and Doink turned face-to-face, but none of the fans seemed to care. Unfortunately, this was not the worst match on the card. <br /> <br /> Razor Ramon vs Bob Backland: You have a brand new heel that goes a long way towards a wrestler who's been forgotten about 10 years ago. The fans sobbed and laughed as Backlund came out. And like the Hogan / Rock in WM18 and HHH / Owen in the WM14, the hooker gets a stronger cheering. Fortunately, this game was short. The real guy won, but I wish they had completely pushed Razor out of the shit and beat Backlund, rather than winning a small pack from nowhere. <br /> <br /> Tag Team Champion match: Ted Dibiase and IRS (Champs) vs Hulk Hogan & Brutus Beefcake w / Jimmy Hart I would like to know the full story of what happened to Hogan's eye. Oh good. The crowd was really in this game, but it didn't flow that much. Hogan and Beefcake had a clear sense of rust because both wrestlers were on the shelf for at least one year. Dibiase, who was the major technical wrestler he was, helped carry the game out of a complete waste. The end was a surprise with Dibiase and the IRS won the win via DQ. But to please the crowd, Hogan and Beefcake did their usual game to the crowd at the end, as they won the game. <br /> <br /> Lex Luger vs Mr. Perfect: The best part of the game was the four hot chicks that Lex Luger accompanied to the ring. Other than that, it was completely forgotten. The Mr. Perfect gimmick was born for a heel roller and he just lacks the heat as a face. And Luger is just a waste of time, no matter what gimmick he is. Luger won through a downward spine, despite Perfect's feet in the ropes. Then Perfect spends the post match to kick his butt. First Luger knocks him out with the running elbow. Then, when Perfect gets conscious again, he goes back to the locker room to find Luger just to get his shit out of Shawn Michaels. He created an HBK / Perfect feud that has the potential to be classic, but abuses the WWF. /> The Undertaker vs Giant Gonzales: ABSOLUTE POWER !! What was the WWF thinking that brought such a horrible wrestler as Giant Gonzales. Certainly, he had size, but I'd rather see the Brooklyn Brawler in a match than he does. It's not even worth commenting on. <br /> <br /> WWF CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH: Bret Hart (champion) against Yokozuna (challenger) You have one of the biggest technical wrestlers of all time going against a guy who only benefits. is it he is a giant bill-ass. Bret was able to carry the match, but a reasonably predictable ending with Mr. Fuji throwing salt in Bret's face. <br /> <br /> POST MATCH: Yokozuna vs. Hulk Hogan Pure crap here. Hogan came to the ring for the apparent reason and Mr. Fuji sets out for a game after Yoko has just won the title. Even the hard-hitting Hulk camas find it as a total BS.
