I think vampire movies (usually) are evil. Even if the movie itself is not that good, I still like it because it has vampires in it. But it stinks. It really gives vampire movies a bad name. <br /> <br /> For a start, the cheapest really shows. I don't usually bother about low-budget movies - one of my favorite all-time movies is El Mariachi which costs only $ 7,000 - but I hate it. The performance is also a bit of a shit, giving a 'handsome' wobbling camera that gives you headaches. <br /> <br /> There is not much more to say, but don't see it. I bought it for Â£ 1.50, as it was a former rental and I felt cheated, even for that low price.
