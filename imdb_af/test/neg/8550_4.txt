You belong to me the last teamwork of Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck as a screen saver and it was a loan movie for Fonda to Columbia Pictures. Fonda signed a contract with 20th Century Fox to get the Tom Joad part in The Grapes of Wrath. But after that it was usually his loan from movies that were good while being thrown into mediocre things at Fox. <br /> <br /> But the rule is broken here. Although the character he plays has a superficial resemblance to Charles Pike of The Lady Eve, this film is not so funny anywhere. In fact, feminists will probably be scared. <br /> <br /> In fact, Barbara Stanwyck didn't like her at all. She likes to work with Henry Fonda, but thought this movie is ridiculous. As good as she should have. <br /> <br /> Fonda is another millionaire game, which we now call a trust fund baby that doesn't really do much with his life. He is kind of lovely lunkhead that Stanwyck meets on a ship's slope and literally falls for her to show. She seems to be a doctor and they have a whirlwind campaign and get married. <br /> <br /> But it seems Fonda has a jealous streak, especially if it involves Roger Clark, another millionaire patient from Stanwyck. And he doesn't understand her professional obligations. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck, like Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn, was and is a feminist icon. When she tells Fonda that he is going out into the world of work and has to stay on a salary and see if he can do it, Fonda goes out and gets a job as a salesman in a shopping mall. She is so proud of him that she will actually stop her medical practice and live with him on his salesman's salary. <br /> <br /> Today, the movie will now pick. Stanwyck didn't have too much conviction in her performance, probably because she didn't believe it. I certainly can't. <br /> <br /> I don't even think audiences even believed that. But the two stars and the rest of the throw tried their best, but this one was a special Thanksgiving.
