This film is bad, yes, but if the producers used a real KANGAROO, it would have killed the actor he played. I'm an Australian and I've seen two seven-foot-tall Roos fight each other, it's not a pretty sight, as the object is to kill one's or the other. (This is the way to ensure the herd of dogs.) And there are incidents where someone bought a kangaroo and was injured or murdered, so when you see a kangaroo on TV or Film, it's probably a female or animated as it is a good idea not to hurt actors (they may be irritated if they lose the ability to breathe). There is a strange idea that Australian animals are cute and nice, it's fake, many are dangerous (10 of the 12 deadliest snakes live here) and most are just ugly (Koalas are as soft as steel wool). So if you come to Australia, be careful!
