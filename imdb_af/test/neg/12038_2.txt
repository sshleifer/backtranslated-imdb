A Chicago couple, Dillon and Dougherty, are being falsely accused of killing their daughter. People are starting to wonder if they did. Police are investigating and finding suspicious evidence. The couple are maliciously public and accused in the press. The police speculate that they are satanists and have killed their own daughter ritually. They are charged and executed. They are represented by attorneys seeking publicity, and give them bad advice and charge them $ 100,000. The evidence presented to them is distorted or hidden by the police. Established intimidation of sexual abuse is offered. Their other child is taken away from them and brought into a foster home. Dougherty is pregnant and gives birth to remove her baby. Judgment, she did not do it, but he did it. He goes with a sentence of 45 years. <br /> <br /> In the final third of the movie, with Dillon in jail and Dougherty wondering what to do next, we see people who are antagonistic, are now slowly coming to the couple's defense. Witnesses admit they lied. Other facts are being revealed which eventually result in Dillon's release. The killer is never found, although the movie gives us a good idea as a probable perplex. <br /> <br /> It's a whip from start to finish. Nothing seems right to the couple. Oh, there are a few happy moments, maybe a party where everyone is happy to be together and tear with joy, or a point of evidence in their favor is discovered and people hug each other. But it is never long before someone rushes through the door with more bad news and all the faces are frozen in tragic unbelief. (Usually a fade follows to follow.) There is not necessarily anything wrong with tragedies, although I can't imagine what pleasure we get to see people suffering. There are also many tragedies in Shakespeare. I think everything we find interesting about tragic stories lies in the way they are told. "Oh, but I'm Fortune's fool!" Romeo cries after killing Juliet's brother. Here we ran Dougherty in her cloak through a hospital corridor, shouting, "Where's my baby ???" There is no ambiguity or irony in the story - as I am sure, there must have been real life events on which it is based. People are good or bad here. Or else they are bad, then they get well. <br /> <br /> The film is not aimed at exploring human peculiarity or the way things work out. It is aimed at wringing tears from the audience. The actors offer prospective role models. I can't remember the last movie in which I saw so many tears. There are waves of tears. Showers from them. Cascades from them. A true Niagara of them. A Lake Lacrymose of them. <br /> <br /> Well, I give one example of the efficiency with which the film is made. Dillon and Dougherty hire a Chicago policeman working as a private investigator (Ed Asner). Asner is sympathetic to them, but he doesn't really do much. He looks like he's in the movie, not because of his importance to the case, but because he can offer the victim pair with a kind of philosophy - "Learn to live with it", and that's good, and because he suffering from colorectal cancer, so we can see how he takes his medicine, double over with pain and eventually passes. <br /> <br /> What is frustrating about the movie is that it focuses so intensely on the suffering of the couple, it bumps one of the more important issues it causes - the function of gossip in regulating private lives. <br /> <br /> Gossip is a strange thing really. If we call it "gossip," it is bad, but if we call it "public opinion" it sounds at least acceptable. Of course, we all have beliefs about issues that may or may not be justified. (As I write, Michael Jackson is once again brought to court and accused of killing a young boy, and I wonder how many of us are excited about the news and immediately assumed he was a pedophile.) But gossip is not bad either. It's like water. When properly controlled, it is a community asset. We need gossip to keep each other in line. It helps us maintain public order. But like water in a flood or a tsunami, it's a mess for a town when it falls out of control. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that's good if you don't look too much for insight into human nature. It is so clever that, with its purpose, it is difficult to argue with it.
