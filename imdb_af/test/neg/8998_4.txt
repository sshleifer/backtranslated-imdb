This movie is enjoyable when you drive poverty, public domain films of the first half of the 20th century, or a fan of amateur movies. The movie combines public domain thrillers with new shot scenes in which the "actors" (With the only exception of Redfield near the death of Lugosi rip, all the "performers" are just scary!) Try to stock footage. The "new" footage is covered with digitally added film scrapers, such as some of the already substandard old material (?? !!). As close as I can find out, the plot has something to do with a lot of strangers brought along on an island for a will (?) This movie, while containing a creative point of departure, Ala 'Dead Men Do Not Wear Plaid 'is a technical and creative wreck. In a horrible long drive and injured sailor on a ship, an abortive journey to 'Fog Island', whatever! Together, the "flashback" weighs together our older footage of completely different times and of completely different film quality. Unrelated screens of "The Lost World" (1925), The Dangerous Game (1932), White Zombie (1932), Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla (1952) and some other poverty-driving productions. It's done about an incredibly bad voice, about which it has too much room cake, as if the sound was recorded on a cheap home video camera. <br /> <br /> The "filmmakers" seem to think they pay tribute to the great actors of the ages by giving characters the surnames of well-known actors (Carradine, Zucco, Ouspenskaya, etc.). This tactic is cleverly done, as well as subtle in 'Final Destination' here it is just unnecessary! Bizarre, and painfully unfunny, jokes about Spiderman, Dracula, and Superman are in abundance. Even the old Dewey, Cheetam and Howe attorney referrals are used here. It was old and tired when The Three Stooges used it in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> The movie stock and audio, do not play scene scene, and dozens of different sources are used for Lugosi. The final effect is what he seems to be, older, younger, older, thinner, heavier, younger and older, getting back minute by minute. Oddly enough, the movie did not use it as a comedy subplot and made it a great chance for comedy. <br /> <br /> Truth is, however, said. It was nice to look in bed late at night. Maybe that's what they wanted!
