Why is it impossible to write in French? Many Kitch! This journey in the middle of the earth is contemptible technical possibilities, but the present in 1976. This great "Casimir" of monsters is completely ridiculous! However, the film deserves a "remake", such as "KING KONG" (the last one), with a little more provided scenario. The professor has similarities with the Professor Calculus and is quite funny. David (the character) is enough contradictory, but crosses (spends) to the people under a good message "you unite and will overcome you!" Altogether we would say a movie made in the 40's. Having said everything (or almost) the evil I was thinking of, we can say that if the brain becomes tired or something else is to be seen, the thing is quite entertaining. Hugh! This is my opinion! (translate French to English with "Reverso": sorry for possible errors!)
