Hollywood had a long love affair with bad Arabian night stories, but few of these products stood the test of time. The most memorable was the Jon Hall, Maria Montez films that have long been camped. This one is filled with hymn songs, anachronistic snake, and slapstick. This is a real cute harvest of Mesopotamian wheat, and today quite unbearable. It is nominated for its imaginative special effects that are almost imperceptible in this day and age, which consist mainly of trick photography. The only outstanding, positive feature that survives is its beautiful color and brightness. Unfortunately to say, of the many films made in this genre, some of them come to Alexander Korda's original "Thief of Baghdad". However, almost any other Arabic night movie is better than that. It's a loser.
