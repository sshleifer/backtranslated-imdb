The black BLACK comedy about a woman (Mia Farrow) who escapes her Christmas Eve home when she discovers her husband (Tony Goldwyn), hired a hit man to kill her. She ends up with a husband and wife (Scott Glenn and Mary-Louise Parker) and then things go wrong. Farrow is basically going on and is constantly meeting many strange people and in unfamiliar situations. <br /> <br /> It was advertised as a good movie when I saw it around Christmas time in the very short term in an art fly. . I found it sick, unfriendly and just depressed. I like black humor, but it was too dark for me. What happened to Parker's character was especially scary. To make matters worse, Eileen Brennan is later thrown in as a nun (!!!) and continues to chew the landscape with cold. <br /> <br /> Farrow's acting was the only saving grace - it's much better than earning it. It was also a relief to see the talented Stephen Dorff at the end. The termination itself was so nice, but it couldn't erase what had happened before. <br /> <br /> Sick, morbid, pitch-black "comedy". A 1
