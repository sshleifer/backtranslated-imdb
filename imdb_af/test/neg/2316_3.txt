"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"! If IMDb allows one-word reviews, that's what the mine would be. This movie was originally intended for children only and it seems very difficult for adults or older children to watch the movie. The song, the story, everything is boring and washed out - just like this public domain presses. Like other comedy-team films with roots in traditional children's stories (such as the horrible SNOW AND THREE STOOGES and the overstated BABES IN TOYLAND), this movie has limited appeal and just doesn't get any good. Now that I think about it, I seriously doubt that many children will even enjoy this movie these days! So my advice is not to watch this movie. If you have to watch an Abbott and Costello movie, almost any other movie (except A & C GO TO MARS) will be an improvement.
