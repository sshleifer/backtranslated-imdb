Stay the hell away from this one ... No, really, I'm serious. I know you can think it is a fun, camping, cheesy Hong Kong action style B movie. I did, but trust me, it's not. In fact, the only thing that is accurate about the description is the words Hong Kong, and then only in a strict geographical sense. <br /> <br /> Yes, Donnie Yen gave it up. Jackie Chan has a cameo. The man Ekin Cheng, of Storm Riders, plays the leading role. It has vampires. It should be good - or at least fun, charming and action-packed. Again - this is not. <br /> <br /> I could deduce why this movie sucks - I can dissect it, hook it to small, alleged pieces. But where to start? There is so much to hate ... <br /> <br /> To make it easier, and to give this hate party some credibility, let me say that I'm usually a big fan of Hog Kong theater is. The heavier drama, as well as the more light action and / or comedy. The really good movies as well as the really cheesy ones. I can sit through hours of bad subtitles, jokes are enough to make first-rate rollers roll their eyes. I can treat lovers as chaste and celibate as a convention of nuns, and anything else would mean the average filmmaker defeated their metaphorical toes on their path between action rows. Also, Hong Kong or any other origin - I love it when a movie is just bad to be bad enough to be good. <br /> <br /> But this - Arrgh! It's just horrible, STOP, irreconcilable garbage. As far as it's funny or beautiful, it's actually painful. So discovering it's a Bergman movie, it looks like the Texas chain murderer. <br /> <br /> Why?! Why waste such an opportunity? It could have been so much fun!
