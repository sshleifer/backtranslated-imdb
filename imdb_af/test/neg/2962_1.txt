This film was produced by Producers Releasing Corp. (PRC), under the so-called "Poverty Row" movie studios of the 1930s and 40s. So you can imagine how little money was spent doing it. <br /> <br /> The music is forgotten. Cast member Gerra Young does not have an operative voice but is a discount from Deanna Durbin. The IMDb database doesn't show any other movie shows to her. Let's hope she could move into the Grand Opera. <br /> <br /> The opening credits for the pressure Turner recently broadcast. Classic films indicate that this film was preserved by the National Film Museum. It immediately asks the question ?? WHY? <br /> <br /> Are their resources so plentiful that they can afford to keep litter? Some low-budget or B-music of that era delivered features that make them worthwhile. This movie has nothing. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie is over. It really wastes an hour of your time.
