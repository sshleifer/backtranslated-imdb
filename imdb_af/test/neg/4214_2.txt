This movie was nothing like the book. I think the author of the script had the job of writing the successor to Gone with the Wind and was disapproved. It was his or her way of getting their ideas anyway. The only similarity between this movie and the story depicting it was the names of the main characters and the location of the main action. None of the events shown in the movie happened in the book that way. For a Gone with the Wind fan (from both the book and the movie) it was very disappointing. If you loved the book Scarlett, don't see this movie and hope it will be played on the screen. They only share the title in common.
