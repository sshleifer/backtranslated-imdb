The Unknown ... Is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story really looks original, but it is badly assigned to the screen. Lance Henriksen, a good actor, ended up in this crap. But hey, he made very low budget movies ... you have to pay the bills, you know? A joke. Lance is a good actor, but he eventually ended up with these bunch of foolish actors. Seriously, Andrea Roth was just there to have a celebrity scene, and other actors. Well, they were just there. There was always a faded decline in editing, which made me sick! It was the most horrible move that just kept coming and it really made you angry. It was also very predictable, boring and slow. It has a bizarre pace that just goes ... wrong. <br /> <br /> Can't say anymore ... don't rent or buy it. You can watch it, as on TV.
