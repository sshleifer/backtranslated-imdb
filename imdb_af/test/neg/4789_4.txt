I agree with the comments on the downward turn. The last views are a little better, but the authors definitely need more direction. I think the characters are still interesting, although they sometimes turn a bit too much into the "white trash". Subtlety and nuance goes a long way on programs such as "Office". I would think the target audience is somewhat similar because they are both on the same night and on the line. One would think Karma and the whole eastern religion thing is a big enough topic to bring some different and interesting performances, but they just scratch the surface of the subject. I think it's the contempt many Hollywood people have about the level of intelligence of the masses. We can handle more intimate content. It has previously been proven in many other programs.
