Oh, another Costner movie that was an hour long. Credible performances, but the writing didn't come true and wasn't in a hurry to get there. Firstly, we are presented with an unrelated series of events, little of which continues. Will the script center on Randall and his wife? Randall and Fischer? What about Fischer and Thomas? Ultimately, no true storyline ever evolves and the characters are artificially thrown by third-party monologues. The singer explains Randall, Randall explains Fischer, over and over. Eventually, long after you don't care, you'll learn something about scripting events. No doubt, three ends were offered and no one can make a decision. The end result? All three were used, one after another, after another. If you can hang out in the 100th chase, you can get them out. Despite the clear effort to win points with a commitment to the Coast Guard, this one had to be wiped out the first day.
