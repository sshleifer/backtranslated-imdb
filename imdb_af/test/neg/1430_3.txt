Dee Snider is the villain in this movie and his bad acting and persuasive kind has ruined it for me. The whole movie just saw him too seriously. It tries to reach the dark atmosphere of "Seven" without the good acting. The film highlights the urban industrial rock / tattoo / body art "subculture" and expects us to be impressed (scared) by the size of a man's nose ring. I'm not an expert on movies, but the screenplay and acting in this movie is just awful. Dee Snider looks at the part of the villain but his action is horrible. I do not recommend wasting the time on this one unless nothing else is available.
