After watching the first scene, I realized that the play was so bad that it couldn't pick it up later. Superficial and artificial, with regular efforts to look professionally through references to technology like a five-year-old trying to make it sound like he knows what he's talking about. <br /> <br /> The second to second storyline is completely unrealistic and just about every decision made by the screenwriter was the kind you expect from a lower average school student. The overall storyline was as original and predictable as a packet of sausages. The few attempts to make the dialogue sound intelligent were limited to neurotic, apologetic behavior. A ten year old may like it. But it would take a five-year-old to accept the lack of realism; How can advanced self-service allow someone to bypass a code lock by touching it as if it were a magic wand, extracting one in 100's of voices through a ventilation system (thereby tapping Superman) and a home computer? recover by just 'wrong' instead of looking for errors? Actually, that scene is a neat example: The mistake was that one of the cooling pipes (aluminum ribbons) was broken on the CPU, as it would look if an exhaust pipe on a V8 engine were blasted off. This cannot happen and if it does, it will not prevent the computer from working. There is no electric current going through this ribbon, but when he (without doing it himself, worked his arms through autopilot because the cells in his body were super effective), a pin was placed in the ridge, desktop with icons appears on screen immediately without booting. <br /> <br /> And that's how it goes. As he escaped an interrogation room in the NSA's headquarters, he lit a lighter under a fire sensor, which led into open doors throughout the building. Of course, the NSA did not predict that this sharply disadvantaged approach had escaped, nor had it placed any guards outside its room (or anywhere else) to ensure a living breakthrough in military nanotechnology. He went out and found a taxi. Examples like this one are not only numerous, but there is actually no single scene that makes sense. <br /> <br /> So-called big effects were terrible. He threw a basketball back to a child in the park, and the child was thrown 20 feet horizontally into a tree. No acceleration or deceleration, but constant speed and height, like a motorized trolley. I'm sure when I stop and look at the cables that kept the child's posture, just like cables, they probably didn't know how to do it or to bother them completely. If someone is thrown so far into a tree, they will at least say (or rather be placed with broken legs), but the child was just confused and surprised. <br /> <br /> Moronies. This is the word for every creative decision made throughout the production. I'm going to put the director's name on my own personal blacklist, someone with poor skill like him can't improve. I feel like claiming compensation because I wasted 45 minutes of my life watching it, and the time it took to write it. Although it was therapeutic, it was traumatic to realize how little it needed to get a pilot approved. The only excuse that a somewhat intelligent person can have should look voluntarily, imprisonment or lobotomy.
