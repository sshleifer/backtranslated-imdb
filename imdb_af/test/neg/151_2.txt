This movie just did it for me. I like horror and splash movies, but this one has very little to do with horror. The effects are cheap and when they cut off one of her feet, it looks so false. The same goes for other effects such as tongue torture and bowel disease. They could spend little extra money on the bonds. <br /> <br /> With a lot of sex (with pixelation as in all Japanese movies) it's just a sick fetish porn and there seems to be a market for sick things. like this. While it is more bloody, it fits me with titles like Squirmfest / Purge and the Genki series. These movies contain girls who eat and play with every liquid that comes out of your body, eating insects and fish in a rough way and watching sex with all kinds of strange animals, such as frogs, eels and .... horror fans to look elsewhere. No horror here, just sick and humiliating sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Horror fans should avoid this one and are better off looking for Guinea Pig2: Flowers of Meat and Blood or even August Underground Mordum. While not good, at least they offer a horror experience and Niku Daruma absolutely fails in that department.
