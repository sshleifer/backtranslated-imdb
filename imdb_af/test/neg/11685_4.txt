First, there are some plot holes in this movie. We see in the beginning playing a child dying of the game. But who was stuck in the post truck containing the package containing the game? How did the driver place the parcel in the mailbox when he was attached to the steering wheel? It is not as if he is Mr. Fantastic was not. Wow that in just the first 15 minutes ... The actors are second-rate, take the "Bad Guy" by Patrick Kilpatrick (who?) Played exactly what he saw in one episode of everything on TV and some secondary roles in poor movies (like the one). So most of the acting is like TV dramas, I can live with it, but the graphics or special effects are terrible. The disembodied "Game" voice sounds like a poor clone of Hal from "Space Oddessy 2000". What they call zombies looks more like shadows jumping like monkeys from the "Planet of the Apes". The Aliens had transparent bodies like the shadow zombies. In most cases, the movie was only predictable because it had no hook or hidden agenda. The story was a good idea, but like most good ideas discussed over lunch, it never developed beyond the good idea stage.
