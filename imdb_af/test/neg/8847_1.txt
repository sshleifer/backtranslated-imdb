I never fell asleep during a movie. Never. This movie did the impossible. <br /> <br /> While many claim the superiority of Japanese horror movies about their American counterparts, this movie was a bountiful lesson. As in the film, 30 minutes was too long. It would have helped if the movie had a little more movement in the plot and the camera was working, but instead we had just uncomfortable silence and a very slow motion. The acting was absolutely horrible, based on bad student levels, while everyone struggled to name something called a script. Did these people even get any direction? Were they cooked to be boring and boring? Any therapy would not surprise me. <br /> <br /> What was even worse was the rather innocuous makeup involved in the creatures of the other side. Anyway, they all stank. Don't see this movie. That's all I can say (unless you're an insomniac).
