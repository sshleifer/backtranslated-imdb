I heard that this move was made up of a lot of high school students. As a high school or theater project, it's not bad. Unless you lived near milpitas in the 1970s or knew someone involved in the making of the movie, it was very terrible. Most of the actors are clearly not actors, but volunteers. Bob Wilkins (the original host of Creature Features at KTVU in Oakland appears, but for about a minute). Some of the sample effects are done with stop animation and some with a man in a monster suit and each works well on its own, but there is no continuity between the two. If you look without dialogue, you will assume the movie had 2 samples. I think the most unsupportable aspect is that even the main characters, which I assume, are the kids behind the movie, can't even pretend to act. These kids have somehow been involved with the theater to do this project, but they do not show credible emotions to the camera.
