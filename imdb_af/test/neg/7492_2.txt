What waste is there actually no part II? If this movie actually ends with the way it did, everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed. This movie is nothing close to a movie like Outbreak, which was actually a pretty decent movie. This movie is rushing in the hope that he can get some easy dollars. I started watching the movie under the assumption that it would be bad, but I never thought it would be that bad. This movie was nothing more than a way to exploit the American people's fears for profit! If you haven't seen this movie, don't bother it. Movie is full of poorly developed characters and poor acting. I really hope the production of this movie was just a few weeks. Stay away! Don't be fooled by the hype!
