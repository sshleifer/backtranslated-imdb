George Zucco was like Boris Karloff in fact, no matter how poor the film he appeared in, he would always maintain a sense of dignity and a good performance. "The Mad Monster" is no exception to that rule. It is, according to all standards, a poor (as entertaining) film. The filmmakers, of course, did not know how to make the best of their low budget and the writing seemed to have turned out in one or two days. Yet Zucco is good and credible as the mad scientist. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is nice on camp level. Normal horror movie fans will usually not enjoy PRC movies. However, these "poverty row" productions have followed a small but loyal cult. Sometimes they will rise above their limits, with "detour" the best example of this. Usually they looked like this. For all its technically poor qualities, "The Mad Monster" is a great way to kill a rainy afternoon. The DVD of Retromedia is recommended, as it speaks to another PRC production "The Black Raven", the original theater trailer, and best of all, an interview with Glenn Strange about his role in this movie. (4/10)
