It only looked at this dog once, for me to never say again! It was so deeply felt that I had to read other people's reactions about it before I could remember anything further (1) it was terrible, (2) Connery had to stop while he was ahead, and (3) the movie had a total gross - a little bit, where a retinal scan is called by the most horrific (not too bad inefficiency), possibly means. <br /> <br /> In fact, I've never understood why anyone would even prefer the best of Connery's Bond movies to even the worst Moore or Dalton outings. Whether Lazenby, Brosnan, or even David Niven, for the case. I personally found Octopussy and Moonraker, including "canonical" Bond films, to be more entertaining than this, and probably for the same reasons why other Moore Bond films, their cruel humor, and their willingness to conform to the preposterousness of the whole basic Bond environment.
