First, I would like to say that I really enjoyed this movie. However, it cannot be said that it was a good movie. I went into the theater with pretty low expectations (something I learned to do). I'm glad I did this because the plot and development were not stars. The jokes were low grade humor. But I was in the right mind to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I wasn't the only one. In fact, the whole theater laughed out loud. I didn't hear anyone complaining after the movie came close. I even saw one man fall from his chair and laugh! But again, I have to warn you, Grandma's Son is NOT a top quality movie. It's a funny (though low-forehead) movie, and if you're going with the right mindset, you'll really enjoy it. Oh, and don't take children there.
