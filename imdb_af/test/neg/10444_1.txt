This is one of the worst movies ever. There is a scene where they are supposed to be underwater and they literally walk on the ground and they add bubbles! The shark is boring and is just this big slow computer blessed thing. Antonio Sabato is terrible, I mean worse than normal. How does this guy work? Directing is the worst and nothing is available in the whole movie. I love shark movies and this one just disappoints. I've seen these studios before and everything they do has a star going to do bad work. I'd rather see an unknown actor who cares to make a good story.
