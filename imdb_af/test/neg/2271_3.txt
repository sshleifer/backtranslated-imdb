Usually when BBC releases a TV series, one becomes accustomed to a certain satisfaction guarantee. Usually the TV show is great, even if the story is boring, you can trust that the acting is worth it. When I was over, persuasion, here at the local library, looked forward to a pleasant evening because I read the story. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I read the story first, otherwise I wouldn't think high of it. Furthermore, I was relieved to learn that the production date of this TV series was 1971, as I thought, until that moment the BBC lost it. It's really bad, and should be used in acting schools as a horror movie. <br /> <br /> The only positive thought I have about this series is that people in this movie probably won't appear or be involved in any BBC or other product this century other than the young Musgroves sisters, apparently took their fist steps in acting and did remarkably well under the other direction.
