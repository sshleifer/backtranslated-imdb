Christophe Lambert once said he was still making movies to make good and easy money. When I see his latest releases, I can believe it. <br /> <br /> Overall, Beowulf is in the "good" part of the crap movies: there are good sensations. The actors themselves are not bad. But the plot is silly, the "Mortal Kombat" -like music has nothing to do here, the end is really s **** y ... Really, the only good thing about it is that my friends and I can laugh how uninteresting it was. I even wish I had wasted my money on something else. <br /> <br />
