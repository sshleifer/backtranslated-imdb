This movie is the worst thing ever created by humans. You think manos is the worst movie ever? It doesn't even come close to this garbage. I don't even know where to start. The "Russian" commander and the rebel chic are the worst "actors" ever to appear in a movie. They make the sister in trolley 2 like Meryl Streep. The goofy faces make the chic while being seen in kung fu training to be believed. Then there is the oompa music during the jailbreak, the completely chosen love scene, the stupid song playing in the out-of-place love scene, the false castro, the fact that everyone also has a band and / or bandana a part of their body, the ever-filmed rape scene, and the worst play ever on film. This movie deserves to be more familiar with bad movie lovers. Definitely the worst movie ever made.
