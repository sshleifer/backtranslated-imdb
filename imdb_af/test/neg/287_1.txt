I thought it was comedy !! What a hoot! I can't believe that Forsythe or Reynolds would actually appear in this piece. And then there is the beautiful Erika Eleniak or whatever this piece of eye candy is called. She has a few pounds since her Playboy center fold. about 50 !! The story line is ridiculous, the acting is absolutely horrible, and the tired old clich√©s running over and over, boy, it needs a lot of stamina to go through this dog. The only thing was worth it! And there are many! If you really want to kill, choose an hour and a half this baby at the rental shop, but make sure you have a room full of brain-dead people to see it with you. I think that's who it was written. It plays like they think of a real low rent, drug-induced audience for this one.
