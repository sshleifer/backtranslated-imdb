This game is a good first person shooter. ----------- Hang on ...... <br /> <br /> But of course a story about this genre should be placed, such a fairly innovative plot on soldiers now drugs are driven. To save the world and kill the terrorists, Nectar is the drug of choice that creates a super soldier. <br /> <br /> Great, just give us some fun, challenging missions, throw in some good new weapons and free terrain vehicles that we can freely manage. <br /> <br /> NO !! <br /> <br /> The creator of this game decides to create a propaganda, military-driven game that tries to make sense of our fears of terrorism and embrace democracy. The game has twisted ideals that only restore morality we've learned when we were in primary school, nothing new is told to us, but "drugs are bad ... mmmkay". Then pressed in a kind .... Yvan eht Nnnioooojjjjj! (joins the fleet) of how to stand up for the general good, given rations on normality and abnormality, right and wrong .... GOOOOOOOOOOD we get it! Let's kill something! <br /> <br /> NO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> You can't, you're forced to endure extremely long gaps to BULLSH! To complete T-objectives such as "Run to Helicopter" ....... "Go to group troops". ... Once it is finished ......... CINEMATIC takes you over ......... You put there for at least half the game and look at the little scenario by the characters played out. Can't beat but sit and wait, sometimes when people don't even talk, we wait and wait for a helicopter to land! <br /> <br /> Bad game, by a happy group of programmers! Don't make the others, because I'd rather see the movie!
