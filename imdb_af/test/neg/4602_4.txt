Clearly, this film was made for a new generation who had or did not have the work of Charles Bukowski. The autobiographical Henry Chinaski character in Bukowski's stories was brilliantly portrayed to perfection by Mickey Rourke in 1987's Barfly, starring Faye Dunaway. Anyone who has seen 'Factotum' must definitely see 'Barfly' to see how Bukowski wrote his character. "Factotum" lacks the greasy boredom of Bukowski's screenplay and the fearless hopelessness of his loneliness. The inadvertent humor bumped by the dark desperation of Chinaski's misadventures, does not work for Dillon, as it has done so miraculously for the overweight dirty bloody Rourke. Rourke's character makes the pain and pleasure of the previous night's misconduct a place for another bad ugly day in the life of a drunken misanthropic unknown author. Dillon's character misses these points in favor of a sturdy, attractive, clean, spectacular, wanna-writer who hardly goes into Chinaski's story for any moment. Dunaway's sloppy heroine Wanda is the perfect complement to the ne'er-do-well Henry. The women in 'Factotum' can't keep a candle on Dunaway's 'sad goddess' and using more profane sexual topics in 'Factotum' is more of a rough distraction than a boost of Bukowski's raw and unapologetic depictions of dysfunctional relationships. I was surprised at how much of the same scenes in Factotum were used. (Marisa Tomei buys all the stuff and loads it to the old man is an exact ending to 'Barfly'). <br /> <br /> If you want to see the best Bukowski stories on film, see 'Barfly' and 'Love is a Dog From Hell' (also called 'Crazy Love').
