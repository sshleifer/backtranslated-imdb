Legendary Cameron Mitchell turkey over an actor / makeup man who is burned by the head of a studio when a drink is thrown into his face while lighting a cigarette. Reduce to a scar and an eye spot. Mitchell works at the Movieland Wax Museum. He also kidnapped and murdered people using a solution that they paralyzed, so that they can turn them into performances. Actually weird bad movie disrupting description. See how the different wake-ups try not to move, see how the whole tobacco is digested from several southern states? See how things just get, get better and deeper. It's a terrible train wreck of a movie and you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. A classic bad movie that will astound you even because it leaves permanent scars on your psyche.
