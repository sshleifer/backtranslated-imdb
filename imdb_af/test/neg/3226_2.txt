Despite being one of John Cusack and Demi Moore's early films, it is one that can miss hardcore fans unless they absolutely have to complete the collection. I have rare moments, where I can handle better from death, but this movie is finally worse. I'm just not a Savage Steve Holland fan, and he did both movies. So, if you don't like the cheesy, random comedy and amateur animation, don't do it. FYI even for Demi Moore fans: she can't sing and the 80's synthesizers didn't spare her. There are too many predictable twists and too easy jokes. I suppose if you want unnecessary entertainment or something that you can leave behind and ignore while doing something productive, then it goes. Otherwise, don't see this movie. If John Cusack (or Demi Moore) couldn't save it, you know it should be bad. They are the only reason I didn't give this movie 1.
