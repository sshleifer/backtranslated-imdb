I saw it when I was 9. All I remember is a few scenes (the one where the main character Elle is chased by a man in a mask) and is scary. If I see it now, my opinions have changed. This is a pathetic "horror" movie about an opera run run by Gloria Grahame (sad) and with a young, talented girl Elle sent there after her mother, the town road, was killed with a hammer (graphically showed). The film has beaten, tortured, killed, hungered, attacked, raped, etc. adolescents (actually actors in their twenties). Etc. The brutal hammering is the beginning scene and then it gets worse and worse. There is nothing to recommend about this crap. The plot is stupid, all the dialogue is bad and the acting ... the less the better. How did this sickie achieve a GP (now PG) rating? It will now get a R. Worthless. One last thing ... a really repulsive strife is an incest.
