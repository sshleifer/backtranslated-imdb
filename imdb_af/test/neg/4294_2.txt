"The Yoke's on Me" is undoubtedly the most controversial film in the Stooges' 23-year shorts. The reason is understandable; according to today's standards, this role can be regarded as racist. For this reason, it is rarely shown on television. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that the Japanese who were seen in the movie were not soldiers; They were sent to a moving center by Japanese Americans during World War II. They were treated and shown as the evil enemy in this movie. At all accounts - including the US government, who made an excuse and recovery in the 1980s - Japanese Americans during World War II were as loyal and hardworking as any American. Their imprisonment at this time is a dark spot in American history. <br /> <br /> There are a few Stooge's in this movie, but the memories of how Japanese Americans were treated during this time are just the entertainment value. Let's not confuse the loyal Japanese Americans with their representation in this movie as malicious people. Loyal Japanese Americans and World War II's evil empire of Japan are not synonymous. 2 out of 10.
