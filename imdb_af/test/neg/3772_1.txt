This movie is an incredibly self-sufficient character piece that assumes that the mere impression of a story is as good as a real story. It was very painful to watch and I wasn't caught up with buying the DVD because of John Travolta and the positive buzz. I didn't look at it. <br /> <br /> This movie has nothing that looks like an interesting representation and looks dependent on weighty (and honest, heavy-handed) characterization. There is one devastating scene between Purslane and Bobby Long, in which a TV is destroyed which, when played, is incredibly slack and uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> I got less and less about the characters as I watched them. It was probably a lot of fun, movie-school-wise, to make it. But it's just very boring to watch. An indifferent and pretentious film school project that you shouldn't waste money on.
