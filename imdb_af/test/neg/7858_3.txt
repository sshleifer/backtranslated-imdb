Henry (Don Ameche) appears at the entrance to Hell and tells his life story to His Excellence (Laird Cregar). The story focuses on relationships with women throughout his life, and especially his relationship with Martha (Gene Tierney). At the end of the film we cut back to Henry and His Excellence for a very predictable end. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is nothing more to say about the movie because nothing happens. It is a sentimental story of one man's life and it is very boring. I watched it with my girlfriend and my dad and we all thought it was rubbish, despite the Lubitsch touch. I believed more than 15 times. Hugo (Charles Coburn) is good when he stands on the screen as the grandfather and there were some funny moments of dialogue. The color made it a great spectacle, but it wasn't enough to save this plodder. In the same form as "It's a Wonderful World" and "You Can't Take It", and not surprisingly, it is nominated for an Oscar. A story about ordinary people, of whom nobody is interesting and with no story of any interest. Drilling, sentimental and the biggest damp squib of an end I can remember ...
