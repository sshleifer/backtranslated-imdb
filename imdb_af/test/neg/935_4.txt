I saw this movie as a normal Hollywood movie, but then came to know that it was a movie channel for TV channel. On my 2-critics DVD cover, one of the critic, Stephen Farber, of moviline, known as a Best Picture of the Year. <br /> <br /> All the character was simple and decent performances, except for the brain's character that never got the size the director wanted to keep secret. There was tension to the end, but when you see the woman police officer and chieftain have a lesbian retirement, it seems quite stupid. Well know what happens to DAVE the male main character. <br /> <br /> The other critic of Mr. Brown's movies said it was shocking and effective, but didn't really live up to all the Hype ... I saw after watching the movie. for which I was partially aggrieved ... I had to read it first before I took the movie.
