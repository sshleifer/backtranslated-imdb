A ridiculous comedy with a coat of arms. I love one of the comments here: "Couldn't be made today". Well, neither "The Philadelphia Story" without a motor yacht or two. Nonetheless, does this mean that the picture is worse for the wear for the old-fashioned? I don't think "Susan Sleep Lord" was good for any generation and it should pacify peacefully in the memories of Debbie Reynolds buffs. There is no sparkle in this story of a screenwriter who ties in to a much younger girl for 'script research'. Dick Powell made his farewell look that had to be an embarrassment to him. Reynolds is pallied. Produced by one Harriet Parsons - giving her famous mother Louella a number of loose plugs. * 1/2 of ****
