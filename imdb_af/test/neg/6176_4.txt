Following the stormy success of The Wrestler (see my review), Mickey Rourke made this "gem" head straight to the video. Every copy was rented for months and I even heard some good buzz about it. So months later I caught it on a movie network and sat down to see it. First of all ... one of the places in the movie (Walpole Island) is a place I regularly visited as a child because we lived very close to the reserve. Cool huh? It's about where the coolness ends with this dud. I mean the story is decent enough to justify a four and even the direction isn't bad, but the shows are just awful and really ridiculous with some really wasted strong and Mickey $% # @ * &! Rourke plays a Native Canadian / American hit?!?! What in the Lord's name were they thinking? He doesn't even look like native blood and his attempt at the generic indigenous accent has made him look even more ridiculous. They could have been everywhere with this story ... they could have hired a native actor, or Rourke's character changed, how about a white man raised by native parents? Instead, they made a full and complete joke for Killhot. <br /> <br /> As you may have caught Mickey Rourke's "stars" in Killshot, I use the term loosely. I have never liked much of Rourke, although his Oscar winning performance was enough. It shows and confirms my aversion to him. He seems bored, constantly bored, and his lame attempt to give a native portrayal impedes me insulting. He makes a decent cold-blooded murderer, but then the story never explores that part of him that is totally backward to the story. Diane Lane, although respected in Hollywood, is turning into another deadly performance. She had her moments, but generally she did not take any action. She looks like she's going to be big, but when she's not, it's even more disappointing. Thomas Jane plays her protective husband. I always felt Jane deserved a bigger career than he did. I think he has starred in his blood. Everyone said his performance in Killshot wasn't really bad. He does not take too far and he is tough and almost heroic. He and Lane achieved proper chemistry, but he didn't get much in the way of his character. I have absolutely no idea why Rosario Dawson A) did this movie and B) didn't have a character at all. Her character is absolutely useless and has no sense in making the plot or story any performance she will be equally bad at. I rarely saw a character so incredibly useless. The only redeeming character and performance in this film is that of Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the confused mini-killer who wants to work with Rourke's hit. Gordon-Levitt is top-notch and entertaining and his character is actually doing. If this movie were completely over him, it would be a smash. He literally saves it from overall shit. His performance is almost worth seeing this bravery. <br /> <br /> Oscar nominated director ... who's waiting? Yes Oscar nominee director John Madden (I think the soccer coach could have done a better job) helpless this mess. I never really saw Shakespeare In Love, but I remember the critical praise it received and it surprised me because the direction in this movie and with the characters was totally awful. The scriptwriter Hossein Amini did nothing to recognize me, but apparently the next Jack Ryan movie was written and after this mess I can't even imagine why they want him. I understand this is based on a novel and I really hope the novel is worlds above this mess. A bit of action and a kind of hokey attempt to get an emotionally charged story of a hit and his mate and the mess they get involved. Unfortunately, unless you are a BIG Rourke fan or really like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, then there's no reason to put yourself through this pain. I did it for you and I still feel the pain. 10/04
