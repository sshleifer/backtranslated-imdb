I don't understand the very good reviews here. I found the photography and scenery beautiful, and the two main players are attractive, but here is little to recommend this movie. Most annoying is the false southern accent and badly written dialogue. This doesn't sound like real people to me. While it is refreshing to show men exploring different forms of sexuality without the usual labeling and stereotypical traits, most of the story is without motivation or logic. The only thing that makes a lot of sense is the responsibility Griffith feels about his mental intelligence, largely handed over by Karen Black. Lee is an interesting character who would be more compelling if the dialogue he was making was more natural and his motivation clearer. Yes, I understand that he is a drifter, but his actions like the movie draw to a hectic conclusion do not make sense at all. This movie is worth a look, mainly because it has a nice atmosphere about it, but it's slow moving and deeply flawed. A serious rewrite and better editing can have saved it, as the premise and storytelling are promising.
