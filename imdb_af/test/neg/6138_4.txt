This movie is likely to be a real decline unless you understand the circumstances under which it is made. The Marxes was chosen to play in the movie show of a play not originally written for them. They are kind of power-equipped in the rolls. Ironically, it might have been harder to use different actors who didn't have such high expectations. Instead, it is captured forever as part of a cannon that it really shouldn't deserve.
