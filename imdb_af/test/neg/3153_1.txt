Barney is just terrible. Like many other reviews on this show. I'm not one to disagree with them (I won't). Because I hate this show as much as they do. They use children who look like they are in the sixth grade, cheese plots, terrible dialogue and very special effects. Not to mention that big purple dinosaur himself. He makes every other children's show like the award winners (Sesame Street won prizes, which I know of). <br /> <br /> Just look at Sesame Street, Thomas the Tank Engine or even the Teletubbies. Avoid both, this and his movie (which I also reviewed). They are both extremely crappy and inappropriate for anyone (even small babies).
