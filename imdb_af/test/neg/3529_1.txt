Hello, <br /> <br /> I bought it on DVD from England. You see, I have one of those multi-region players. I thought it would be fun to get a cool movie to show to my friends. Well, surprise for Amy-Jo Johnson, she's hardly in the movie. Although she is on the cover. It's really hard to imagine how a movie that made this bad was in the first place. Maybe someone has a trust fund. <br /> <br /> Oh ... It's about Vampires living on the beach
