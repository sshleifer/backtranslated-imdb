Wow. The storyline about this was just incredibly stupid. I realize that this movie is supposed to be a comic genre. But even nonsense must at least make a vague kind of sense. <br /> <br /> Water has become incredibly rare? <br /> <br /> Well, it's weird, since hydrogenated oxygen (or oxidized hydrogen) is one of the most beautiful substances in the universe. And pretty easy to make. Reduce hydrogen and oxygen atoms, and voil√†, water. <br /> <br /> Instead of water, the rarity of dilithium crystals or something like a plot device should be used as something the pirates go through. Water as a plot device was just stupid, stupid, stupid. <br /> <br /> The "comedy" looked and confronted and forced. The comedy in the TV series "Red Dwarf" was complicated and confronted and forced, but it was actually amusing. Here I felt like saying, "Ha ha, it was just as funny, I forgot to laugh ..." <br /> <br /> Sigh ... put all the money in sets, costumes, actors. What a waste ... <br /> <br /> Instead of just grinding and grinding and complaining, it's my lame, my recommendations to make it better: 1) Use a credible plot device . 2) Get rid of the "comedy". None of the actors was really a good thing. The movie would work better as a "serious" action adventure. <br /> <br /> The intention of the authors was to make a haunting comedy, but they didn't really pull it out. It's probably that I'll ever look at it again. It's too much a total hack job.
