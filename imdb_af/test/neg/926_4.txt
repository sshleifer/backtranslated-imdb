Ignore the extreme voices about "House of Wax", in no way is it a "1" or a "10". I will try to help someone think of 'House of Wax' or for those who have seen it on the grounds of the trailer and feel cheated. The trailer makes this movie very promising, which is what trailers need to do. There is only one thing about trailers, if the producers can't connect some interesting elements to make a trailer, it is a very sure thing that the movie is a great sucking party. But a good trailer just tells you that a few things about the movie are good, it doesn't give you much idea about the overall package. Here, some research can be valuable. <br /> <br /> "House of Wax" stars, Elisha Cuthbert (whose acting skills are closer to Kathy Ireland than to her fellow Canadian Sarah Polley or her lookalike Rose McGowen), are directed by a music video artist who was previously known. like Jaume, in his distinctive debut. These are not good signs, but if you are like me, you ignore them and go to the work of production designer Grace Walken, who was responsible for the appearance of "Ghost Ship". Walken's work is worth seeing again, so much so that 90% of the film's $ 30 million budget seems to go into production design. The rest went to Cuthbert to compensate her for the abuse she had to take throughout the film (finger cut, lips glued, tied, and many in a variety of thrown things). By the way, Cuthbert looks much heavier than she did in "The Girl Next Door", about one big pork away from a big weight problem. <br /> <br /> That means they have little left to pay the rest of the cast and crew. And judging from what was on the screen, it would probably be true. Everyone else seems to have given their time to get their first acting or crew credit. Unfortunately, the contributions of all of these inexperienced / incompetent volunteers have been unhappy or uneasy about the pay gap. Less than zero. Inexperienced Steven Window's DP work was about as terrible as you probably would. see and work in a league with incompetent editor like Joel Negran (add "Pearl Harbor" here), they succeed in removing most of the value added by the production design group. Instead of sticking over and showing the sets, Window filmed these things with bad lighting and jerk-zoom-bobbing camera work. Negran aggravated the problem with an insane number of sobering cuts. Poor lighting, an ADD-like camera, and fiery cuts are what you use to hide inexpensive and silly production design. not what is needed if the movie's only power is its expensive and detailed sets. <br /> <br /> Chan Hayes did the script and Charles Belden (who wrote the original story) is credited as a writer, though except for the title and use of wax figures there is absolutely no agreement. One saving grace is that the movie doesn't take him seriously as a horror movie and mostly parody (adds Van Helsing here). The murders are played to laugh, too extreme to be scarce or even scary to anyone older than six. The audience especially crashed when a certain high-profile hotel heir ran her domestic face through a steel rod, although her earlier half-baked striptease was the only real, grisly thing in the film. Another comedy highlight was when Cuthbert knocked her finger through a grid and cut it through the bad man. <br /> <br /> The good scenes take place in Trudy's House of Wax, a wash that has something to do with closed sugar mills, paired twins, and lots of road views (with which Cuthbert goes bathing). All this is supposed to happen somewhere in rural Florida, although it looks quite like the hills of Paul Hogan's land. (The place for attention schools, the Gulf Coast is not known for its rolling terrain). The script apparently meant to play the connection (poor pun) between the two sets of twins, but somewhere during production or post-production most of the dialogue was cut off about this. As what's left of the twin connections doesn't make sense and go nowhere, you wonder why it's not cut to reduce the boredom factor. <br /> <br /> What is particularly sad is that producers are not the brain to recognize in mid-production that they have had the ingredients for a first-class horror classic - even with the existing cast. What they were facing was a chance to go somewhere with the illusion of a laundry. Because it is a photographic medium, modern film is actually naturalistic, almost without exception tending to create an illusion of reality. Here they had the opportunity to give the photographic medium a theatrical element of extreme styling. Like an impressionist painting, the town creates the imagination of reality from afar, but reveals itself as a highly styled washing plant close by. Of course, they would have had a Vision Director and DP to bring the thing down successfully, but all the others were already in place to make it happen.
