The only thing good about this movie is the artwork on the promotional poster by H. R. Geiger. Anti-nuke protesters who all look like late-1970s punk rockers and somehow become non-violent (except their leader, "Splatter") occupy the cities. Brotherhood boys fall on the punkers to make violence on them and make them victims. Bad acting and bad plot then falls to the right victim, you, the viewer. I gave it a "2" because some sexual scenes give it at least MST3K potential. <br /> <br />
