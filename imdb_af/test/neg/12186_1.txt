I watched this movie last night, I'm a big fan of the book, and I was pretty happy with the version that Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon played. But this one, it's just awful. Oh my God, I don't understand how they dared to disassemble this classic story and make the characters completely different. Start by converting the younger sister to Beth, and make Amy the third. And Jo's interpretation, horrible, Jo was a feminist, intelligent and friendly angry young woman, and the actress Jo in this movie serves as a foolish and very annoying girl. And what about the Laurie? I'm right with the fact that when a book is made in a movie, some changes need to be made, but not the whole story. done very badly.
