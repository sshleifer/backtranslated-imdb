I just saw it because my 10-year-old was bored. He and his friend hated it, but naturally loved being at the movies. This is the first time I have totally disagreed with Ebert for many years. There is no single thing to recommend this movie. Willis is good as always. But the story stinks, is incredible, there is no real story, no action, no interesting movies, no surprises, and worst of all, the child star is a thorough repulsive snail guaranteed to any parent who doesn't. a dweeby did not slip fat for a child. Anyway, keep away and save your child - unless you want to punish him or her. There is no excuse for such lousy directing or writing and one hope these filmmakers will suffer.
