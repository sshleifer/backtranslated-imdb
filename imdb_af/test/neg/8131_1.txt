I was unaware of this "fall" of a movie. <br /> <br /> If I could turn back time or just get a refund, I'd be happy. <br /> <br /> It was 7:30 pm and Cinderella Man didn't start at 10pm so I rushed into the theater to catch the movie that started at 19:20 ... and I dare say that God has stretched out his hand (or pulled it back) and allowed me to punish myself for my movie It can be unfair to criticize a movie not targeted at my heterosexual male cohort. However, there is no excuse for bad audio and video editing. This movie was most worthy of a high school project budget ... and I think I saw better in the dramatic French shorts we did about Louis Laloupe. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because I'm Canadian and this movie was for the LA Fudge-Packing crew and their sympathetic ladies. Woe to me when I realized that the whole audience was saving and jumping on all the jokes. I understood the toned humor, but I couldn't relate it. <br /> <br /> This show has shown me, presumably, how Gay men date and build relationships. But even if it was the purpose of the movie, I feel that the "Gayness" was too focused. Humanity turned out .... but again, maybe it was the point ... to just be avant-gard ... and to make a splash. <br /> <br /> I think with a low budget and poor equipment, you have to make your movie as hard as possible to get crowds and cash back. . I really wish I had read my Sheldon Van Auken before. Hehe ... I was completely wrong.
