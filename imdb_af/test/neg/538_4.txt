It is perfectly good that people die in an animation, but there is just too much death in this one. Beginning from the beginning, the story is all about battles, battles, death and revenge. It goes on for half an hour. It was interesting at the beginning, but I grew a lot of ties before the show was halfway through. Unlike other animations, this is a lack of humor. There are also not many interactions between the characters. The good thing about this is the sword fighting scene looks pretty good and the characters look nice.
