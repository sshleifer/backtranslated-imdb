Steven Seagal is a thief who specializes in the robbery of other drug dealers, giving the poor and the unhappy .. Harlan, the Robin Hood. Anyway, Harlan wants to go straight to his girlfriend, Jada (Mari Morrow), so he appeals as the driver of an armored car for a Max Stevens (Kevin Tighe wasted in a minor role). Max plans to have the millions for himself and his unscrupulous associates, with the intention of using his loader, Bruno (Robert Miano) to bring him the money, but Harlan has other plans. He escaped the police, hid the money and threatened Bruno (who had a loaded rifle on Harlan's head to shoot him if he didn't drive) after being caught by a large truck. Harlan went out. Harlan was imprisoned with, among other things, the murder of the police because of the damage caused by the high-speed chase, and many want to know where the money is. Harlan joins a prisoner, Ice (Treach), a leader of one of the many gangs in jail, with plans to find Max and eliminate every member of his corrupt chase. Soon, DEA agent Rachel Knowles (Sarah Buxton) will be part of this scenario, thanks to her boss, Saunders (Nick Mancuso), who claims drugs are involved. Also injected into the plot, Harlan's desire to save a children's hospital is to close and Jada has mysterious dreams about Max. <br /> <br /> Seagal and Treach played with each other in gangsta, while Buxton spent time trying to help Harlan, revealing the possibility her boss is in cahoots with Max. Mancuso's character is a strange duck, which allows Rachel a lot of leeway despite the threat she is facing for his career. Tighe appears for five or so minute tops, which is a shame. Seagal's Harlan escapes prison and finds every rich association of Max's, who has necessarily discovered his whereabouts after tearing a few skulls, cutting a few wrists and breaking legs. Treach speaks in his rapper speech and Seagal tries to answer him in kind, which gives unintentional laughter. As you would expect, many people are shot and Seagal doesn't break sweat. It is interesting to see Seagal in prison, among prisoners, to help out Treach when a group of Eses plans to take him out.
