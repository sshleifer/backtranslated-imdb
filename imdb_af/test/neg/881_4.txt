Richard Gere and Diane Lane star in a chick fly romance with the kind of end I really get angry ... Just say it's not my cup of tea, just like the dime store romances aren't my cup of tea. <Br /> <br /> The plot has a doctor who will stop at an inn and meet a woman in which he has a deep but short relationship with him. He goes out to meet his estranged son and she goes back to her life. <br /> <br /> Well-educated and well-made, the filmmakers forgot to get a real plot line. These are the things of dime store romances that make the women swoon and the men shake their heads in disbelief. I would not be as unfavorable to the film as a contemptuous romance, except that the film takes a turn in the final line that is so off the left to be absolutely incredible. Why should certain types of movies do such stupid things? It really ruined it for me. <br /> <br /> If you like romance, give it a shot, but wait for the cable.
