I watched this movie for about an hour (against my will) and couldn't complete it. I'll evaluate it as a 0. The writing was bad, the plot predictable and one that has been done too many times. The most annoying part of this movie was the play Melody Thomas Scott did. This part didn't ask anyone to look snobbish, but she managed to look like a (sour) snob or someone who wanted to send something extremely sarcastic or cruel at every stage I saw. <br /> <br /> The two romance that looked like something serious was almost at the couple's meeting was a bit too much. <br /> <br /> I need to know better than watching TV movies. If there is absolutely nothing on the list and it is the only choice, read a book.
