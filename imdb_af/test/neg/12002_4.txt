I couldn't help looking at every 5 to 10 minutes, because I got this movie a total hit. Childlike humor, cheap looking sets, cheap look-out effects, a plot that "Legally blonde" looks like "The Usual Suspects" and so many accidents I can now officially say that Robert Rodriguez had a brain surgery somewhere after 1996. The only thing he left as his trademark is some cool camera moves, but there is where it ends. Okay, so the guy decided to do something new for a change, a kid's movie. Well if I was 12, I would feel insulted. The best thing about this movie is the absolutely amazing Carla Gugino who just stole every scene. Unfortunately, she wasn't much. 10/04
