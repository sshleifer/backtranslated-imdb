I really wanted this movie, especially after all the buzz I heard about it. But unfortunately it just didn't work for me. Paranoid Park suffers from the same error Lost In Translation has - If you use very little dialogue, be heavy on slow motion close ups and concentrate on pieces of matter in the environment, then your story will become so deep and thoughtful. <br /> <br /> Many of the plot lines, if you can find a plot, of this movie are confronted. I was not impressed with the 'write it all down' confession as the protagonist handles the accident. So what should we believe? Fortunately, he has ever grown up and written a book about his experiences, which is why it is fair for the horrific incident. <br /> <br /> What I suppose should be a film that empowers a young man who is pointless and confronted with an impossible moral dilemma, rather a portrait of a future sociopathic personality. He has no connection with anyone around him, and by the end of the film has no real sense of what is right or wrong. He has no direction at home and does not feel anything to his friends. What we have is a portrait of a non-person, a spirit just kissing life while weaving his way onto his skateboard. I didn't feel at all for him and I honestly wish he was caught. The whole movie is not necessarily about his guilt feelings, but about how he will avoid punishment and / or liability for a bad decision. He not only gets away with it, he finds a way to subtly rationalize it. Quite a frightening, negative message, the suggestion that so many of our youth are disconnected from right and wrong that they simply make the rules as they go, serving themselves well or ill. I find it an abusive treats of today's youth, and the pretentious arrogance of the filmmaker dips thick with every plowing, over-emphasizing and moving of the eye. <br /> <br /> (He killed the guard, but if you flash your eyes miss it. Whether it was a merciful act or not, it's hard to say. It might be that he was so bored that he ran out of his skateboard, and if he was driving to the security guard's car, one of his skateboard wheels was stained with blood.)
