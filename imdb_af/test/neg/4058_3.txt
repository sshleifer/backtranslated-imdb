"Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver" is a very bad rehearsal to make a successor in the course of a single year. The first film was cute, nice and charming. The idea of ​​a basketball player playing is quite far-fetched, but he has taken enough stunts to save the concept. Even the human story has explained some of it. Josh's father died in a plane crash, so he's sad. And the audience also gets emotionally involved. <br /> <br /> Now for the poor successor. It's terrible. It's the worst kind of bad sequel, the kind that changes the good ideas and turns them into bad people. The kind that changes the main plot in one way, this time playing the K-9 football instead of basketball. No evil how long the time is kept in mind about the matter, doubting doubt, walk in with an open mind of an attitude you have with a movie like this. There are no positive thoughts when it comes to fixing bad movies. <br /> Successor stars Kevin Zegers as Josh, who is in grade eight. He lives with his mother and little sister in a Seattle suburb. In the first film, the human story lost to the father at the crash of a plane crash. Most people know how to lose a loved one. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the emotional plot is a little more complicated. Josh's mother is dating again. He and Buddy, his dog who can play basketball, do not like this. Why? If I were in his shoes, I would like to have an extra parent in my life, especially one that is nice. The man's name is Patrick Sullivan, and Josh's mother, Jackie, met him. He is a local vet for Buddy. <br /> <br /> The animal story is too simple. Josh is influenced by his best friend to try out for the school soccer team, the Timber Wolves. The team itself looks like something from America's finest home videos, the ball can even catch a ball, without stumbling or falling apart. So, when Bud arrives one day, he proves that he can play for them as a recipient, and that is undoubtedly the team's best player. <br /> <br /> Buddy is extremely cute in his soccer costume. Oh, he's enough to melt the heart. The dog is also the best in this movie. There wasn't enough stunts he did to draw attention to the fact that no one ever asked questions about a dog playing a school soccer team. <br /> <br /> There is a very bad sub-plot about Russian circus workers who like to steal wonderful animals, of course they are trying to catch Buddy. But their dull thoughts are controlled by the animals and eventually make them a "Home Alone" sign for them. <br /> <br /> "Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver" is much more goofy than the first one. The Russian kidnappers add a bunch of lamb breaker sticks, which I have to admit I have been laughing at its stupidity. There are too many rows showing a screw-ball nature and too few scenes that will see the real reason people watch this movie - to see a dog play soccer. <br /> <br /> The performances were also quite embarrassing. I like Gregory Harrison and Robert Costanzo's presentations, but the overall acting degree will be equivalent to a D +. Kevin Zegers and Cynthia Stevenson were absolutely pathetic. <br /> <br /> There were a few hilarious moments near the end through a few soccer announcers, but it's not even worth mentioning. Will kids enjoy this movie? Maybe, but even they will get tired when the heart feels that the discussions are getting too long and deep. They will surely complain that the dog did not have enough screen time, and have the fast-changing writing and protesting against the boring performances, arguing that this film is dirty compared to the origami already "Air Bud" if I did . <br /> <br /> I suppose they'll think the dog is rich.
