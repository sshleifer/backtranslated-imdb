Travolta and Thurman deserve a better movie. This one is very secondary in all respects, not a single fresh idea. But the biggest problem is the film's ridiculous philosophy. A gang of black rappers after all their criminal activities and even killing people is almost positive Mickey Mouse-like heroes acting on stage and giving awards at the ceremony. Maybe it fits in with real life. But to show it as a fairly normal "happy ending" is beyond my imagination. "What's wrong with shooting a few bad Ukrainians if they aren't politically correct?" - the show must continue! It makes me think that Hollywood writers have a big problem with the separation of good and evil, even if the genre is a "black comedy".
