I'm not a fan of the original book, but I expected to see a better fit than the Natalie Portman movie, which I found terrific. This version is even worse. <br /> <br /> First, there are very few of me. Gregory's book in this writing. The whole subplot of George Boleyn's sexuality is completely eliminated and in this version George is just a whisper between his duty to the Bolyn family and his duty to the King. I thought the title of the book refers to Maria as the lesser known of the Boleyn sisters, but here it is used to refer to Anne. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the writing confesses the characters the audience regularly as if in confession. Apparently, it is meant to give a bit of a narration and explain their motives, but it is amateurish in performance. <br /> <br /> On top of the bad writing, the direction is amazingly bad. There are too many shots that are done with a circular camera, which is not too resistant, and in the worst case, shaky. Several of the speeches are tentatively presented, as if they were in a first rehearsal. The production values ​​for Henry's flamboyant court are minimal. The costumes vary: some are copies of historical portraits and others are of some costume designer's celebrated imagination. And the King, the source of all power and favors, is often shown ONLY. No courtiers, no servants in the background - where are all the people? I'm used to Hollywood to change history in fantasy, but I expected better from a BBC production. Even because of a flawed book, this production is BAD.
