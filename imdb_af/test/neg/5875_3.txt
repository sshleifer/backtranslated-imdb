A conversation about how Jan-Michael Vincent is a lion has led me foolishly to visit this mid-90s DTV entry. A child is traumatized when he sees an Ice Cream man shot in the 1950s and becomes a psychic Ice Cream man (Clint Howard). Something happens and people disappear and end up in the ice. Blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> Director Norman Apstein (credited as Paul Norman) has made a career to do porn before and immediately returned. That's what you get to make all murders happen on the screen. And to throw a thin child as a fat child and get him a fat suit. Just throw a fat kid! There is also a scene where Vincent is reacting to a group of escaped wages that surround him. He was either completely drunk and was afraid of his life, or the filmmakers had "Did I really sink these layers?" Disgraceful. Despite a low budget, it had some good names, including David Naughton, Olivia Hussey, David Warner and his own Doug Llewelyn. How you can make a boring treasure chest with that role is beyond me.
