It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm still trying on how bad it is. Just because it attached Godard's name to it, doesn't make it good. In addition to the fact that it has absolutely no meaning, we see a bad long shot of a traffic jam that is not stunning, incredible or anything of the kind. While this long shot of the traffic jam is going on, you will probably feel more like making a pastrami sandwich than keeping it. Pieces of a supposed story, stupid, stupid characters. What message should we take for this? It offers nothing and serves no purpose. The arrogance of the director to show these tough, dull chain-smokers French people and to let them sit and talk about the hour, and then to leave it as art, is truly amazing.
