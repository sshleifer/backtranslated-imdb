In the Muslim country of Khalid (fictitious), his gracious leader / dictator, Reed Hadley as Amir, dies of cancer. Amir dies and unfolds a desperate plot. His body is wrapped in aluminum foil and in an illegal operation (the population does not know of his death) consisting of his doctor (Nigserian) and Mohammed from the country to perform a risky brain transplant. The operation is carried out by the shame dr. Kent Taylor, who believes there is no chance of failure and has two assistants. One of them is about 3 feet tall (Master Blaster does have Barter Town) and the other is a mutilated and traumatized 7-foot giant called Gor. What can possibly go wrong? <br /> <br /> Did I forget Amir's deathbed, American blonde Barbie woman, Tracy or that Dr. Do you call a dungeon with female slave test subjects and disorder of grandeur? What about a brain transplant that didn't take? There are many double trades throughout this and people are being killed, but I'm not going to lie to you anymore: MISSION IS REQUIRED. The points justify the means. If you can accept it, you won't have to waste 80 minutes. I hope this is enough warning. Don't say I didn't warn you. If you have to look, don't look alone and have enough medicine. <br /> <br /> Celluloid Rehab
