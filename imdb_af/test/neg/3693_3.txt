The plot in this movie is very thin, and there is not much acting. Val Kilmer - I don't know why he agreed to do this movie - played a small role as a gang leader. In short, the movie is boring to watch. <br /> <br /> A man similar to an archeology / religious professor examines an underground area of ​​Moscow, which has a history of railway construction and the Bolshevik revolution. A church tragedy in that history makes exploration "spiritual" and spirits of malicious intent haunt the underground ruins. A friend of the professor decides to find his girlfriend in the ground and hire a few Russian guides. The entire movie is based on this plot and contains many repetitive footage of the underground and some camera effects; much like those in "Day Watch", "Night Watch" etc.
