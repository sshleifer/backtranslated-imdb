That this movie is stuck to the wall of a chapel as proof that God is really dead. Am I the only one who really saw (rather slept) through this "movie"? It's the only movie I've ever seen in the theater I regret not going out and claiming my money back - it was just as boring. And I even saw "Highlander 2: The Quickening" at the local theater. From start to finish, Gibson and Downey have absolutely no chemistry as two unlikely, combined by circumstances, that eventually work together as best friends. The action (which is little there) is goofy and so boring as the skull bone of the author. Thank you for all that the wickedness breaks down on us, because it considers our "theater" that there is no chance of an "Air America 2."
