I classify it as the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> If there was ever a movie I'd want on my enemies, it would be. The plot is ridiculous, there are only 2 characters, and the coincidences between these characters are just full of faith. <br /> <br /> These factors combined to make it a very boring movie. <br /> <br /> My wife and mother walked the movie for about 15 minutes. I thought a movie this boring and slow should * have some interesting interesting plot twists, and a little disappointed was when nothing exciting materialized. <br /> <br /> I briefly considered sending filmmakers an account for my 2 hour lost life.
