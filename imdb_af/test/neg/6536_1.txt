So then ... this is what goes on as a high art for the likes of SXSW Film Festival and Sundance, eh? Well, I suppose I can be completely irrelevant as long as story, essay, dialogue, play (except Ms Aselton), cinematography and editing. <br /> <br /> I remember telling other movie people in a few years Since then, the biggest problem with digital video was that we now had to venture through a future sea of ​​crap to get anything worthwhile watch now that someone and his brother (or brothers in the case of the Duplass) could run and make a movie. "The Puffy Chair." Should I say more? <br /> <br /> This feature-length video is another chapter in the gloomy, ever-growing world of dudeology movies; Young guns armed with a DVX100A, a few thousand dollars, a hurry written, level writing and a few friends call them actors who decide one afternoon to make a movie and voilà! Don't get me wrong - I'm all about independent theater (ie Hollywierd sucks). But if you have said that, you can't argue with some of the realities of that system. <br /> <br /> If the Duplass brothers had to go out and raise a real budget and bring it to real producers, it would be clear that a script like this had never been lit! And there lies the problem. There is no such thing as a beating process to get movies (sorry ... videos) ready for production. Just grab a DV / P2 camera and go away! And what makes it worse is that high-profile festivals like the aforementioned actually embrace and encourage this kind of nonsense. And why? Exactly because she's no budget. <br /> <br /> I think it's important, especially in the current Indian movie climate, to stop video makers from using the language to "label" themselves. There is quite a difference in my book. If you go out and actually put your writing on the line, ask friends and family or businessmen to make money to make a "movie" feature, and know the potential losses at stake, then you will know what it means to a "filmmaker." But a few hundred at Sam's Club fall for some DV tires, some soda and chips don't cut it. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah ... and by the way ... I have to mention how totally annoying it was to listen to a woman being addressed all over the movie as "man." Even Mark Borchardt retains that intense over-exploited moniker for his male friends just where it is at least frightening where his girlfriend Mike is worried. <br /> <br /> I think his high time has begun to call the Indie movie community this crook. , no-budget videos for what they are, and at the same time prestigious feasts for the dedication of such casual efforts, high praise. Or it either asks these festivals to at least have the courtesy to add a new category to their line-ups ... "Dude Movies."
