You know the story of Sweeney Todd now, most likely thanks to Tim Burton's recent movie. You probably don't know, from here the old story of Andy Milligan - that infamous sleaze dealer who gave Al Adamson and Ted V. Mikels a run for their money. <br /> <br /> Eventually it had to happen. In my years of horror and exploitation of the 60's to the 80's, I finally reviewed an Andy Milligan movie. You see, from 1964 to 1990, Andy gave us a lot of exploitation and horror movie. None was good, and hardly visible. "The bloodthirsty butchers" are no exception. <br /> <br /> There is dialogue and indeed, there is talk, and this is one of the things you will find here, many and many. The movie reaches almost "Manos The Hands of Fate" levels, as you are constantly waiting for something to happen. While I love cheap effects, the violence is too little and far between, and despite its reputation, the breast scene is not so shocking. <br /> <br /> I love cheap and heavy exploitation as much as the next trash can, but Bloodstirsty Butchers is the kind of bad thing that MST3K ruthlessly tore apart. Unfortunately, Milligan would die of AIDS in 1991, and if there was a movie from him, I would say it would be, it would be the boring "The Ghastly Ones". However, this is no "horror" - it's just bad.
