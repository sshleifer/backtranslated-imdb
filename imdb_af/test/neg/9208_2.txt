This is the kind of movie that can ruin multiple careers if rubbish can destroy the film career these days. <br /> <br /> Melanie Griffith took off her shirt, and in her pre-reinforcement operation days she really had to be Jeff Daniels was completely wasted, but happy for him and for us he has done much better since this ... this ... this ... well, heck, a piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> Strangely, all his big players have gone on bigger and better things, including director Jonathan Demme. His work here was also wasted, but deserved an admiration. I mean, anything that isn't worth it is not worth doing well. But he did it well. <br /> <br /> However, there was one bright, shiny aspect: Ray Liotta, who is on the credit list, stole everything completely. Liotta was pleasantly pleasing! Hypnotic! Enthralling. <br /> <br /> I saw this piece of garbage while it was still relatively new, in a friend's private theater. For a strange reason my friend loved it. I think that is because Melanie Griffith has taken off her shirt (and really, honestly, she shouldn't have), though he tried to claim it was other, more artistic reasons. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I even thought, after his first scene, that Ray Liotta would become a great star, or at least a great, highly respected actor. <br /> <br /> Despite the dirty aspects of the dirt headline, the ugly ugliness of the whole story has made Liotta almost worth watching. In fact, it is worthwhile to see how far Ray Liotta came. I mean, for one thing, his name is usually listed at or near the top. <br /> <br /> Even then, even in a pile of waste, Ray Liotta shone like a diamond. <br /> <br /> If you see this trash, be prepared to hold your nose. Each main character is either amoral or immoral. Terrible movie. Terrible movie idea. <br /> <br /> Added comment: Too many people replied "Was this comment helpful?" with a "no" because they disagree with the expressed opinion. Perhaps IMDb should rather ask the question: "Do you agree with these opinions?"
