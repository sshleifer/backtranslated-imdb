Isaac Florentine made some of the best Western Martial Arts action movies ever made. In particular, US Seals 2, Cold Harvest, Special Forces and Undisputed 2 are all action classics. You can say Isaac has a real passion for the genre and his films are always understanding, creative and sharp, with some of the best fighting series that an action fan can hope for. In particular, he found a muse with Scott Adkins as a talented actor and action practitioner you can hope for. This is expressed by special forces and undisputed 2, but unfortunately the shepherd just doesn't live up to their abilities. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that JCVD ​​is fighting here better than it did. Years, especially in the battle, he (for pretty much no reason) in a prison cell, and in the final confrontation with Scott, but looks in his eyes. JCVD seems to be dead inside. There is nothing in his eyes. It is as if he just doesn't care about anything throughout the film. And this is the leading man. <br /> <br /> There are other dodgy aspects of the movie, in essence and visually, but the biggest problem is that you are not able to empathize with the hero of the movie. A real shame as I know we all wanted this movie to be as special as it really could have been. There are some good bits, mostly the action scenes themselves. This film had a tremendous director and action choreographer, and a great opponent for JCVD ​​to watch. It could have been the one who threw the veteran action star back to scratch the ball action movie. <br /> <br /> Sincerely sorry that this did not happen.
