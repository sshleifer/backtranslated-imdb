While studying the differences between religion and cult in college, Mindy (Rachel Miner), the best student in class, convinced her schoolmates Cassandra (Taryn Manning), Bailey (Glenn Dunk), Alex (Joel Michaely) and Morgan (Victoria Venegas) to investigate Kwan Yin worshipers by their leader Owen Quinlin (Robert Berson) in California twenty years ago. Quinlin found an ancient amulet in South China that would give him enormous power after the sacrifice of human souls, but resist one woman and he is destroyed. But after the death of Morgan, who allegedly committed suicide, the students discovered that Quinlin had returned and pursued their souls with his amulet. <br /> <br /> The story of 'Cult' is not quite bad. Unfortunately, the script, the direction, the play, the lines, the camera, the CGI and the edition are terrible. I was completely bored and requested to use the FF button of the DVD, but I resisted and wasted 90 minutes of my life. My voice is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Amuleto Secreto" ("The Secret Charm")
