How is this time and age, people are still stupid enough to think others are stupid? Perhaps stupid people like things that make them feel smart. Like 'the war at home'. "Cuss, it's even stupid than the stupid people who see it. There are no jokes, just half jokes and slight gags that barely even justify a small internal smile. The acting is your typical, unhealthy, idiotic, standard sitcom flailing limbs acting and why, oh, why did this crap replace arrested development? Well, you have to hand it over to fox, knowing that they must have dull performances to attract all the stupid viewers. reason why Arrested Development was not very popular was because it was so clever, it was so clever that it made stupid, bad it was so stupid, and of course, if a stupid person meets a smart person, the stupid person hates the smart person, most of the time anyway, either it, or try and mooch off the smart person.If you like this show and one of the stupid people, I really can't understand How it should be to have no open eyes and open minds, I can't understand how it should be mindless, laughing drones, influenced by every thing. Basically, people who laugh at a track are parrots. Trained, obedient, sensible parrots. Maybe I shouldn't insult parrots by comparing them to you. You know who you are. (If I look like a bastar * in this review, it's because I'm so bad that AD is canceled.)
