I don't know about you, but I'm going to be scared of horror movies and it was nothing but scary, the movie had several chances to really miss and fail every time! Several of these so-called exciting moments are haunted by some of the worst CG, you will see this year, maybe ten years! I mean if I say the cg looks like TV in the day, I give TV night a bad name, I saw better things on the sci-fi channel. Who I really feel sorry for is the actors (they attached their names to this movie). They did a good job, I cared about most characters and I felt their performances were pretty good, but it wasn't enough to bring this movie out of the box. What is really amusing is the reuse of some of the sets. If you saw "exorcist: the beginning" it will be easy to see the reuse of some of the buildings. But what I thought was the worst aspect of this movie, even above the CG problems was the main monster, but he was just not scary. His form, the way he spoke, was very fine. All this movie was a terrible experience and I would have walked out of the theater if it wasn't for my wife to see the end.
