OK, everyone is so enthusiastic about this movie. I didn't dare immediately add a negative review, but I just didn't enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> I have to say I overstuffed the movie in Russian language so I missed some dialogue but not much. <br /> <br /> Nice things first. There are a few hilarious moments (the Elvis imitator for example). Actors seem well-cast, including the Russians. Efremova is good and Goldblum is very good. This brings us the disadvantages of this movie. First. There is hardly a story and the end we already know: Yeltsin wins. So no drama or tension. They tried to solve this problem with an upcoming issue between the above actors, but the story kind of evaporated. <br /> <br /> More importantly, the film does not represent reality. The Russians at the level of politics and society portrayed in this movie are not funny, they are a serious and dangerous destiny. I am prepared to believe that in some of the countries fleeing the spin doctors the pilots helped Yeltsin win his campaign, but the really interesting questions to be addressed are: who financed the campaign, what got them back, how was the opposition handled <br /> <br /> So, what we have here is a movie, loosely based on reality (but strangely avoiding something the movie either historically relevant or not) can make a very good political excitement without plot or subplot.
