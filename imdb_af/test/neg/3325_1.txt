This movie was basically set up for failure by the studio. One, Anne Rice (author of the book), offered to write the screenplay, but was refused by the studio. Two, they tried to put 2 in-depth novels in a 2-hour movie. <br /> <br /> I maintain the only way for these two books, Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned, to work in a vibrant action form. be through a mini series. First, the Vampire Lestat finds itself alone from the 1700s to the 1980s and has an abundance of character that is essential to the plot of the main character, Lestat. The whole book of Vampire Lestat raises the events of the second part Queen of the Condemned. Without the full understanding, the prospect of a movie is destroyed. <br /> <br /> Lestat was not cruel and angry at all, he didn't want to go with Akasha's plans, Marius didn't make Lestat, Lestat didn't love Jesse or her, Lestat couldn't stay light unashamed, Marius was not to David and vice versa. Each character was completely misrepresented. BASIC NAME calls another story. <br /> <br /> If they wanted to make a vampire movie, well. Even if you want to be inspired by these novels, it's good. But don't get piggy back in the theaters from the success of Rice's great novels and characters to just destroy what her loyal readers have come to love. <br /> <br /> If you haven't read the books, you won't really understand the movie, if you've read the books, you'll be insulted. That being said, I'm such a big fan that I had to see the movie know well and that would be the case and still went for it. Catch 22, see it, hate it.
