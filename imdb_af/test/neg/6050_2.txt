OK, so Herc is hungry ... but the rest of the 3 hours was wasted, wasted ... oh humanity! <br /> <br /> Weak Sean Astin had to wait for his master at the same heights of New Zealand! Can it be? Someone in the production crew of Lord of the Rings was in his spare time home movies! Yes, that's it! <br /> <br /> I wish I could at least say he was promising. <br /> <br /> The special effects were often laughing. <br /> <br /> But Herc was hungry. <br /> <br /> NH
