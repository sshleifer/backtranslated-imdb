I try desperately to stay awake while watching the movie Solomon Kane. I have about 20 minutes to go. If it gets better, I'll come back here and let you know, but I doubt it will happen. Solomon Kane seems to be based on the video game Dark Watch, and it sounds like it is based on the video game Legacy of Kane, but unfortunately it is not true either. I hear it is based on some cartoon or graphic novel or pulp fiction or something I have never heard of, but whatever it is based on, there is nothing original in this incredibly boring movie. The atmosphere was stolen from the movie 300, which was not so good in the first place. The boring over-processing takes itself so seriously that it is almost hypnotic, and to be clear, I mean it badly. The plot is virtually non-existent: violent man who is not violent, meets friendly family, friendly family is murdered, violent becomes violent again. All the characters are stereotypes taken from Waterworld or Book of Eli or The Hills Have Eyes, or whatever, just choose another apocalyptic slide-fantasy-slide-wizard movie you've seen and there you have. Someone said somewhere: this is how to make a movie: use a blue filter to look everything apart, make lots of slow-motion shots of horseshoe splashing in dark splashes, add snowflakes while two boring characters talk to each other , and oh yes, rain drops dramatically to derive from the fact that nothing really happens, and don't forget that the black silhouettes walk towards us with fire blowing behind them, and many flares burn, and of course blurry scenes during which it is not clear what is actually happening, because we do not have the budget for the greedy special effects, so just throw in the sound of metal sound, and, oh, then do not leave any character long enough for the audience to Understand them, talk to them, or sympathize with them, and cross fingers, hoping swords and magic film fans will upload it, even if it is full, and go straight to the video, fail GO. . .
