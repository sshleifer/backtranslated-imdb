***** Spoiler Forward ***** <br /> <br /> I suppose you shouldn't expect much from a TV movie, but this one was especially bad, the plot was a good idea But badly done, the acting wasn't very good. And the end of the movie was just terrible. The main character was completely normal throughout the movie, and then suddenly when we found out she was the killer, she became a psychopath who was challenged spiritually. It's completely pathetic. <br /> <br /> There is just one reason to really see this movie, Yasmin Bleeth, though we haven't all seen in a swimsuit? Don't bother wasting this time, if you want a movie about the world of beauty competition, then look "Drop Dead Gorgeous" instead, it's just an infinite number of times better.
