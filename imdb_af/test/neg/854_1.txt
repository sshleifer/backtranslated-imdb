Technically, this movie would have had everything: decent actors, a beautiful landscape, no obvious goals of lack of budget, a celebrity like Richard Attenborough. the plot summary also sounds promising and suggests a satire on foolish bureaucracy and general people living it. <br /> <br /> It never delivers. the plot is simply too illogical. Throughout the movie, not one person does a single meaningful thing. crazy politicians, ridiculous soldiers, brain-dead villagers - everybody just moves from one incredible situation to the next. What they all do never makes sense in a context beyond the current scene. <br /> <br /> Of course, this kind of movie should be absurd and exaggerated. However, it is also supposed to have at least one example pointing out the madness behind the division of a city in the center. In fact, there are (at least) two attempts, which unfortunately fail: the main character, who has no idea what is happening to him, and the author who sometimes discourages jokes from the down is considered funny by an audience who is just 12-year-olds exist. <br /> <br /> What I liked most is that the movie is always funny all the time, but doesn't make me laugh. I saw some bad "funny" movies, but so far each of them had at least 2 or 3 good laughs. so in this sense "puckoon" is really remarkable. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good movie with a comparable plot, watch "Brazil". Don't waste your time on "puckoon".
