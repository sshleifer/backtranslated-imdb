Saboteur was one of the few Hitchcocks I had yet to discover and I was less than half overwhelmed. The French title "La Cinqui√®me colonne" (ie the fifth column, a very positive phrase for underground espionage and sabotage organizations) set my expectations quite high as the images of the final on top of the Statue of Liberty. <br /> Basically, Saboteur is so much lighter than the 39 steps (note, it's another great phrase, even McGuffin as a title), but it has the most of humor (so the characters are rather on earth) and it certainly is not so fast. As a chasing movie across the US from LA to NY, Saboteur drags his feet sequentially. The order at the villain's lovely farm? Beautiful farm, beautiful villain but pretty tame on the whole, it doesn't really add to anything. The encounter with the blind man, the blend with Circus people, the Soda City order, the NY ball order? They fall flat and bring more characters with very little suspension value. <br /> <br /> One big problem I can point out is the relationship between the lead Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane who didn't build up like Robert Donat. and Madeleine Caroll in the 39 steps. Hence, the entire narrative structure is swinging, depending on the addition of new scenes. And new scenes just bring us to the end as it's not clear whether the hook is the hero's escape from the police, the villains or his action to stop the plagued sabotages. In the 39 steps it is clearly written as 1 / escape from the police (so you know the hero cannot just go to the police) then 2 / run for his life and to the villains to prove his innocence. <br /> <br /> If you want a better Hitchcock from the war propaganda of the 40's, I will advise you to choose foreign correspondent about Saboteur. They are both chase movies with a catchy final, and really a gripping and not just a visit to foreign correspondent, as well as beautifully efficient scenes (the umbrella wares, the tulip field, the strange mills ...).
