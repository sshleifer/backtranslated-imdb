Space is a vacuum, right? That's why the room sucks. Vampires also suck. A very bad vampire movie that's in space will have twice the suction, right? <br /> <br /> It started with what could have been a fun point of departure. The return of Bram Stoker's Dracula story in the future. There is a rescue team sent out to investigate a cargo ship lost in space called the Demeter. Fans of the original novel will unknowingly assume that it will be a fair tale of Dracula in the future ... unfortunately, short of partnering, this one takes the lowbrow route and goes 20 minutes later in the B movie when Coolio becomes a vampire. Trust me when I tell you he is the best actor in the movie, and it doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> Casper Van Dien has to put his products on a daily television basket. Erika Eleniak had to quit after leaving Baywatch and poor Udo Kier had trouble reading the tickets. The man playing Dracula in this one is more ridiculous than Frank Langella was in the 1970s. If you can read through the whole movie, you'll be rewarded with the worst end imaginable. The end makes one wonder if the actors and the crew realize what a piece of garbage has made and ran off the set. <br /> <br /> Beware, vampire supporters. This one sucks twice as hard.
