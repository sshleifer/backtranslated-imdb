This version of Mansfield Park, while being extremely accurate for the novel, felt the compassion I felt for Fanny, essential to this Jane Austen story. This was due to the total lack of acting ability of the actress, Sylvestra Le Touzel. She had no appeal and sometimes found it lost in space or in depth. The scene she had with her uncle where he broke down in hysteria was hysterical. She surprised the critical scene and I felt sorry for Henry Crawford's care. <br /> <br /> The polar opposite is the depiction of Mary Crawford by Jackie Smith-Wood. What a wonderful actress, in a very difficult part to make that character spiritually and self-centered, selfish, yet susceptible to love. <br /> <br /> I always loved Fanny. She is gentle, but with an unrelenting sense of right and who she thinks respect and admiration are worthy. The Fanny in this adaptation is too soft and subordinate with barely a thought of her own until the end of the series. As much as I wanted this Fanny. I just couldn't. <br /> <br /> I suggest sending this version of Mansfield Park for the right thing ... the novel. Fanny won't be disappointed ... you'll love her!
