This movie is worse than terrible! It took a good story plot and changed it into schizophrenic theater. Photography is exceptionally amateurish. . . Looks like a homework project of the 5th graders filmed with malfunctioning 8mm kiddie cameras. . . The editing seems to have been done by someone with psychotic flashbacks (while on drugs and liquor), cut short scenes, followed by other unrelated scenes, then pasted chopped segments of scenes. . . completely unnecessary and unnecessary nudity. . . missing scenes. . . Daily scenes are inexplicably changed in night-time scenes, then suddenly back to the day. . . Of course, no continuity. Tom Skerritt, Wendy Hughes and James Mason's good acting skills are being wasted, as well as the talents of the "key" supporting role players (forget the villain and Anderson women - very amateur acting). This movie is a good candidate for a remake, even with Skerritt and Hughes. . . just do it professionally this time.
