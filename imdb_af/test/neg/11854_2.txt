I'm a big Eric Roberts fan, I am collecting his movies and so far I have 60. But I'm honest to say that he sometimes makes bad movies. But that's why I love him. He is entertaining. <br /> <br /> But this one has to take the prize, I can't stop wondering why. Somehow they managed to get Eric and Corbin Bernsen on the picture too. <br /> <br /> While Bernsen is simply awful (I don't really like him), Roberts is the best thing in the movie. doesn't mean much). He does this practically on a routine basis. <br /> <br /> The female lead (Brasselle) looks like a plastic doll and acts like one. And Tim Abell and his crew look like plastic dolls from action men and act like those. <br /> <br /> The plot is really embarrassing. I didn't see any Carnosaur movies, so I can't recall the footage added from there, but it does explain some things. Still there are holes like craters in the plot. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ALERT <br /> <br /> The first attacks are located outside the lab near the forest. But in the end they blow the whole lab into pieces and just relax that everything is over, but they forgot about those outside. When the helicopter pilot is eaten alive, I wonder how she couldn't climb a T-rex in the helicopter ???? <br /> <br /> The guys in orange overalls are my favorite - what do they do for a brace or what? /> <br /> Of course there is also a B-movie standard sex scene with silicon pops involved. This time it is Lorissa McComas who greets us. I have no problem with it (she looks terrible), but looking at a man who is kneeling and on the edge of the peak for 8! minutes are just too long. <br /> <br /> Shame on you all (including Eric Roberts) - Now I'm looking forward to Con Games (I'm wondering?)
