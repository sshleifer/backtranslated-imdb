"Red Sonja" is defective, weak and lacking. Even the camp is not good. <br /> <br /> There are only two good things about "Red Sonja"; The costumes (although the red Sonja costume is ridiculous. It is ironic that a girl who is even afraid of being touched by men, because she was raped, still chooses to carry so little young, even when it rains.) And the music by Ennio Morricone. Yet the film is somewhat observable, but definitely not recommended. <br /> <br /> The story is extremely simple and they didn't even bother to make it interesting. The story could have been forgotten if there were some good action sequences and some humor, both were present, but were severely flawed in many ways. The movie takes him too seriously and tries to impress, but completely fails. <br /> <br /> Brigitte Nielsen is a terrible front lady. I don't know whose accent is worse; Hers or Arnies and, moreover; She can't act. There is absolutely no chemistry between the two characters that make the love story totally incredible. Even worse was Sandahl Bergman as the main villain who is weaker than a paper bag. Ronald Lacey was somewhat good in his role, but my God saw him terribly. He has changed so much since his (only known) role in "Raiders of the Lost Ark". Perhaps it had something to do with his illness that claimed his life in 1991? And, incidentally, what was with all the "Raiders of the Lost Ark" actors in this movie? In addition to Ronald Lacey, Pat Roach, Terry Richards and Tutte Lemkow appear in a role, it looked like a kind of Raiders of the Lost Ark reunion. <br /> <br /> The only times when the movie gets a little interesting is during the (sword) battles, although some of them are unnecessary and weak. <br /> <br /> Only really viewable for the fans of the fantasy genre. <br /> <br /> 4/10
