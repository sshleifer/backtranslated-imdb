The stranger Jack (Matthew Lillard) arrives in the studio of the crooked collector of ancient Max (Vincent D'Onofrio) and tells his ambitious partner and specialist in poisons Jamie (Valeria Golino) that he is Jack's brother. Jamie doesn't buy his story, dominate Jack and tie him to a chair. When Max arrives, Jack sets an amount of US $ 100,000.00 for everyone to protect him in a negotiation of the ancient "Spanish Judges" with a rich and dangerous collector. Max invites his dumb acquaintance (Mark Boone Junior), who, together with his delayed girl who believes she is from Mars, is compiling the backup team. Jack, however, doubles the collector and then intrigues Jack, Jamie and Piece. <br /> <br /> The low budget "Spanish Judges" is a movie with a reasonable script with a horrible conclusion that loses a good role. Valeria Golino is surprisingly beautiful, but with the good actor Vincent D'Onofrio they can't save the stupid story. Furthermore, the screens that are supposed to be funny work unfortunately, and actually they are stupid and not funny. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Tudo Por Dinheiro" ("Everything for money")
