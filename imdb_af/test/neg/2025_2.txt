Author's author Steve Tesich's sophomore effort (following the overwhelming BREAKING AWAY) is a compliment of clich√©s, coincidence and dour melodrama. Perhaps he lived these things; if so, I'm sorry to say that he couldn't inexplicably dramatize. <br /> <br /> In fairness, he isn't much helped by Arthur Penn, a talented director who has done remarkable work in the past. (BONNIE AND CLYDE, LITTLE BIG MAN), but fails to inject any energy or veracity into Tesich's story. <br /> <br /> The governor struggles as well as they can, but is sown with poor motivation and dialogue. Sympathetic should especially be reserved for Craig Wasson, whose morale performance hides the continuous fast-paced fading of his leading man's career, as well as the embarrassment of untouched Jodi Thelen, as the incredible femme fatale of the film. <br /> <br /> It all looks longer than it is, and any points made are heavy-handed and obvious. See Arthur Penn's earlier approach to the subject of the 60s, the droll and elegiac ALICE'S RESTAURANT; That's all this is not.
