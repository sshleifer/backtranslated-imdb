The book is wonderful. This is one of my favorite books ever. The film, on the other hand, is incredibly unsatisfactory and bad! When I heard Damon would play Ripley, I knew this production was doomed. But I didn't expect it to be that bad. The actors go around acting very prominently. Except for the law (and even he is guilty of some striking acting), all the actors here are almost amateur. To speak Italian and to move your arms or hair should not be considered acting. Damon is wrong. He is too stiff for a character who must be a chameleon. Paltrow is forgotten and Hoffman plays a slightly slender character. Talk about typing. <br /> <br /> What is really unforgiving about the script (written by the over-the-top director) is that it completely rejects every subtle detail of the book and pops out of its own, and none of them works. ! Adding the Jazz music stuff is completely wrong! I suspect Minghella's idea of ​​Italy in the late 50's, early 60's is clouded with images of Chet Baker rolling around the Italian countryside and spreading amore. Yes, Minghella is a true visionary. The movie is so blooming obvious. The foolish scene when Ripley drives through the narrow street full of mirrors. Lots of laughs. Yes, we get the point !!! Every point or detail comes a mile away, so much so that the film can give the audience the false impression that they have psychic powers. For example, we know that the Blanchett character, introduced at the beginning of the film, will come back later, but only complicate. And the soundtrack is sometimes inappropriate. Whimsical when it shouldn't be. The film goes on too long and in all sorts of senseless directions. There are too many boring characters populating the landscape (many not in the book). This movie is bad! Really bad! <br /> <br /> Apparently Minghella's son told his father that the Ripley novel was his favorite. Mr. Minghella then proceeded to direct it to his son as a favor. Well, the director reached what he wanted to do: Talented Mr. Ripley, with his Hitchcock aspirations, is a film made strictly for 12-year-olds!
