It's really a pity that IMDb doesn't allow you to vote negatively. It is the most terrible terrible show ever flown to the American public by our normally neighbors in the north. The parents are a troglodite and a neurotic hag. He is as charming as a well-used fire hydrant, with the same hygiene standards. She is a wax museum mannequin programmed with more neuroses than the entire cast of the view. The children are non-entities as female and repulsive beyond belief as male, especially the title character. The boy is a serious contender for the most insane, self-fulfilled, arrogant and vain male character on Disney, who says something. This show is apparently considered the anti-BRADY BUNCH, but it comes down to the anti-Christ. And why is photography so dark?
