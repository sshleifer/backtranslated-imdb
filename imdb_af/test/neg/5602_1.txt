DeCoteau has to be one of the worst "directors" in any genre today, and it has nothing to do with his movies that usually contain homuroticism and that guys walk around in their matching boxer underpants. Remember ... anyone in tight black lingerie is satanic and angry and wants your blood / soul bulge ... such a deep symbolism here). I just sat down by The Sisterhood to justify him. I try every horror movie I can see, and Barbara from Crampton in there (I was previously sucked into the world of DeCoteau thanks to Linnea Quigley, Adrienne Barbeau and various other actors I would like to have.) <br /> <br /> Lemme tells you about The Sisterhood ... As the other reviewer pointed out, the alleged plot involves lesbian vampires on a college campus. But never had a parade of hot young babies ("actresses" if you like) walking so bored in bras, panties and bikinis. The movie has no plot, no gore, no nudity and the dialogue is ridiculous and looks like they made it up. Parts are slowly started and repeated repeatedly to push the running time. About ten minutes of this one consists of characters just walking around on campus (oh the excitement!) It looks more like a hotel resort than any university I've ever been to. And acting is the absolute worst. The only thing these girls do well leans forward and bends to point out their bodies. The cast was so without talent that I would be shocked to see one of them get a one-day role in Passion in the future. It's for the guys. Yes DeCoteau also puts more hot guys in lingerie in this one too ... guys who have to be in a K-Mart brochure instead of trying to act. Should these people actually have audition or just appear at Dave's office and take off their clothes? I think the answer is obvious. <br /> <br /> I'm willing to give any movie a chance as 1.) it's intelligently written, well-directed, original and skillful (or hell, even ambitious and stylish). . Or 2.) it's a bunch of gore, nudity, different trashiness and / or it's unintentionally hilarious. David DeCoteau's movies do nothing of them, and they do it on better-than-normal production values ​​for direct-to-video flashes. What a waste! So what is the appeal, especially with the advent of soft and hardcore porn that is easily accessible to anyone with a computer? I simply can't answer it. <br /> <br /> DeCoteau is a gay horror director and can use his resources to put a unique turn on the genre. Instead, he produces sensible grief without our clear talent or intelligence. Ironically, if you think of it, his films are anything but pro-gay. They actually make homosexuality ugly, mysterious and sinister. The clear gay characters in his films always try to corrupt, seduce and / or kill the innocent, sexually confused leaders. There is no shadow here to make things interesting. The protagonists are naive and rarely prove themselves strong, confident or confident in who they are. I will understand it as Jerry Falwell, Fred Phelps or Dr. Laura is starting to make live horror movies, but from a gay director, it just shows that he does not place any thought in these beefcake cheese festivals.
