... at least during his first half. Starting with the three friends in the fleet and concentrating on the marine action scenes, it would have been a much better and harder movie. The second half of the film is worthwhile, especially for the action sequences and close-ups of early 20th century ships, but it's like a dull toothache coming there. Also don't look at this movie just because Ginger Rogers is in it. She has an important role, but it is a small one. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with three New York City friends who are doing the tourism industry and also in a good competition for Sally (Ginger Rogers), a singing candy salesgirl along the avenue. The First World War breaks out, the three buddies seem completely indifferent to the battle, but they make it anyway in the navy. One of the three with the least activity as a citizen (Bill Boyd and Baltimore) winds the commander to the other two (Robert Armstrong as Dutch and James Gleason as Skeets). To make matters more complex, Sally fell in love with one of the three, but didn't have the chance to tell him before the three sails in the war. <br /> <br /> The movie is a bit more interesting. On board the ship, mainly because of the close shots we've got from the ship itself, and also because the chemistry among the three makers is credible. James Gleason at the age of 49, however, seems a bit long in the tooth to be swabby, especially if the sign at the enlistment office said you should be between 17 and 35. <br /> <br /> One real obvious mistake in the movie that made me believe that everything outside of the navies is slept with minimum care is the costume design, or I have to say the lack of it. In the scenes in New York just before WWI, we all dressed in the fashions of 1931 and everyone who ran the cars from 1931 - made no effort to bring this movie into a period. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you look at the few scenes with Ginger Rogers in them and the last 45 minutes in the suicide mission of the fleet, you've seen everything here worth seeing. The rest is padding.
