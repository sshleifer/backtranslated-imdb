The gun is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. The direction of the comedians is very poor, the dialogues sound like it was written by a 13-year-old teenager, the plot (which plots?) Is another "tension" in which it is very difficult to enter. Lastly, nothing in this movie is good. A great thumb for everyone involved and especially for the Montreal movie festival that hosted this movie in COMPETITION!
