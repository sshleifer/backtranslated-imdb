... and that's a damn shame! Please raise the sun and burn all copies of Dracula 3000. It must be the WORST vampire movie of the new millennium so far. I haven't seen REIGN IN DARKNESS yet, but they aren't much worse than this). Don't be deceived, be the movie's cool H.R. Gigeresque cover. It's so bad, it's almost hilarious. I can't describe all the emotions that this movie testifies to. I laughed my ass, I shouted on the screen, I put dead, clipped my head in disbelief. This film wrote 'cheap and cheese' about it. The best thing about this movie is the opening credits and the opening shots that contain more or less good CGI of two spacecraft. But when Casper Van Dien's voice comes over, you start to smell something dirty. And indeed, it all goes very fast. <br /> <br /> The crew of a mountain spaceship finds a deserted vessel, the Demeter, heading for Earth. They enter it, and seal their lot. Above all, this movie is a shameless, low-budget Alien rip-off, mixed with vampires. Erika Eleniak's character, Aurora, came to his disposal that she was a robot. Coolio goes badly over-the-top than the shell-smoke, blood sugar 187 (pffff, code of the hood as a name?!?!). Casper Van Dien's character Capt. From Helsing (hahaha!) And he looks like ... well, Casper Van Dien. Udo Kier as Capt. The former Demeter commander, Varna, is only shown on a screen and he looks really hard to read his lines of an auto cue (poor Udo, what are you going to do in this movie?). And then we have Langley Kirkwood as Orlock, which is one of the most pathetic and laughing Dracula's, to grace the silver screen. Just look at his outfit. Instead of a cool-looking futuristic black suit or something, he wears a cheap old-school Halloween suit with borders. You thought Richard Roxburgh was unconvincing as Dracula in VAN HELSING? Then wait until you see Langley's show! <br /> <br /> The set designers went overboard on this one. The inside of the Demeter looks like an intersection between an oil tanker and an old steel mill, which decorates them with dazzling lights and colors such as green, pink, blue and yellow. The prop master must have forgotten that this movie is taking place in the year 3000, because the characters use guns that look like today's .45 magnums and "Prof" uses a non-motorized, non-floating wheelchair. It must be pushed to move. <br /> <br /> Apart from one dried body, a few impalements and one blend are absolutely no gore. And the vampire fangs and contact lenses look fake like hell. Add to that the most lame, stupid and sudden end ever: Humvee and Aurora are the only survivors. Instead of a final (bloody) revelation with Orlock score, they lock themselves into the control room. Then Aurora explained that she had upgraded her program and joined drugs, she was a "Protest 3.2 PB", in other words: a pleasure bot. So she says, "Well, what are you waiting for?" Humvee answers "Don't tell me twice. Come on, girl", pick her up and ... "BOOOOOOM !!!" the ship explodes and rolls credits. No sex scene, no Erika flashin 'her boobies, no bloody climax, ... Another shot of Udo Kier reads a line on the monitor and it's over. <br /> <br /> So, this movie is a must see for every bad movie lover, but I have to warn them: sometimes it gets painful. And everybody claims that FROM HELSING, UNDERWORLD or even KING OF THE DAMNED is the worst vampire movie of the new millennium, is insane or just Dracula 3000 hasn't seen yet.
