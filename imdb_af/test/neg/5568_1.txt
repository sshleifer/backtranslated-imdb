Actually! Here comes the French theater at the bottom of the rock, and compared to that, the least appeals of American adolescent horror movies, such as the Friday thirteenth "Freddy" and fellow, are masterpieces of the seventh art. <br /> <br /> This is all the more disturbing as there were exciting original elements: the foret de Brocéliande and its legends, the druids and King Arthur, were all wonderful assets for a dream-like fantasy and horror movie. Filmed, as shown by a user appropriately in a fake forest near Paris, the movie is false horror, false Celtic history, false vestiges. You have to see the professor (Wilms who was a wonderful M.Le Quesnoy in "la vie est un langvluktrus rest" screaming for the "priceless waste" - which the production probably bought in a dime shop-fake characters, false excavations ... <br /> <br /> The boys who are disguised as druids are inadvertently very funny, so are the girls who seem to be experts in martial arts, and what can we say to the professors of the monster? would like to write a better script than this grotesque farce, thinking that people can spend money on such drift when artists are still waiting for a producer! <br /> <br /> Word for the wise: Maurice Leblanc has a wonderful written story about druid and old ceremonies made in his Arsene Lupine saga, called 'l'île aux trente cercueils', 30 years ago, carrying out this "Broceliande" garbage and trying to see it earlier.
