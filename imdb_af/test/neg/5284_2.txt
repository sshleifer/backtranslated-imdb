I paid $ 2.00 for this piece of crap, I want my money back. There are many different floors in this movie, including the acting, the lack of real abomination, the lack of nudity (apart from the initial nursing porn outfit) and the still breathtaking naked flash, there is none. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is perhaps the best thing, as it has some genuine sorta guitar riffs / tracks. <br /> <br /> There are your usual typical characters, the jock, the jocks woman, the nerdy man (who looks more like a jock), the newcomer cop / ranger (with the biggest gap in his teeth) , I wanted to save a few dollar coins in it, or go for a field goal) the mysterious fella and the sheer girl. <br /> <br /> The make-up was unfortunate with his views of dr chopper showing a clear "make-up" and natural skin, The cover art on the DVD is clearly photo shoot / improved to make the cover more tempting as Dr. Chopper looks like an old "plopper". The scrap women hanging around. Dr Chopper is not explained. Also the conviction of the rest of this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot twist was VERY predictable and the abundance of bad looking FAKE limbs was laughing, which they thought. fake blood and you have a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Dr chopper himself is the funniest character I've created for a while, but originally I believe the creator of this movie was tense for ideas and possibly I tried the rider and helicopter (bike ) and thought that "bingo" is sick. I've seen worse before, but it's just bad. Everything about it is bad ... the lack of tension ... the lack of real terror or character development ... the lack of a decent story ... the only thing good about this movie was when it was finished . This movie does not fall into the category so bad, it is good for me either / <br /> <br /> Overall 2/10, the director / writer / editor needs to know better.
