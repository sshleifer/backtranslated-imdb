You know, I was very surprised when I watched this movie. It was broadcast once during the day, when I was sick, and I had nothing else to do, I continued to watch. This is by far the WORST MOVIE EVER! But to my surprise I kept looking. I sat there saying it was terrible but didn't change the channel because I was so amused about how bad it was. Perhaps it was the man who looked like Big tom of survivor or the horrible mustaches and what these characters had made me look. However, the girls were not half bad, but if that is what you want, there is much better. Oh, and there is "NINJAS" and "PAJAMA BOYS!" <br /> <br /> So if you like ninja's bad play, hilarious (and terrible) dialogue, and two twins who are five feet tall and kill everything in their lives, then this movie is for you. It's so bad, it's good. But I only had to give it one out of ten. I couldn't have put a 10 up there with the Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br /> ENJOY !!!!!!!!! :)
