I'm sure many guys will love this movie. The only woman showing a "ball" is made to look, talk, and look like a man, the other 2 women are portrayed either as sexual objects, with one thing on their heads, sex / sexy, with sex as their only trait and skill (Iris) - or as freaked out pretty little princesses whose neurosis ignores any power and professional authority they had before the whole break (Doc). The only strength iris is ultimately the result of the advice of a great strong man. Besides my negative bowel reaction as a feminist, I have to give the camera's props. And Ethan Hawke is wonderful in the very first scene. Then, his performance lost steam. Blank entertainment for a brain that wants to make it easy. At least the film shoots the subject of the duality of good / bad in the criminal mind.
