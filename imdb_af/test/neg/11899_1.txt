After watching the movie, I have to say this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It takes my worst movie award away from Komodo, which is not easy. It's not a porn or a legal movie and it both gives them a bad name. The acting, camera work, plot, writing and sound are all terrible. My personal favorite part of the movie is the duck that the bartender asks if he has grapes. Why was a joke like this in the movie? Was the director thinking; "I need a humorous scene to balance the big play, so I'll use a lame ass cat that I read on a Laffy Taffy wrapper." Another delayed part is when Norman injects the invisibility drink on himself while trying to wipe it. Why did they even bother to give the movie an NC-17 rating and hope to get as much of an audience as possible? At least if it was X, it would be more sexual and therefore the viewers would focus away from the overall low quality. I pray for someone who worked on this pantyhose from a flick to respond.
