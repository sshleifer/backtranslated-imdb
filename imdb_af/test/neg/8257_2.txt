It is a pity that the script of this movie has more holes than you can shake a stick on (mixed metaphor intentionally), because Kinski and Coyote - both highly talented artists capable of being very subtle and nude - have wonderful chemistry together, and the ever-challenging Fairuza Balk did not hurt the mix either. Jeremy Piven would also have been nice if his character (and all the other supporting characters) were not written as a plot device. Regarding the main proceedings, the writers just didn't know how to create the appropriate guilty or innocent tensions for Kinski's character - instead, we led our confusion, contradiction, and the finals with the righteous late-hope viewers. Don't see a bang.
