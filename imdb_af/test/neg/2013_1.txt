Imagine the worst thing that can ever be conceived by human mind. Imagine something infinitely darker - I mean, worse than that. Then increase it with the amount of suction the Star Wars Holiday Special has. This movie is much worse than that. <br /> <br /> "Dracula 3000: Infinite Darkness", starring such famous and esteemed actors such as Coolio and Langley Kirkwood (as the movie's "Terrible antagonist" Count ORLOCK) is equivalent to eating you your own feces are shortened for your entire life, in about one hour and twenty minutes. To be honest, it is not possible to give an overview of this dramatic drama - with communist propaganda, promoting drug use, futuristic anachronism and possibly the worst special effects since the (original) "World War". <br /> <br /> The hammer and sickle of the Soviet Union can be proudly seen throughout the icy sets they dare to call a spaceship. Lenin can be seen on several posters through the film. And of course religion has been abolished for two centuries. So they do not know who this "God" is, even if they have no reservations about using his name in vain. But of course, in the Socialist Republic of space (chaired by interstellar president Baker), the killing of drugs is being legalized and very common. However, disability mobility is even worse than it is today (they do not even have a wheelchair drive). Racial tension is going on in a familiar / predictable way. We receive great comment on ethnic division by lines such as "is Dracula a brotha?", "Our brothas must stay together", and "as soon as you go black, you're not going back." Talking of the sign black characters, one is played by Coolio. Coolio may be the most annoying and ridiculous vampire ever. Oh wait, SECOND ludicrous vampire ever. The valued title goes to our friend COUNT ORLOCK, of PLANET TRANSYLVANIA, in the CARPATHIAN SYSTEM. These two make quite a few, between Coolio's efforts to make a paraplegic, strange attempt to make loud noises, sounds, a hair style of 1004 years, and GIGANIC regions of utterly worthless dialogue. and Count Orlock's twenty-dollar generic Halloween style vampire costume, explosive coffins, or confusing, unknown back story. <br /> <br /> One wonders if they not only gave Coolio the opportunity to "get as high as a kite in space" without gravity, allowing him to interact with the other "actors", and just went from there. <br /> <br /> Count Orlock's motivation is also a bit relevant, if he wants "infinite darkness", as the movie's subtitle would believe? * Coolio * to kill them all? Or does he want to give disabled people such an inhospitable future? It doesn't matter, because none of this movie's plots make sense. <br /> <br /> The highlight This movie has to end, more for the fact that the movie is over than with any earnings from the abrupt train wreck of a climax, calling them credits, instead of counting Count Orlock in a kind duel (the closest we get is a shot of Orlock breaking into the speed of our protagonist, who dies shortly afterwards), h et our heroes beat him by cutting off his arm in an ordinary. Orlock then collapses, screaming in pain at a completely mundane but understandable painful injury. This is by far the most fun you will get from this movie. If you see a vampire's cut face while crying in pain, you will sit on the edge of your chair - with laughter. Almost worth the four dollars. Of course, right away we are treated with one of the movie's worst single-liners, the mandatory sex-to-sex, and perhaps the most ABRUPT EXCELLENT for an END * EVER *. They ride in the sun, and their ship literally falls just before they even get close to the impact. I think they just missed the Wachowski brittle. for the worst final ever. <br /> <br /> I can only sleep at night because we know a successor is impossible. Safe in this fact, we can safely say that it is the WORST MOVIE ever created, and it will never be exceeded in low quality, lower budget and lower aesthetic talent.
