Not bad. Personal opinion? The people who made it? They knew it when they made it. To die in this movie, again my opinion, you had to meet three criteria ... # 1: You had to own your own Got style clothes and jewelry. Make wardrobe easier and cheaper. # 2: You had to remember and repeat your lines with excerpts. Note that I didn't say you should do it well. Save time and paperwork. # 3: You had to be willing to be naked. Give an R rating and therefore promote sales. Want to watch a better movie? Easy. Get a camera and some of your friends together and do it yourself. Trust me, you won't do worse. Like vampire movies, well, this one sucks. And a hint here for people like me who are looking for little peculiarities in movies ... Consider the link between vampires and crosses. Now look at the symbols and names on the tombstones in the cemetery. Portions of this thing are filmed. Ed Wood couldn't have planned the kind of accident to make himself better.
