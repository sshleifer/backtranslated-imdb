Plankton, or Abyss Beings, as I am positive, it is more commonly known as & filmed below as the title Creatures from the Abyss appears over a moving image and in the same font as the rest of the credits starting with five 20 something kids, Mike (Clay Rogers), his girlfriend Margaret (Sharon Twomey), sisters Julie (Ann Wolf) and Dorothy (Loren DePalm) and an annoying idiot named Bobby (Michael Bon) who decide to put everyone in a small dinghy fit into the sea, do not ask why as I do not know. Ag and the complete idiot Bobby left the petrol and never thought to tell anyone, so it comes as no surprise that they were stranded on the beach without any petrol for the car and to make matters worse, they became trapped in a thunderstorm & discovering a dead body floating in the water. Soon after they turn out to change their luck when they come across a hunt and potential safety, everyone is driving the hunt and starting to explore. First, they find a scientific laboratory with different fish samples and computer equipment, and below, they find fully furnished and luxurious cabins. They find a chemist (Deran Sarafian) who looks angry and can't speak. They eat fish from the fridge, generating Dorothy green vomit, beetles and snails. They learn that this fish is a living fossil's 1000s of years and is contaminated with poisonous waste dumped in the sea and that they fly, mutate, bite and are generally unpleasant to be around. I really can't be bothered to continue with this plot sketch, so I won't, here's what I think ... <br /> <br /> This Italian production was produced and directed by Massimiliano Cerchi under the pseudonym Al Passeri (I want to put it under a different name if I made a movie too bad) and I think Plankton is simply one of the worst movies ever. There are so many things wrong with this movie, it's hard to know where to start. First, Richard Baumann's script is crap, it doesn't make sense and is so slow and boring, it was torture for me to go through. Why would five people just sail for the middle of the ocean on a dinghy, barely big enough to fit them all in? What did they plan to do exactly? Why do we often get point-shots of these fish beings, but they seem to be completely invisible to the characters, as they never appear on the screen, although they are right next to a character, and how do these fish get around the boat because there is no water for them to swim? People's actions and responses to things are wrong, they break constantly, they make bizarre decisions that simply do not make sense in the situation in which they find themselves. And some of the dialogue is as terrible as I've heard. I can go all day long over all the plots and ridiculous gaits, but I'll run out of space if I do. The fish beings look terrible, a mix of dust puppets and a very bad stop motion animation at the end, the screens where they interact with the human casting also look terrible with some bad super imposition. I heard a lot of comments and said Plankton was nice, don't make me laugh! Don't forget there's no blood or fad in Plankton whatsoever. There are some slimy scenes when Bobby turns into a fish sample while having sex with Julie, but it's pretty short and he doesn't kill her, he's just splashing on her growing a few tentacles and a fish head come out of his mouth. Later, July's vagina starts to sharpen a bit of darkness, but that's it, we never really see what is happening to her or what is the mucus. Dorothy got a fish from her back, screen, and controlled her, but again we never see what's happening to her, while Margaret commits suicide, a very short shot of a plastic harpoon attached to her forehead. Easy is the roughest scene when Dorothy comes up with the green stuff that looks like beetles and snails in it. It's just one person who actually dies on the screen and for the most part, Plankton is pretty soft and as exciting as looking dry and I almost fell asleep. It's so boring. I can't see how anyone can keep this total crap, I just can't. The acting is terrible, the dubbing is terrible, the characters are terrible and I hated all of them. Tecnically, Plankton is also predictably crazy, with an estimated $ 250,000 budget I can only say is where the money went? The sets are monotonous and boring with one lab and a few huts, the special effect is bottom of the barrels, including the most fake search-exploding boat ever, cinematography is vague, the music sucks there is zero atmosphere or tension and if A whole Plankton, as it is for the sake of the name, is as low in the food chain as it would be possible. I hate Plankton, it's terrible in every aspect of it over a 86 minute period. Do yourself a favor and avoid this one at all costs, except if you are not a masochist or mess.
