No one in this movie has much to do. It's probably the longest 65 minutes I've ever spent watching a movie. The makeup effects on the pianist with macromeglia are pretty good, but this is the only thing it means to be a 1. The doctor's assistant goes through hysteria in seconds in extreme mood of passivity and then it seems to forget where she is in the next scene. The director combined many of the right ingredients for a crazy movie, but somehow the story of a story forgot to hang on to them. Unless you know someone in the throw or crew, I wouldn't recommend agreeing.
