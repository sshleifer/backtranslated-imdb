I accidentally thought it was the 70's art film about the bed people were eating, which was interesting. It's not. Interestingly, I mean, let alone a man-bed. <br /> <br /> I assume Stuart Gordon puts his name in the same spirit that Lloyd Kaufman puts "Troma" on just about anything with a video camera, in the interest of building a franchise library. Little more can be said about this opus, other than running time is less than 90 minutes. It is, of course, about a bed being driven by the spirit of a man, or something that once killed a woman with a wig and long false eyelashes. Along the way we get ** a five-minute opening credit series (is one for "Lawrence Of Arabia" even so long?) ** A killer with Marylin Manson contacts killing with the same technique as the troll in "Cat's Eye "** Demonstrations of a sexual practice Michael Hutchence may have a preview of what Emilio Estevez will soon see and act like ** soft core porn will even surrender Cinemax ** manbutt and a topless scene ** a wacky (or is it a "whack" -ee?) that consistently hits hilarious hammer and involves remaining strawberry pie (well, it looked so similar) ** and a rudimentary surprise that doesn't include the apros post. It is as if the scriptwriter even fell asleep on the "Deathbed" before the final draft was completed. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, it's not sexy, it's shot on hi-def video and doesn't look bad, but doesn't mean "It doesn't look good either, the acting isn't good enough to not be bad enough to be fun and so is everything else. No one would even have seen or heard it, unless it was on a slide with another movie, the modern "dual function." I didn't pay attention to parts of it, so I missed something. But for some reason I doubt it. Rating: PASS
