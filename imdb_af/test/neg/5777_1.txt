A group of teenagers go to an old town in the hope of finding gold nuggets. The one in the heartfelt scheme is that the old supernatural miner belonging to the gold does not want to share his treasure so easily that he sends the interlopers accordingly. <br /> <br /> Literally-clich√© sprout dialogue, horrible play, bad terrible 'southern dialect' and a lame unmemorable killer who, like Jeepers Creepers (without the aforementioned prominence of young boys of course) seem to combine stinking just about unwatchable. Even cult legend Karen Black in a small role cannot save this aberration. Eyecup: Elina Madison shows (poorly lit) T & A <br /> <br /> My Grade: D- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: TMCX
