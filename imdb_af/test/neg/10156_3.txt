Oh yes ... it's funny. would have been a sadistic comedy, many horror movies have common sense, but I think a delayed caveman would throw away his way around this situation. Don't really expect Hitchcock or anything close to this. It's a good one for friends, but I wouldn't recommend it for anything else. This movie does not have the real horror movie, the tension, the shock and the good characters. the killer did not become the unstoppable force I had expected from him, and he was the average malignant D student who could just shoot out stupid people. And the very funny thing is the terrible play and the lack of emotion of the so-called "victims". <br /> <br /> 3/10 just expects this one in daily funnies.
