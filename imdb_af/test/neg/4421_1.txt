This movie is a hodge-podge of several idiotic cliches. For example, boy-meets-spoiled-rich girl and gets her in love with him by harassing her in college (an overused background in recent Indian commercial films). A masculine chauvinistic glorification of sexual conquest. The climax is predictable (in advertising it is used in several other films). As with many other recent commercial Hindi movies, the movie flows with the relentless insertion of songs, which probably contributed to the success of the movie more than anything else.
