Aaran is one of those movies where you find the loopholes in the Indian Cinema. Here is a good example to show how excellent writers, directors and actors donated to the producers. Here is one of the most wonderful actors, Mohanlal, who deals in a movie about a real story in Kashmir. The seriousness of the movie is slaughtered with sub-standard comic scenes and songs. There is this character, Havaldar Jaykumar, who is actually the son of the film's producer. So he didn't cut a hair, despite his officer asking him to do so. This kid does not know what is acting and he is the "hero" of the movie. God helps Indian cinema with such producers. <br /> <br /> This movie is a pathetic show of what's happening in Kashmir. A sensible viewer can intuitively understand the limitations of such wonderful writers, actors and directors who want to share their life experiences. But the unfortunate part is that a movie about the highest ranks in Indian Militia seems to be a pathetic show that just makes the movie stupid. <br /> <br /> We need to expose such producers in the film industry and pave the way for good theater.
