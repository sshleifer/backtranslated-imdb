I discussed quite a bit about what rating to give this one, as it is my least favorite Herschell Gordon Lewis movie so far except The Gruesome Twosome, but it has the best play I've seen in a Lewis movie . But we all know it doesn't say much. Once the movie was done, I was happy because it felt like I was sitting through a 4-hour movie, though it was only 82 minutes long. I'm trying to see all HGL's movies and that's probably the only reason to see this one. <br /> <br /> The gore is good as usual, the one thing Herschell does. The acting is just as bad as usual with one exception. The exception is Frank Kress. Now, would I say he's a good actor? No way, but he's good compared to everyone. The story is boring and flat and doesn't go true and in the end I didn't mind what happened just as long as it ended. I know it's a cult classic, but I didn't enjoy it at all. I hope you will.
