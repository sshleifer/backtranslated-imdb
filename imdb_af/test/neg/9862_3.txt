I write this note as a chess player as well as a movie viewer. I watched the 1997 Kasparov Deep Blue games on the internet. I know something about the issues raised. Other chess players will come together and want to know if this movie is worth seeing / buying, and I talk to them a lot. However, I will try not to ignore those who are not in chess. <br /> <br /> This movie is about the 1997 match between Garry Kasparov and the personal computer "Deep Blue". The first picture you see in the movie, however, is not from Kasparov, or from the computer, but from "THE TURK". It is an "automatic" that was built in Europe in the 18th-19th century and played a resilience against all coming. I put the word "automatic" in quotes because, as everyone knows, it is a fake. There was a man inside. <br /> <br /> If you don't want to see the "TURK", you won't be able to stand the movie, because "THE TURK" has so much screen time as Kasparov, perhaps more, both in modern visuals than in b / w footage of an old movie. The revival of "THE TURK" every few seconds emphasizes Kasparov's charge that Deep Blue had human assistance - that it was, to some extent, a fake computer, which deceived IBM by a man inside what was behind the job. scenes to help win. Kasparov doesn't just believe it, but the filmmakers also believe it. And so it's not really that much of a movie about chess games or about chess development. It's a propaganda piece about a large corporation that is supposedly abusing a helpless grandmaster. Actually, it's very much like a negative campaign ad, as it sounds like ominous music and enticing camera work and ghostly sound effects and innuendos ("we never realized what was behind that door") and the ever-present "TURK". <br /> <br /> Now, most people in the chess community are pretty convinced that IBM has not cheated and that was Garry's paranoia at work. To start with the fact that one can help "Deep Blue" to beat Kasparov, it seems you need one that was better than "Deep Blue" and better than Kasparov. Since there was no such person, the whole idea was a little suspicious from the beginning. Furthermore, by the time this movie was made, there were computer programs that could run on your computer that could beat strong grandmothers. Today, much more than in 1997, we take it for granted that a computer can do things you can't expect. And we are less likely to accept it as a monumental human tragedy that a computer strikes a guy in chess. (And basically, Kasparov himself has two bad mistakes, including game 2 in a signed position.) <br /> <br /> As for the chess games, you actually see very few of them. There are a few comments from masters and commentators who briefly explain how they went, but you really don't see much of the strategy or tactics. Of course, as a chess player, I take it as a big flaw, but I also think non-players are being deceived. For example, imagine a baseball movie where you can't see any of the games - just a commentator who told you, "In Game Four, the White Sox beat the Astros with such and such a score." No one will make such a movie. But here it is said, for example, that Kasparov made a bad blunder in opening the decisive game 6, but we didn't show the position on the screen, or tell why it was a blunder or what he had to do instead or anything. We only see a few seconds of Kasparov holding his head in his hands, and then working more atmospheric sound effects and camera. <br /> <br /> (Since I've seen it on DVD, let me warn chess players about the DVD if Well, the jacket promises you that the Extras include the games "with analysis." Are these grandmaster analysis, what people like us. maybe interesting? NO! This is the automatic computer voice synthesizer analysis of a version of Chessmaster, which tells you when a piece is attacked and a pawn is isolated and you are in the Caro-Kann Defense, Main Line. Blahhhh.) <br /> <br /> Someone can come together and say, "Well, this movie is clear. It is meant to dramatize the game for the non-player, and therefore it is unfair to be impatient with it." not a good job either to reach out to the non-player - it skates over certain points that a real beginner really wants to explain. For example, it says Kasparov could have got an eternal check in the second match, but that doesn't explain what it is (or show how it would look on the board, which would have been interesting). It flickered back to the Kasparov Karpov matches, but did not explain why there were two of them or what they had organized. I didn't need myself, but I'm familiar with it. If you do not already have a chess experience, there are places where you are confused and this is just a lack of film. <br /> <br /> Eventually I can't recommend the movie, as "THE TURK" itself is not what it claims (a documentary), but more of a stage illusion.
