Good enough though. It's a horrible piece of television. The camera work is awful (I have to remind you of the crunchy grit so loud that you can't hear the actors) Lady Bertram has the most annoying voice in the whole world. Anna Massey is 'acting' in such an incredible way. and the lack of chemistry between fanny and edmund is over. Also, the bertram girls are not good enough, and the man Henry Crawford plays is terrible. To say the camera work is dodgy is an understatement. I watched this adaptation over Christmas, and under no circumstances do I think I could not endure it, and would certainly not justify the lost time. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of true to jane adjustments. So I couldn't make the movie adaptation or the recent pride and bias movie. but see any other modification instead, even emma is better than that.
