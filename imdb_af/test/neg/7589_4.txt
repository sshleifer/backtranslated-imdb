Butter Battle is an entertaining story about two fictional cities and their arms race. It is also a misleading allegory about the Cold War and arms races in general. Yes, it is a children's book, but like so many of Theodor Seuss Geisel's works, it touches people with his moral. <br /> <br /> And those morals are exactly what? Certainly, it is laudable to encourage us to focus more on what unites us than we divide. It's even a good thing to encourage international collaboration. But comparing the differences between the Warsaw Pact nations and the NATO West to a difference in butter application is just wrong. To explain the obvious, many Warsaw Pact nations enjoyed intervals of lack of butter and bread - they would have liked to eat it if available. At a less literal level, and whatever your political inclination, Soviet socialism towards Western (especially Anglo-American) democracy is not a mere demand of preference and habit. <br /> <br /> To make the point even clearer, nuclear weapons were not developed in a Cold War with the Soviet Union, but in a hot war with the troops. There is no doubt that Germany developed nuclear power during the war. Would the US have refused nuclear weapons research to trust their (less than inevitable) victory in the conventional war? Once the weapons were developed, they were used against the enemy we attacked at Pearl Harbor. What does a nation do at this point when the genius is out of the bottle? In addition, after 20-20, that is, there was no way to secure another half-mad dictator, will not gain sight of the development of nuclear weapons. The second Gulf War showed the incredible effort to identify and neutralize credible threats. <br /> <br /> In any case, the cartoon is not much more than simplistic propaganda, not arming the nuances of the ethical questions and trying to raise fear of weapon technology in children.
