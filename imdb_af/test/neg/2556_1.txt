Like the previous commentator on this film, I sometimes also experienced tears during this movie. Sometimes one wonders how a movie of such an awesome fear originates. From the first moment when our protagonist in his apartment in New York wakes up from a dream of subway trains crossing with galloping horses (which the Irish emigrant didn't have that one), it's clear we are in trouble. And it doesn't get much better. <br /> <br /> Back to the 1950s Ireland, we enter a world where everyone speaks without intonation, and exclusively on the subject of the Irish Civil War. School children go to school to learn about the Civil War. The drinkers in the bar split themselves according to their Civil War speeches. Memories are performed for those who died during the Civil War. The town is divided between those who believe we should remember and those who want to forget the Civil War. Every look and conversation drops with meaning that traces back to the Civil War. <br /> <br /> The blurb on the Broken Harvest video cover suggests that the film is a parable of the problems in modern Ireland. The only parallel that strikes me is that Dublin's conversation today is dominated by one topic: house prices. If the intention is to give some insight to Ireland's obsession with its past, it fails miserably. It is striking how few Irish films dealt with the Irish civil war and its legacy. But it will take a much more subtle and intelligence movie than to tell this about the lasting effects of such a traumatic event on the nation's psyche. <br /> <br /> For the American viewers who suggested the movie calls the atmosphere of the 1950s Ireland: it doesn't. 1950's Ireland was a horrible, poverty-stricken pit of sexual oppression and misery from which young people fled into their herds. However, there was more than one topic of conversation.
