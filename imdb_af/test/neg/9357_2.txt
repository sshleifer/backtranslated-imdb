I was very disappointed in this movie. Twice I was delayed to walk out because segments of the movie were so demoralizing and depressed. The movie has elements pertaining to all the seamic things in life (pornography, murder, suicide, fornication, hatred, gang warfare). The graphic nature of the violence in this film was particularly disturbing. <br /> <br /> And Richard Dutcher is doing a great deal of discourse on the LDS Church to portray missionary attitudes, dedication, spirituality and obedience as unfocused and unashamed. /> <br /> My biggest objection to this movie, however, is that it is exactly the opposite of a good movie. <br /> <br /> Dutcher's God's Army One was good. His Brigham City was pretty good. This movie, in terms of casting, acting and drama, was his best. But in terms of inspiring or uplifting it was as terrible as it could be. In fact, this movie has demoralized me so much that I'm sorry, I went. I lost interest in ever supporting Dutcher in an LDS-themed ticket-purchase movie.
