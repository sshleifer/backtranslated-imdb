"Changi" is an Australian comedy / drama that is in the Second World War 2 Japanese war prison camp of that name. The story cuts between past events and the present day, when the elderly veterans plan a reunion. It is a very published and controversial miniseries, here in Australia. The budget has overtaken ($ 6.5 million Aust Dollars); historians and veterans criticize it's authenticity; and critics have criticized the awkward mix of comedy and drama (shades of Pearl Harbor). Series writer John Doyle (half of the successful Roy & H.G. comedy team) tried to defend himself with comments on "the characters are composites of real people"; "the troops used comedy to handle the situation"; "it's just based on real events"; "one of our actors was actually there" etc. I have no problem with any of these points. Many beautiful fictional and factual dramas came from the Japanese P.O.W. camp experience: "King Rat", "Tenko", "Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence", "Bridge on the River Kwai", "Paradise Road", "Empire of the Sun", "Blood Eath" and "A Town Like Alice ". Black comedy is often used successfully in P.O.W dramas: "Life is Beautiful", "The Great Escape", "Seven Beauties", "Stalag 17", "The Colditz Story" and even "Hogan's Heroes". So why is "Changi" a monumental failure? - The play in "Changi" is uniformly excellent, the music and movies are good - this is the writing and direction it has dropped. Every scene was to give me waves of Deja Vu. When Anthony Hayes is made to stand in the burning sun, I thought, "Didn't I see Alec Guinness doing it in" Bridge on the River Kwai "? The sudden flashes of surrealistic song and dance Dennis Potter's. "Sing Detective" brought back, but without the finesse, these loans happened so often, it cut lazy writing by cutting and pasting, rather than paying tribute, and the ongoing relationship between the past and the current stories has also not enabled me to Flash forward and flash back can be a useful tool - here it left me with characters, where intensity is called in. The "Business" is exaggerated - every conversation apparently included "the bloody crows", and so I said, "I get the point, I know they are Aussies." Cultural stereotyping extended to the British and Japanese-SADIST young Japanese official, sincere British officer, wiser Japanese commander, fun Aussies etc. I have t thought I was looking at "Hogan's Heroes on the River Kwai". After 3 episodes I vote out.
