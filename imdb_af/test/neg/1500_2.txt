This one contains an interesting way to handle a camera, especially for a DTV movie. The version I saw was fullscreen <br /> <br /> - but it falls short on the scenario section. First you get <br /> <br /> about 20 minutes of talk, talk, talk in a will-be hip, post-trainspotting way, then it's a city member. And then <br /> <br /> comes the dishonest fraudulent end I've seen much worse than <br /> <br /> "April Fool's Day" - at least it made sense. So all in <br /> <br /> everyone, this is the old song and dance: interesting directors try <br /> <br /> but get better movie. Funny: usually it's the actors who are in desperate need of <br /> <br /> something better ?? Save it anyway, for your time
