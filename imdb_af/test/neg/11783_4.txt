Jim Varney's first real movie is a pleasure, but doesn't come to see Ernest P. Worrel anytime soon. I felt the wide variety of characters depicted by Varney was wonderful, but without saying the rest of the movie should be placed in a shoemaker or something. A little strange starts for a movie icon.
