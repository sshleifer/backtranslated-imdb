I wasn't old enough to really appreciate the original Mod Squad, but I knew everyone thought it was cool. I have some of the "books" written from the series in my screen-to-print collection, and they are pretty light, so I didn't expect much from the movie. That's a good thing, because this movie was bad on a long leash. <br /> <br /> I admire the risk of creating a movie that is as true as the 1960s. However, the film has been sophisticated for 30 years. At least I think so. I definitely expect a little more than an hour and a half from the original Mod Squad concept, with (now old) car hunts, (now considered poor) camera work, (tinny sounding) soundtrack and (poor) writing and everything on the big screen. In the 1960s we didn't care, because we had minimal expectations. An integrated police team of young people wearing something besides suits was enough. That was it, another exciting episode of "Ironsides" or "Password." <br /> <br /> Rate this episode against regular theater releases, the story was ... well, I'm not sure I should even say because I'm not sure there is one. Drugs are bad? Whatever. The writing was stupid. When the characters exchange dialogue and plot with lines like "I've heard, he says so on the phone," and "I think I have a plan," we're really in trouble. No wonder the play was terrible. No one knew how to say such idiotic lines. <br /> <br /> If I were Claire Danes, I would now go to my agent with a flame grinder. (Actually, I think everyone and watching the movie have the right to seek retribution.) <br /> <br /> And where was the Mod in that team? I realize these kids just came from the youth home, but nobody had a velvet pack? "Mod" just means young and integrated? What happened to white go-go boots? Perhaps the costume department was getting anxious, but everything they got was dirty and rough. <br /> <br /> Since the movie was completely true to the original series, and the special behavior of the actors, cameras, stuntmen, etc., we must appreciate it more. Unfortunately, I still don't enjoy it. If I wanted to see 60's crime drama, I would buy DVDs. No thank you.
