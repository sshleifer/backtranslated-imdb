"The Bone Snatcher" starts out extremely promising, with the introduction of a new and original kind of invisible evil, as well as the use of the sublime separate filming of the African desert. While pipelines are being checked in the desert, three miners are attacked and killed by a seemingly unworldly creature that consumes their flesh and leaves only a pile of half-eaten legs. The expedition crew sent to rescue them discovers that the monster is a superior mutated ant queen, and they will soon find themselves trapped in the subconscious desert. Director Jason Wulfsohn maintains a respected level of tension only until the nature of the sample is identified. Immediately afterwards, the movie quickly becomes an ordinary creature feature, with all the characters surviving one by one. The second half of "The Bone Snatcher" is unnecessarily boring; with the inevitable love story clich√©s, as well as a complete absence of gory murder set pieces. The characters are all insatiable stereotypes that act and say exactly what you predict a few minutes before. There is the newcomer who has to prove himself, the woman with brain capacity, apart from her warm looks, the petty-experienced man who saves himself in the end by self-sacrifice and ?? last but not least ?? who can forget the wise black man who refers to the monster with all kinds of voodoo names. Wulfsohn tries too hard to make his monster look like the outer spacewalk of "Alien" and "Predator". The mischief has infrared vision and crumbles when it is shot, yawn! The movie actually only benefits from its unique environment and the handful of nasty images of decomposed bodies. It can be a modest jewel, but it's less than mediocre. Avoid.
