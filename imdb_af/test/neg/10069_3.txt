<br /> <br /> JURASSIC PARK III * ___ Adventure <br /> <br /> Sam Nell (The Sheep), William Macy (Happy Texas, Fargo), TZ (a Leoni (Family Man) <br / > <br /> A better title would be: ESCAPE FROM THE ISLAND, WHICH MAKES DINOSAURS REAL, but then no one will have to watch the movie, in this sequel a rag-tag group goes to the island dinosaurs around the victim of a hang-gliding accident. <br /> <br /> Access HOLLYWOOD reports JP3 starts filming without a completed script, explaining why the movie seems little or no purpose other than to reveal state-of-the- Art special effects Sure, there are a few smart scenes and some moderate funny pieces, but no sensible plot line to tie them in. The dinosaur dolls and animation in JP3 are very good, excellent and more than ever. overall movie experience cannot hold a candle at the original JURASSIC PARK or even JP2. <br /> <br /> JP3 is a gracious short 90 minutes - the last 10 minutes is faithful she is ready. Even so, I regularly checked my watch. The audience I saw left the theater in silence. <br /> <br /> Better commitment: see the movie LEGALLY BLONDE. <br /> <br /> Dave
