I stopped and changed this movie for 48 minutes ... I don't know ... maybe it's because I'm not Swedish ... or French (the gun comment) ... or any of those OTHER sleeping places that the previous reviewers continued ... born and raised in NY. lived a quarter of a century near San Francisco. and now Holland. I love a good independent movie as much as the next movie enthusiast ... but it's not funny in a word. see? now it's funny ... that you think I've made a mistake. I said, "in a word" but then said, "It's not funny" ... no. no mistake. If it's your kind of humor, I'd say you didn't really have a life ... consider your appreciation for this movie a symptom ... and PLEASE, don't ever write another review ... I have a tendency to believe them when they are unanimous. even though there were only 3 reviews for mine ... I thought I could actually save someone else's boredom ... the expectation of the laugh that is never material ... I laughed once or twice, though. .. when I started the movie ... and when I stopped it. It must be 10 lines.
