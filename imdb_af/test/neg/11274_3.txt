Thanks, I got ahead fast. I think it's a movie about a man coming up and falling. Whatever: it's a stupid clich√©. It makes no difference. There is this guy, Javier Bardem, who builds buildings or something. It does not matter. He's beautiful, this is Javier Bardem. Who cares? I think there's a car wreck, but I watched it fast ahead, so ... who cares? Car wrecks and handsome heroes struggling with them smell like a melodrama to me. Javier loves someone, but he marries Maria de Madeiros. She is beautiful, poetically beautiful, with a heart-shaped face. Then, Javier has an oral interface with Maribel Verdu, who washes her vulva before, for some reason. You'll think Maribel Verdu, with her handwashing vulva will be sexy. No she's not. It's a boring story about a lot of people who don't interest me. Javier, Maribel, and Maria have a trio: How boring. This film is irritating. I think it could be a small THEME of (some) Spanish movies: The rise and predictable fall of a little guy who succeeds. Let me just make it clear: it is a high-class melodrama or maybe soap opera. It's not worth your time, except for a laugh.
