I usually spend so much time writing my reviews when I watch the movie, but with Today You Die, I feel it would be a criminal waste of my time. <br /> <br /> So here's a five There was a time in the mid-80s when a single glance of Steven Seagal was enough to crack your ribs. A full on shoe can knock you off your feet. If he really got you, he would snap you like a twig. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, though he can still do considerable damage, he no longer seems to be the part. He went to the seed and didn't know when to call. He walked as if he had dumped in his pants, but somehow he still managed constipation, and he lay weight. His trademark long ponytail went, but his hair still looks stupid. How this man is working in the film industry is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Today you are the usual Seagal blend of bottling battles, car accidents, gunfights and fireworks. Seagal mumbles its way through the dull writing and delivers its lines with no enthusiasm or credibility. In this two-day action movie, he plays Harlan Banks a straight thief who is determined to take part in a $ 20 million robbery. He is caught, goes to jail, escapes, and seeks revenge. Yawn. <br /> <br /> There are some good car hunts and rifle battles that divide the boring stuff (many of which are there), but reading other comments on IMDb revealed that it was better borrowed from others . movies. Seagal is also doubled in this one. <br /> <br /> Seagal turns into one of the terrifying representations of his career? And it says something, given the common 'acting' in some of its recent efforts. Most hilarious is his embarrassment to Ebonics (African American Street Snake). "Me, man, for me?" No, actually, Steven, you sound like an ass! With a ridiculous writing and plot lines going nowhere, this movie is a waste of time, money and effort. And the last moment, when Harlan Banks stores a children's home from closure, is enough to slap your pieces. <br /> <br /> Damn, I just watched the clock. I enjoyed so much this steaming heap of liquor, I walked over five minutes. It's time to post this comment and look at something decent.
