If movies where virtual reality characters come to life and they are all male tough guys or female eye candy sound good to you, then maybe this movie might not be a total waste of movie. Needless to say, the overwhelming majority of people will find it an absolute drill, with little acting talent, and even less of a script. Yes, Athena Massey is nice to look at, but this is the only positive thing I can say about this disaster.
