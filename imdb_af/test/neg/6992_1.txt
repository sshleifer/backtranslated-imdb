Everyone likes to see a very bad movie somewhere. You watch it, take a good laugh and forget it in the next half hour. But it's not one of those. This is the worst thing that will appear before your eyes for a while. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see someone take responsibility for Dante - he's really the stupid villain you can think of: a voice-talking guy in a trouser suit like a 50's Dracula. How can anyone come to this man? And the hero ... "The Dragon" or whatever ... My grain bag has better acting skills than he (maybe all). It's incredible. But the worst is the fighting tones where you think there might be something in it. They are so lame, it's out of any kind of description. There is no shame, I just can't believe how this movie was allowed by any studio. But I'm just excited that it was. To look at it is a smashing pleasure. See it only if you are in a movie search for pain, and then this one is a sure winner.
