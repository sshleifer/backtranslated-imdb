There is the excitement of low-budget film noir. And there's the frustration of winding, uninteresting movies made at the cheapest. This one falls into the second category. <br /> <br /> The Spot is the name of a nightclub. The film is about a policeman whose father was killed by gangs. He headed out to find them. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was the bad print. Maybe it's me. But I felt I had seen it a hundred times, most of those times better than it was. <br /> <br /> It also has promise: The police are fascinated by a woman who plays records she introduces about juke. boxes. They then meet. Now, though well done before I was born, I saw that kind of juke box. And it is incredibly fascinating: When I was a teenager, I wandered into a bar that had such a device. I always liked juke boxes, bars or dinner. But this one was different. You talked to it and a sultry sounding female voice spoke to you! It is addressed here, but falls into the general, uninteresting stew. <br /> <br /> The movie has one thing: it plays in a small role the very young Anne Jeffreys. What a beauty she was, and no doubt yet!
