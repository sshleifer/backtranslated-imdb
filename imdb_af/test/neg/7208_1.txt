Dark Harvest 3: Scarecrow: 1 out of 10: In Einstein's theory of relativity is the time of the one who considers time. (Or so I heard) In other words, this movie feels much longer than an hour and changes. Even on fast forward (and you'll reach that fast forward button). It beats somewhere for eternity. <br /> <br /> If you are familiar with Lionsgate's own version of Project Greenlight (that's where they put a home movie but a fancy cover on it and sneak it into the horror section of your local Wal-Mart) , you won't be surprised at the complete and total lack of entertainment value. <br /> <br /> Reading the line (I refuse to mention it) is uniformly horrible. It is a collection of deadly fathers and strippers who pretend to be in a movie between cans of Schlitz. The camera work is drunk dad shooting holiday movie quality and while the special effects are okay the frightening effect is the chest enhancement scars in the nude scene. <br /> <br /> The story is horrible, sets are ghost Halloween supplemented by ADHD middle school students and again the line reading (remember it's no longer acting than sinking at the bottom of a pool) as mere words. Avoid.
