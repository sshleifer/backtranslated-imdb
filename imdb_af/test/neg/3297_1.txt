I'm one of those gluttons for punishment when it comes to sitcoms these days. I will always investigate it once. My observation is that most of them are not very funny, even those on big networks that get high ratings, I just don't get whoever finds it While a few made me smile, none of them made me laugh out loud . I usually change the channel after a few minutes. Now on the FOX network they are visiting new programs like changing your lingerie, for some reason they think they can make a good sitcom, wrong dead wrong. They've beaten this dead horse so much, it's just about to hire someone who can find them writing a patchwork of bad dialogue and just cutting it out. Let's look briefly at the last piece of rubbish Fox had cut out. called the "War at Home" <br /> <br /> I watched it about 5 minutes and it was generous. In this particular episode, the daughter is doing her parents. I'm now an adult. The father gets tired, tells her, "Well, go ahead and do what you want. If you screw it up, it's your problem." after which she replies: "Well, I think you're crazy, but at least I didn't get AIDS" (cue the laugh track, no way a lively audience can be, unless they're paid to applaud such garbage). I found the crack on how not to have AIDS in such a bad taste. Well, hi, I don't have to look at this crap anymore. Take a tip FOX, stop wasting your time with sitcoms.OK Well, you have the Simpsons, but it also gets really old and tired.
