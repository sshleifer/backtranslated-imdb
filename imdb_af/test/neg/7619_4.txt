I saw the movie for the first time on NBC Friday 11-29-02. It was a pretty good movie, but I don't think it will be the kind of Muppet movie that Jim Henson would make. I mean, first, Pepe, with the word "sexy", now and then, and Pepe says, "will it suck?" And I absolutely know that Jim Henson will not allow Kermit to shout: "I DON'T WANT ANY BORN!" thirteen times a minute. This movie is just not like a classic Muppet movie. Certainly, I can understand Nicky Holiday stealing the baseball diamond from "The Great Muppet Caper", but a businesswoman cheating the Muppets in a contract for their theater to turn it into a smoker's nightclub. If Jim Henson was here today, he would hate this movie!
