Me, me, me: Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance had to be desperate because they borrowed their talents from this turkey. A horrible hidden story about Satanism in contemporary Greece, Land of the Minotaur (aka The Devil's Men) is a misconception imaginable on more or less all levels. It has precious few horror stories (always a slight mistake for a horror movie, don't you think?); poor performances; countless scenes where characters deviate or break the opportunity to stay in the safety of a group; and some annoying editing techniques that don't add anything to the proceedings. I was excited early on the prospect of Cushing and Pleasance working together 17 years after The Flesh and The Fiends - but this movie is not worth getting excited about; It is a great retrenchment and rather an embarrassment to its very worthy lead. <br /> <br /> In a remote region of Greece, outsiders such as tourists and archaeologists are missing, and local priest Father Roche (Donald Pleasance) suspects that there is something sinister. He writes to his friend, New York's private eye, Milo Kaye (Costas Skouras), and asks him to fly to Greece to help him find the bottom of the riddle. Meanwhile, three visitors - Beth (Vanna Reville), Ian (Nikos Verlekis) and Tom (Robert Behling), all of whom are personal friends of Father Roche - are missing while drinking near Greek ruins. Milo eventually arrives in Greece, but is initially doubtful about Father Roche's beliefs that the missing people have been chased for satanic sacrifices. Milo and Father Roche are also joined by Laurie (Luan Peters), the girl of missing man Tom. Together they discover the activities of a Mino-devil-worshiping cult led by the creepy Carpathian exile Baron Corofax (Peter Cushing). These crazy cultists were sacrificing their victims on a statue of the minotaur. In addition, they apparently cannot be murdered in the normal way, so Father Roche must use a variety of religious artefacts in his struggle against them. <br /> <br /> Land of the Minotaur must have been much better than it actually is. The plot is so stupid and unlikely to have all the features of a pleasant gay cult / camp favorite. But handling is just awful. Director Costas Carayiannis has no idea how to link the story together, so the whole thing progresses as it is set up on a daily basis. He also has no idea how to make convincing actions out of his role, so they can embarrass themselves in terrible hammy (Pleasance, Cushing) or terribly amateurish (Skouras, Peters) achievements. What's worse is that the narrative doesn't make sense. Why would Father Roche seek help from a private eye that is completely flippant about his beliefs? How does Roche know that the sacrifices occur only during a full moon? How can the Minotaur statue speak? Why was one of the victims sacrificed to stab Father Roche during a vision, to be stabbed a few scenes later before getting the chance to do so? And, most of all, why do Father Roche Milo carry halfway around the world to help him with everything he needs, a crucifix and holy water to have the bad guys? These questions - and more - will appear in your mind during the Minotaur Land. But unfortunately there are no answers. Frustrating, stupid and disappointing!
