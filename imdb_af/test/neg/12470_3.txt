The start of the movie was confusing and the rest was predictable. It was just one of those movies I got in my netflix instant store and I thought it would be interesting to see Brad Renfro and the Byou Phillips team again since Bully. Unfortunately, "interesting" never happened in this movie. Swain plays an invisible girl at a private school whose best friend is rich and does anything she wants (Phillips). But Swain loves one of the boys (Renfro) of the "in crowd" and eventually starts hanging with them. And of course, like all the other movies, things are good (or you assume the movie never suggests that things are good) and then it doesn't get so good to hang with the rich ones. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that there are absolutely no peaks and valleys. It's just a dead lifeless movie that looks at you, you feel can have done anything better. Some scenes (those with Renfro's parents) do not even make sense to be in the movie, because the director and author did not follow it at all. <br /> <br /> All the interesting things that CAN have played are just completely ignored and it's almost like watching before their star episode (Mischa Barton and Rachel Bison from the OC). <br /> <br /> The only bright light in this movie, and why it doesn't get a ONE rating from me, is Phillips. They needed more scenes with her. Renfro looks as if he has conveyed some of his character from Bully. And for the sake of the name, the title is BS, change the name.
