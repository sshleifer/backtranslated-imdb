It's hard to imagine anyone who makes a Tom Cruise movie looks good; Hard indeed, but this one makes him look good. Very good. Actually, it makes him look like Sir John Gielgud with a bravura performance with a very good performance day. <br /> <br /> The acting of the whole ensemble struggled to rise above the risible and failed. The mistake was, in part, let's justify that the plot closely resembles the original HG Wells original, as well as the carcasses of human victims in the film to their living predecessors: both are blood related and excess remnants of more attractive predecessors. But to describe a plot, like this to be a little sacred, is to say of the Colander: "My kitchen utensils have a remarkable amount of holes" unless it is your holes; In this case, this movie will be attributed to you. <br /> <br /> The blame in the other part was that it was demotivated, working, well-known DVD actors, it was assumed that it was their exhibit coming on the $ 5 DVD shelf. And too expensive about it. <br /> <br /> So should you see it? Why yes, of course, you should. You are a miserable sinner and deserve punishment.
