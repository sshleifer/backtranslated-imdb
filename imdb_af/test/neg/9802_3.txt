Since I finished the book, Mrs. Dalloway 'by Virginia Woolf, I was excited to see that it was on one of the movie channels last weekend. However, what I have experienced is a movie that was boring, incomprehensible and non-sensual. One cannot completely blame the film. It did best with the material it had, but if the source material is Virginia Woolf, and almost completely in a stream-conscience style written with long periods of internalization and little real dialogue, one would definitely think that no movie should be made, just because a movie can be made from it. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave, who plays the title character, does not deserve any debt for this movie's failure, nor for the other actors. It is simply a film that could not be made understandable from the story that Woolfe wrote and should not even be attempted. Don't watch the movie, read the book. <br /> <br /> - Clear
