This movie is definitely a strange thing to say the least. The basic plot is 3 old business partners inviting 2 strangers in their home to return a lost 10 dollar wallet in it. The two who arrive are in love. The 3 older businessmen die and come back as a ghost to help the two younger guests. Oh yes, it can make sense, but then we have 3 old guys who seem to have bread living together. Bad strange here ... Harry Carey plays his part off the base, you can't tell if he's a good guy or really a prick. I mean, really, make sure I can handle it. Then there's Richard Carlson who plays James Houston from Texas. Hmmmmm, He sounds much more like a southern gentleman from Kentucky than a Texas person. This one is not even close. Then we take the 3 ghosts that will give a better chance to help the New Orleans Saints play a game than to really help ... In fact, they are really no help and why they are even in the film is beyond the scope of knowledge. Silly movie in which a throwing character is completely out of character. You can avoid this one.
