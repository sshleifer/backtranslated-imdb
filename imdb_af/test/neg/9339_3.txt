... if only Disney stayed out of it. Look, I think this movie has a potential. Well, do the main character's situation, at least. Take out the entire Jordanian Cahill thing, and you have the start of a decent movie! Of course you also lose more than half of the movie, but, oh well. Not so much of a loss. <br /> <br /> So, here it is: you take a typical preppy, suburban teenage girl (Danielle Panabaker, who is actually a decent actress) whose best friends scream a lot, mostly about a "pop sensation" (I assume it is a direct quote from the movie; film like this almost always involves that particular phrase), called Jordan Cahill. Except, of course, TPSTG wants more from life. Give Brenda Song's character, a sophisticated individual who only needs TPSTG (honestly, I don't care what the character's real name is, I like the acronym better). The two new friends will see Jordan Cahill (one to move, one to enjoy the butterfly), and they come out with his cellphone. Hyinks follow, and everything seems in the end. <br /> <br /> If only Disney, or any major movie studio for the case, didn't have such a low opinion of 8 to 14 year olds. Or maybe if 8 to 14 year olds expected a little more from the movies. It is sugar-coated shit like this that makes me more than a little unsure, to be more disgusting (a small movie called 'High School Musical' comes to mind ...)
