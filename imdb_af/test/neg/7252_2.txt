I don't think the number of blunders militarily and strategically contained in this turkey can be beaten. Everything in this mess is done on the cheap and made soldiers really look stupid. Examples: Initially, the 2-star general is given strategic advice by a lieutenant and undoubtedly accepts it. The map used by the Lt shows enemy positions, but they apparently only have a single narrow valley to use to advance on the battalion (although the map showed a dozen more). The guard takes position from which they are clearly seen and exposed by the enemy. They shoot our heroes from high ground, but this outstanding firepower makes little difference. A single enemy tank progresses near the end (initially referred to as an armored section), continued through a lonely infantry point (!) Which moves extremely slowly without exploring the area and then dispensing the tank when he It is considered to continue - a most bizarre scene. The soldiers take cover in a cave. Around them are ice and deep snow, but in the cave a garden of the entrance is a deep pool through which they all repeatedly blow - their feet will only last a few minutes before they freeze. Later, the survivors pathetically slow and chest high through a river to return to their unit. Remember it is deep winter and the ground is frozen. Yes right! <br /> <br /> And it goes on. They shout commands at higher levels, they lay mines near their own position and warn each other not to trample on them (!) Initially, credit is given to some soldiers who received the Congress Medal. Was he blind or did Director Fuller just ignore him? Truly the most indifferent soldiers I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> One of them tears with a bayonet in its own wounded leg and eventually pulls a piece of scrapnel without a hint or groan. He announces that it should qualify him as a surgeon. Now it was funny.
