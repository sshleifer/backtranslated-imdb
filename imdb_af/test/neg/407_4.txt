In a way, you must respect Arachnia. It is clearly meant as a tribute to the great fiction films of the fifties, and while the special effects look terrible; at least the movie does not have CGI. But on the other hand; you can't respect the movie too much, because it's a rubbish bin. The acting is terrible, the special effects (as mentioned) are impossible to take seriously, and once you've seen a giant spider blown up; you saw them all, so it gets boring very quickly. The plot follows a lot of people who, unfortunately, are enough to be a meteorite in a plane crash. They go to the only house in the area; what just happens as a house where a man has a big spider that he used as a circus attraction. Coincidentally at the same time, the meteorite has caused more giant spiders from underground. All the characters in this movie are poor caricatures; None of them has something that even looks like a third dimension and they will soon begin to tolerate you. You have to feel for director Brett Piper because he clearly didn't have much to work with. but it does not make Arachnia worth a damn, and overall there are better giant movies than this, and therefore Arachnia does not get the seal of approval from me.
