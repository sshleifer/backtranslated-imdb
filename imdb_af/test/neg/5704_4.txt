So much for JUDGE AND JURY, which leads to his nonsense title. What's good there? The lighting is terribly misty! Another horror movie you ask? Well, this is quite clear. David Keith is pretty good at disguising fools, chefs and other shenanigans while being the killer who escaped the deadly. But although, despite some new twists, it's pretty stupid. Unapix recently released some ridiculous productions, and this one means just as much. We, the jury, find this movie guilty of its indecent exposure to many of us sitting and believing it is a total waste of time!
