Usually I start my reviews with an explanation of how and why I watch the movie I reviewed. I simply cannot explain this. The next day I had to be awake early for work, so the last thing I wanted to do was watch a movie I didn't know about. But something was sticking to my comfortable futon while watching this Heather Graham vehicle. Oh, that's right. Mystery. <br /> <br /> Graham plays Joline, a Bohemian note affair that looks more obsessed with her marriage vows than the man she married (played by Luke Wilson). When her hubby decides to look for better things (work, women and scripts, presumably), Joline begins a fanatical quest to find her husband and free him from his "spiritual wheelchair". It looks like I'm fixing it, but unfortunately I'm not. In fact, this is little more than an acting exercise for Graham, as she gives this Phoebe-from-Friends role a workout. Oh, and Goran "ER" Visnjic is also there for some reason. <br /> <br /> The TV schedules put it as a comedy, but I didn't sleep anywhere. It struck me that it was a personal trip for Lisa Krueger (the director and writer), in the same form as "Girl, Interrupted", but even that laughed more than that. Graham's character is simply too self-centered for the audience to care and I feel sorry for the man who was picked with hands because he fought bravely for his freedom from his clear spiritual wife. Very little of this movie made sense because characters simply appeared in the story as if they were standing around waiting for Graham to stand up like the extras in "The Truman Show". In fact, the only positive note I could make about my writings was "Heather Graham - nice baps". And it wasn't because I was too tired to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is very difficult to think of someone to recommend this movie. Graham purists (a lot of small movie-goers, think you'll agree) will have to commit to watching this froth and possibly hippie students who gather American Indian dreamfinders will take something of it. I was surprised that the average rating (on time of writing) was 5.0 - which would make this movie as good as "Die Another Day" and "Gothika" in my book and it simply isn't right. "Committed" is a strange strange mess of a movie that doesn't entertain or relieve. It's complicated, useless and just to sow for my taste and probably yours too. Don't even look at it.
