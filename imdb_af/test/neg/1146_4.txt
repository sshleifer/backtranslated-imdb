I just watched DVD on National Lampoon's Christmas Holiday 2, hoping to see something at least close to the original, big holiday comedy, Christmas Vacation. I saw nothing of the kind. You can tell from the beginning that this movie is just not going to measure. It's too bad, it has a title that links it to the original Christmas holiday. It's really so sad. The film cannot stand on its own merit. I think too many people will see this movie based on the title and it doesn't come close to the level of comedy. Unlike the title, there is very little to link the movie to the original 'Christmas holiday' and even less of a connection with Christmas. The comedy is very simplistic and the plot is poor. Children may find humor here, but most adults will get a visit here and there. This movie is a flop. Don't waste your time with it.
