As a bit of a Michael Dudikoff fan, I sat down to watch one of his good old-fashioned action. I'm still waiting. <br /> <br /> The movie is based on a group of American commandos who are trying to get rid of a bunch of Syrian terrorists who have taken over a nuclear reactor. Maddie Reese (Felicity Waterman) was an English member of the commando unit and of course she became romantically involved with Tom Dickson (Dudikoff). I have to ask since when the British had female SAS members - as far as I know they are ever needed, they are from other sources. Even if they did, I can reasonably make sure they aren't as wet as Maddie Reese. I would also think that Tom Dickson would be a little more responsible in his position - or did I lose the plot? I know there is always a romantic corner in these movies as it helps provide the feeling of godliness, but it must be constant, especially when more important things are taken into account - such as nuclear warfare! <br /> <br /> Signing the treaty on the US aircraft carrier irritated me. The "holy pen" worn by one of the so-called TV news staff - there was no security check to find out who or what was going on board one of these ships, especially with the caliber of people there. If you think about it, I think there will be no story. <br /> <br /> I can go on, but when it comes to an "inner body defusion" to safely remove a bullet, I got up on the action drama movie piece and enjoy it for the comedy what it actually was. <br /> <br /> By the way, would a news reporter really "Downtown Damascus" ??
