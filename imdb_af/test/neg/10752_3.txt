One reviewer says of those who may not like this movie, that "it will only be appreciated by filmmakers who are tired of film as a distraction". I feel it is unfair to those of us who find it boring. <br /> <br /> I didn't feel tired or disillusioned with movie or movie makers, but found this boring and confident. But then it's true, I'm not too big in deep sense. I feel it may have good meaning for those who know what you know. <br /> <br /> It's very slow and it takes a lot of time to try to make its individual points, using images, to do so. But in such days it seems that a movie like this is the kind of thing you will see in one of those dark and terrifying huts in modern art galleries, rather than on the screen of a popular cinema setting.
