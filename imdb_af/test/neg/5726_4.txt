It is, in my opinion, a very poor film that Arnold Schwarzenegger is advertising as the co-star, advertising just more copies. It is clear that the film of the similar theme of Conan's movies does not seem to be so attractive and does not end up entertaining at all. <br /> <br /> Bridgette Neilsen stars as Sonja, a beautiful woman who has been given amazingly. strength by a ghostly figure after her village was ransacked, her family murdered and raped by Queen Gedran's soldiers (Sandahl Bergman). Gedran is a tyrant queen who wants control of the barbaric world and seeks a talisman protected by Sonja's sister to do so. After discovering what has happened, Sonja sets revenge and at the same time saves the world from the wrath of Gedran. Kalidor (Schwarzenegger), the master of the talisman, suggests her to protect whether or not she wants him there. <br /> <br /> The first big problem with this movie is the start. The events that up to the point where Sonja receives her powers could easily have made a good ten to fifteen minute nice movie. But the beginning is rushing in what looks like a quick one minute `Previously on? . segment of a television program. If they actually made the event part of the story and later cut it out of the stuffing, they might be able to detach this movie, but unfortunately they didn't. (I wonder why director Richard Fleischer first directed two movies since Reds. Sonja). <br /> <br /> This movie also contains some of the most annoying characters in history such as Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.) who is a stupid character and just adds a plethora of camp to the movie, which sometimes works In this case, failure fails. He was, of course, written in the movie for some comic relief, but with the overall absurdity of the film, it was still another expensive mistake for 'Red Sonja'. <br /> <br /> For all its mistakes, there were good fighting scenes that included both Neilsen and Arnie, which is remarkable, but it is nowhere enough to save this turkey. The acting is about as good as it is for movies of this quality and even Arnie didn't bother too much about his performance. I don't recommend this movie at all; for me it's a waste of an hour and a half. My review for? Red Sonja? ?? 10/03
