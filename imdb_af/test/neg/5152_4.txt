The story of the bridal show is an entertaining and enjoyable one, and it is for the filmmaker's credit that he portrays the rural Minnesota with the same respect that is usually reserved for coastal residents. However, it is strange to find an independent movie, the brainchild of a single person, who is so unambitious and clich√©-driven as a broken Hollywood pot boiler. <br /> <br /> The portrait of rural people is meant to be loving, I think, but these characters don't hold me right. I had quite a few meals in small places, but never heard a debate about the merits of different nineteenth-century English novelists. One can imagine that writers / directors Semane no longer have experience with rural culture than the Coen brothers, and significantly less satirical paints.
