It was deduced from a previous poster that the army would not be subordinate to police in a disaster as depicted in the film. In fact, the military role would be to provide assistance to civilian authorities when asked. Civilian authorities will retain priority. In practice, the army will need 48 hours or so to mobilize itself, as there is not much army in London, especially with current overseas commitments. Even then, they would be dependent on the calling in the TA. <br /> <br /> As far as COBRA is concerned, we were given the impression that it was a full government emergency department, in its own right - even to a Met Police Police Cobra department. In fact, COBRA stands for the Cabinet Office Briefing Room "A". It's just the room where the PM or DPM meet their advisers to discuss the current emergency!
