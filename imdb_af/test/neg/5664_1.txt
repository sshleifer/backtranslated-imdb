I watched the Halloween episode ... oh my god, I wanted to die. The acting was just terrible. The lines were voiced with absolutely no conviction. It's also a bad idea for a show, I mean who will look like a web show like this in real life? Miranda Cosgrove was great in a supporting role in Drake and Josh, but didn't have the character power to anchor her own performance. I'm even more upset because her departure is an important reason why Drake and Josh ended. She was approached with her own show ... she jumped ship on Drake and Josh. They then decided that they might do a thing with Drake and Josh who go to college and thereby declare the loss of Meagan a character, but Drake has already had thoughts to move on to bigger and better things and he thought if Miranda did it why couldn't it. The best part of the show was the theme song ... a catchy, good voice in an ant of mediocrity. Of course, Bell drags Miranda's voice for the whole thing and writes the song ...
