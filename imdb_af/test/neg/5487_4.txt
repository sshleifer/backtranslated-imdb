I love all the Lilo and Stitch movies. The TV series was not so good, but I set aside my views of the series when I watched this movie. And I have to say ... It was bad. <br /> <br /> One thing I found disappointing was the animation. Yes, you heard it. The animation. I found that the quality of the movie has deteriorated greatly since the first movie. The quality was just as high as the TV series, "something I didn't expect at all. If you are looking for hippo, don't expect much here. The animation also did not portray any serious moods. Even in the so-called sad scenes I felt nothing for the character, another downgrade of the first movie. <br /> <br /> The following was the absolutely terrible voice work. I found it very, very unconvincing, and wondered why Disney, with all its wealth and glory, could not afford real talent voting. The voice players' skill was just as annoying as the one in the series. I have patience one in the series because, hey, who wouldn't be tired if it was made to vote for so many episodes? Heck, I don't even know how many episodes there are (Theoretically, there are 624, but I just can't believe it). However, I thought the voice worker would improve in the movie, and I was put in the face by the truth. What they could do in the series was already their best. <br /> <br /> Next was the terrible writing. It was barely past redemption, and the writers were just trying too hard. They were trying to make jokes, but I just found them annoying. Maybe it wasn't the voice acting, but the cheese dialogue that destroyed the sound section. (On the front, the soundtrack was not bad, and the mood was very good.) <br /> <br /> Fourth was the problem with the storyline. I predicted everything, and the storyline was what made the characters so suddenly inexplicable and unlikely. You've got the strangers new positions and responsibilities in space. After the initial hype, they realized they didn't really like it and missed their old life. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the evil villain is out of jail after a very action-packed action scene and breaks into Jumbaa's lab to steal his experiment. The experiment was then cloned in 100 others and the hamster wants to conquer the Earth. When the main characters find out, they try to stop the evil hamster, but are confronted with a cute final action against the experiment and have a very terrible excuse to try and cool the series. The characters then give up their new privileges and return to Earth to resume their lives. Seriously, how many other movies have they used? The story was very short and formulaic, so don't expect too much from it. <br /> <br /> So Disney has failed in sound, graphics and storyline. The only charm of the series was the original characters, and how they kept the 'feel' of the characters, but even that couldn't save the movie. I did it, I really did, but I give it a score of 4/10. Another Disney failure.
