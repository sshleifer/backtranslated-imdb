Proof, as ever proved, had left Hammer their vampires firmly in the Victorian age. Vampirism is after all about the repressed sexuality, so the concept is irrelevant in 1972 London, with its thirty-something teaspoon pretending that it is rickety teens. <br /> <br /> Remember, by this time, Hammer is doing badly. The audience got tired of the drama horror of the 1950s and 60s, so the studio tried everything to bring them back, including enough nudity (LUST FOR A VAMPIRE, et al.) And updating their characters - which is smooth not worked as Hammer. was almost in the grave just two years later. Shame ... <br /> <br /> But I still love the classic Hammer era from 1957-1965.
