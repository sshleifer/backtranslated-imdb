The start of this movie doubted that it would be little more than a typical B-sci-fi movie. But as I progressed, I started to get interested and I saw the whole thing. The premise is interesting, original, and has the ability to make a classic. Unfortunately, instead, it ended a mediocre movie. This is done by the common factors that make a potentially good movie into a bad movie (bad acting, low budget, etc.). I'm interested to see how it will be re-created with good actors and a great Hollywood budget.
