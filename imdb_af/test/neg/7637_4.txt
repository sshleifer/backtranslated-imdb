It could have been a breakout for Valeria Golino, but the film decided to shift its attention to another area. The film is about a woman named Grazia (Golino) who is married to a fisherman and the mother of three. She is a free spirit and susceptible to outbursts, so the rest of the town and her family decide that she should be sent to Milan and see a doctor. The story takes place on Lampedusa Island outside Sicily and it shows everyday life with the teens in gangbands and just trying to find something on the sun-baked stone. Grazia's eldest son, Pasquale (Francesco Casisa), welcomes her and always tries to protect her during her depression. The daughter Marinella (Veronica D'Agostino) is a thriving young girl caught with a local policeman and the youngest son Filippo (Filippo Pucillo) is very sassy and mocks the policeman's accent. After learning that she should be sent to Milan, Grazia walks away and Pasquale helps her hide in a cave while everyone is looking for her. This movie could really have made more of the impact if it could focus on Grazia. We see some outbursts and irrational behavior on their part, but they are no follow-up to these scenes. Nothing comes of it. The movie looks good and is beautifully photographed, so the director gives Emanuele Crialian credit for it, but the story needs to focus on something bigger. The film does a great job of showing us how life is on this island and what happens in the lives of the three children as they grow up. They are a speculation that Golino's character gives an indication of a mermaid like an animal and therefore has problems with the land on the ground. I also felt that the island itself was expecting its residents to act in a certain way and if you did not, you could be subject to the harsh reality of its rules. All the speculations, but I think the attention of the movies could have remained with the character of Grazia. After hiding in the cave, she really has nothing to do. In a sense, the character becomes stagnant. I wish Golino had more to do because I always loved her and when she's on the screen, you can't take her eyes off her. She is a bundle of anger, passion and raw energy! What a shameful Crials did not write a more complete role for her to act. When the movie ends, your left feeling remains empty of an incomplete story.
