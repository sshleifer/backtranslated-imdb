Wow - this movie was really bad! You talk about the formal, typical movie plot? Watching this movie was like hitting my head repeatedly against a brick wall. The transitions still remain cool, but fail. The plot ends at the end, where we find out who the bad man is, is unexpected, but does not make much sense to his monologue. Even then ... The amount of gore in this movie doesn't help either. Need all the images? My last complaint is about the likelihood of bits of the movie. Will the PD really be a lone officer in an unoccupied warehouse, subway tunnel or where a body gets, when the location of the perimeter is unknown? And why is the spectacle at the end just as sudden? It's as if the author tried to fit into every Hollywood click. Don't waste your time, see this piece ... something.
