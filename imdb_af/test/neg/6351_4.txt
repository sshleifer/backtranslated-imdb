I rented this movie from my local library and thought it might be good if I liked this kind of movie and consider who it was, but boy was I wrong. The acting bump, the fighting scenes were just as bad and they got some famous people in it, but didn't throw anyone with acting ability to play the head? I noticed that some people gave it 10. Why would you ever consider giving this pile of horses a 10. You might say it's worth a 10 for the sheer comedy, but if you vote for a movie that's not supposed to be a comedy you can't give a 10 for comedy. You should evaluate it on what it actually would be and not on something the director did not intend to do. Perhaps some of you voted 10 because you thought it would be funny to have this crappy movie, have a high rating, so people go out and rent or buy because you think it's nice to mislead people. You play time and money with people you don't have right. If the movie is sucked, it gives a bad score if it is good, it gives a good score, but does not lie. I gave this movie a 4 and am glad I could check it for free from my library, because this movie sucked and is really not worth paying a penny.
