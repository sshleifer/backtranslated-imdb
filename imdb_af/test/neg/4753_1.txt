This entry has no spoiler. It doesn't have to. The movie is as predictable as the sunrise. The element in the first Alien movies was the tension that something could happen. It was so in the first two Predator movies, but less common. Requiem completely removed the element of tension and replaced it with blood and gore. You know people are going to die (well, it's an AvsP movie), but you know who is going to die and when they die, and where are they going to die before it happens. The directors have to take a lesson from Hitchcock, who said, "Suspense is not a time bomb that goes under a table. Suspens are a bomb that doesn't go under the table." What is the point of going to a movie when you know exactly what is going to happen and when? If you really want to watch this movie, wait until it comes to the video and then rent it, but I'll never buy it.
