JP3 lacks the Spielberg touch. It's an all-out attack on the senses with "in your face" dinosaurs. To watch this movie was a bit like a rollercoaster ride from hell. <br /> <br /> The writing is lame; at the same time it asks and leaves too many questions unanswered. Nor do we really appreciate the people in the movie for everyone. For example, William H. Macy is too big a talent to compete with dino thugs for our attention. And Laura Dern was especially sympathetic in JP1; In this movie she is hardly a blip on the radar screen. <br /> <br /> The whole JP3 experience was t o o m u c h. Too much noise, too many surprises, too many characters who die, too much predictable, free violence. <br /> <br /> Word of the Wise: Vote yourself off this island. <br /> <br /> (I rated it 3 for special effects, and I subtracted the other 7 points because I have absolutely no originality.)
