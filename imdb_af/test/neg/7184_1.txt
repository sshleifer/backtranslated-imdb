I'm still not sure what the hell is in this movie. I think the boy was scared to get blind and started to imagine all kinds of strange things. it does not explain why he wanted to kill his new baby brother, or the relentless boredom found in this movie. While watching this movie you wish you were blind, you didn't need this experiment in futility. skip this steaming pole and choose anything else at the video store ..... anything else.
