Is it just me or the fact that the evil racetrack is Japanese and that their arrogant star racer is German, looks a bit at the top? Maybe that's how it is on the international race track, but if everyone represented America, it's like Cody and his mechanic Chris (Peter Berg, who still learns how to act), then I'll root for another country . Formula movies can be good, but the characters must be nice and no one meets the criteria in this movie. To put it briefly - a very bad movie.
