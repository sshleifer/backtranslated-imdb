This series does not offer the British view of the Revolutionary War, as much as an anti-American view. The underlying theme of the series is that a quiet majority enjoyed colonists British rule; that the founding members were manipulative schemers whose sole purpose was to pull Britain into a violent civil war; that the American supporters of the revolution and the militia were racist and violent, plunged into battle. Clearly, the intention of the writer, Richard Holmes, for the viewer is to extrapolate these features, in a straight line, from the American population from 1775 to the present. <br /> <br /> For example, in the episode "The Shot Heard Around The World" Holmes makes a dark print of the Boston massacre, claiming that the skin of Crispus Attucks, a black man and the first man murdered in the revolution deliberately erased. Holmes claims that Attucks as a black man would be a bad propaganda for the revolutionary cause. Holmes never reveals how he knows it. And there's more. Holmes goes to some extent to work in a single, undisputed, atrocity: the desecration of the body of a British soldier. He compared the American militia to the Viet Cong and the mujahade - without mentioning any differences in the goals of these groups. The list goes on. <br /> <br /> The series was supposedly made in response to Mel Gibson's "The Patriot". It says a lot when an academic needs to respond to any topic on Mel Gibson. Instead of suggesting the British view, it seems that Holmes really wanted a sensational, anti-American view, and in the process he made the Roger Corman of historians - rigorous second-class joke.
