I was very upset about the movie and watched the promotions and watched it. FDFS The movie was terrible to say the least <br /> <br /> The first scene is good and until they go to London, things are funny but slow down the pace and they are nothing funny about it <br /> < The Manoj Joshi subplot is funny in places but is undesirable and adds to the boredom. <br /> <br /> The drug part is funny, especially the Govinda monologue <br /> <br /> The movie continues and goes aimlessly, just as a small child wrote it. <br /> <br /> The interval turns into a story, but then I lose hope <br /> <br /> The second half starts well, but the way things are handled makes a mockery. The whole Arbaaz-Jackie corner is half baked. How do people get it? <br /> <br /> The climax is quite funny but stupid <br /> <br /> Priyadarshan is not in its elements, from this movie he started doing craps and his films got bad and bad. Music is good, SIGNAL, TERE BIN stand out and OFF to Camera work. i is good <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar has white in his stubble and looks old, but he does well, although this role he has done many times, thanks to his natural comedy acting stuff looks portable. Govinda looks out of shape, bad and his act except monologue is boring too surprisingly from Govinda seems too much pressure on him to come back and Priyan fails to use him Paresh is okay in parts, but overall just repeat action Manoj Joshi is funny places Sharat Saxena is okay Shakti Kapoor is great Jackie Shroff looks overweight and enters his sleep. Arbaaz Khan is bad. Lara Dutta screams to glory, but fails to act.
