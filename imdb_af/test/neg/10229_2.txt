Also titled -> The Magic Castle -> This one is a stretch. Why Try? Why create another rockbar and then add another story line, which has almost nothing to do with the play or swarm. Only a rockbart friend, the stolen book prohibited art and the original characters (not voting). Stripped to its bare it is a continuation of a wire. Next thing you know, a few birds will have memorized the "forbidden art" and Swan Princess 4: the magical bird will be born. Fortunately, all the chapters are presumably closed and will begin, but the bad end of the trilogy will come to an end.
