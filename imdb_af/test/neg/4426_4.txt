Another Lo Wei production to completely wipe out the talents of a young Jackie Chan is a strange mix of wuxia, melodrama, supernatural action and ordinary old-school kung fu struggle that is rather dull, despite the fact that it contains several surreal WTF moments. and very nice dialogue. <br /> <br /> In an effort to protect his pregnant girlfriend Chin Chin from the Killer Cattle, a gang of relentless murderers who are going to attack his home, Cao Lei (Jackie Chan) presents be, who drives her away, and thus frees her from danger. <br /> <br /> During the attack, Cao's family is killed, but left relatively unscathed by the gang, whose leader, a scarred woman, apparently had the hots for him. Cao then goes looking for Chin Chin, whose security he entrusted to his good friend, Chu Chuk. <br /> <br /> During his quest to find his true love, Cao befriended a courier company whose precious cargo was stolen by the leader of the evil 'Bloody Rain' clan. Eventually, after being injured in a fight against members of the nasty clan (a fun scene with many foolish weapons), then returning to health through the scar Killer Bee (showing her love by burning his face!) Cao finally learns that he is a bad judge of character: his friend, Chu Chuk, is none other than the power-hungry head of the Bloody Rain clan planning to marry himself with Chin Chin. <br /> <br /> Cue fought the stretched climate, repeatedly kicking Cao in the face before finally killing his betrayed ex-pal with a scarf. <br /> <br /> Even Chan's fans will find this one chore. to go through with only the final battle to show some of the star's amazing acrobatic skills. Fans of general Asian weirdness can dig the haunting appearance of the Killer Cattle at the beginning of the movie (with one character inexplicably claiming his cut hand!), Or the moment when three men blow through a window to attack our hero but, for most, this movie will have very limited appeal.
