This peculiar and observable film is the story of a deceptive dentist who begins to fight his or her mission or crusade to fight tooth decay in the back and legs of Patagonia. From New Jersey, the main character, Fergus, sees his crusade in New Jersey as a mission of great importance and approaches it with all the enthusiasm, vitality, discipline and attention to detail one would expect from a trained dentist. Regarding his dedication, as she unraveled great plans and gradually fell into pieces, because he was disastered in the Patagonian Outback on the back of a personal motorcycle or his mobile dental unit. We never meet his wife, or the rich philanthropist who sponsors the failed mission, but we get a solid performance from Lewis. Fans of his work will not be disappointed with his highly credible performance as the fraudulent dentist loved by the innocent but sexy 18-year-old female lead next door to the * ahem * ride. <br /> <br /> This movie isn't for everyone and I can understand why it wasn't printed by the pack. It is a low budget, sometimes charming, always disarmed, generously amusing and immediately forgettable film that sticks out with low expectations and almost passes.
