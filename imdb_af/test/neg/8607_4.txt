Sex Life of the Potato Men are talking about the sex life of various men involved in delivering potatoes. So there are no surprises. That's exactly what you expect from the title: it's a strange comedy that includes sex and potato men. Sometimes the movie works. It is an edgy, sometimes awkward comedy about the lives of some unimportant and rather average men who have problems with different kinds of women. Where the movie clearly does not work and why it has failed at the box, the strange, uncomfortable parts may be just a shadow that is too special and uncomfortable. Instead of laughing at the scene of a man suspended from a cellar ceiling masturbating over another man while making love for his wife, I think most of us are just a little angry and wondering what Andy Humphries thinks. Well, maybe we are shown what he thought too clearly.
