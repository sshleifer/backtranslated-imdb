Instead of Paul Newman and Steve McQueen with their motor vehicles, it has the appearance of a jollies project for Robert Redford, as he kicks on the hill and downhill in the Alpine sunshine. <br /> <br /> The story is as light as snow powder with Redford's small town boy, David Chappellet (what is the name of the main name?) which, with a view to the prize of Olympic glory, comes to the nose of, in no specific order, his coach, father and teammates. Women are a mere silk show in their own world, as evidenced by a fairly unpleasant reception scene with an old friend in his home town and then his selfish petulants are striving for a free thinking, independent woman, a bold, independent woman who Camilla is played. Sparv. The ski sequences are good with some good stunt work that includes numerous bumps and scratches on the slopes, but their effectiveness is reduced by our later launch with the best TV coverage of ski events to this day. I am also not convinced that the Winter Olympics have the same mass identification with the general public as the summer games, so when Redford finally wins his gold medal in the final, I couldn't really be excited in any way no. <br /> <br /> Of the actors, Redford, best profile ahead, doesn't have to do much, and indeed, while Gene Hackman does better with equally slim material. Ms Sparv does well as the main female interest, which Redford deals with, because he undoubtedly treated every other woman in his chauvinistic way. <br /> <br /> In truth, however, there is a lack of dramatic tension that should not fully compensate for the action sequences and you don't care about a vie for any of the leading characters. One of those films where the actors probably enjoyed making it more than the viewers watched it.
