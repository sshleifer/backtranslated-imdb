The authors do not know anything about Russian prisons, the film is absolutely cameled, has nothing to do with reality. They also don't mean that the aliens in Russia have a special prison, so the strangers never live with Russian criminals. The uniforms in this movie seem to have been stolen somewhere in Latin America. Prisoners in Russia are also out of jail. Every death in Russian prison is a subject of investigation so that the prisoners just kill each other if there are many important reasons. Playing soccer is also prohibited in prisons, contact between prisoners is very limited, no chance to fight blood, etc. Etc. So this movie has nothing to do with reality.
