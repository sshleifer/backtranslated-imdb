A man (Goffredo Unger) is found in the sea under the wreckage of his destroyed boat, just outside the Florida coast. A helicopter just blows him to reveal both his legs, under his knees. Dr Stella Dickens (Valentine Monnier) and her partner dr. Bob Hogan (Lawrence Morgant) is some kind of marine biologist and does research on the Dolphins in the ocean. Hogan hears a strange loud noise. In, he and Stella intrigue Peter (Micheal Sopkiw) and his assistant Sandra (Iris Peynado) to create a device to track and locate the source, or something, because it is not made very clear. Meanwhile, a scientist named Florinda (Cinzia De Ponti and Cinthia Stewart) who works at a competitive organization called 'West Ocean International' is brutally murdered when she threatens to expose someone within the organization. More people are being attacked and Sheriff Gordon (Gianni Garko and John Garko) are on the case. Peter, Stella, Hogan and Sandra all stretched out. Soon they find evidence that there may be something strange and very unfriendly under the surface. Together with rival, prof. Donald West (William Berger), Sheriff Gordon and the US Army have destroyed the monster, but there are other sinister powers at work as someone does not want the genetically modified creatures to be exposed in any way. food! Directed by Lamberto Bava as John Old Jr. It is far from the classic Italian horror and explosive films of the 70's and early 80's. The script by Gianfranco Clerici, Herve Piccini and Dardando Sacchetti is very slow and will make most people sleep well before the 90-year-old minute run time. The monster is hardly used, large parts of this film consist of footage of boats and helicopters. Large pieces of the first half focus on the not so mysterious "who's behind" part of the story. There's not really a lot to talk about, a man with both his legs bitten and someone with one arm over there. The special effects on the sample itself are generally poor and are shown in very fast flashes, disappointing. Throwing virtual nobody's does not make it easier to go through. There really isn't much to recommend this movie, so I won't. Don't bother, you can do much better.
