I bought this movie on DVD, despite the "old" review and it was idiotic ... The review was quite accurate and I have never seen a worse "erotic" movie in my long life! Even if it was partly filmed and had an interesting environment, plus a nice cover ... But my own extreme erotic (c) movies are more than 100 times more erotic (just in the soft nice aspect), probably less than 100 times this movie budget! The story has no logical connection with the first film or the famous book. Or any new (exciting) element of slave training, except some very strange and sad developments. Then the main male character - Klaus Kinski didn't look a bit like the second master of "O" he was trying to play ... And not even lovely Arielle Dombasle, looked nice in any scene!
