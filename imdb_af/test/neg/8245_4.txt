I break my brain, but I can't think of another movie like The Valley of the Gwangi. A western with dinosaurs? What could be more natural? You have to wonder why John Ford and / or John Wayne never tried it! <br /> <br /> The plot ?? While looking for a mythical miniature horse for her circus, TJ Breckenridge (Gila Golan), Tuck Kirby (James Francis) and the rest of the cast / characters come in a strange, lost valley. There they find not only the miniature horse, but also other, more frightening creatures. Dinosaurs rule this place. Wouldn't TJ's circus appeal now? a cast T-Rex? <br /> <br /> It's not that I find the Gwangi Valley a bad movie, but I just didn't enjoy it that much, like many others who commented on the movie. There are a few parts that I find almost inaccessible. For the first half of the movie there is not much to look at. I wasn't necessarily bored, but I wanted something to happen. Plodding would be an adjective I would use. To download it, the movie contains a very beloved love story. It felt as if the authors had decided that the male and female leaders had to come together. But the Gwangi Valley is not a complete waste. There are moments I really enjoyed. Who doesn't get a kick out of the cowboys who are riding horseback riding a T-Rex. You don't see things like that every day. Ray Harryhausen's creatures are impressive. There are some fantastic photos of Harryhausen's miniature that interacted with people and horses. It may not be the best of its work, but its effects are very nice. Yet, at least in my mind, these good moments are not enough to overcome the negative. As much as I hate to do so, I must rate the Gwangi Valley a 4/10.
