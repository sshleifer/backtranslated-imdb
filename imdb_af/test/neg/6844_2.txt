A kiosk with a bad history of past horrific murders reopened. Of course, the bloody murders start again. Written, directed, shot, recorded and edited with a terrible lack of flair and finesse by the exceptionally talented Rick Sloane (who later violated the celluloid even more with the absolutely horrific "Hobgoblins"), this horrible ham-fisted attempt at slasher spoof rots from anything rotten in every imaginable way: the ominous strenuous pacing, the painfully static, grain kinematics (there is a stinking residue of lethal master shots everywhere), an annoying drone and excess hum'n'shiver synthesizer , the flat (not) direction, a boring talky and indifferent writing, the so-called sophomoric sense of lowbrow humor, the bloodless murder pieces, a spicy, unashamed murderer (he's just an old old man in a decorated makeup -up), the uniformly offensive and unattractive characters, an unsatisfactorily sudden end and lifeless performances of a remarkable uninspiring throw, assure everyone that it is so fun and rewarding to watch eat scruffy red eel that is soaked by acid vinegar. This litter has the necessary rough and messy power needed to be junk. Instead, it's just a mere, plowing and winding stiff that never gets fire or even remotely entertaining in such a shy-it-smoky kind of way. Only a smithy of nudity and the glorious presence of the ever-reliable Mary Woronov as a snarky, sardonic secretary, offers some relief from the overall curiosity of this bad loser.
