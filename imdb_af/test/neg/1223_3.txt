I have looked at all three segments and am so disappointed in the story. Zahn spends as much time as Duvall, he does nothing else in the show. And Tommy Lee Jones will never be as weak as a young man, but not weak. We never see how or why they go back to Lonesome Dove ... which is a dirty hole in the original ... why would they ever leave Austin where their hero is ... to do nothing during the whole movie? I rooted at the end of the movie for Blue Duck and he was completely disgusted. There is no warning about how many segments there are ... it just ends. This mini-series could have been "someone" ... tragic. It seemed to be managed by the Parrot and the Hunt
