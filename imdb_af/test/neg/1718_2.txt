Tycus is one of the worst movies to watch live video movies ever seen. <br /> <br /> I'm not very excited about this product not appearing at the theater. With the visual effects (The start is terrible) Bad actors (I don't understand why in this movie the great Dennis Hopper does not appear) and Bad Screen Without Sense. My alternative: Armaggedon or Twister. SENTENCE FOR TYCUS: Don't watch this movie.
