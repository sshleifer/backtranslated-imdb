One would think with the incredible background of World War II, Stalingrad, that the writers would come with a script. Nope. There is NO story here! It's like pornography, interrupted vignette of violence by pathetic, rotten and meaningless dialogue. <br /> <br /> A lot of Germans march to shoot and to be shot. Slower there are fewer Germans to march, shoot and shoot. Then there are no Germans to march, shoot and shoot. <br /> <br /> Very bad. <br /> <br /> Chilcoot
