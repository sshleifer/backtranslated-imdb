I was very disappointed with this one. After reading the wonderful Oscar Wilde story, I hoped for at least a little of the magic to translate on the screen. Well, no one was there. This version plays like a condensed, obscured Reader's Digest movie. Not only did it feel rushed, it was cheap and unnecessarily re-written. Big characters and plot points are either changed or completely removed. I appreciate the trouble of bringing a novel to the screen, especially about what a limited (TV) budget could be very good, but there is no excuse to miss such a big story. I strongly recommend reading Wilde's story of the depravity that exists among even the most beautiful exteriors. But I can't advise anyone to rent this travesty.
