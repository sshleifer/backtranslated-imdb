iCarly is all wrong with the world. All the main characters, but Carly's brother and Freddy, are morally bankrupt. <br /> <br /> Sam damages others. She breaks a children's safe and he is forced to pay a $ 100 to fix it. All she says is "Hard luck" and continues to beat Freddy's cellphone. She caused at least $ 300 damage and she is more focused on getting food. What the hell? The only time she's every debt is when she made Freddy on the show. And that's just because Carly is pushing the shit out of her. <br /> <br /> Carly is the "I'm perfect, everything I do is nice." type of girl. Everything she does is for her own benefit and she is often shown to have repented alone. What's worse, she encourages Sam's crap. Sam ruining some of Freddy's clothes? She was laughing. Sam ruining a child's grades? She took it off. <br /> <br /> Don't start my humor first. The laugh track is played at any moment. <br /> <br /> Sam: He's not that hot. CARLY: Yeah, he's Sam. Yes, you're right. * INSANE LIGHTING * <br /> <br /> Shows that humor exists to humiliate others and say unclear words and occasionally talk about trivial issues with similar sentences. <br /> <br /> Not to mention all the "super cool special techno effects", it can be done in Windows Movie Maker.
