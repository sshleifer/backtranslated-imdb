I tried to keep this presentation, I really did, but I can't find a reason why anyone would like it. The story lines are weak, the acting is poor and incredible. Each selected member appears randomly picked up from the street. And it seems to me that the whole show is just a vehicle for Jamie Lynn Spears to move to movies. Every episode shows Zoey as the girl that every girl wants to be her best friend and that every boy wants to date. She is always perfect and no one is in real life. How can people relate to a character who is just a Barbie doll? Jamie Lynn's play is fair, but she's not a strong enough actress to star in a series. All the show's fans are just young girls who don't know better. I'm sorry if you think my comments are too loud, but if you can find a meaningful and deep moment in this series that is not quickly directed to a beach party, please accept my views and find something worthwhile to watch.
