I was willing to love "Where's Poppa", it had the Normal Lear sitcom character features nexus, which when I was growing up, felt like extended members of my raisenette-size broken nuclear family. How nice it would be to see without censorship Barnard Hughes, Vincent Gardenia, Ron Liebman, Rob Reiner and a pre-SNL Garret Morris. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "Where's Poppa" is dragging. The plot involves the efforts of a lawyer (George Segal) to get rid of his excessive Jewish mother living in his huge New York apartment. Along the way, we are exposed to ridiculous characters and situations: a comic group of muggers who repeatedly claim the main character's brother, the rape of a policeman who includes a gorilla cost and a subsequent gay love. Ruth Gorden pulls off Segal's pants and bites his ass while serving her dinner. Why doesn't it work? Part of the explanation is the sense of punishment caused by the cramped, dark interiors and ancient set-decorations. I absolutely enjoy New York cinematography during this era, but I felt this movie as if I was blowing through the police newspaper in a dark bus terminal. <br /> <br /> The main reason, however, is the slow pace. Modern MTV style quick cuts have changed what moviegoers feel is a comfortable editing pace, but even if taken into account, camera shots are kept for an excessive length of time. Plot developments are also very slow. There is one situation in which it works: a strange love song that George Segal sings, Trish Van Devere, soft, very close to her face, and for a very long time. It reminded me of the cherished extended shots in the British version of "The Office", where you are begging yourself to cut the camera, and at the same time you can't stop looking. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, most of the movie is more "hurry" than "can't look away". What makes me wonder if it is possible to have a black comedy that is also a farce. The dilemma is that the gravitas of the subject in a black comedy tend to weigh the brightness of the farce. Movies like Robert Altman's "M * A * S * H" and Kubrick's "Dr Strangelove" prove that this can be achieved. They do this not only by speed, but also by entertaining subplots, something that "Where's Poppa" neglects. <br /> <br /> Although the film contains several stereotypically funny characters, almost everyone is directly involved in the central drama of how to go with the retired mother. The screens with Garret Morris and the Central Park muggers are as close as the viewer gets to a mental break. The muggers were almost Shakespeare, following the tradition of comic ne'er-d0 wells. If the rest of "Where's Poppa" clung a little closer to the traditional tradition, it would have been a better movie. Edgier is not always better. It is as if all these talented actors and director Carl Reiner were short of the 70's creative grind. <br /> <br /> Random Notes: After Ron Liebman's clothes are dressed, the muggers call Cornel Wilde's "The Naked Prey" (1966), a great action movie that was a stylistic forerunner until 1968's "Planet of the Apes ". <br /> <br /> If politics is wrong as he was, it is alarming to learn about the death of an action hero as formidable as Charleton Heston. Linda Harrison, who played "Nova" Taylor's dumbbell, said James Fransicus, in the sequel, was cute and small compared to Heston.
