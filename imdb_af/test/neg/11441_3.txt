Not as bad as 1992's "Nails" (where Hopper plays an "unstable" policeman), but pretty bad. How can a movie with such a good role go wrong? This film manages to find a way. The story was pretty stupid and Hopper's direction seemed like he had never aimed for it. All the long shots in the beginning were tricky. Many meaningless scenes with lots of meaningless dialogue.
