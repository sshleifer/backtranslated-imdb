This movie was bad, but it was so bad that it could reach cult status in the distant future. A type of film noir meets Plan 9 from outer space. The story was, there wasn't really a story. There is a place reserved for the Ed Woods and Russ Meyers of the world and this film proves it. "So bad it might be," is the best way to describe it. I seriously doubt whether this movie will be picked up by any legal distribution company. It is therefore unlikely that a wide release will occur. <br /> <br /> I'll add that I'll see more of actor Ron Carey. He had the best of what he had. The rest of the acting, if I could mention it, was quite forgetful. I got worse from big studios with big budgets.
