I don't understand why anyone would allow a sub-pari director to float on such a muscle. This movie has been made at least twice, which was better than this ("Lord Comes Mr. Jordan" - 1941, and "Heaven Can Wait" - 1978). The only rescue factor for skating skaters might have been some good ice skating through a professional skater, but it just doesn't happen. The closest thing the audience sees for good skating is when Tara Lipinski's character spins for a moment. Others like Nancy Kerrigan and Elvis Stojko are hidden in the background and do not at all. Not many real emotions have been shown, and there is really no reason to agree to this naturally made-for-TV movie. My advice: rent the original.
