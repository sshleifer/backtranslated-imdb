Linda Lovelace was the victim of a sadistic woman hooker, Chuck Traynor. I don't understand how to have sex with a dog (which is also animal abuse) can be found to be entertaining or funny. Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner committed to making these films. I know some people will criticize this comment, but I feel strongly that these types of movies burn the hatred and further misoginistic feelings towards women. This society continues to portray women as sexual objects to people. We call ourselves "civilized", but I feel we have a long way to go before we can ever scratch the surface of civilized.
