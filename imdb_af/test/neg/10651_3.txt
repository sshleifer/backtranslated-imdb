Never mind the serious logical gaps, no matter what the spectacular cliché character depictions, no matter what the haphazard writing, and you might like this movie. The main character Alyssa was supposed to love, the heroine you root to be saved (or in this case, save herself). Instead, she just stings and makes one wonder, are all pro ballerinas really stupid? Her sighted mother was, of course, only required to increase the illusion that ballet companies are evil monsters ready to let go of your poor, innocent, young girl, with an everlasting artistic director / villain. And the clichés! Not only does she become anorexia, panties, an exaggerated junkie, and a pathological liar, but all over the course of a few months. It's like the author reads every horror story he could dig on ballet and decided to see how much he could cover in two hours. (With Ads). Believe it or not, but I'm a dancer. . This "uprising" or "revival" of anorexia and bulemia that occurs is inconsistent with all the dance schools I attended. In fact, the teachers are so scared to even imagine that a girl might have a better chance of pounding a few pounds, most of the dancers in my classes would actually be considered overweight. I'm not saying eating disorders never occur, but not to the extent that it is portrayed in the movie. <br /> <br /> Another annoying problem this movie had was the middle-to-end writing style. Her boyfriend probably had half an entire screen time, all in the first half. The other supporting characters were merely props, decorations to advance the story. Given the right dialogue, it would be a very complicated mind study of a psychological problem. As it is, it becomes a one-week show, and Kimberly McCullough doesn't have the chutzpah to pull it off. <br /> <br /> For a non-dancer, this movie would be an insight into what really goes one behind closed doors at a ballet company. For a dancer it is a very insulting movie, which depicts ballerinas so stupid and parents as obtrusive and poorly informed. Those adjectives describe the people who have it in the air, correct. 10/03
