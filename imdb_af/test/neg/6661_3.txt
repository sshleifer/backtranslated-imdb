I watched "Gristle" mainly for the presence of Michael Dorn, because I enjoyed his Worf depiction on Star Trek TNG, but never saw him from his makeup. Dorn has a pretty presence and probably has the potential for a profitable acting career. However, this movie has given him a small dramatic challenge, except to prove that he can use the "F" word. <br /> <br /> It seems that this movie was made by someone who impressed himself as a forward-thinking type, with a social conscience. Yes --- for 1965. Today, the themes are so complicated and sophomoric and cornball that even Spike Lee's terrible "Bamboozled" looks good in comparison. <br /> <br /> This crime-caper flick has a complicated labyrinth of double, triple and quadruple crossings, but the plot scheme is so complicated that it falls upon him within the first 30 minutes. Mostly, after that point, I just looked out of momentum and a gentle curiosity about how each scene would play. There is a big roll here - you will recognize almost everyone as a character actor of much better movies. Why are they all in this? I suspect it was 1) The job, and a little money, even if it is modest. 2) Perhaps the director knows all of these actors of acting classes and social connections around LA --- you know, they may have participated in supporting him as a fellow-struggling film-maker on the third and fourth level of the Hollywood scene. Dunno ... but the movie was half baked --- not really "done." I gave it a 3, although my love for the actors involved is unworthy of my admiration for their previous work. Let's hope everyone has been looking for more professional, careful, and more thorough projects since.
