First, I hate those moronic rappers who can't act if they push a gun against their foreheads. All they do is swear and shoot each other and play like a click version of gang members. <br /> <br /> The movie takes no more than five minutes to explain what is going on before we reach the warehouse There is no single sympathetic character in this movie, except for the homeless man, who is also the only one one with half a brain. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton and William Sadler are both hilarious and the Sadlers character is as much a villain as the gangsters. I didn't know him from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with useless violence and Walter Hills specialty: people falling through the windows with flying glass everywhere. There is not much plot and it is a big problem when you do not root for anyone. Everyone dies except Paxton and the homeless man and gets everyone what they deserve. <br /> <br /> The only two black people who can act are the homeless man and the junkie, but they are actors by profession, not annoying. ugly brain dead rappers. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this shit and rather watch 48 hours 1 and 2. So that they don't have characters you care about, a sense of humor and nothing but real actors in the cast.
