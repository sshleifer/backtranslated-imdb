It is one of the most ridiculous westerns ever made by Hollywood. Gary Cooper plays 'Reb Hollister', a former law-demanding confederate official. He meets a moron called Weatherby, played by Leif Erickson, who is an American Marshal without any knowledge of firearms. Weatherby is on his way to Dallas to see his fiance, Tonia Robles, by Rut Roman. Senor Robles, Tonia's father, has many men, but they don't seem to be able to keep an eye on his cattle, which is often stirred by the Marlow brothers. Will Marlow, played by Raymond Massey, have financed the loan on the Robles estate and made things absolutely absurd. He even has the power to ask for mortgage payments before they are due simply because he likes it. <br /> <br /> Since Weatherby is a Boston boy who can't fight, as he just became a Marshal, he can visit his fiance, Tonia. (Just another example of more plot nonsense. Must we assume you only have to write a written test to get this job done? Wait a minute, this guy can't pass the written test either) he changes identities with Reb Hollister, who is of course an expert armed man. Reb takes the liberty to greet Weatherby's girlfriend with a passionate kiss, while Weatherby looks like an idiot. Gary Cooper, Hollywood's number one stud, is in good shape here as Reb. Before the movie is finished, he not only takes Weatherby's work, he also steals his fiancee, and Ruth Roman like Tonia falls so hard and so fast that she gives Leif Erickson on the brush before the movies more or less half left. <br /> <br /> There's not a lot of credibility in the whole movie, and despite the good cast and lush photography, the movie is a dud. And Cooper's character is a complete heel to start. The film also kills Barbara Payton as Brant Marlow's girl, a beautiful and talented actress who has wasted her chances, unfortunately making too many headlines for the wrong reasons. I advise you to pass this one.
