I have a hard time getting the words to explain how much I ignored this movie. The historic trial of Henriette Deluzy-Desportes and the Duc de Praslin is a tragic and compelling story that I believe has the potential to be a fantastic movie, but has failed. <br /> <br /> Although cinematography definitely has something to say for itself, it can in no way promote the terrible structure of the film, the badly written writing and most of all the terrible characters. The worst of them was the Duc's children who were so over-the-top corny and sickeningly fake that it was almost painful to watch. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie made me feel nothing more than irritable and deeply disappointed.
