Try not to see this one. I thought it would be good, because I'm a fan of the cheesy 80 movie and I've enjoyed Linnea Quigley's work. I was wrong. I had to say "no" and look at Gigli instead, which is probably a better movie. I think my biggest problem with this movie was his attempt at humor. Nothing about it was funny or even funny. The acting is bad, even for the queen's 80-year-old movie. There is no story, just random cuts. I don't think I should hate it that way, because it's just made as a fun and foolish piece, but I didn't have fun and I wasn't entertained once. I even had to get up to the end to get all the crap. I'm sorry, but I don't find zombies doing aerobics funny.
