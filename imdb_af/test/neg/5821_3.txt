I watched this movie at our crossroads film festival and look forward to filming it in the Mississippi and playing Karen Black.

How did lee and clerk become friends in five minutes? Which one of the two was the girl under the tree? It was unclear. And there seems to be a law in Hollywood about southern accent, and you rarely hear anything that touches the everyday sounds of the south. Despite the terrible, "it must be how they sound, just the" r "approach softened to dialogue, so many times the actors fall out altogether. Aleksa especially sounded like a New York street that was difficult during" emotional " scenes, and no-one had no missions at all, Walt Goggins's character was supposed to be from Morgan City, Louisiana, and sounded nothing like the city's blend of New Orleans and Cajun accents. was the urge of the writer to make us all feel that everybody urgently needs homosexuals in. Before I start a ghost and accuse homophobia, I have enjoyed many gay-themed movies, especially "punks" "When Love Comes" and "B-Monkey" But it seems someone's wish is for all young men, Well, Tennessee Williams has already covered this land and has done a much better job on it. the coen brothers can get local accent and culture in movies in Minnesota and in Mississippi, why can't anyone else? What a waste of my time.
